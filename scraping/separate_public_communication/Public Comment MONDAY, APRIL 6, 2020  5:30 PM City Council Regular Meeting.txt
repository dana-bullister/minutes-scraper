March	31,	2020	
Dear	Members	of	the	Cambridge	City	Council	and	Cambridge	Planning	Board:	
My	name	is	Victoria	Awkward,	and	I	am	the	Artistic	Director	of	VLA	DANCE,	a	dance	company	based	in	
Cambridge	and	Boston.	I	am	writing	to	share	the	ways	in	which	BioMed	Realty	has	supported	my	artistic	
work	and	to	urge	you	to	support	their	proposal	for	585	Third	Street	by	rezoning	the	land	to	allow	BioMed	
Realty	to	develop	a	much-needed	public	space	and	arts	facility.	
I	grew	up	in	Natick,	commuting	into	Cambridge	to	work,	take	dance	classes,	and	spend	time	with	friends.	
Since	graduating	college	and	beginning	my	professional	artistic	career,	I	have	gravitated	towards	
Cambridge	because	of	its	artistic	community	and	spaces,	including	the	Dance	Complex,	José	Mateo	Ballet	
Theatre,	Studio	@	550,	the	Multicultural	Center,	Green	Street	Studios,	and	BioMed	Realty.	However,	I	
have	also	witnessed	in	recent	years	the	closures,	full,	partial,	and	potential,	of	many	cultural	institutions.	
It	is	vital	that	Cambridge	continues	to	support	its	artistic	community.	Allowing	BioMed	Realty	to	develop	
on	585	Third	Street	would	increase	the	dwindling	space	for	artists,	especially	dancers,	to	work	in	the	city.	
VLA	DANCE	and	our	peers	in	the	dance	community	would	benefit,	and	thus	the	cultural	sector	of	
Cambridge	would	directly	benefit	as	well.		
I	especially	support	BioMed	Realty’s	proposal	to	develop	at	585	Third	Street	because	I	believe	it	will	be	a	
wonderful	and	important	addition	to	East	Cambridge,	a	neighborhood	which	I	called	home	last	year,	
living	on	Gore	Street.	Kendall	Square	is	developing	quickly,	and	as	biotech	companies	and	corporations	
take	foothold	there,	what	the	area	needs	desperately	is	space	for	culture	and	community.	BioMed	Realty’s	
plan	increases	green	space	and	will	provide	access	to	affordable,	diverse	and	inclusive	programming	that	
benefits	not	just	the	people	who	work	in	Kendall	Square,	but	the	residents	of	the	area	as	well.			
	BioMed	Realty	has	shown	that	they	are	committed	to	supporting	local	arts,	and	their	support	for	my	
company,	VLA	DANCE,	has	been	unparalleled.	Last	August,	BioMed	Realty	hosted	VLA	DANCE’s	show	
“Bare	Velvet”	at	their	campus	on	Third	Street,	providing	us	with	a	full	week	residency	and	monetary	
resources.	More	recently,	BioMed	Realty	supported	VLA	DANCE’s	GoFundMe	Campaign	with	a	matching	
donation	of	$5,000.	Their	support	has	directly	impacted	VLA	DANCE’s	ability	to	thrive	and	continue	to	
enrichen	the	cultural	scene	in	Cambridge.	
I	am	excited	for	this	project	because	I	have	seen	how	much	direct	community	input	has	gone	into	the	
plans.	I	believe	that	once	completed	the	space	will	be	enthusiastically	activated,	since	the	community	has	
been	involved	at	the	initial	stages.	
With	all	this	in	mind,	I	ask	that	you	support	BioMed	Realty	on	the	rezoning	of	585	Third	Street.	For	
further	communications,	I	am	available	at	victoria@victoriaawkward.com	or	508-315-9833.	Thank	you	
for	your	time	and	for	the	work	you	do	for	Cambridge.	
Respectfully,	
Victoria	Lynn	Awkward	
Artistic	Director	of	VLA	DANCE

Councillors and Clerk,
Please include this correspondence in the package of the next city council meeting.
Can you guide me to where the info is about the city contracts being offered to Cambridge 
businesses like mine for food preparation?
I have not received any email about the contracts, nor do I see anything posted on the license 
commission website, or in the city announcements that go out. My legal clients have also not received 
any such contract offers or information.
I have heard, however, that specific businesses that are members of the Harvard Square Business 
Association have received invitations to apply for these contracts.
Are these city contracts being offered in a fair and open process for all Cambridge businesses?
Thank you
Kim Courtney

Public comment for Council Meeting of Mar. 30, 2020
Public comment to Cambridge City Council on City Manager&s Agenda Item #2 and Policy Orders #2 and #3, 
March 30, 2020
In view of the activity at the War Memorial Recreation Center and Field House on Cambridge Center today its 
use as a temporary shelter for the homeless during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency seems to be well 
under way. In view of the urgent public need for temporary shelter, I expect that this interim use is something 
most neighbors in Mid-Cambridge will accept and support if it is done right. I urge the City to inform and 
promptly engage with abutters, the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association, and the Joan Lorentz Park 
Committee to ensure that legitimate concerns about the guests in the heart of the neighborhood are promptly 
and properly addressed for the good of all.
On P.O.R.s #2 and #3, it will be great if residents of all ages can make temporaryuse of some side streets and 
Memorial Drive for needed socially distant recreation during the Public Health Emergency. I&m sure the Mid-
Cambridge Neighborhood Association will be glad to work with the City to identify streets in our area where 
this could work.
Please remember, though, that Joan Lorentz Park is Mid-Cambridge&s main and only remaining park and 
residents will want to use it more even than in &normal& times in the weeks and months ahead. 
Thanks for your consideration,
John Pitkin,

City of Cambridge, Massachusetts 
Attention:  City Council and Planning Board 
RE: Support Letter for the Rezoning of 585 Third Street, Cambridge, MA, for Redevelopment by BioMed Realty 
Dear Cambridge Council and Planning Board, 
I am writing this letter today, in strong and enthusiastic support of BioMed Realty&s earnest and well-rooted application 
to rezone and redevelop the long-barren 585 Third Street, Cambridge, MA, lot, into a beautiful mixed-use commercial, 
recreational, and cultural building, with a 30,000 SF arts and culture center, and a 10,000 SF indoor all-season public 
space, at its center, and over an acre of public and green space.  I am writing as the President and Executive Artistic 
Director of the 17-year-old non-profit 501(c)(3) public charitable cultural organization, Brookline Community Center for 
the Arts, Inc., (BCCA) and as an individual artist, engineer, and developer, specializing in mixed-use redevelopment 
projects. 
Whenever a developer makes a proposal that requires rezoning, one of the criteria should be the determination of the 
earnesty and viability of their plans, so I&d like to offer our organization&s and my personal experience with BioMed 
Realty.  I fully attest to their first-rate and caring management, including but not limited to the visionary V.P. of 
Development Salvatore Zinno, and the hardworking, passionate, and skilled Community Manager Andrea Windhausen, 
with whom we&ve been extremely fortunate to develop a strong community partnership.  In January 2020, they awarded 
our non-profit a rent- and utilities-free licensing agreement to their 1,250 SF retail facility at 500 Kendall Street, 
Cambridge, (opposite the 585 Third Street lot), along with extensive publicity services and other logistical support, and 
recently a $5,000 cash sponsorship, to facilitate our establishment of the Cambridge Community Center for the Arts 
(CCCA - www.CCCAonline.org), in support of artists and organizations that had recently lost their space with the 
closure of Green Street Studios, and other local cultural establishments and support systems.  During challenging 
economic and social times, which have only become tougher with the recent COVID-19 crisis, BioMed has proven many 
times over, to be a trust-worthy partner, a loyal corporate sponsor, a true team player, a culturally inclusive and 
unbiased supporter of community arts programming of all types, and a first and effective responder, each time it counts. 
We feel extremely fortunate for BioMed&s support of our cultural programming, and a big reason for our ability to 
survive through the progressing pandemic, is due to their corporate sponsorship, the many direct community 
partnership referrals and connections that they have provided us with, and their regular collaborative engagement with 
our programming.  This has allowed us to keep focusing our resources on employing artists, and continually developing 
our technological infrastructure and reach, which has proven invaluable, as we were among the first organizations to 
launch our online/virtual arts programming, to help keep artists working, and for the Cambridge, Greater Boston, and 
global online community, to benefit from the dance, martial arts, fitness, and music classes we continue to offer.  
BioMed plans to extend our facility licensing agreement through the end of this summer, while increasing our access to 
be able to offer on site programming seven days a week, during all prime-time hours of operation, and hope to be able 
to keep extending our stay, which effectively makes them our first long-term corporate sponsor, and further 
demonstrates their commitment to our organization and the community! 
On Thursday, February 27th, a good number of community artists, arts colleagues, and myself, had the great pleasure of 
attending BioMed&s unveiling of their arts center plans for the Canal District Kendall building they had been working so 
diligently on, for the past two years.  The strong show of support by a wide range of Cambridge constituents, for 
BioMed&s visionary building design was well-deserved.  As a developer and re-development consultant who has helped

develop and realize several mixed-use cultural, industrial, commercial, and residential buildings, and has deeply 
analyzed large (400K to 1.1M SF) building projects with non-profit and cultural elements at their core, financed by the 
strong economics of the for-profit residential and commercial building components, I was particularly impressed and 
inspired by BioMed&s well-rooted, extremely well researched, socially- and community-minded, environmentally 
friendly, practical, and from my initial assessment, economically viable detailed building design!  From the get go, 
BioMed has engaged the community artists and arts administrators to realistically design the cultural facility portion of 
their building, in a way that would best serve the evolving needs of the community, including but not limited to their 
assessment that a 250- to 300-seat theatre and multi-use and scalable art studios, would be the best approach — From 
28 years as a professional artist, producer, and arts administrator, I can confidently say that they have hit the mark, and 
the fact that they are continuously getting council from active community leaders, and local artists and arts organization, 
in an earnest effort to develop a solid plan for the realization and management of their proposed cultural facility, speaks 
volumes of their high chances of success. 
I have found BioMed and its community and development representatives, to be highly transparent, forthright, and 
dependable, and willing to put their money where their mouth is, in support of arts, culture, and community.  My staff 
and I have strong confidence, and a consistently growing relationship track-record to prove BioMed&s intention, that our 
non-profit organization, and many other worthy community organizations and artists, will find a permanent home in 
BioMed&s proposed multi-use building, that the building will serve as the resounding and unifying center piece of the 
growing vision for Canal District Kendall, and that until the building is realized, BioMed will continue to actively support 
the arts community with action, shared real estate, and funding.  Our non-profit organization and I, wholeheartedly 
support BioMed&s application for the rezoning of 585 Third Street, and encourage your council to work hand-in-hand 
with them to carefully consider, and help further develop and support their well-thought-out multi-faceted building and 
environmental plan, and to do so expeditiously, in the best interest of allowing the project to proceed at the earliest 
date — the sooner the better for the benefit of the revitalization of the Cambridge cultural landscape!

Dear Councilors,   
We are requesting that the attached letter and revised plans be included in the public record for Monday’s discussion 
concerning the curb cut for 207 Lake View Ave.  
Based on some feedback from counselors we went ahead and made two significant changes to the plans, attached 
hereto: 
1) The plans now formally call out “permeable pavers” 
2)  The driveway as been narrowed from 13’ to 12’ 
Additionally, we just met with our neighbors to discuss some of their concerns and are amenable to working with them 
in a neighborly fashion.  
Thank you,

Dear Cambridge City Councilors,  
We are writing to ask for your support on a driveway curb cut on Lake View Ave. I am a life-long 
resident of Cambridge, born and raised on Lexington Ave and now raising two children, ages 3.5 
and 1.5, with a baby due in August.  
In October we purchased the home at 207 Lake View Avenue. We were drawn to the generous 
yard which would allow space for our kids to burn off energy and an area for my husband to 
garden. We expected it would be a home to raise our family and in the long-term space for my 
mother-in-law to move in with us (a widowed, cancer survivor living alone on the North Shore).  
In February we drafted plans and obtained signed support from all of our neighbors, and met 
personally with our next-door neighbor who would be most affected by the driveway. They 
asked for a few changes to the plans, which we readily accepted.  
We’ve decided to take some additional measures to clarify our plans. We are an 
environmentally conscious family and would like to preserve as much open space as possible. 
The initial plans show a 13’ wide driveway which we have amended to 12’. In addition, the 
driveway would be made out of permeable pavers which is stated on the plans.  
When we purchased the home, we knew there was no driveway. Normally we are able to park 
within 5 houses of ours. However, as a 21-week, pregnant mother juggling two toddlers it’s 
really become a matter of safety to request a driveway. As you can imagine, corralling children 
while loading bags and kids into the car can be a challenge. Additionally, raising a family has 
taken its toll on me physically, especially my back, which is prone to falling out of alignment and 
rendering me bed ridden. Running after children who run into the street or could encounter a 
car backing out of the driveway is a scary situation with limited physical abilities.  
My mother-in-law has been coming to our home 2 days a week from Georgetown, MA to watch 
the children. This is an hour and a half commute during rush hour. She is not accustomed to city 
roads and when she can’t find parking in front of the house, she circles the block which is 
confusing and stressful for her. We would like to have parking to accommodate her needs and 
well as my own.  
Sean O’Grady and Ranjit of the Cambridge zoning department have signed off that this 
driveway meets Cambridge building code and zoning ordinances, from section 6.40, we are 
more than 25’ away from a street intersection, and are more than 15’ away from any crosswalk.   
We appreciate your help and consideration at this time.  
Sincerely,  
Maggie Currier & Samuel Kachmar.
