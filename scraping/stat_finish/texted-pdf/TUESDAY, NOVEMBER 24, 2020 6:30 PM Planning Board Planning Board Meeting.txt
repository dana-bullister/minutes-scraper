          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good evening, and 

welcome to the November 24, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board.  My name is Catherine Preston Connolly and I 

am Chair.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

October 26, 2020.

          CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER:  The first item on the 

agenda is an Update from the Community Development 

Department.  Please also introduce any staff present at the

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Iram 

Farooq, Assistant City Manager, Community Development.  Jeff 

Roberts, who has been introducing the meeting is of course 

here, along with his team from Zoning and Development.  And 

that includes Daniel Messplay, Swaathi Joseph, and I think 

that is it.  [Actually just Swaathi Joseph today.]    

          Just in terms of our agenda for today, we have --

first I should say thank you very much to everybody for 

joining us on Thanksgiving week.  Tonight's agenda hopefully 

is short.  The principal public hearing on tonight's meeting 

is zoning related to cannabis delivery businesses. 

          Our next meeting will be December 1, and the Board 

has two hearings on your agenda, the first -- well, 

actually, it's on zoning changes related to retail uses, and 

zoning changes pertaining to home occupations.   

          These have both emerged through many months -- 

actually, I should say many years -- of work at Community 

Development and at City Council to our Economic Development 

and Zoning and Development team, as well as the Economic 

Development and University Relations Committee of the City 

Council. 

          We expect also at that meeting to have 

presentation from 2072 Mass Ave, which is a residential 100 

percent affordable project.  The work on that had begun 

prior to the Affordable Housing Overlay being adopted, so it 

is a comprehensive permit request that will be granted by 

the BZA, but the Board has advisory review as always.  So 

that should be before you on December 1. 

          December 8, you'll have a hearing on 600 Mass Ave,

and also another zoning petition coming back to you will be 

the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest Overlay Zoning Petition.  

The Board has heard this before, but it has had to be 

refiled, and so, there will be another hearing on that. 

          December 15, the Board will have a hearing on 727 

Mass Ave, and then 2 James Way, which is an amendment to an 

existing special permit. 

          And December 22, sorry we are bringing you in for 

-- on holiday week, so Christmas week we will have public 

hearings on -- continued public hearings on Cambridgeside 

PUD special permit.   

          And hopefully, we can have December 29 be 

canceled, but that is a tentative date that we are holding. 

          So in terms of other items of interest, the 

ordinance hearings on some of the petitions that the Board 

is considering:  December 9, the Ordinance Committee will 

hear the Cannabis Delivery Zoning that you're hearing today. 

          On December 16, they will be hearing the Alewife 

Quadrangle Northwest Overlay Petition, and then on December 

17 the Ordinance Committee will hear the retail use and home 

occupation zoning changes. 

          A couple other items are that as -- well, at -- we

had a very long Council meeting last night, but there were a 

couple of items of interest.   

          So the Green Energy Review Zoning Petition that 

the Board had made a positive recommendation on and had 

suggested certain changes was adopted last night with the 

changes that the Board had recommended, and that staff 

worked with the petitioners on. 

          There was another item of interest, which is that 

the Council adopted the Mullen Rule, which is something that 

the Board has asked about over the years, and finally it has 

been adopted for Cambridge.   

          So what that means is that if the Board is 

considering a special permit case or any case, and a Board 

member has to miss one meeting during the course of that 

deliberation, they will be able to catch up by viewing the 

video and/or reading the transcript.   

          And our hope is that that will help with any 

quorum issues, which -- you know, the Planning Board doesn't 

encounter those all that often, but we have a few, and I 

know that they have been challenging and disruptive at those 

times.  So we are hoping that that will get solved with 

this.

          The Council's Neighborhood Long Term Planning 

Committee just earlier today had a hearing on Harvard 

Square, particularly focused on pedestrianizing or thinking 

about a future plan for pedestrianizing parts of the Square, 

and really making it more of a -- the kind of place that you 

might see in an older European city, so something that both 

incorporates safety considerations but livability 

considerations and at the same time is supportive of the 

small businesses in the Square. 

          So we will be doing work along with other 

departments, other city departments and the Harvard Square 

Business and Neighborhood Community to come up with a plan 

for a pilot over the course of the winter to deploy a pilot 

in the spring.  Particularly the Council was focused also 

during COVID to create opportunities for people to be 

outdoors in a safe manner.   

          And I will say one last thing that's only 

tangentially connected to the Board, but there has been -- 

with the recent COVID spike there has been a lot of 

discussion at City Council and as part of the administration 

as well in terms of what changes the city needs to 

incorporate to continue to have people be safe and to try to 

11

manage the surge.   

          The Council has asked the City Manager to speak to 

our regional partners in other neighboring cities to try to 

come up with a plan to address the surge, particularly as it 

relates to indoor activities where people gather.  So that's 

something that will likely be something that the city will 

be looking into over the next coming weeks. 

          But in a related manner, the city has reduced as 

of December 1 and going through to January 8 -- this is just 

as of today -- the city has announced a reduction in the 

number of staff who will be asked to be asked to be in 

person in city buildings, or allowed to be present in city 

buildings in person, and also reducing the number of days 

when we will be in city buildings, so that there's more time 

for sanitizing the spaces for occupation. 

          So just wanted to note all of those things.  And 

that's it, Madam Chair, for my updates.  Thank you very 

much.                

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All 

right.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Then 

we'll move on to our next item on the agenda, which is a 

public hearing on a zoning petition by the City Council to 

amend Articles 2.000, 4.000 and 11.000 of the zoning 

ordinance to create a new land use definition and 

association regulations for, "Cannabis Delivery-Only 

retailers." 

before us.   

          CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Catherine.  This is Jeff 

Roberts in the CDD.  I'll have Daniel do this one, since he 

did a lot of the work on this, but he's -- thankfully for 

him -- on vacation this week. 

          So this is the first hearing for the Planning 

Board on this zoning petition.  As explained in the memo 

that CDD staff provided, the city adopted zoning for 

cannabis uses back in 2018, but at that time did not 

contemplate home delivery, which wasn't permitted at the 

state level, until the Cannabis Control Commission began 

issuing licenses in 2019.

          Potential regulatory changes to the deliberate 

licensing is currently under review at the state level, and 

I think that's what will take us into the discussion 

tonight.   

          We do have two of the key proponents of this 

petition on the Council with us tonight, who will be giving 

a before presentation, and the Planning Board's action with 

zoning petitions is to make a recommendation to the City 

Council. 

          That's it for me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Jeff.  As 

Jeff noted, we have two guests from City Council here 

tonight to present on this petition -- City Councillor Mark 

McGovern and City Councillor Patti Nolan.  Councillor 

McGovern, do you want to kick things off for us? 

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  Sure.  Thank you, and thank 

you all for being here too on a holiday week.  So this will 

be pretty brief.  As Jeff stated, the Council passed a 

cannabis ordinance and when we did that, the state was not 

offering licenses for delivery.   

          The state has since allowed or would be allowing 

licensed delivery licenses, and so, we are looking to update 

16

our ordinance to reflect that. 

          As Jeff mentioned, there are some definition 

changes that the state is looking at, and from what I'm 

being told, there should be some information coming down 

from the state in the next week or so.   

          What they're willing to do is to take the 

Delivery-Only license and break that into two different 

licenses -- a delivery operator license and a marijuana 

courier license.   

          The courier license will be something similar to 

sort of an Uber Eats type of service, allowing those 

delivery companies to own cars, pick up retail orders from 

brick and mortar dispensaries and then deliver those 

individual orders to customers. 

          The second model, the delivery operator license, 

would allow delivery companies to purchase prodFucts at 

wholesale from cultivators and manufacturers, store that 

product in a secure vault and then deliver it directly to 

          So those changes were not known to us when we 

filed this, you know, several months ago.  So we're going to 

consumers. 

have to fix that.

22

          But essentially, you know, the purpose is to keep 

us in line with the state.  Oh, and it should also be noted 

that both of these licenses will be available only to equity 

applicants at the state level for at least the first three 

years.  And that was something that, you know, when the 

Council was looking at the zoning, I mean we talked a lot 

about how do we support and help equity applicants get into 

this business.   

          And actually one of the things I think is good 

about the delivery licenses is getting into the brick and 

mortar cannabis industry is incredibly expensive, where -- 

you know, I think this is a lower entry point for some 

people to get started in the business.   

          And then obviously with the equity applicants and 

looking at folks who have been given a head start to folks 

who come from communities that have been adversely affected 

by the War on Drugs is also a benefit and something that's 

very much in line with the values that the Council has. 

          So that's kind of why we're doing this.  It's to 

just keep us in line with the state and create this 

opportunity.  And I don't know if Councillor Nolan wants to 

add anything?

           COUNCILLOR:  Nolan Thank you, Councillor 

McGovern.  Yes, Councillor McGovern and myself and also 

Mayor Siddiqui and Councillor Zondervan had filed this, 

which passed the Council on October 5. 

          The principle is pretty simple, as Councillor 

McGovern explained, is that the idea is to allow delivery in 

Cambridge right now.   

          I don't know if you all know this, but I did test 

it out and confirmed it with my young, legally- aged 

children:  I can order delivery of cannabis from other 

cities and have it delivered to my home in Cambridge, and 

yet I cannot do that for someone -- a Cambridge-based 

business -- just because we haven't allowed it in our own 

zoning.  And that's what we wanted to fix by filing this 

policy order. 

          As Councillor McGovern also noted, it's a little 

bit complicated, but doesn't have to be too complicated by 

the fact that it was on September 28 that the state Cannabis 

Control Commission first promulgated some draft regulations 

that were new about the delivery orders, because they 

started accepting applications in May of this year. 

          And then I think on October 27 you'll probably 

hear about this more from CDD, they were -- the draft 

regulations were approved, but I think they're still in 

19

          So my request and plea is that -- you know, review 

this, decide if it's right for Cambridge.  We do think it 

process.   

is.   

          We think particularly it will help that only 

certified Economic Empowerment and social equity players are 

going to be allowed to have these licenses, and it's a 

period of three years, which we had thought it might only be 

two years, because this City Council prior to me joining it 

had made a very clear statement that we wanted licenses 

available for a couple years to be limited to communities 

impacted by the War on Drugs. 

          This is something if it passes, we want it to 

happen as soon as we can.  So whatever language the state 

comes up with, if you can move it forward, the sooner we can 

get this in place, the sooner that applicants can then 

apply.   

          Two or three years will go by very quickly.  It's 

an incredibly difficult business to get into.  The 

regulations for good reason are really, really intense in

terms of the financial limits, in terms of the safety 

concerns.   

          So I just really hope you're able to give us 

advice, but also move it forward, and knowing that there may 

be some changes as the state change its definition hopefully 

will not hold us up so that we can be in a position to as 

soon as possible you know, hit the green button and allow 

applicants to get in line.  And then we'll all be able to 

order from in Cambridge from Cambridge entrepreneurs for our 

benefit.  Thanks so much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  This -- as I noted, this is a public hearing.  So 

we're going to move now to public comment.  Any members of 

the public who wish to speak should now click the button 

that says, "Raise hand."  Or if you're calling in by phone, 

you can raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had not 

received no written comments from the public on this matter, 

but any written communications received after that time will 

of course be entered into the record.   

          I'll now ask Staff to unmute the speakers one at a 

time.  You should begin by saying your name and address, and

staff will confirm that we can hear you.  After that time, 

after that you will have up to three minutes to speak before 

I ask you to wrap up.  Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Catherine.  I see a 

couple hands raised.  So I'll just -- I'm going to call the 

names as they appear on the Zoom, and I'm sorry if I 

mispronounce your name, but you should give your own name 

and address, and then you can continue. 

          So the first speaker is Grant Ellis.  You can 

unmute yourself and start with your name and address.   

          GRANT ELLIS:  Yes, Grant Ellis. 9 Center Street, 

Cambridge, Massachusetts.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, we can hear you.     

          GRANT ELLIS:  Thank you, and Thank you, Madam 

Chair for the time this evening.  My name is Grant Ellis.  

I'm a disabled medical cannabis patient who lives in 

Cambridge.   

          I'm rising before you today because I wanted to 

make it a point of emphasis to say that I think it's crucial 

that this change to the ordinance to facilitate the delivery 

regulations as are being proposed by the state Cannabis 

Control Commission is crucial.

          And I think that moving this process along and 

allowing it to get to the Ordinance Committee and then be 

adapted as the definitional changes occur at the Cannabis 

Control Commission is crucial. 

          I think Councillor McGovern and Councillor Nolan 

were on point without questions as to the nature of the 

changes.  

          For just some insight for the Planning Board, on 

November 30 at 10 a.m. the Cannabis Control Commission will 

approve its final regulations.  Those regulations do change 

the Delivery-Only license to a both a delivery operator 

license and then the cannabis -- the marijuana courier 

license. 

otherwise. 

          Both of those license types are designed, as 

Councillor Nolan mentioned, with a litany of security 

requirements as well as caps to prevent monopolization or 

          The security requirements are very impressive.  

They were led by Commissioner Britte McBride, who's the 

Public Safety Chair.  They include all of the operational 

requirements for any other marijuana establishment, and then 

add on top of it two employees in the delivery vehicles for 

23

both types of licenses at all times, body-worn cameras for 

all employees, a third employee at the headquarters 

monitoring the delivery applicants, and as well the vehicles 

that the companies employ are nondescript and contain 

security requirements themselves that protect the product 

and the drivers. 

          I also recognize the timer started a little late, 

so I will try not to take the full three minutes, but I will 

just say one other thing, which is that the equity component 

of this I think is really the most crucial part.   

          To be clear, the three-year equity priority period 

for these delivery licenses is actually on the state level.  

So it's separate from the ordinance.  But the fact that both 

the delivery operator license and the marijuana courier 

license are only available to equity applicants is really 

quite crucial.   

          And I think anything the city can do to engender 

equity in its licensing process is wonderful.  The ordinance 

is strong on equity already, and I think moving forward by 

adapting the ordinance to facilitate these types of delivery 

licenses is crucial. 

          And also, on a final point, as Commissioner Nolan

mentioned, per 935.500.145 Section L subsection 1-3, 

cannabis delivers can already occur in Cambridge because 

retail sales are allowed.   

          So allowing Cambridge to license couriers and 

delivery operators would bring more excise revenue.  That 

excise revenue can then go to fund social equity programs, 

and even a social equity loan fund to get more companies 

open in Cambridge from communities that were harmed by the 

drug war. 

yield the floor.   

          Thank you for the indulgence, Madam Chair, and I 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  And thanks for being 

mindful of the time.  The next speaker is Chandra Batrach.  

You can unmute yourself and I apologize if I mispronounce 

your name.   

          CHANRA BATRACH:  Good evening.  Can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.     

          CHANDRA BATRACH:  Hi.  This is Chandra Batrach.  I 

live at 52 Trowbridge in Cambridge.  And as someone who's 

both a cannabis activist as well as a patient, I am really 

happy about where we stand right now with the delivery 

program.  I was at -- I am looking forward to what's being

put forth. 

          The one thing that I would like to emphasize that 

I would like Cambridge to focus on is making sure that this 

process remains an equitable process by any means necessary, 

and that Economic Empowerment candidates and operatives get 

to go first.   

          It's going to be a hard enough, competitive world.  

And because of the lack of generational wealth as well as 

black wealth, black operators are starting at a different 

point than the white people who open dispensaries in the 

city start it from.   

          They're starting from the position of having all 

of their money in, of having all of their friends' money 

into these deliveries, and to having all that they own -- 

basically almost to the point to the clothes on their back 

invested in getting this process up and running.        

I think it's going to be very vital that the city do 

whatever it can possibly to ensure that the three-year 

equity period is upheld, and that all black operators and 

that all people of color and especially black people of 

color who have waited so long for social justice actually 

get the social and economic justice they deserve.

          One important thing I think that is going to come 

down the line November 30 is a clarification of what your 

roles will be as a city.  And I think that's going to be the 

big turning point.   

          So this was made to help historically 

disadvantaged people of color who have borne the brunt of 

the drug war, and who've actually borne the scars of this 

war in ways that people don't truly know and can't even 

begin to fathom, so thank you for your time.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is Mo 

Barboza.  You can unmute yourself and begin with your name 

and address.   

          MO BARBOZA:  Sure.  Mo Barboza.  I live at 1670 

Sutter Street in Newtown, so I'm an expatriate 

Cantabridgian.  And I just rise in support of the words of 

our good Councillor, Mark McGovern, and really emphasizing 

the need for supporting this as it falls in line with what 

the state is doing, and it can open up opportunity for 

equity candidates. 

          And also, as our good Councillor Ms. Nolan stated, 

that it's already possible to receive deliveries of cannabis 

in Cambridge, and folks are already doing that.

          And so, not doing this puts Cambridge-based 

entrepreneurs, and especially because of the ordinance -- of 

the way this is structured, folks of color at a disadvantage 

to what folks are doing in other cities already. 

          So if you could move quickly to change the 

language and change -- make the changes that are necessary 

going forward in the other spaces as are needed to make this 

opportunity available to the Cambridge space equity 

cannabis.   

          And I look forward to your support for this, and 

the succeeding opportunities to support this industry and 

Cambridge-based people in being part of this new industry. 

          Thank you so much.  Have a great Thanksgiving, you 

all.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  And the next speaker is 

David Rabinowitz.  Can you unmute and begin?    

          DAVID RABINOWITZ:  Yes, thank you.  David 

Rabinowitz, and I live in Norfolk, Massachusetts.  I work 

with a number of social equity and Economic Empowerment 

applicants that are interested in getting into the home 

delivery business.   

          I applaud Cambridge for their awareness of the

struggles of the social equity group in trying to get 

licensed and the difficulties they've gone through. 

          A couple of comments with respect, as you're 

considering some of the zoning issues.  Unlike a retail 

store, a home delivery operator that is going to have 

marijuana products in their facility does not have the 

ability to repackage.  Hence, they're taking products that 

are prepackaged, filling orders and delivering them.   

          There is -- when you have processing which can't 

be allowed without a processing license, you have the risk 

of some sort of odor issues.  You don't have that here.   

          And I would urge you, because there are no walk-in 

customers -- a retail store can't allow a customer to say, 

"Hey, I'm only a half a mile away, and I'm not going to be 

home when the order's dropped off, can I just pick it up 

there?"  

          That's now allowed; hence I would urge you to 

consider as wide a berth as you can for the zoning as 

possible.  These are very, very discreet businesses when 

they're placed. 

          Again, there's no walk-in business.  There's no 

odor issues, and many times the zoning tends to be tight --

so tight, that there is immense competition for the 

locations which drives up the cost for the operators, and 

many times puts the landlords in the position of being able 

to demand that rents start to be paid immediately, with no 

grace period to get local permitting and that sort of thing 

lined up.   

          So the wider the zoning to place this type of 

business, the more options the prospective operators will 

have, and most likely the better deals they're going to be 

able to cut with landlords, because many of these folks are 

capital constrained, and the biggest capital draw for a 

social equity or an Economic Empowerment applicant is 

getting past the landlords to get through the host community 

process, as well as to get to the provisional license.   

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  And that is the last 

speaker with a hand raised.  So I'll just give another -- 

actually there's one more hand raised, but I'll go ahead and 

give a final call at this point.  So if anybody hasn't 

spoken yet and would like to speak and hasn't pushed the, 

"Raise Hand" button please do so now. 

          The next speaker is listed just as "Marcus J."

Can you please unmute and give your name and address?   

          MARCUS JOHNSON:  Hi, good evening, Board.  My name 

is -- Committee rather -- my name is Marcus Johnson Smith.  

I am at Foster Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Also I'm 

the founder of KG Collective and I hold a retail special 

permit for cannabis in West Cambridge. 

          So I wanted to thank you all first for taking up 

this issue.  It's definitely of concern for me, and 

something I've -- you know, been participating in and 

involved in for the last couple years now.  My specific 

comment is really around the zoning.   

          I think the gentleman before me really spoke in 

the eloquence it needed.  That spoke to the issue about 

expanding the zoning.  As he said, you know, these are 

really discrete businesses once they're operational.   

          So I think, you know, it's important that we 

create zoning spaces and zoning areas, or widen the zoning 

spaces and zoning areas within other business districts, so 

that Economic Empowerment applicants like myself can 

actually go tie down real estate at an affordable rate and 

move through the city process.   

          You know, that's the only kind of concern or

comment I had, but thank you all for your attention on this 

issue.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  I believe that is all 

the hands that were raised.  Just one more second, in case 

anybody still needs to raise their hand.  I think that ends 

the list.  I'll turn it back over to Catherine.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you, Jeff.  We will now move from public comment to Board 

discussion.  If the hearing is continued to a future date, 

and additional information is received, there will be 

opportunity for public comment on any additional materials.  

Additional written comments may be submitted as well. 

          So we received a memo from the Community 

Development Department Staff who are available for 

questions.  And obviously, we have the representatives from 

the petitioners here -- Councillor McGovern and Councillor 

Nolan.   

          Do Board members have any questions staff or the 

petitioners?  You can go ahead and either use your, "Raise 

Hand" button or just start by giving your name with your 

question.

I do have a couple questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So I think this question is for 

Staff.  Just it was mentioned in the staff report that there 

might be a desire to propose revised zoning amendments to 

mirror what types of delivery will be licensed by the state.  

When will we have that language, and is there a reason to 

write our own language before we have their language?    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's an excellent question, and one 

that we sort of -- we pose a little bit in a kind of open-

ended way in our report.   

          And I think it's come up a couple times in 

discussion so far that with this potential kind of 

bifurcation of having two different types of delivery 

business, it may require a little bit of rethinking as to 

how we situate each of those into our zoning ordinance. 

          The way it's currently proposed, it may become 

sort of ambiguous if the state regulations offer two 

different types of delivery business, we have zoning that 

only kind of contemplates one type of business; it may end 

up getting complicated. 

          I think that some of the speakers have indicated

that in the next couple weeks maybe, the Cannabis Control 

Commission might be taking action on their regulations.  I 

know that it's -- I haven't been following the process to 

the minute myself, but I know that it's gone through a few 

cycles of having draft regulations submitted and getting 

feedback and sort of looking at a few issues again.   

          So I can't guarantee when it's going to be 

resolved, but it certainly might be resolved just in the 

immediate future.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  My next question is 

about timing and when the timeline starts.  So I've heard us 

talk about two years of the Cannabis -- the CCC only 

allowing Economic Empowerment and social equity program 

participants.  But that clock started ticking.   

          And so, when we talk about these three years, does 

the clock start when our zoning goes into effect?  Does it 

start when the state goes into effect?  When would our clock 

start?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So to try to answer that question, 

I think as far as the zoning is concerned, it doesn't have a 

-- the zoning doesn't have a particular sort of clock on it.  

The zoning usually is intended to just take effect and 

34

remain in effect. 

          The provisions that are being looked at locally 

regarding preferences or priorities for different kinds of 

businesses would be in the city's Cannabis Business 

Permitting Ordinance, which is separate from zoning.  And I 

think there's amendments that are also going to be under 

consideration by the Council to deal with that. 

          So the City Council could make some decisions 

around the Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance of what 

kind of timeframes they want to set for Cambridge. 

          And at the state level -- again, it's -- it would 

have to, you know, it would be subject to whatever the final 

decision is that's made regarding the state's regulations.   

          I know that the current regulations that apply to 

delivery businesses, which are somewhat more limited in 

scope, are also intended to provide a kind of a window of 

time for Economic Empowerment applicants. 

          And I honestly don't know if that time period is 

intended to continue to run from the time the regulations 

were first adopted, or if a new period of time is going to 

be established with a new set of regulations.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And then I know

we'll get to discussion in a minute, but on questions for 

staff, I'm looking at the actual zoning language, and on the 

section that talks about buffer zones.   

          I wanted to know if under section A when it says 

that, "facilities shall not be permitted within 300 feet 

above preexisting public or private school," does that mimic 

the language that we already have for cannabis, or are we 

adding in, "private school"?   

          I am sensitive to unintended consequences, and I'm 

sensitive to the neighborhood associations always trying to 

fight every cannabis business that comes in.   

          So I want to make sure if the intention is to 

expand the possibility of businesses; that we're not 

unintentionally limiting them, and I definitely depend on my 

colleagues, especially those who have practiced or are 

practicing law to flag any language for us, if it's going to 

impact my or our intention for equity and being as open and 

flexible as possible.   

          But I'm wondering if that word, "private school" 

is new compared to -- it's not, okay, awesome.  And then 

when we say, "public" so in that same section in buffer 

zones B, when we talk about a public children's playground,

public youth athletic field, does that mean city owned, or 

are we saying public -- there was recently people trying to 

argue against cannabis in Harvard Square because it was near 

a, --quote, unquote-- "public park" that is no city owned.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So a public -- "public" would mean, 

well it has a particular use definition in the zoning 

ordinance, but it's owned or controlled by a -- either by 

the city or by another government agency.  So it could be a 

state park or some other type of park.   

          But the language is written fairly deliberately to 

include playgrounds, athletic fields and youth recreation 

facilities, so not necessarily including an urban plaza or 

some -- or another type of open space.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And then my last 

question about the zoning language, at the very end suggests 

that we delete section 11.806 regarding effective date.  I 

just wonder why we would do that, and if that has any kind 

of impact one way or another?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So that section 11.806 was adopted 

because when the zoning was first adopted in December of 

2018, there was a desire by the City Council to not have it 

take effect until they adopted the Cannabis Business

Permitting Ordinance, and that ultimately was adopted.   

          So I think that that language really doesn't 

really have any effect anymore.  So I think that it was 

suggested that that be deleted just, you know, because it's 

extraneous at this point.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted, you 

virtually raised your hand next.  You want to pose your 

questions?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  I only have one question.  

Was there a rationale for limiting the Delivery-Only 

locations to the industry B1 and B2?  I understand that's 

where production facilities are limited, but retail stores 

are limited in many other zoning districts in the city. 

          And in light of the public comment we received 

about the need to be able to negotiate successfully with 

potential landlords and the fact that these facilities will 

not have public going to them, or will not be generating 

owners, was there a real rationale for limiting them to 

those particular districts?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Right.  That's sort of the $64,000 

question.  I think that does go back to the -- sort of the

root issue of trying to understand what kinds of uses these 

are.   

          I think -- I can just give just sort of the 

general principal behind the way that we've handled zoning 

for cannabis uses in the past, and maybe the -- sort of the 

Councillors can sort of weigh in on intent as well. 

          Most of our cannabis zoning is intended to mirror 

in terms of locations where uses are allowed the zoning 

regulations for similar types of uses that are non cannabis 

related.   

          So cannabis retailers are allowed in districts 

that allow retail stores. And cannabis -- you know, 

production facilities or manufacturing facilities are 

allowed in the same districts that allow other types of 

manufacturing facilities. 

          So the issue here -- again, this is -- these types 

of businesses in terms of their land use impact are a little 

bit sort of unique.   

          But, you know, if it's the type of business that's 

being described in some context as being sort of more like a 

warehouse or logistics distribution center, those kinds of 

uses are allowed currently in Cambridge in our industrial 

39

district.  So they're more limited.   

          You are not necessarily allowed to have sort of 

warehouses or -- you know, putting aside cannabis you're not 

really allowed to have warehouses or distribution centers 

in, like, retail places like Harvard Square or Central 

Square.   

          There might be issues with regard to traffic and 

transportation if there's a lot of -- if it's facility with 

a lot of trips going to and from there.  So those tend to be 

limited to certain areas of the city. 

          If it's a -- sort of more of a courier type of 

business where it really isn't warehousing any kind of 

products on site, but it really is just a kind of a company 

that, you know, has a fleet of vehicles that sort of move 

around and, you know, move -- you know, products from 

retailers to people's homes, that might be something that's 

looked at a little bit differently. 

          Although the question then is, if the main land 

use is a parking lot where you're parking a fleet of 

vehicles, you know, where would we want that kind of use to 

be located in the city, or where would we want that to be 

zoned?

          So I think the way that petition is currently 

written is sort of aligned with the way we zone other kinds 

of warehousing and logistics to look like parcel deliver 

kinds of businesses.  But, you know, we can look at 

different kinds of businesses in different ways.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, does that answer 

your question?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, great.  Lou, 

you had your hand up next.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I guess a couple 

questions.  So is there a state license that will be issued 

for this on top of a local license?  And how does that work?  

How does the city regulate a state license?  If it's just 

driving -- I can understand the courier situation is pretty 

straightforward.  I'm not so sure on the operator license.   

          My curiosity on the operator license is how this 

operation works.  Do they pick up product in the morning or 

from a supplier and keep on making roots through the city to 

fulfill orders?   

          It sounds like an ice cream truck or so forth.  I 

don't know how that works.  Does it increase the traffic?

22

Because, I mean, I think we need to move forward on some of 

this, but it's unclear how this operates.   

          And by the way, it does say they can repackage.  

So I mean, I wonder if anyone would actually park their 

vehicles in Cambridge just because of this, just for the 

real estate value problems.   

          It's curious.  I'm curious.  I wish there was 

somebody here that was proposing to run one of these 

businesses to find out how it actually works.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I can try to respond to that 

just to say in the last part, I'm inclined to agree and, you 

know, if we knew more about the kinds of businesses that 

we're planning to operate, we might be able to answer these 

questions a little bit more directly.   

          But the -- to answer your question about 

licensing: So cannabis businesses require a license from the 

state.  They don't go through a local licensing process the 

way liquor licenses do.  They're all -- all that licensing 

is controlled by the state.  And the licensing is for the 

business.   

          So like any license, it's a license to do 

business; it's not the same as a zoning permit or a land use 

42

kind of -- or a special permit, which is really about siting 

a particular land use at a specific location in the city. 

          It doesn't -- the zoning doesn't really regulate 

the operation of vehicles on the street.  It's just like, 

you know, UPS.  You know, if UPS has a parcel delivery 

center somewhere in the city, that delivery center would 

have to be zoned to allow that use.  But the trucks moving 

around the city and delivering packages to people's homes, 

that activity is not regulated by zoning. 

          So that would be subject to state licensing.  And 

the city also has its -- although the city doesn't have a 

licensing process, they have a business permit, which is 

intended to give priority to the Economic Empowerment and 

other categories of business. 

          So there's that, and then there's also the other 

piece of the regulatory process is the host community 

agreement, which is something that the state Cannabis 

Control Commission requires there be an agreement between a 

host community and a licensee.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Everything you just said, 

would that only affect someone who's basically parking a 

vehicle in Cambridge, or using it as a warehouse site?  But

22

I kind of doubt that's going to happen.  But, so it's only 

the use -- basically parking use that we're talking about 

here, the vehicles?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Right.  It's the land use, and it 

could be -- you know, it could involve, you know, storage or 

moving of cannabis products.  It could include parking of 

vehicles, storage of vehicles, it could include just kind of 

office type -- you know, accessory office type operations 

that are part of the business.  So all of that could be 

incorporated into this business.   

          And again, you know, we don't -- the most I know 

about what these kinds of businesses might look like is that 

there's kind of a wide range of different possible models 

that might be employed.   

          Like was mentioned at the beginning, it could be 

sort of an Uber Eats type model where it's lots of small 

operators doing -- you know, small deliveries, or it could 

be a larger business with a larger sort of fleet of 

vehicles, and it's sort of hard to -- a little bit hard to 

suss out at this point.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So I guess my last question 

would be, so if it were a fairly -- a delivery operator, and 

44

they had a fairly large fleet, would they need to -- would 

they necessarily need a license to operate their delivery 

service in Cambridge?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  They -- well, they would need the 

license from -- again, the license would all come from the 

state level.  I don't believe -- and we did sort of ask, and 

to our understanding, there isn't a -- there isn't a local, 

there would be a -- you know, local land use controls in 

terms of zoning would need to apply.  There may be a need to 

get a business permit if the business is located in 

Cambridge. 

          But it -- I don't believe there is a permit 

required to drive a vehicle on a city street, basically.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, that's what I just 

wanted to clarify.  I didn't know how that was going to 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Don't quote me on that, 

because it's a little bit outside of my area, but that was  

work.   

--  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  No, I, I --    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  -- that was the answer that I 

sort of received while we talked about that.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Now I gotcha, yeah.  Okay.  

Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Councillor McGovern, 

did you have something you wanted to add?         

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  Yeah, thank you.  So just 

also to note that from my conversations with folks, sort of 

the way this will work is someone will place an order either 

over the phone or online, the driver will then pick up that 

order, and then deliver that order.   

          No one's going to be -- just so folks now, it's 

not like there are going to be large, you know, minivans 

driving around with a bunch of cannabis in it and they're 

going to be delivering that.  It's going to be very 

specific.   

          And I think the point that Councillor Nolan made 

earlier just around the licensing piece, you know, right now 

there are some cities that allow delivery.  And so, as she 

said, you know, you can call -- you know, you can get 

cannabis delivered to Cambridge from another city.   

          And so, you know, what this is doing, we have some 

folks that would like to -- you know, and some of them are 

local folks -- who would like to, you know, enter this

industry and have their business located here. 

          I did ask about sort of what are we talking about 

in terms of facilities.  And sort of what I've heard back is 

somewhere around, you know, 1000 square feet.  You're going 

to have to have space where, you know, there's going to be 

some security, there's going to be a dispatcher.  You know, 

again, there's no walk-in service, there's no real -- you 

know, it's not a real retail space the way we would 

typically think about it. 

          And, you know, you're probably talking from what 

I've heard people have told me is anywhere, you know, five 

to eight or so vehicles, give or take.   

          So, you know, I don't think you're going to be -- 

you know, it's not going to be fleets like, you know, 

Enterprise Rent A Car, you know?  So, you know, I think it 

would be -- you know, relatively controlled.   

          And to the license question, the state issues a 

license, but we have to allow it here in Cambridge -- you 

know, for businesses to operate here in Cambridge.  And then 

they will enter into a host agreement with the city, and 

then the City Manager will approve it, and then it moves 

forward from there. 

47

          And then there was an earlier question about when 

the clock starts ticking on the three years.  And my 

understanding is that the clock starts ticking when the 

state issues its first license.  So I'm not sure when that 

would be.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you very much 

for that additional information.  Tom, you had your hand up 

next for questions for staff or the petitioner.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  It's really a question around 

this, of course.  Like all of us on the Planning Board, I'm 

trying to buy local.  And I buy books from Harvard 

Bookstore, and somebody drives up to Harvard Bookstore and 

they load the books in, and then they drive them to my 

house. 

          Did Harvard Bookstore have to get a special permit 

for that?  Maybe it's a rhetorical question?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  For delivery, to do delivery?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I don't believe so.  There's been -

- this is -- it is not something I really want to comment on 

broadly, but I know that, you know, during the -- as 

everyone is aware during the pandemic, there's been a lot of

increase in businesses doing delivery.   

          And the question about, you know, how much can a 

retail -- an ordinary retail store operate as a delivery 

business while still being called sort of a retail store and 

not sort of, like, you know, more of a distribution center, 

is -- you know -- a question that's been dealt with a little 

bit differently during the pandemic, because it's a state of 

emergency. 

          It is something -- it is a question or an issue we 

plan to address when we talk about retail zoning more 

broadly next week.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Ah.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So you might want to hang on to 

that question, because we'll talk about it again.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.  Well, you know, of course 

in the pavilion area for all of these businesses that I 

frequent are now delivering to my house.  And I wasn't 

aware, I haven't seen them recently at the Planning Board, 

so I assume that none of them had to apply for a special 

permit.   

          We have, obviously, reviewed 11 special permit 

applications for cannabis distribution.  I didn't -- wasn't

aware that my fellow citizens were so fond of cannabis, but 

-- and increasingly, it's a nonissue for us.   

          So I don't look forward to hearing -- rehearing 11 

times more issues around cannabis, around a delivery issue 

which is, I guess, a routine way of doing business for any 

other retail.  So this seems -- you know, it's supposed to 

be questions, not editorializing now.  But this is verging 

on officious, in my opinion.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?  You have your 

hand up for questions.              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah.  So I'm trying to understand, 

just as my colleagues are.  It seems like if you use one 

business model where you -- the operator has a physical 

location, buys product from people who use it, store it in a 

Business 1 -- IB1 or IB2 district; people who order from 

them and they deliver to them.  That's one business. 

          In the courier business, it seems like it's really 

somebody's getting a permit to pick up product from the 

existing retail store and deliver it to somebody's house in 

Cambridge.  Now, is there any reason why that person has to 

have their parking lot or their business located in 

Cambridge?   

50

20

21

22

          And if it's just an office, is there any reason 

why it has to be out in Alewife?  Because IB1 and IB2 

districts are actually very limited.  There's a portion of a 

bock in East Cambridge that's IB1, and then there's like a 

corner of the Alewife Quadrangle is IB2.   

          And if you think about what those areas are like, 

there may not be that many opportunities to actually 

respace, because mostly they're sort of large businesses 

taking quite a bit of land. 

          So I guess it's -- is this a license to serve 

people in Cambridge, or is it a license to have a parking 

lot in a warehouse location?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Jeff, do you --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Oh, I was -- I thought that was 

another one of those rhetorical questions.   I mean, I think 

it's a -- so again the license, we're trying to sort of all 

separate, you know, what it means to license a business, 

compared to what it means to zone a land use.   

          And so, you know, the business licensing is -- you 

know, it's not entirely settled yet, but it's taking shape 

at the state level.  You know, what kind of licenses can you 

get and what kinds of businesses can you operate?

          And I think the question before the Planning 

Board, which -- you know, we're as open to ideas as anyone 

is given different kinds of land-use models that might 

exist, whether it's -- you know, an office, a parking lot, a 

warehouse or storage center, you know, where are those 

different types of businesses appropriate to be located in 

the city?   

          And I think the challenge that we've had kind of 

playing catch-up with this is that, you know, we have -- 

we're sort of working with one very broadly defined type of 

use that it's now becoming more apparent that it really is 

multiple different kinds of uses that will have different 

kinds of characteristics.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I'll be brief.  I guess I cannot 

be as eloquent as Tom was -- he's always more eloquent than 

I can possibly be.   

          But, given that marijuana is now illegal in this 

city, I really don't see the need for all of this regulatory 

restriction on how it might be delivered within the city, 

just like any other product, as Tom pointed out. 

          And that perspective is further emphasized by the

fact that it can be delivered from outside the city without 

any restriction at all, and probably the rent and 

restrictions outside the city are probably lower and less 

restrictive, and you probably most in that business would 

prefer to run that business from outside the city. 

          But, you know, being in fact that it can be run 

from outside the city without any Cambridge restrictions, 

and given the fact that we have legalized this product, I 

really just don't really understand the need for this 

somewhat complex regulation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Steve.  So as 

the questions have gone on here, we definitely have segued 

nicely as we often do into discussion.   

          So I'm going to keep calling on people -- I may 

come back around to some of the folks who started out with 

just questions.  So if you want to chime in more, please 

feel free to put up your hand again.   

          I am going to take Mary next, because she hasn't 

weighed in either with questions or commentary yet.  So 

Mary, I turn the floor over to you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Catherine.  I think I'm in 

the same ballpark as Steve and Tom, in that -- particularly

for that courier license.  You know, I mean it seems a bit 

overkill.   

          I do understand with the operator license and the 

warehouse component, that that does have a land use context.  

And so, the -- there are limited areas where we'd be 

allowed, as it's currently proposed.   

          It might be worth considering some other areas, 

but I think, you know, it's a question of how quickly do we 

want to move this along, and how much study do you really 

need to try to figure that out.  I don't know.   

          But to me it would seem if you could at least 

start with those districts for the warehousing piece -- 

because quite frankly I think the marijuana courier license 

piece is the part thatâ€™s going to -- people are really going 

to move forward on quickly. 

          And that being said, I'm just curious -- and maybe 

Councillor Nolan knows this, and she tried the service from 

outside the city, but, you know, Amazon and all those other 

places will just leave things for you.   

          Now groceries you can -- you know, the contactless 

pickup is the new thing because of COVID -- hopefully it 

won't be here forever -- but I'm assuming that this would be 

54

a little bit different with all the security regulations 

that exist around the retail facilities, and as one of the 

public speakers said, you know, there are security 

regulations attached to the delivery as well. 

          I'm just curious in terms of the actual delivery.  

You know, I'm assuming the person who's ordered it needs to 

be there and sign for it and things like that.  Does anyone 

know how that works?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Clearly, Mary, you 

have not done home delivery of alcohol during the current 

situation.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I have not.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I continue to buy my own wine.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So at least with 

regard to alcohol, you can't do contactless delivery.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  The person who 

ordered must be home, must present ID and must sign for it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Got it, okay.         

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  That is the same for 

cannabis and the state law as well.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  

Thank you for clarifying that.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It is funny what one 

will shop for in person and what will -- you know, what 

we'll order to have delivered to your door.   

          Anyway, I think -- you know, I think it's just, 

you know, one more convenience that not only helps the 

buyer, but provides an economic opportunity for individuals 

who are looking to start a business or provide an additional 

service to their ongoing retail facility.   

          And I think, you know, having the ability to focus 

on the Economic Empowerment community initially is a really 

wonderful idea, and is consistent with the way the city has 

been approaching this all along. 

          So, you know, I think it makes sense to move it 

forward, realizing that, you know, there may need to be 

still some back and forth with Community Development on, you 

know, the language as it comes out of the commission at the 

state level.   

          But all in all, I'm in favor of it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Councillor McGovern,

did you have something else you wanted to add?         

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  Thank you.  Turn my camera 

back on.  I hate just looking at my face on the screen.  

Another thing in terms of moving this forward, my 

understanding is that there are a couple of potential 

businesses that are already paying rent on space, but can't 

open yet.   

          And so, if the state is coming down with their 

regs, probably sometime next week is what I understand; you 

know, the further we delay, we have -- you know, that's the 

issue we're having with brick and mortar now too, with the 

court cases, you've got people paying all this money for 

rent, but they can't open. 

          So the sooner we can kind of shuffle this along, I 

think it's going to help these smaller businesses, because 

they're paying for space they can't use.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you for that.  

That actually helps to frame as I kind of go to people's 

second round comments here.  It looks -- I want folks to -- 

if you can comment on what action you think we ought to take 

tonightâ€¦   

          And again, we can recommend that the petition be

adopted with or without changes, we can recommend it not be 

adopted and explain why, we can provide comments without 

recommending either, or we could continue this hearing and 

have it come back to us. 

          So, love people's thoughts as we go around again.  

I'm going to start with Corinne, who had her hand up early 

as one of the folks who wanted to get in again.  So, 

Corinne.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  So I depend on my 

colleagues to help me understand the impact of the zoning.  

I completely, completely am on board with allowing delivery 

of cannabis in Cambridge and making it as easy as possible 

as quickly as possible and fulfilling the promise of equity 

that was promised to communities that were disproportionally 

harmed on the War on Drugs.   

          I don't know enough about how this works to know 

if recommending this without changes is the way to get 

there, recommending with changes, et cetera.  It sounds like 

continuing I don't want to say yes to.  But I'll wait until 

we hear from everyone else. 

          I did want to ask, if there's a simpler way to do 

this.  In the Staff memo page 5 under, "Existing special

permits and amendment process" it says that, "We've 

explicitly prohibited home delivery in the past."  Could we 

just strike that sentence?  And then does all this go away, 

and then people can do home delivery?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.  I believe 

that portion of the memo -- and Jeff, correct me if I'm 

wrong here -- is not referring to a portion of the zoning 

ordinance, but to the special permits we have issued to the 

11 businesses we've already permitted?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes.  It definitely was in 

regards to the special permit.  So I guess a better way to 

state my question would be, is there a way to simply strike, 

you know, delivery or mobile in the original zoning, or 

would that be a faster, easier way to get there?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's a good question.  I mean, we -

- I think we would need to discuss that internally and see 

what kind of action could be taken, either by the City 

Council or by the Planning Board?   

          The issue is that each of those -- so cannabis 

retailers require a special permit from the Planning Board, 

and that means that the Planning Board is looking at the 

particular characteristics of that business, including a

transportation logistics plan. 

          As you know, the Planning Board has spent a lot of 

time discussing pickup and drop-off and parking impacts and 

all the different things that might happen if cars are 

double parking, or do they have access to loading 

facilities?   

          These are all sort of questions that come up, and 

part of the reason for home delivery is not being allowed is 

first of all because they hadn't been allowed previously, 

but also because that is something that typically would be 

looked at as part of the Planning Board's review of an 

application, if they need to review and make findings on the 

transportation impacts of a proposal. 

          So whether it can be done sort of legally or 

practically just across the board to allow that, I don't 

really know the answer to that question.  But if the Board 

were to put that in their recommendation, it's something we 

could talk about with the Law Department and others within 

the city.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  So I think everyone 

might remember that when we first talked about zoning for 

cannabis a couple years ago, I was actually in favor of

mobile cannabis for the same reason that Councillor McGovern 

and members of the public brought up -- starting a brick and 

mortar business in Cambridge is extremely cost-prohibitive 

and excludes the very groups that we are intending to 

redress harm with.   

          So I think that any way that we can help with 

mobile -- someone joked about an ice cream truck.  I'm not 

opposed to that in the future -- I know that's what we're 

not talking about tonight, but in the future the same way we 

have beer gardens, why not have -- you know, a mobile 

cannabis truck that comes to a place that only people who 

are 21 and older are allowed to go to for a festival or 

concert or something?   

          Anyhow, I would like this to be as expansive and 

inclusive as possible.  I would like to -- I'm in favor of 

expanding which areas under the table of use, you know, to 

look beyond simply B1 and B2 to consider other areas as 

well.   

          And I'm also in favor being as generous as the law 

allows.  We've said that cannabis retailers couldn't be 

within 300 feet of a public or private school, but I'm fine 

with in this instance for delivery or courier being close --

as close as the law allows, right?  Because there are state 

regulations that are in place.   

          But I would rather that the city of Cambridge 

zoning is the most -- as generous as legally possible, 

because of that reason that we all already know.  When we 

looked at a map of where you can start a cannabis business, 

once you start drawing these circles around parks and 

schools, there's almost nowhere that you can do this.  And 

as the public brought up, that means that the costs are 

prohibitive.   

          So I'm in favor of making this happen, whether 

it's through this zoning amendment, or whichever way 

possible.  Thanks.    

wanted to weigh in?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Ted?  You 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  Well, as someone who has 

not been inside a brick and mortar store since the middle of 

March, I am all in favor of couriers and delivery services 

and curbside delivery.  And so, I think it is a quandary, 

because it seems to me that there are two possibilities.   

          It seems to me the courier services like Uber Eats 

or Grub Hub or the retail stores that are making deliveries 

62

on their own, and there's no reason why they couldn't be 

allowed almost anywhere in the city.   

          I mean, if we take out residential districts, but 

it seems to me there's no reason why they couldn't be in 

most commercial and industrial and office business districts 

if they're really just going to be a facility that's going 

to be sending cars and couriers out. 

          Now, the other alternative of a facility that's 

going to have a fleet of cars and maybe doing some other 

things -- you know, maybe yes, they should be limited 

initially in a couple of the industrial districts, as we 

limit other similar fleets. 

          I certainly agree with Tom that we have spent so 

much time on cannabis issues that I really don't see why 

they need to come to the Planning Board to get a special 

permit to have a courier facility that is going to already 

be licensed by the state.   

          I mean, now maybe yes, the facility that might do 

other things and needs to be in say a specific place and has 

a fleet that we have to deal with traffic and parking issues 

-- you know, maybe those do need a special permit. 

          Similarly, I also agree with Corinne that the

concept that we're going to have to go back and amend I 

think 11 licenses and have hearings on that to get rid of 

they can't have delivery when it's now going to be allowed 

by the state, and we're otherwise going to allow it in the 

city, it just seems really onerous. 

          Where we are right now, you know, I'm not really 

in favor of continuing things, but if indeed this state is 

going to decide something in the next couple of days which 

may set up these two different categories and we could 

realistically, you know, separate out say the couriers from 

the non courier facilities, maybe it is waiting worthwhile 

continuing to do that. 

          Or alternatively, you know, I don't know 

procedurally whether we could simply say -- you know, we 

recommend this, we recommend it as broadly as possible, and 

send it on to the Ordinance Committee and to the City 

Council to figure out how they coordinate it with whatever 

comes out of the state.   

          I'd be happy with that too.  I think we're all 

pretty much in favor of adopting this in one format or 

another, and I think we're all pretty willing to have it be 

as expansive as possible.

          I mean, especially the fact that you can have 

deliveries from outside the city to your house makes this 

seem so academic -- you know, we're spending a lot of time 

on something that, you know, ought to be able to figured out 

and be made, you know, purely mechanical.  That's where I 

am.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I think we should 

move forward with this one also.  I am curious -- and to 

Corinne's point, I believe this does make it very possible 

to basically have mobile cannabis operations using a -- you 

know, people say they're going to deliver one item at a 

time:  I don't know if the economy is there.   

          I think they're going to try to have a delivery 

vehicle.  I mean, these people are running basically a non-

brick and mortar retail cannabis shop.  The purchases will 

be made online, and that will go to a dispatcher, who tells 

the vehicle where to go and what time.  I can see that 

happening.  

          And although one thing I'm surprised is I haven't 

seen a lot of the license facilities here in opposition to 

any of this.  So that's another thing to weigh I guess, but 

65

I think it's a positive move.   

          On Ted's point, if this is going to get decided at 

the state level soon, I don't think it hurts to wait a 

little longer.  But I think it's -- doesn't have a lot of 

teeth in it, but I think it helps along to get this moving.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Councillor McGovern, 

did you have a comment about kind of the food truck?         

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  Yeah.  So I mean, I mean 

obviously, you know, you never know what individual people 

are going to do and sometimes people try to skirt their way 

around, but that would be an absolute violation of the law, 

and they could lose their license.   

          And so, you know, I'm not sure -- I'm not sure 

many places would risk that, given the investment that goes 

into it.  And of course, no one can ever say, "never."   

But that would be a violation of the law, and they would 

lose their license.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Excuse me, I just want to 

clarify.  Why would that be a violation?  I don't 

understand.  That's the part I don't understand.  But maybe 

I haven't gotten deep into the law here, but it seems like

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  It probably -- yes, you 

know.  But my understanding what I have been told by people 

that the law allows them to only deliver what has been a 

particular order.  So they can't carry -- so, I mean, could 

they?  Right?  You're absolutely right.  If I was driving to 

-- if I had three deliveries in a particular neighborhood, 

it would make a lot of sense for me to bring, you know.   

          But you can't -- my understanding is, but you also 

can't drive around with non -- with cannabis that is not out 

for specific delivery either. 

          So we could get some more clarification on that, 

but my understanding is that that's -- I think the state is 

also trying to -- the state's not looking at this 

necessarily as being what's the most efficient; they're 

trying to balance different things too.   

          And I think Cambridge is probably a little more 

willing to be flexible than the state is.  We did vote for 

legalization at over 70 percent, so it's as close to a 

mandate as you're ever going to get in a ballot question, I 

think.   

          But thank you.  It's a good question.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you for your answer.

Like I said, just always looking for the unintended 

consequence.  And there may not be a consequence at all.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I think it's 

one of those where you start parsing the, "You're allowed to 

be a UPS truck who has a delivery to go to a specific place.  

You're not allowed to be the food truck who says, "I have a 

menu here and can make it available to anyone I come 

across."  I think that may be the distinction that we're 

looking at here.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'd have to agree, except 

that these transactions are online.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, I think when 

the truck leaves the dispatch, it has -- the order in the 

truck when it leaves dispatch has to have been put in.  So 

anyway, we don't have to get into that.  That goes kind of 

beyond the scope of what the Planning Board needs to do 

here, especially tonight.   

          I see a bunch of folks still with hands up.  I 

want to make sure that everyone has -- Hugh, did you want to 

say anything again?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes, I did.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I'm recalling my misspent youth.  

When I was in high school, I worked for a drugstore, and the 

afternoon shift.  And part of my duties were to deliver 

drugs to people.  I didn't ask what the drugs were, I even 

said, "Here they are" and I jumped in his car and drove 

around.  So that makes me think that, you know, it's 

probably not just going to be you go to Point A to deliver 

to Patient -- Person B -- it might be more like Grubhub.   

          When we order from Santouka with Grubhub, we're 

not necessarily the first person that gets a delivery.  The 

guy goes to Santouka, there are three orders to be 

delivered, and if we're lucky we're the first, and if we're 

unlucky we're the third.   

          I could see that it would be very useful for a 

public -- you know, a retail marijuana store to have a 

relationship with delivery companies or have several of them 

-- possibly even several of them go together and get a 

license, so that they can -- you know, deliver to their 

businesses throughout the city. 

          I think we pretty much want to get out of the way 

of this.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And I would propose a way we get 

out of the way of this is to comment that the rules in this 

proposal apply to a marijuana delivery operator, which has a 

place of business that he Councillor McGovern says might be 

1000 square feet in a loading dock.  That should be subject 

to generally the regulation in here.  You know, we can start 

out with industry districts, for example. 

          I think we should say we have no -- I think it's 

fine that people pick up retail businesses in Cambridge and 

deliver to people.  That's really not a zoning issue.  Yeah, 

they might have an office, yeah, they might have a parking 

lot.   

          If there are rules that restrict their parking lot 

or their office, they might have to get permission to have a 

proper parking lot, but -- 

          And so, I would say we say that we're in favor of 

having the resources work, having regulations come out.  We 

should have the staff work with the Council and the City 

Solicitor and the Traffic and Parking Department to craft 

the marijuana delivery operator.  I mean, there simply 

wouldn't be zoning regulations about marijuana couriers. 

          So that's my thinking.  And it's obviously -- it's

building upon that with most other people in the city.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Tom, did you have 

another comment you want to share?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Sure.  I agree, we should 

recommend as broadly as possible.  But the City Councillors 

aren't deaf to what's happening at the state level, right?  

So they can incorporate and fine-tune this as the 

regulations are drafted on Beacon Hill.   

          I agree with Corinne; if there's some way to amend 

special permits -- I wouldn't know how to do that 

retroactively so that you would allow delivery that would 

save us whatever 11 more hearings on marijuana which -- you 

know, I signed onto this Board and I was promised that we 

would sit two nights a month.  It looks like December we'll 

be sitting five times. 

          So anything we can do to address that I'd 

appreciate.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I think what 

I'm hearing from the Board is we do want to forward a 

positive recommendation just because, you know, we support 

the goals of the Council's petition to facilitate this in 

Cambridge as broadly as possible, and to the extent we can,

that they can make changes based on the state regulations to 

facilitate delivery from retail establishments, which are 

not in the IB-1 and 2 districts.   

          And to do that without those retailers having to 

come back to the Planning Board, we would be especially 

supportive and appreciative of that, because it has been a 

surprisingly -- I mean, this Board didn't advocate for 

marijuana dispensaries or retailers requiring special 

permits in the first place. 

          But I think even based on what we were expecting 

when we said that, it has taken up a surprising amount of 

the Board's time.  And to go through those again would not 

be a good use of the Board's time, frankly. 

          Now, that's my sense of what I'm hearing from the 

Board.  Are there other thoughts of what else we would like 

to include in a recommendation?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Seeing 

none, do I have a motion to forward a favorable 

recommendation to the Council on the zoning with suggestions 

that they make such adjustments as are necessary to 

coordinate with the state's regulations to facilitate as 

broadly as possible delivery within Cambridge, both from

delivery facilities that do not have a retail component, but 

also to facilitate from marijuana retailers within 

Cambridge?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  This is Tom.  So moved.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  [1:52:20 audio unclear]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh, you are 

breaking up, so I can't understand you.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Sorry.  I'll try again.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  The concept that the existing 

retailers found a way to deliver products through the 

delivery services without requiring a special permit --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- that should be in there.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Absolutely.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And I think that it's not -- and we 

should say we don't really think the special permit is 

needed for a courier license.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I think those 

are good additions to the recommendation, Hugh, that to the 

-- Tom --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.     

73

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- you accept those 

as a friendly amendment to the motion?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I accept those as friendly 

amendments, at the wisdom of my fellow Board Member, Mr. 

Russell.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?    

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It's Ted.  I second the motion 

as amended.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  And we 

have a second from Ted.  Jeff, anything you need from us 

before you take a roll call vote?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No.  I think the comments were 

fairly clear, and as we always do, we'll try to do our best 

to consolidate the comments, but they all seem pretty 

consistent so --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Shouldn't be too hard.  On that 

motion to forward the favorable recommendation, Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's a yes. Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And Catherine Preston Connolly?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.             

          [All vote YES]   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you very much, 

Jeff.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Before we move on to 

our next agenda item, I just wanted to make a brief comment.  

Tom mentioned that our Tuesday nights are filling up here 

pretty rapidly.   

          I will say that Staff has been really diligent 

about respecting the Planning Board's wishes to have these 

75

shorter meetings as much as possible.  That does right now 

have the knock on effect of us meeting much more frequently 

than any of us signed up for. 

          And, you know, if folks' opinion on that -- how 

that's working for them changes, please let Staff or myself 

know.  You know, this has been a conscious decision to go to 

more Tuesday nights, rather than have marathon meetings as -

- and thinking that that works better for Planning Board 

members.  If it doesn't, we need to know that.   

          And so, I think that the City Council adopting the 

Mullen Rule is going to make all of this easier, certainly 

on staff in terms of making sure there's a quorum, even 

though we're meeting every week.  But I think that is 

something, you know, we're going to have to coordinate on 

for the foreseeable future.   

          Hopefully, you know, there will be a vaccine that 

makes it safe for us to all gather again soon, but I'm not 

sure what soon looks like.  So do keep us in the loop if 

it's not working for you, if you need a night off -- you 

know, just communicate about it, and we'll all make it work 

together.

(8:07 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, Mary T. Flynn, 

                  Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven A. Cohen, H 

                  Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom 

                  Sieniewicz, and Corinne Espinoza.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Then 

we'll move on to our second but hopefully brief item, which 

is a request for an extension of time on the public hearing 

for Planning Board Case #364, a Planning Unit Development 

special permit at 100 Cambridgeside Place.  CDD staff will, 

as usual, begin by summarizing why this is before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Jeff Roberts with CDD 

again.  I'll try to be brief.  It's a little bit complicated 

this one, but it relates a little bit to what you were just 

talking about, Catherine, in terms of the scheduling of 

meetings and trying to keep that under control while keeping 

meetings not too long. 

          Also, the fact that we have been advised by the 

Law Department now that there have been some changes at the 

state level while there was an Executive Order in effect 

that essentially extended in a fairly open-ended way the 

77

normal timeframes for holding hearings and filing decisions 

on special permit cases. 

          Our understanding is that by an act of the 

Legislature, that will cease to be in effect after December 

1.  So we're now back to the time when we will have to be 

pretty diligent about scheduling hearings and filing 

decisions, and we'll start to be probably bringing a lot 

more time extensions to the Board if we do need them.   

          In this case, though, this is the Cambridgeside 

development.  And there's actually requirements in the 

zoning ordinance about the timing between holding the first 

hearing and the second hearing.   

          We -- because of the Executive Order, we weren't 

really worried about that, but now we're sort of worried 

about it again.  And we have that hearing scheduled for 

December 22.  But I think the date in the zoning ordinance 

when we would need to hold it would be sometime a little bit 

earlier in December.   

          So we asked the applicant to send us a waiver form 

so that we could -- you know, ask the Planning Board to 

agree to an extension of that timeframe to hold the hearing 

on December 22.    

78

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Are there any 

questions from Board members about that?  Then is there a 

motion to greet the time extension?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis Bacci, so moved.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mary Flynn, second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Roll call vote?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion to agree to the 

extension of time for the hearing?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That was yes.  Ted Cohen?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, so that's seven Planning 

Board members voting in favor.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Jeff, I'm back, I apologize.  

I'm also in favor of the extension request.  This is Corinne 

Espinoza.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  We'll report Corinne as 

being in favor, so that's all members in favor.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Thank 

you, Jeff.  So that concludes the business on the agenda.  

Any additional comments from staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Any Board members 

have anything to add before we adjourn?       

          COLLECTIVE:  Happy Thanksgiving.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have a question.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Does the Mullen Rule allow for 

someone who's not been at the initial hearing to follow the 

procedures, and then participate in the case at a later

time?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  My understanding -- this is Jeff 

Roberts again -- my understanding of that is the answer is 

yes.  So if the -- if for instance the case goes to two 

nights and there is a particular seven members hearing is on 

the first night, and then on the second night maybe some 

member who was on the original case wouldn't be -- wasn't 

present, another Planning Board member who wasn't present 

the first time, as long as that member reviews the materials 

and the transcript or watches the video of the meeting and 

certifies that they have reviewed that material can then be 

seated for the continuation.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So there's homework involved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  It's obviously 

-- you know, in a suboptimal situation.  But it does give us 

some additional flexibility, and God knows right now 

flexibility is key to everything we're all doing.  So thank 

you all for --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.

congratulate Iram and Jeff and anyone else on Staff who did 

indeed get City Council to adopt the Mullen Rule, which is 

something I've been lobbying for the entire time I've been 

on the Board.  And it's -- you know, it should help us all.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It really should.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I appreciate that, and I would be 

remiss if I actually didn't point out Swaathi, who's been 

the one who's probably been carrying that torch for us the 

most on staff, and --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And thanks Swaathi.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- put some good effort into it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  Very well 

done.           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think it will make 

all of our lives a little bit easier, and we can all use 

that right now, so all right.  Thank you everyone.  Everyone 

have a happy Thanksgiving.  Stay safe and healthy, and see 

you next week.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Happy Thanksgiving.  Well done, 

Madam Chair.  Thank you.
