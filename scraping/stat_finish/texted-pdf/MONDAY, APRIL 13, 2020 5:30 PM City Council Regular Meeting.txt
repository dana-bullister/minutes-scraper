are delivered to shelters and programs that the Department of Human Services Program has 
identified having a strong need for meals. To date, over 2,000 meals have been provided weekly 
to 10 shelters and programs in Cambridge through these efforts.  
 
This appropriation covers meals for the next 9 weeks, however the City is committed to 
providing these meals through the duration of the declared emergency.  If additional funding is 
needed, I will request that the Council appropriate the necessary funds.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it

lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in 
both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.”

shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible

such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along:

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,

provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle

ORDERED: 

The City of Cambridge has declared a Health Emergency due to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
 
On March 23, Governor Charlie Baker issued a “stay-at-home” advisory, in an effort to 
increase social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19; and 
 
Playgrounds, basketball courts, ball fields, and fitness areas have been closed to ensure 
social distancing; and 
 
It is imperative that Cambridge residents are able to safely go outside while keeping a 
distance of 6+ feet from others; and 
 
The length of time that residents will be asked to distance themselves from others is 
unknown at this time; and 
 
New York City has already implemented street closures to decrease density and reduce 
crowding in the city’s parks; and 
 
The “stay-at-home” advisory has drastically reduced car traffic in Cambridge, now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager is requested to confer with the Director of Traffic, Parking, and 
Transportation on streets in each neighborhood that could be closed to all non-essential 
traffic for the duration of the Health Emergency and report back to the council as soon 
as possible; and further be it 
 
That the City Manager will ensure that all neighborhood groups are invited to give 
suggestions and input into any recommendations for how to best select streets for 
closure.

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

The Governor has issued a Stay at Home order for the Commonwealth; and 
 
The order urges residents not to leave the home except to do essential jobs, shop for 
groceries, buy medicine, or take a walk; and 
 
It is impossible to maintain proper distance from other individuals when talking a walk 
or going for a run on narrow Cambridge sidewalks, creating an unsafe situation for 
anyone who leaves the home; and 
 
Closing Memorial Drive to vehicular traffic would create a space for residents to go for 
a walk or get some exercise while maintaining recommended social distancing 
practices; and 
 
Traffic volumes are down significantly in the City of Cambridge during the Stay at 
Home order; and 
 
As the temperature gets warmer, the demand for safe outdoor space will only continue 
to increase; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DCR to explore 
closing Memorial Drive for the duration of the Stay at Home order to give people in 
Cambridge a safe space to exercise and be outside without violating social distancing 
practices; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter as soon as possible.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the

The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule

The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home

Public comment on Policy Order #68

Policy order #68, which was brought before the Council by Councillor Nolan, is reckless, thoughtless and quite frankly 
possibly the worst policy brought before this Council in the last ten years. I am beyond baffled as to why a group of 
Councillors think it’s a good idea to go against the advice of our Governor, our Medical officials, and all prevailing wisdom
and encourage groups of people to essentially congregate on Memorial Drive. It’s frightening to think that our Councillors 
possess this lack of basic comprehension of public health needs. This would be a DISASTER if this policy order were to 
pass. With warm weather approaching (and lately already here), we are having a hard enough time convincing groups of 
people about the importance of staying home and self-isolation. Should Memorial Drive open up, we will have groups of 
people riding bikes, rollerblading, walking, running and congregating. It won’t just be the families and avid exercisers the 
Councillors envision either. It will be teenagers, out-of-towners, and people who are at high risk. We will then have to 
divert our police and our fire personnel who are already extremely over-taxed, to this area to monitor the situation. This is 
just not thought out. Let’s instead think of ways to help our small businesses who are struggling to keep afloat. Let’s worry
about those families who are struggling to put food on the table and whose parents have been laid off. Policy order #68 is 
absurd and should be struck down before it has the chance to do any substantial harm.

Closure of streets during pandemic

I think it is a terrible idea to close streets, encouraging people to spend more time 
outside, in the company of others.  I was just at Fresh Pond yesterday and it was clear 
that as a group, we Cantabrigians are not good at social distancing or wearing 
masks.  Try as I might to maintain a 6 foot distance from others, it was like people were 
out for a typical casual Sunday stroll.  I finally gave up and went home.

Closing our streets to encourage more of our citizens to get out of their houses is folly.  I 
think a better idea would be to follow in the footsteps of Boston and encourage a 
curfew.  Don't get me wrong, I'm as "left" as they come, but I also have common sense, 
and common sense says we need to accept the sacrifice of boredom for ourselves, so we 
all have a greater likelihood of staying healthy and safe.

Thank you.

Best,

Michelle Phoenix

Memorial Drive closure

I'm writing to express my support of opening Memorial Drive for pedestrian traffic during the Covid-19 crisis (calendar 
item #3).

Governor Baker already includes socially distant outdoor activities in communication around approved and essential 
tasks, for example by leaving beaches open to transitory use, and by opening seasonal parks early, we should do the 
same by opening Memorial Drive to pedestrian traffic. 

We are in this for weeks and months to come, so we must seek interventions that are not just effective, but also 
sustainable. It is vital that we do everything possible to create spaces where people can more safely exercise and enjoy 
the outdoors while maintaining the recommended 6ft distance between themselves and others as we go through the 
difficult time ahead.

585 Third Street

Hi-
We are 100% in favor of the 585 Third Street project. The design is exciting and will add to the area for residents and 
businesses. We are especially excited about the green space inside and outside and the performing arts studio. We are 
hopeful they will bring people to the area at nights and on weekends, traditionally slow times in Kendall Square. Count 
us among your supporters and best of luck with the project.

Dear councilors,

Opening Memorial Drive to pedestrians during social isolation

I am deeply disappointed with the lack of action taken by the city of Cambridge thus far in responding to the desperate 
need of our residents for more spaces to get outside. Please close Memorial Drive to cars as soon as possible—and 
identify other streets in the community that can be turned rapidly into either pedestrian streets or slow-speed zones for 
use by pedestrians at all times.

As a resident of Cambridge, it is stunning to me that the council has not taken more proactive action on this issue, given 
our population. According to the Census, 85 percent of our city's population lives in multi-unit structures. A huge share 
of these individuals—including me—has no access to private open space, like a back yard. As such, we're forced to use 
our city's tiny sidewalks to get any exercise outdoors. The 30 percent of households in our city without access to cars—
again, including me—can't drive out to some far-out location to take a hike in nature.

The result of our reliance on our six-feet-wide sidewalks—which are inadequate even in normal times—is that we are 
literally being put in danger on a daily basis in the act of trying to get some exercise. This is extremely upsetting and 
scary for my family and me, and it is depressing that the response by the council so far as been to avoid taking action, 
such as by closing Memorial Drive to cars.

My understanding is that some members of the council are concerned that closing Memorial Drive would attract crowds 
and therefore cause a dangerous situation. However, I am confident that this fear is misplaced. The roughly four miles 
of Memorial Drive from Longfellow Bridge to Mount Auburn Hospital is equivalent to roughly 1,000,000 square feet of 
roadway, or 23 acres—roughly the size of Boston Public Garden. There is enough space within that area for more than 
2,500 people to stand with 10 feet on all sides. There is no realistic potential for congestion in that space.

Moreover, other cities throughout the US are taking even more ambitious steps. Minneapolis, for example, has 
closed 18 miles of roadway to cars, for the purpose of pedestrian and bike use. Other places 
from Denver to Montgomery County, Maryland are taking similar steps. These initiatives are being undertaken in safety.

Ultimately, if we're concerned about pedestrian congestion on Memorial Drive, the answer is not to take space away 
from pedestrians—hoping they'll hold up in their apartments for the next month, We need to expand pedestrian space; 
if Memorial Drive is too small (and even if it's not!), let's open up other streets for exclusive or safe pedestrian use, 
creating safe connections throughout our community.

The progressive council that I believe you represent—and for which I voted—will adopt a proactive, bold action and 
create the safe, convenient outdoor environments we need in Cambridge.

Thank you, and be safe!!

Fw: Late Order From Councillor Simmons

Perez, Lori

From:
Sent:

Subject:

Clerk,

Councillors,

Please include this correspondence in the next City Council agenda package in correspondence.

Please be aware that the late policy order submitted by Councillor Simmons regarding liquor license 
establishments is recommending to unnecessarily take valuable time and energy away from the City 
Manager during this Covid19 crisis.

It appears that the requests made are not within the legal authority of the City Council or the City of 
Cambridge. It is critical that Councillors understand their role in our legal system as law makers for 
the City of Cambridge, and that they have no authority to change state laws. We have gone down this 
road before, so many times, and it is incredibly frustrating that this is happening, yet again, during a 
time of crisis.

To the extent that Councillors are not willing or able to respect the scope of their role, it is my opinion 
that they should step down from their positions.

All Councillors know that I am an attorney and an expert on liquor licensing in Massachusetts. I also 
own a food and drink small business called UpperWest, and have specialized first hand knowledge 
about the Cambridge restaurant industry. The Council and City are always welcome to consult with 
me prior to taking up the incredibly valuable time of this City Council and our City Manager during a 
time of crisis for matters that are outside of the City's authority.

There are ways to accomplish the goals expressed in this Policy Order, and it requires State action.

Please do not waste time at tonight's meeting on this topic, and instead spend time addressing the 
very serious public health crisis facing our residents and businesses.

Thank you
Kim Courtney, Esq.

Policy orders

I support policy order #8 which urges the Universities in Cambridge to step up and house homeless reside in vacant 
dorm rooms. Tufts, Suffolk and other far less wealthy universities are doing this. It would be far safer than an open gym. 
So far Harvard and MIT are contributing a mere pittance. They further should each be urged to donate $5 million to the 
mayor’s emergency fund.

I also support the policy order which seeks to tie the last council’s goals to the budget. This seems like common sense 
and would better help the council and citizens to see the connection where it matters most - the money we spend.

Thank you for your consideration and your continued work for our city in this difficult times.

Sincerely,
Kathy Watkins

4/13/20 

Dear Mayor and Councilors, 

I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance regarding matters on the Council agenda 
tonight. 

We support Councilor Carlone’s Policy Order #3 asking that the 2017 goals be used during 
the upcoming budget process.  It was helpful in 2019 to know which part of the budget 
related to which of the Council’s goals, and it would be helpful to continue that approach.  
We would also be supportive of the Council passing updated goals this year, and would 
welcome public input in that effort.  We would like to see the future goals be prioritized 
and more specific. 

We repeat our strong support for closing Memorial Drive (Table #5) to create room for 
people to be outside (see our letter dated 3/29/20).  We were disappointed to hear that the 
City staff had asked the state DCR not to open Memorial Dr.   We do not think opening it 
would result in “block parties.”  We do think it would be useful for there to be some sort of 
monitoring to make sure that the physical distancing and face coverings needed at this time 
are followed. 

Regarding Communication #5, we do not think that the council rules prevent similar 
motions from being filed during a council term. (This would apply to voting on proposed 
road closures.)  Clearly circumstances may change, so that the council would need to be 
able to reverse its position if warranted.  This seems to already be the Council’s practice; I 
can think of many times when the Council has passed an order asking the manager to do 
something, and then they pass another order asking about the first order. 

Thank you for all your work at this difficult time, 

Lee Farris, President,  
Cambridge Residents Alliance

Hi Councilors -- I am writing to express my support for the policy order that QYZ and JSW introduced concerning the War 
Memorial. I think this is the right move.

Thanks for all of the hard work you are doing in this difficult time. I think the city is in good hands with each and every

Policy Orders 5 and 8

Dear Council Members and City Manager:

I understand that Policy Order 5 is being reconsidered to specifically close Memorial Drive to vehicular 
traffic. Whether weekend alone or weekdays, please factor in that Memorial Drive is the main road for many 
residents who use the Boston Hospitals: Brigham and Women's, Beth Israel-Lahey, Children's Hospital, Joslin 
etc. To be sure, the long way around is just that, the long way around. Closing Memorial Drive essentially 
closes access to ambulances, and other emergency vehicles, not just private cars. To put your residents in 
jeopardy during a historic pandemic so that a few can exercise is absurd. Once closed, Memorial Drive will 
become an attractive nuisance, inviting neighboring residents to join in. Who is going to enforce 6-foot 
distancing?? Does anyone really expect our police force to carry out this mandate?

Policy Order 8 establishing the War Memorial complex as a homeless shelter, while well-meaning, really 
jeopardizes an already fragile population. This past week I have spent time challenging measures within the 
Department of Corrections to safeguard the well-being of inmates.  Your plan, as presented, would not pass 8th 
Amendment analysis. It would be deemed cruel and abusive punishment per se. For two weeks now 
Department of Corrections has opted for 23 hour lock down, meaning each inmate is locked within his/her cell 
for 23-hours per day. Each has a bathroom within the cell and they are served meals there. When allowed out, 
only 5 persons per tier are allowed out together. During that time, they can shower; phone and visit the canteen.

To my knowledge, the homeless population destined for War Memorial will not be pre-screened for 
infection.  They will be corralled into close quarters with virtually no separation. There will be no way to 
enforce distancing. Are they all eating together as well?? Only once someone is clearly sick will that person be 
separated out. By that time it is too late.  To be sure this is a very fragile population. Many have psychiatric 
problems and are plagued by paranoia. I was informed by a neighbor that they are going to be locked in so that 
they will not be wandering the neighborhood. These people are not civilly or criminally committed. Is 
Cambridge prepared to seek judicial approval for each homeless person to lawfully contain them. Why is a 
private security company being retained to oversee this? Is it precisely because their rights will be abridged?

Note, I am very supportive of caring for the homeless within our community. We are a resourceful and wealthy 
city. I am not suggesting that the colleges should open their doors since I have no idea what their dorms are 
actually like. With all the gray matter in this city there has to be a better plan even if the city needs to pay the 
bill. Surely we have empty hotels in the city confines. And, there are definitely colleges opening their dorms to 
homeless, not just first responders.

Support for PO #85

This is certainly a trying time, and I'm very happy we're trying to do our best to help the most vulnerable to stay safe and 
healthy. Nevertheless, PO #85 from councillors Sobrinho-Wheeler and Zondervan raises a number of very important 
concerns about the currently planned approach, and I strongly urge you to take them into consideration and support 
this policy order. While it may not be "as easy" a path as the War Memorial site alone represents, I think we owe it to 
those we're seeking to serve (and the entire general public, for that matter) to pursue a comprehensive solution that 
leverages all of the resources at our disposal (including the currently vacant living arrangements mentioned).

Thank you all for your time and work on this!

Always,

Policy Order 85

I am very concerned that housing all of our homeless population in one big room at the War Memorial is simply a 
coronavirus outbreak waiting to happen. We have so much empty dorm space and hotel space. This is where we should 
house people who do not have homes. Please act in the best interest of all Cantabridgians and pass policy order 85 to 
protect against an outbreak such as occurred in San Francisco.

Thank you.

War Memorial use

I applaud your efforts regarding questioning the use of the War Memorial as an emergency shelter for our fellow 
Cantabrigians, the homeless population in Cambridge. With the numerous empty dorm spaces available, (Boston has a 
deal with Suffolk U to house homeless) hotels, (the city announced the Commonwealth of Massachusetts contracted 
with Fairpoint hotel at Fresh Pond), I find the War Memorial, is a poor solution to this emergency problem.
I appreciate the need to find immediate solutions for this difficult and unprecedented event in our City and the video 
recently released and explanations given to explain are problematic and fails to give confidence and logistics on how to 
flatten the curve in a such an open space.

A recent article in digboston https://digboston.com/cambridge-plan-to-warehouse-homeless-could-spark-covid-
outbreak/, spells this out pretty clearly.

Why can Tufts, Suffolk U and the City’s of Sommerville/Medford and Boston, do something we can’t?

As I write this, NPR had a segment on New Orleans which announced they have founds rooms for 240 homeless 
Individuals in hotels. 

This population should be treated with some dignity and be provided some privacy which a dorm room or hotel room 
would provide. Warehousing fellow citizens in the War Memorial, is the equivalent of Mary and Jesus arriving in 
Bethlehem and being told the only place they have available is the manger, with the animals.

We can do better and should do better than this.

Thanks again,

Please support housing the unhoused in university dormitories and hotels

MIT, Harvard, and Lesley have dorm rooms they could contribute to unhoused people, in a safer (and more comfortable) 
environment than a giant gym.

Hotels are now at a record low occupancy rate, ~22% nationwide, an all-time low even adjusted for seasonality. They 
could also house people.

Dear city leaders;

Close more streets for pedestrians please

Thank you for closing Memorial Drive To cars for the pandemic.  We have lived in Cambridge for over 40 years and know 
how many others are active and need to be outside now more than ever for their mental and physical well-being. Please 
close other streets to cars also for more and safer places walkers and  runners can be outside socially distance. It will 
benefit residents all over the city, not just along the river.

I am lucky enough to be able to row a single on the Charles,  which in spring I only do on low wind days. Besides all the 
people who must pass in opposite directions,  I get a broad perspective on how many runners, walkers, and  cyclists are 
going in the same direction, many at similar speeds. They are behind each other for extended periods of time and thus 
exposing each other even when they are social distancing on the narrow path.

So please also encourage all athletes to wear masks, even if it means one must back off from a full-on workout a little. 
We can all  work on our technique instead of just speed :) That is a lot of heavy breathing,  and research is showing that 
microdroplets do remain in the air for many minutes in enclosed spaces, not just when people cough or sneeze, and but 
talk, especially loudly. On still days, especially, It is obvious to me that if you move behind someone at the same pace at 
length that must have at least some of the same affect as being in a closed room. 

As recommended by the CDC, everyone should wear masks outside their homes all the time. I do so rowing. It is not 
ideal of course, but I feel the people around me are and will feel protected and I worry less about anyone working hard 
upwind of me :)

This is another reason why we should also have more full-width roads open to pedestrians only, not just paths.

One other suggestion: it is great that the Fresh Pond path is officially one way. The signage is so minimal, however that 
very few people seem aware of that.  The popularity of this and the Minuteman bike path underline the need to open 
more roads to pedestrians.

Thank you for all you do. I am very proud and relieved that our city and state have been ahead of the game (with the 
tragic Biogen exception) and continue to be proactive.

Policy Order

I am writing to urge you to support Policy Order 2020 #85, which would order the City Manager to work with local 
universities and hotels to house anyone without access to housing during the pandemic. We know from stories like this 
one from San Francisco, that the kind of shelter that the city is currently planning to operate in a gymnasium does not 
provide adequate isolation and will almost certainly result in a new outbreak in Covid-19. We know this virus to be 
incredibly contagious. So even without this tragic story from San Francisco, if we have the means to provide greater 
isolation and fail to, we are literally gambling with people's lives. Please protect the lives and safety of all Cantabrigians 
by voting for this bill.

Pilot project to test for COVID-19 in all nursing facilities. 

Dear City Mayor Siddiqui, and City Manager,

Thank you very much for all the City is doing in fighting this COVID-19 pandemic. The fact that we only have one death 
due to this virus is true testament to City's heroic efforts.

However, with the peak of the pandemic upon us, it is horrifying to know that Cambridge, as throughout MA and the 
rest of the USA for that matter, still doesn't have enough tests and worse yet, Cambridge doesn't seem to have a fast 
turnaround test in spite of the fact that we have so many bio-tech firms in our City.

As a septuagenarian with underlying medical issues, this is very disturbing. Through you, I would like to find out the 
current situation at the City's nursing home/rehab centers and how ready Cambridge is for the expected surge in 
infected Cantabrigians. This kind of information should be readily available in simple charts in the COVID-19 Response 
Email Update without having to dig through layers of webpages,

 

I just saw the results of the pilot project to test for COVID-19 in all nursing facilities which which reports: "Following the 
first round of rapid testing, a total of 212 people who live and work at skilled nursing and assisted living facilities in 
#CambMA have tested positive for COVID-19." Even with this program, it took 4 days to get the test results and just 
overnight, the number of confirmed cases almost doubled from 256 as of last night. This is truly frighting statistics! How 
many more people have been exposed by the health care workers from these facilities in the last 4 days?!

I would like to urge the City to expand the pilot program to test the residents living in the Cambridge Housing Authority's 
elderly/disabled housing developments as the next step.

I would like to illustrate my concerns through what my neighbor went through when she had a freak car accident 
recently. She broke her hip and the top of her femur. She was transported and operated on at Mt. Auburn Hospital 
then discharged to the Neville Center at Fresh Pond Nursing & Rehabilitation. After being there for 4 days, the 
Center called her husband last Monday to inform him that two very sick patients there were taken to the ER with 
confirmed COVID-19. When pressed for more information, the Center reluctantly admitted there were 7 more 
presumptive symptomatic patients. Yet, she could not get a virus test because she was asymptomatic.  There was a 
last-minute offer by Neville to test her, perhaps as a result of the City partnering with the Broad Institute of MIT 
and Harvard on a pilot project to test for COVID-19 in all nursing facilities. But she would be required to stay another 
four days (as borne out by the test result released today) there until the results came back. So, he managed 
to get her discharged early and brought her home.

Thank you for your attention and I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Respectfully yours,
Young Kim

Closing streets to cars

I am writing to you about the need to close some streets to cars in Cambridge, in order to give pedestrians more 
opportunities to get outside, while social distancing. My partner and I live in an apartment. Our outdoor space consists 
of about 10 feet by 10 feet of front yard that we share with our neighbors. We do not have a car, so cannot access trails 
and open spaces that are farther away. For our physical and mental health, we rely on being able to go on walks and 
runs in our neighborhood.

We have been doing our best to go outside during quieter times and to chose quieter streets. However, the reality is 
that Cambridge is a dense city and most neighborhoods have narrow sidewalks. When I go for a walk or run, I find myself 
detouring into the street many times (maybe once every block) so that I can give my neighbors space. I always try to 
step into the street cautiously, but I cannot help but think that a situation in which pedestrians are being forced to share 
streets with cars is not safe.

This article discusses the decisions many cities, including Boston, have made to close streets and/or extend 
sidewalks: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/coronavirus-street-closures.html. I think Cambridge should follow 
suit and close a selection of streets throughout the city. I realize there are some implementation considerations, but I 
think a creative solution can be reached. I also think it would be beneficial to consider PSAs to drivers, urging them to 
drive more cautiously, and more slowly - I think it would be ideal to limit speeds to 15 mph.

Thanks for considering this pressing issue.

Best,

Cecilia Viggiano

Subject: Support for POR 2020 #85

Dear city councilors, Mayor Siddiqui, and City Manager DePasquale,

I'm a Cambridgeport resident and a member of the organizing team of the Cambridge Neighborhood Aid 
Network. In the last few weeks (our entire existence), we have connected 200 people in Cambridge with 
neighbors who have given them material aid and support. We have seen how precariously close many of our 
neighbors are to losing their housing. For me, this observation has underlined something that has always been 
true: unhoused people are part of our community, and should be full participants in it.

That's why I'm writing to urge you to pass POR 2020 #85 to repurpose the War Memorial facility into only a 
COVID-19 testing and temporary quarantine site for unhoused individuals awaiting their test results rather 
than a long-term housing site.

If this city were not currently full of empty hotel rooms and vacant university dormitories, having unhoused 
Cantabrigians stay indefinitely in a city recreation center might be a justifiable solution: one that would be 
better than nothing. But we can do better than "better than nothing", and our unhoused neighbors deserve 
better too. They deserve privacy, safety, and dignity.

Would you want to recover from a viral illness in a converted gym? Would you want your father or mother 
sleeping in a vast open space while an infectious disease is circulating? How would you feel if you found out 
that all around you, there were safe, clean rooms where no one was living, where you could have privacy and 
quiet and not have to worry about getting sick or having your possessions stolen?

I believe that our city has the resources and ingenuity to come up with a better housing solution--namely, one 
that treats unhoused people like our neighbors rather than a problem to be solved. Please pass this measure 
and show that you believe the same.

Yours Truly,
Kit Cali

Subject: The need to close Cambridge streets to cars—opening space for pedestrians

Dear councilors,

I am deeply disappointed with the lack of action taken by the city of Cambridge thus far in responding to the desperate 
need of our residents for more spaces to get outside. Please close Memorial Drive to cars as soon as possible—and 
identify other streets in the community that can be turned rapidly into either pedestrian streets or slow-speed zones for 
use by pedestrians at all times.

As a resident of Cambridge of more than six years, it is stunning to me that the council has not taken more proactive 
action on this issue, given our population. According to the Census, 85 percent of our city's population lives in multi-unit 
structures. A huge share of these individuals—including me—has no access to private open space, like a back yard. As 
such, we're forced to use our city's tiny sidewalks to get any exercise outdoors. The 30 percent of households in our city 
without access to cars—again, including me—can't drive out to some far-out location to take a hike in nature.

The result of our reliance on our six-feet-wide sidewalks—which are inadequate even in normal times—is that we are 
literally being put in danger on a daily basis in the act of trying to get some exercise. This is extremely upsetting and 
scary for my family and me, and it is depressing that the response by the council so far as been to avoid taking action, 
such as by closing Memorial Drive to cars.

My understanding is that some members of the council are concerned that closing Memorial Drive would attract crowds 
and therefore cause a dangerous situation. However, as a PhD student in city planning, and someone who holds 
professional degrees in transportation and city planning (and has practiced in those fields), I am confident that this fear 
is misplaced. The roughly four miles of Memorial Drive from Longfellow Bridge to Mount Auburn Hospital is equivalent 
to roughly 1,000,000 square feet of roadway, or 23 acres—roughly the size of Boston Public Garden. There is enough 
space within that area for more than 2,500 people to stand with 10 feet on all sides. There is no realistic potential for 
congestion in that space.

Moreover, other cities throughout the US are taking even more ambitious steps. Minneapolis, for example, has closed 
18 miles of roadway to cars, for he purpose of pedestrian and bike use. Other places from Denver to Montgomery 
County, Maryland are taking similar steps. These initiatives are being undertaken in safety.

Ultimately, if we're concerned about pedestrian congestion on Memorial Drive, the answer is not to take space away 
from pedestrians—hoping they'll hold up in their apartments for the next month, We need to expand pedestrian space; 
if Memorial Drive is too small (and even if it's not!), let's open up other streets for exclusive or safe pedestrian use, 
creating safe connections throughout our community.

huge share of these individuals—including me—has no access to private open space, like a back yard. As such, we're 
forced to use our city's tiny sidewalks to get any exercise outdoors. The 30 percent of households in our city without 
access to cars—again, including me—can't drive out to some far-out location to take a hike in nature.

The result of our reliance on our six-feet-wide sidewalks—which are inadequate even in normal times—is that we are 
literally being put in danger on a daily basis in the act of trying to get some exercise. This is extremely upsetting and 
scary for my family and me, and it is depressing that the response by the council so far as been to avoid taking action, 
such as by closing Memorial Drive to cars.

Moreover, other cities throughout the US are taking even more ambitious steps. Minneapolis, for example, has 
closed 18 miles of roadway to cars, for the purpose of pedestrian and bike use. Other places 
from Denver to Montgomery County, Maryland are taking similar steps. These initiatives are being undertaken in safety.

Ultimately, if we're concerned about pedestrian congestion on Memorial Drive, the answer is not to take space away 
from pedestrians—hoping they'll hold up in their apartments for the next month, We need to expand pedestrian space; 
if Memorial Drive is too small (and even if it's not!), let's open up other streets for exclusive or safe pedestrian use, 
creating safe connections throughout our community.

The progressive council that I believe you represent will adopt a proactive, bold action and create the safe, convenient 
outdoor environments we need in Cambridge.

Thank you,

Dear councilors,

I am disappointed with the lack of action taken by the city of Cambridge thus far in responding to the desperate need of 
our residents to spend time outside safely. Please close Memorial Drive to cars as soon as possible—and identify other 
streets in the community that can be turned rapidly into either pedestrian streets or slow-speed zones for use by 
pedestrians. As a Cambridge resident, I am limited to getting a breath of fresh air on the narrow sidewalks and walkways 
alongside highways. 

Please look to cities like Minneapolis, that has closed 18 miles of roadway to cars for the purpose of pedestrian and bike 
use, as well as Denver and  Montgomery County, Maryland. These initiatives are being undertaken in safety.

The progressive council that I believe you represent—and for which I voted—will adopt a proactive, bold action and 
create the safe, convenient outdoor environments we need in Cambridge.

Thank you,

Dear Councilors,

I am a resident of Cambridge living on the 4th floor of a multi-family apartment building. I live in a studio apartment with 
my partner and thus have very little room for exercise indoors. My only option is to go for runs and walks outdoors, 
however, when I do so, I often find myself running in the street just to avoid coming within 6’ of my fellow pedestrians. 
It would be immensely helpful to the safety and sanity of Cambridge residents if you were to close Memorial Drive to 
cars and open it to pedestrians to alleviate the current levels of pedestrian congestion on the small sidewalks around 
much of Cambridge. 

I appreciate your support and look forward to what I hope will be a decision to keep residents safe during this 
challenging time.

Thank you,

Subject: Memorial Drive Closure

My name’s Ben Walker, and I’m a Cambridge resident at 30 Norfolk St. concerned that the Council has rejected plans to 
close Memorial Drive to vehicles. I’ve practiced social distancing for about a month now, but when I do leave the house, 
Cambridge’s narrow sidewalks make walking in the street unavoidable. When I try to keep my neighbors safe by 
distancing, I put myself at risk in the road. 

That’s why I support efforts to close Memorial Drive and potentially other streets to cars so that pedestrians have 
access to an amount of space appropriate to social distancing guidelines. 

I appreciate the Council’s concerns about overcrowding – we all want to do what we can. But as it stands, Cambridge’s 
constrained public spaces block pedestrians from practicing social distancing. Closing Memorial Drive at a minimum 
would go a long way to easing this strain.

I appreciate the council’s support. 

Best,

Ben Walker

Subject: Opening Memorial Drive to pedestrians

Dear councilors,

I am very disappointed with the lack of action taken by the City of Cambridge thus far in responding to 
residents' desperate need for more spaces to get outside. Please close Memorial Drive to cars as soon as 
possible—and identify other streets in the community that can be turned rapidly into either pedestrian streets 
or slow-speed zones for use by pedestrians at all times. 

Like many other residents of Cambridge, my husband and I live in an apartment without access to a balcony 
or green space. For our mental and physical well-being we desire to go outside from time to time, while also 
being aware of the dangers this poses to our, and potentially others', health. We want to be responsible 
citizens and keep our community safe. Having more space to do so would make a tremendous difference.

My understanding is that some members of the council are concerned that closing Memorial Drive would 
attract crowds and therefore cause a dangerous situation. However, as a PhD student in city planning at MIT, 
I am confident that this fear is misplaced. The roughly four miles of Memorial Drive from Longfellow Bridge to 
Mount Auburn Hospital is equivalent to roughly 1,000,000 square feet of roadway, or 23 acres—roughly the 
size of Boston Public Garden. There is enough space within that area for more than 2,500 people to stand with 
10 feet on all sides. There is no realistic potential for congestion in that space. 

In addition, you are probably aware that other cities in the US have been taking similar, if not more ambitious 
measures to allow their citizens to be outside while respecting social distancing.

Either way, we will need to consider ways for safe pedestrian mobility over the next months, which will imply 
expanding space for pedestrians for safe passage through our City.

I hope for this council to adopt a proactive, bold action and create the safe, convenient outdoor environments 
we need in Cambridge right now, and in the future.

Subject: Please open streets for pedestrian use

I am a resident of the City of Cambridge (116 Willow Street). I live in a small apartment, so I have relied on 
walks outside to maintain my physical and mental health during this crisis. I never realized how narrow our 
sidewalks were before this call to socially distance -- the only way I can maintain the recommended 6-foot 
distance is by crossing the street when I see other walkers or by walking in the street.

I strongly support all efforts to make our empty streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists so that people are 
able to follow social distancing guidelines while going outside. I ask that the council support of the effort to 
close Memorial Drive.

I'd also like to draw your attention to the possibility of making a lane of Harvard bridge a pedestrian-only lane 
-- right now, there are almost no cars using the bridge, yet because of the tiny sidewalks, it is impossible to 
cross the bridge while maintaining social distancing. Though I realize the bridge is just outside the city's 
jurisdiction, I would appreciate your advocacy for residents who need to cross safely.

Such initiatives are supported in statements by public health experts like Harvard's Marc Lipsitch, who has 
noted that the benefits of outdoor access likely outweigh the risks of spreading covid-19 so long as people 
are able to get outside safely. Your initiative to close Memorial Drive is a wonderful example of an effort that 
will make the right choice the easy choice.

Best,
Madeleine

Dear Cambridge City Council,

I’m writing to say that I’m surprised that the Council has not yet supported measures to close Memorial Drive to cars 
and make it a pedestrian avenue for the duration of coronavirus closures. I’m a resident of Cambridge who lives in a tiny 
apartment with no outside access. So, after a long day of working from home, I tend to go on runs or walks near the 
river for exercise. Unfortunately, the rest of Cambridge has the same idea! I find myself trying to dodge people on my 
runs, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to maintain a six-foot distance! Please make Memorial Drive a pedestrian 
zone until businesses reopen! It’s necessary for the health of our city!

Thanks!
Wishing you health,

Subject: Please close Memorial Drive to cars ASAP

Dear Councilors,

Please close Memorial Drive to cars as soon as possible. I live with my partner in a small one-bedroom at 241 River 
Street, and rely on the paths along the Charles River daily for exercise and fresh air. Especially during daylight hours, the 
paths can get busy with runners, bikers, and walkers. I try to social distance as much as possible, including by walking 
and running off the path, but remain concerned that I'm putting myself and others at risk. I also worry when I see others 
running directly adjacent to Memorial Drive, just feet from speeding cars, in an effort to keep their distance from 
people.

We shouldn't have to take these risks to get the fresh air we need during these stressful times. And we don't need to -
closing Memorial Drive to cars, even just during daylight hours, would go a long way towards helping people get exercise 
safely.

I've heard that some officials are concerned that closing Memorial Drive will lead to block party-type situations. I'm no 
public health expert, but that argument doesn't make sense to me. I'll be using those paths for daily exercise regardless, 
whether or not cars are there. But without cars, I'll be able to more easily keep my distance from others. In short, it 
seems to me that keeping Memorial Drive open exposes people to risk; closing it reduces risk.

Thanks for your consideration of this issue, and for everything you're doing to keep our community safe.

Best,

Nathan Arnosti

Subject: Close streets to cars and open them to pedestrians!

Hello city council, 

I want to voice my support for the idea of closing streets to cars, which would open them up for pedestrian use. I am a 
Cambridge resident, and I am incredibly frustrated by the urban design of the city’s open spaces, which currently 
prevents adequate social distancing. In my neighborhood, many sidewalks around only 4 feet wide, forcing people into 
the street when they in counter other pedestrians. Parks like Fresh Pond and the Charles River paths near Harvard are 
also completely unsuited for the volume of people using them, given social distancing requirements. Allowing residents 
to safely use streets without having to compete with cars, which seem to be driving even faster than usual given the 
absence of ordinary traffic, would be the best outcome for everyone. 

I live in an apartment, so I don’t have a private backyard to escape to when I need to get outside. Public spaces are my 
only option, and I feel increasingly uncomfortable using them given the volume of other people trying to do the same 
thing. Please consider opening not only all of Memorial Drive, but also other streets across the city to maximize the 
amount of open space that residents can safely access. Please keep in mind that if you don’t expand city’s portfolio of 
open space, your residents will continue to pack into the only areas currently available, which will be to the detriment of 
Cambridge’s public health. I hope that the city understands the scale of this challenge, as well as the importance of 
providing equitable access to safe open space at this time.

I appreciate your support, and your on-going efforts to guide this city through this challenging time. 

Best regards,

Subject: Street Closures to Cars

I live in an apartment in Cambridge at 21 Jefferson St. I wanted to express my support for closing some streets like 
Memorial Drive to cars. I would like to be able to safely get out in a socially distant way during this crisis.

Many other cities have been closing streets to cars including Minneapolis, Denver, Oakland, Louisville, Portland, and 
many more.

It would also be great if more roads could be closed to through-traffic giving people the ability to socially distance in 
more areas.

Thank you so much,
Sean.

Subject: Memorial Drive plan

Dear councilors,

I am a 3-year resident of Cambridge. I live at 75 Hancock St. #3 (02139) and plan on living here for 
many years. Mine is a tiny apartment with no outdoor space. Daily walks are my way of getting in 
some exercise and also keeping my spirits up.

Taking these walks have become like games of pac-man. Sidewalks are so narrow that I'm forced to 
switch sidewalks all the time or walk in the middle of the street (dangerous both to myself and to 
cars!) so as to maintain social distancing.

I STRONGLY support the effort to close Memorial Drive so that pedestrians like me can walk 
comfortably and at a safe distance from each other. Whenever I go to Memorial Drive now, the grass 
is crowded. If we have the entire space, we can all maintain a safe distance.

I would also love it if other streets were closed. It also makes it easier to bike, which is a safe social 
distancing/exercise activity.

Thank you for considering those of us who have no access to outdoor space, no gardens, no 
balconies--and who want to keep ourselves and those around us safe but are almost forced to 
inadvertently break them due to the way Cambridge is built.

At this point, given that this will continue for at least a month and possibly much longer, the 
sustainable thing to do is to close the streets to cars so that we can get fresh air and exercise and still 
follow the rules that keep us all safe.

I have noticed with pleasure how respectful everyone around Central/Harvard has been of the rules 
(wearing masks, trying to keep a distance), so I know that this change would be welcomed and that 
the new guidelines would be respected.

I appreciate your support!

Best,

Dear Councilors,

In the interest of providing more space for people to get outside during the pandemic, please close Memorial Drive to 
cars —and identify other streets in the community that can be turned into pedestrian streets or slow-speed zones for 
use by pedestrians.

Other cities are taking similar steps. Minneapolis, for example, has closed 18 miles of roadway to cars, for the purpose of 
pedestrian and bike use. Other places from Denver to Montgomery County, Maryland are taking these types of steps 
also.

These are very difficult times so let's join other cities in making our resource of space available.

Subject: Streets for Pedestrians

Dear councilors,

In the interest of providing adequate open space for residents during the pandemic, please close Memorial Drive to cars 
as soon as possible, and quickly work towards identifying other streets that can be used as pedestrian zones around the 
clock.

As a longtime Cambridge resident, I have been running along the river for close to fifteen years. As far as I can 
remember, the path along Mem Drive has never been as consistently busy as I've seen it the past few weeks. This has 
resulted in crowded sidewalks and paths, with people either passing within inches of each other on the packed, narrow 
pavement, or swerving into vehicular traffic in order to maintain social distance. As it stands, residents attending to their
mental and physical health through exercise or walking to conduct necessary errands are being forced to choose 
between the threat of exposure to COVID-19 or the risk of being hit by a car. This has been challenging for me and my 
family members, all of whom have been exercising outside and traveling by foot in recent weeks and plan to continue to 
do so moving forward.

Please open up Memorial Drive -- and other streets, if possible -- for exclusive or safe pedestrian use. I have observed a 
clear, desperate need for more safe outdoor space, and appreciate any efforts you may take in order to secure such 
space for city residents.

Thank you, and stay well!

Subject: Close Memorial Drive

Dear Councilors, 

I would like to request you to please close Memorial Drive to cars as soon as possible—and identify other 
streets in the community that can be turned rapidly into either pedestrian streets or slow-speed zones for use 
by pedestrians at all times.

As a resident of Cambridge, it is stunning to me that the council has not taken more proactive action on this 
issue, given our population. According to the Census, 85 percent of our city's population lives in multi-unit 
structures. A huge share of these individuals—including me—has no access to private open space, like a back 
yard. As such, we're forced to use our city's tiny sidewalks to get any exercise outdoors. The 30 percent of 
households in our city without access to cars—again, including me—can't drive out to some far-out location to 
take a hike in nature.

The result of our reliance on our six-feet-wide sidewalks—which are inadequate even in normal times—is that 
we are literally being put in danger on a daily basis in the act of trying to get some exercise. This is extremely 
upsetting and scary for my family and me, and it is depressing that the response by the council so far as been 
to avoid taking action, such as by closing Memorial Drive to cars.

My understanding is that some members of the council are concerned that closing Memorial Drive would 
attract crowds and therefore cause a dangerous situation. However, there is enough space within that area for 
more than 2,500 people to stand with 10 feet on all sides. There is no realistic potential for congestion in that 
space.

Moreover, other cities throughout the US are taking even more ambitious steps. Minneapolis, for example, 
has closed 18 miles of roadway to cars, for the purpose of pedestrian and bike use. Other places 
from Denver to Montgomery County, Maryland are taking similar steps. These initiatives are being undertaken 
in safety.

Ultimately, if we're concerned about pedestrian congestion on Memorial Drive, the answer is not to take 
space away from pedestrians—hoping they'll hold up in their apartments for the next month. We need to

Subject: Closing streets for pedestrians and cyclists

Dear City Council,

I am following up on my earlier email about my request to close portions of some streets to allow more space for 
residents to walk, bike, and jog at a safe social distance. Since my first email, Brookline has adopted some measures and 
the DCR has also moved to close portions of roadways to allow more space for safe non-vehicle travel or exercise.

This is a public health, mental health, and equity issue. Many residents need to walk to do essential errands for 
themselves or others. Many do not have easy or safe access to outdoor space where they live. Some Cambridge 
neighborhoods have wide sidewalks and parks and sufficient space for those who live nearby to move through safely; 
other areas of Cambridge do not allow those same health benefits. By closing some streets, we offer equitable access to 
outdoor safe spaces for errands, dog walking, exercise, and fresh air.

Here is a relevant article from The Guardian about this issue. I will add that I too have noted the increased speeding by 
cars on my street. This makes me fearful for the safety of my neighbors who are walking their dogs, the families out 
scootering or biking together, or my daughters who are jogging daily. 

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/world-cities-turn-their-streets-over-to-walkers-and-
cyclists?CMP=share_btn_link

Thank you for your consideration. I appreciate all that the city is doing in these stressful times. I consider myself 
fortunate to live in a community that is compassionate, inclusive, and forward-thinking.

Sincerely,
Leslie Bliss

Dear city council,

I urge you to close streets—or even just some car lanes—to enable Cambridge residents to walk or jog with considerably 
less risk of contagion. All that's needed are some cheap barriers and signs.

Right now, we pedestrians swerve into lanes of traffic to avoid getting close to other pedestrians, making our walks 
more stressful and dangerous than they need to be. Closing some streets to automobile traffic would enable us to 
stretch our legs and to burn off stress safely. There are so many idle acres of road dedicated to very little car traffic that I 
am confident the resulting density of pedestrians would be sparse enough that it would be safe — and certainly safer 
than the status quo of crowded sidewalks and people swerving into streets.

Please act now to avoid further contagion and to make Cambridge healthier.

Thank you,

Subject: Opening Memorial Drive to pedestrians

Dear councilors,

I am disappointed by the lack of action taken by the city of Cambridge in providing more spaces for residents to go outside 
and keep safe and distant from each other. I am urging you to please support the effort to close Memorial Drive (and 
hopefully other streets too) to cars so that pedestrians and runners like myself can have access to safe open public 
spaces that are not crowded.

My name is Daniela Chong and I live at 24 Fayette St. Apt. 2, Cambridge. I live in a small apartment with four other 
people and the current health crisis and situation is very stressful for all of us. I am trying to go outside for runs and walks 
but I am seeing more and more people going out now that the weather is getting better, many of whom do not keep any 
distance while walking, running or biking.

According to this study, in order to reduce infections, people walking, running or slow biking, and fast biking in the same 
direction should be at least 5, 10, and 20 meters apart respectively. Every time I have been outside I have seen that 
people are not taking distance, mainly because the paths and sidewalks are too narrow and they are getting crowded. 
Moreover, I have recently seen more people walking and running on the bike lanes, which also presents a safety risk.

Now, more than ever, we need large open public spaces so pedestrians can go outside and keep their mental and 
physical health. Please support opening Memorial Drive to pedestrians.

Thank you in advance for your support,

Subject: Closing vehicular travel on Memorial Dr

Dear City Council,

I am a resident in East Cambridge living on Otis St and would encourage City Council to pass the measure to open 
Memorial Dr to pedestrian travel (prohibit vehicular travel). The sidewalks are by no means wide enough to pass others 
and stay socially distant. On my occasional walks, I usually walk down Otis St, which is often empty so I walk in the 
middle of the street, and down the Riverwalk along the Charles. There are often other people traveling along this path, 
and trying to maintain proper distance is difficult without walking into the street. This is not possible as vehicles still 
drive on Memorial Dr, preventing people from maintaining the appropriate distance recommended by the CDC and the 
WHO. As someone who lives with an MGH healthcare worker, I try to maintain as much distance as possible on the few 
occasions I leave my apartment. I would appreciate if City Council pass the measure to prohibit vehicular traffic on 
Memorial Dr during the duration of the pandemic. Streets are light enough that redirecting traffic will not cause jams on 
minor roads. While there is a concern that this measure might induce activity in these areas, the desire to go outside and 
get fresh air will increase regardless of this policy as people remain cooped up in their homes and as the weather warms 
up. So City Council can either allow people to distance themselves or will continue to pack residents in tights spaces and 
increase our chances of spreading the virus.

Subject: Street Closure

Honorable Council,

Regarding the  initiative on street closings: We at Riverbend Park had the same idea and asked the DCR to do 
so in a letter about a month ago. It is unfortunate that the council voted against it.
Without the additional space, people will crowd other open spaces. Already there is not enough space to go 
outside. The right thing to do, would be to post rules at all places where you have car barriers installed and 
have occasionally enforce them.
The quarantine will not succeed if people cannot even go outside.

Please reconsider it.

Franziska Amacher

Dear Councilors,

I am a resident at 48 JFK Street and a business owner at 17 Story Street. I have lived in 
Cambridge since 1974. I would like to express my strong support for Policy Order (POR) 
2020 # 85 regarding the repurposing of the War Memorial facility. I urge you to explore 
how to secure support, including the use of dormitories, from our three major non-profit 
universities; Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Lesley 
University to house homeless populations during the COVID-19 emergency.

Thank you.

Subject: Policy Order 2020 #85

To the Council,

I am writing to strongly urge you to vote in support of Policy Order #85 (Quinton Zondervan and Jivan Sobrinho-
Wheeler, Sponsors). The current plan to provide unhoused individuals shelter during the COVID-19 crisis in the War 
Memorial facilities is not safe. Specifically, because it is not possible for people to socially distance within this facility, 
using it as a shelter would foster the spread of disease among some of our city’s most vulnerable residents. The order 
requests that the City Manager “work with Harvard, MIT, Lesley and local hotel operators to procure sufficient rooms to 
individually house people who lack access to a safe, transmission-free place to shelter.” This is the safest, most viable, 
and humane option and similar to the paths that other cities such as Boston and San Francisco have taken. I urge you to 
vote for this order.

Sincerely,
Louise Parker

On April 7, 2020, Governor Charlie Baker issued an order with stricter guidelines for

WHEREAS:  While the order institutes several protections for patrons, there is little emphasis placed

Coronavirus, and a Market Basket employee in Salem has died after contracting 
Coronavirus, illustrating just how dire this situation has become for our grocery store 
and other front line employees; and 
 
Instituting stricter public health guidelines in essential frontline businesses, such as 
food markets, pharmacies, grocery stores and others located in Cambridge with an 
emphasis on regulations that will protect and support workers, such as  

•  Requiring that essential frontline businesses provide masks, gloves, and hand 

sanitizer to employees for every shift worked 

•  Mandating more frequent store and equipment sterilizations 
•  Requiring larger protective plexiglass barriers for cashiers allowing for 

maximal protection when within the recommended 6' distance  

•  Requiring customers wear masks or other face coverings while in-store 
•  Providing signage educating customers on acceptable types of face coverings 

to be worn in-store  

•  Creating pick up only locations 
•  Rerouting all cash transactions to self-service kiosks 
•  Shutting down a location where an essential frontline employee has tested 

positive for COVID-19 until the site is inspected by relevant City staff, and 
creating a clearly outlined sanitization program in these cases prior to opening 
•  Encouraging grocery stores and other frontline essential frontline businesses to 

give their workers hazard pay  

and others that will help ensure these employees are able to safely perform their crucial 
work, safeguard the health of these workers and their families, and save lives; now

WHEREAS:  Harvard University recently extended the tenure clocks for tenure track faculty by one 
year, acknowledging the gravity of the impact of COVID-19 on all forms of academic 
research; and 
 
PhD students face the same effects on research as faculty, being unable to enter 
laboratories, libraries, and field sites, being unable to work collaboratively, and moving 
to teach students online while taking care of themselves and their families. In addition, 
crucial conferences for presenting research have been cancelled while universities have 
begun announcing “hiring freezes,” greatly endangering the ability of PhD’s to 
produce meaningful research and find employment; and

graduate students as they courageously stand up for their needs in a time of crisis; and 
be it further 
 
That the City of Cambridge echoes the call on Dean Dench, Dean Boodram, and Dean 
Aloise to expediently agree to the bridge-funding proposal as put forth by graduate

WHEREAS: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has expanded the definition of frontline care workers to 
include grocery and pharmacy clerks, delivery drivers, public works teams, a variety of 
service-industry and custodial workers, in addition to first responders, nurses, doctors, 
and medical personnel who face daily risks in order to provide essential services; and 
  
The City of Cambridge is deeply appreciative of the daily sacrifice of these essential 
workers who are keeping our community safe, clean, supplied, and healthy during this 
pandemic; and  
  
Local and national legislators continue to work to advocate for expansion of funds to 
more appropriately support these frontline workers; and 
 
Until such a time as we are able to tangibly recognize these workers, the City of 
Cambridge wishes to recognize them symbolically, as has been done in neighboring 
communities; and 
 
In April 2019, the City Council approved the City Manager’s request to install 
permanent LED lights at City Hall to be able to light the building when merited; now 
therefore be it

The city is preparing to open an emergency shelter at the War Memorial Recreation 
Center and Fieldhouse complex on Cambridge Street; and 
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that preliminary studies have shown 
pre-symptomatic transmission by individuals up to several days prior to the onset of 
symptoms, and that transmission by truly asymptomatic individuals is possible; and 
 
As of April 8, 2020, The Johns Hopkins ABX Guide reports that infected individuals 
who aren’t yet displaying symptoms may transmit 25-50% of total infections; and 
 
Recent testing of unhoused individuals in Boston revealed that several hundred 
individuals tested positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus even though they were not 
exhibiting symptoms at the time the test was taken; and 
 
It was explained during discussion at the March 30, 2020 City Council meeting that 
Cambridge’s emergency shelter does not intend to test clients during intake except for 
those who are visibly displaying symptoms; and 
 
As of April 9, 2020, the council had not yet received enough information about day to 
day proceedings at the shelter, including hygiene, foodservice, and general downtime, 
to be confident in the ability of the facility to operate without significant pre-
symptomatic transmission between clients; and 
 
Thousands of dormitory rooms and hotel rooms are now vacant in our city and 
available for proper isolation for unhoused individuals and anyone else who needs to 
be isolated from family members or roommates to avoid spreading or contracting 
COVID-19; and 
 
Tufts University has been preparing their COVID-19 response for weeks and has 
segmented their campus into separate zones for the four different types of populations 
being housed; and 
 
Cities including San Francisco have changed course to house homeless residents in 
hotels rooms rather than large, temporary, congregate settings because of the potential 
health risks; and

space; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to repurpose the War Memorial 
facility into only a COVID-19 testing and temporary quarantine site for unhoused 
individuals awaiting their test results; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with Harvard, MIT, Lesley 
and local hotel operators to procure sufficient rooms to individually house people who 
lack access to a safe, transmission-free place to shelter; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to put forward any necessary 
appropriations to fund this level of response to the COVID-19 pandemic; and be it

WHEREAS: 

According to the Cambridge License Commission, there are approximately 222 on-
premise alcohol consumption establishments in Cambridge that serve food, and 
approximately 212 establishments that just serve only food without alcohol – this 
number does not include restaurants in hotels licensed through the hotel license or 
“take-out only” businesses, as take-out only are permitted by Inspectional Services 
Department – and Cambridge also has hotels that serve alcohol, along with 15 hotels 
that do not serve alcohol; and 
 

Packet Pg. 141

WHEREAS: 

Given the large number of restaurants and the amount of time it will take the City’s 

5.9

 

 

 

Investigative team from the License Commission to inspect each 
establishment prior to re-opening, it would be prudent for the City to 
streamline the re-opening process this year due to the extraordinary 
situation impacting our economy and to immediately begin 
consideration of the following items: 

•  Providing a licensed established restaurant does not have any 
pending violations and can show proof of an up-to-date Pest 
Control Report, that business’s license to operate should be made 
valid until such time as the city can conduct an inspection. 
 

•  The City should waive patio applications and fees for all 

restaurants with patios and roof decks who had permits in 2019, 
providing the square footage, location, and configuration remains 
the same, and if payment for this permit has already been paid in 
2020, allow a credit for 2021. 

•  The City should waive the second payment of the Liquor License 
fee which is coming up circa June 2020, and if a business has 
already paid in full for 2020, allow them a credit for the first half 
of 2021. 

•  As a result of public health considerations and concerns, post 
pandemic – if restaurant capacity is to be reduced, allow the 
establishment to change its opening and/or closing hours by 
submitting a written notification to the License Commission in 
advance of a hearing, if requested by the License Commission; 
now therefore be it  

 
ORDERED: 

 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the appropriate City 
staff to determine the feasibility of immediately enacting the above-mentioned 
recommendations, and to report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely

VICE MAYOR MALLON 
MAYOR SIDDIQUI 
 
WHEREAS: 

Partners Healthcare recently announced a partnership between Mass General and 
Brigham Hospitals with Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Cambridge to act as a “step 
down” facility for patients recovering from the Coronavirus; and 
 
It is likely that patients in the step down facility at Spaulding Rehabilitation Center 
may relapse and will need to return to a hospital for more intensive medical care; and 
 
Cambridge Hospital, a Safety Net Hospital which ensures there are no barriers to care 
and will be the closest hospital for these relapsed patients; and 
 
Cambridge Hospital is additionally in need of step down beds for recovering patients 
as well, Partners Healthcare should be offering the same collaboration and resources 
afforded to Mass General and Brigham hospitals; and 
 
Given the possibility that Cambridge Hospital will be asked to take on previously 
discharged patients who have relapsed and the need for additional step down beds; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager work with the Public Health Department, the Cambridge Health 
Department and our State Delegation to report back on how Partners Healthcare and 
Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital are sharing resources with the Cambridge Health 
Alliance for the health and safety of CHA patients and Cambridge residents; and be it 
further 
 
The City Manager report back by Monday, April 27th.

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui 
Cambridge City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Avenue 
Cambridge, MA  02139 
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui, 
 
Please find enclosed the 2019 Annual Report of the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA), which 
summarizes the CRA’s program activities and unaudited financial position in 2019.  The report was approved by 
the CRA Board at their annual meeting on February 12, 2020.  Per the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Urban 
Renewal Regulations 760 CMR 12.00, the CRA is providing a copy of its Annual Report to the City Council and 
the City Manager for review.  This report and the annual reports from previous years can be found on the CRA 
webpage: www.CambridgeRedevelopment.org/Annual-Reports.  
 
In 2019, the CRA continued to broaden its scope of work beyond Kendall Square with a number of new initiatives.  
The most significant new project was the purchase of the property at 93-99 Bishop Allen Drive, known as 
Nonprofit Row.  The CRA has also engaged in a long-term technical planning effort to stabilize the Margaret 
Fuller Neighborhood House.  Additionally, the CRA expanded its Forward Fund grant program to provide more 
financial assistance to infrastructure projects of nonprofits that directly service the City’s most pressing community 
needs.  The CRA has helped the formation of the Foundry Consortium nonprofit, the future operator of the 
Foundry building, and has assisted the City with the final design process for the building’s redevelopment.   
 
Within the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project (KSURP), the CRA, in partnership with Boston Properties and 
TSNE Missionworks, opened a workforce development and educational shared workspace, called The Link.  New 
commercial development in KSURP included the completion of Akamai’s world headquarters at 145 Broadway 
and the final design of 325 Main Street that provides additional office space for Google’s Cambridge campus.  
325 Main Street will deliver a fully redesigned roof garden with a significant public connection from the Kendall 
Plaza utilizing a rebuilt MBTA headhouse as a stepping stone up to the new public park.  
 
The CRA appreciates that the City Council is likely prioritizing its energy on policies and programmatic responses 
to the COVID-19 emergency at this time, but we wanted to follow through with the delivery of this report in 
compliance with the state’s regulations.  Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions about the 
CRA projects moving forward.   
 
Sincerely,

Introduction

The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority 
broadened the scope of its work beyond the 
Kendall Square area in 2019.  Most significantly, 
the CRA negotiated the purchase of the 
property at 93-99 Bishop Allen Drive, known as 
Nonprofit Row, with the objective of preserving 
and enhancing the building’s use as a center for 
community service nonprofits in Central Square.  
The CRA reinforced its relationship with the 
Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House (MFNH) 
by providing short-term operational assistance 
and engaging in a long-term technical planning 
effort to stabilize the MFNH operations, 
improve its assets, and provide additional 
housing opportunities in the neighborhood.  
Additionally, the Forward Fund was expanded 
to provide deeper grant offerings to target key 
community infrastructure projects by helping 

nonprofits invest in facilities that directly service 
the City’s most pressing community needs.

The Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project 
(KSURP) area also reached some key milestones 
in the past year.  The Link, a co-working space 
focused on workforce development and 
education, opened at 255 Main Street. Boston 
Properties (BXP) completed the construction 
of a new commercial building at 145 Broadway 
to serve as the world headquarters for Akamai.  
This project includes significant public realm 
improvements to the streetscape around the 
building.  This streetscape design will continue 
throughout the KSURP area. Staff worked closely 
with the City and BXP’s design team to finalize 
those designs.  The CRA and the Cambridge 
Community Development Department approved 

the design of a new commercial building at 325 
Main Street that will provide additional office 
space for Google’s Cambridge campus.  This 
project will deliver a fully redesigned roof garden 
with a significant public connection from the 
Kendall Plaza utilizing a rebuilt MBTA headhouse 
as a stepping stone up to the new public park.  

Finally, the Foundry Project advanced 
significantly in terms of both the physical 
redevelopment of the building and 
the building’s programmatic operation 
infrastructure.  The CRA helped the Foundry 
Consortium evolve to become a formal nonprofit 
while the City facilitated the advancement of 
the design and the start of enabling work for the 
construction site.

Kendall Square Development & Planning

Development
The CRA continued to oversee the development 
planning and design review of Kendall Square's 
Urban Renewal Project Area (KSURP), guided 
by the Infill Development Concept Plan (IDCP) 
approved in 2017 and amended in December of 
2018. 

145 Broadway

The CRA oversaw the completion of Boston 
Properties' 145 Broadway project, the first 
commercial building approved as part of the 
MXD Infill Development Concept Plan. The 
building, with over 400,000 SF of office space 
is the new home of Akamai Technologies' 
global headquarters. To celebrate the building's 
opening, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held 

8

on November 1st, with Governor Charlie Baker, 
Senator Ed Markey, CRA Board, staff and other 
political officials.

88 Ames - Proto

The 145 Broadway project also provided public 
realm street and landscaping improvements. The 
project included an improved public pedestrian 
path on the north side of 145 Broadway, 
connecting Galileo Way and the West Service 
Drive. An expanded streetscape along Galileo 
Way and Broadway, includes a new raised cycle 
track and bus stop for the EZRide buses.

Ground floor retail space will help activate the 
Galileo Way and Broadway corner streetscape. 
Sweetgreens, a national salad chain, and 
CorePower Yoga, with classes throughout the 
day, will open in 2020. 

The Proto residential building has been 
operational since 2018 and is home to the first 
residents of the Kendall Square MXD District. 
The building has achieved nearly full occupancy 
of its 280 units, with 36 units being leased at 
below-market rates. 

In 2019, Boston Properties finished the 
remaining public realm improvements for Proto. 
Ames Street's reconstruction is now complete, 
including a two-way cycle track on the east side 
of Ames, a new floating bus stop, a resignaled 
intersection at Ames and Broadway, as well as  
final landscaping.

325 Main Street

The IDCP's Phase II commercial building, located 
at 325 Main Street, was approved by the CRA 
and the Planning Board on March 20, 2019. 
The building will be 16 stories and will deliver 
approximately 340,000 SF of office space, to be 
leased to Google, and 42,000 SF of  retail space 
on the first and second floors.

The project will provide a number of significant 
public realm investments and community 
amenities. Improvements include enhanced 
connectivity from Main Street and Kendall Plaza 
to the Roof Garden by a new public elevator, 
and a staircase from Main Street, via a public 
second level terrace, to the Roof Garden. The 
Roof Garden will become more visible and 
accessible. The improvements also create 
additional outdoor open space with seating 

and access to second floor retail tenants. The 
redesign of the Kendall Plaza MBTA Headhouse is 
currently under review and should be completed 
by the summer of 2020. The building will have 
a new double-height public indoor lobby to 
connect the 325 and 355 Main Street buildings, 
and provides indoor seating and pedestrian 
connection from Main Street to Pioneer Way and 
the Roof Garden. 

Construction of 325 Main Street began in the fall 
of 2019 with the demolition and abatement of 
Three Cambridge Center.  Vertical construction is 
expected to be underway by the first quarter of 
2020, and the building will be complete by the 
fall of 2022.

Transportation 
Binney/Broadway/Galileo Streetscape Design

This past year, Boston Properties (BXP) with 
consultants Vanasse Hangen Brustlin (VHB) 
and Sasaki Associates, refined the CRA's 25% 
Alta Streetscape Designs to 100% construction 
documents for their portion of the streetscape 
project, which includes Binney Street from the 
Sixth Street intersection west via Galileo Way 
to Main Street and part of Broadway. The CRA 
and city departments have worked closely with 
BXP as the streetscape designs have advanced, 
and will continue to do so as elements of the 
streetscape's landscaping, bicycle and utility 
infrastructure are refined. Construction of the 
streetscape improvements will begin in the 
spring of 2020. 

Annual Transportation Report

The CRA has worked with VHB to develop 
a multi-modal transportation data report 

10

for Kendall Square, required as part of the 
KSURP's Environmental Impact Report (EIR) 
commitments. The project will include a 
written report, as well as an interactive website. 
Multi-modal field data was collected at the 
end of September, and the next report will be 
published in the spring of 2020 utilizing five 
years of data.

Transport Kendall

Transport Kendall discusses key transit 
improvement recommendations provided by 
the City's Kendall Square Mobility Task Force. 
The publication highlights infrastructure needs 
of Kendall Square, and recommends ongoing 
planning for the Grand Junction Corridor, 
MBTA, Red Line upgrades, and expansion of 
MBTA and EZRide bus routes. The report was 
published in booklet and website form, and was 
a collaboration facilitated by the CRA, with the 

City, the Kendall Square Association, MIT and 
numerous local companies who sponsored the 
effort.

Kendall Square Transit Enhancement Program

The Kendall Square Transit Enhancement 
Program (KSTEP), is a mitigation component 
of the KSURP 2015 EIR. The fund will pay for 
programs that improve transit capacity, and 
will be guided by the initiatives recommended 
by the Kendall Square Mobility Task Force and 
Transport Kendall. 

In 2019 the CRA finalized the Fund's governance 
structure with the Working Group, comprised of 
the CRA, City of Cambridge, MassDOT, the MBTA 
and Boston Properties, to initiate the planning 
for funding proposal ideas. The first KSTEP 
projects will be implemented in 2020.

Open Space
The CRA continued its efforts to enhance and 
activate the public spaces in Kendall Square, and 
to collaborate with developers, the community, 
and the City to plan for infrastructure and 
landscape improvements.

Ames Place Open Space

Over the past year, the CRA worked closely with 
landscape architects, Mikyoung Kim Designs 
(MYKD) and Nitsch Engineering to undertake a 
collaborative landscape redesign for the open 
space off Ames Place, including Danny Lewin 
Park and the Broad Pocket Park. MYKD and 
Nitsch completed easement and utility surveys. 
The CRA met with individual stakeholders and 
held a community meeting to discuss design 
ideas. Preliminary designs were underway 
by the fall and will be refined and finalized in 
stakeholder working group discussions in 2020.

Galaxy Park 

Grand Junction 

The CRA activated Galaxy Park. In April, the CRA 
partnered with Flexetail and Babson College to 
host a one-week pop-up art gallery. The Flexetail 
mobile retail unit was transformed into an art 
gallery parked in Galaxy Park. Great Arts Studio 
(GAS), a local non-profit from Lynn, MA provided 
artwork and small sculptures for sale. 

The shared Grand Junction multi-use path 
continued to be well used by cyclists and 
pedestrians. The park’s plantings have flourished, 
with the exception of the Karl Foerster grass, 
which succumbed to a fungus caused by an 
exceptionally wet spring. The grasses will be 
replaced with a hardier species in 2020.  

In June, the Looking Glass, an art sculpture 
designed by students from Innovators For 
Purpose (iFp), was installed on Galaxy Park. 
The students celebrated the installation with a 
ribbon cutting ceremony. The CRA also initiated 
a design effort to increase access to the eastern 
portion of the park while updating some 
landscaping.

Third & Binney

The CRA improved the Third & Binney civic space 
landscaping with the planting of seven locust 
trees. The seasonal Food Truck program kicked 
off its fourth consecutive year in March. The 
program drew over 25,000 visitors to the site to 
sample foods ranging from vegan Jamaican to 
Vietnamese. This season the CRA also hosted 
two beer garden events that filled the civic 
space with local employees and neighbors in the 
evening.

93-99 Bishop Allen Drive

In the fall of 2019, the CRA purchased the 
property at 93-99 Bishop Allen Drive in order 
to preserve affordable, centrally located, office 
space for nonprofit operations and services. 
Enroot (formerly Cambridge Community 
Services) owned and operated the building since 
1965. Today, the building is home to 11 nonprofit 
agencies that provide affordable summer camp, 
improve math literacy and other academic skills, 
engage youth with chronic illnesses in the arts, 
bolster the City’s nonprofit and small business 
sectors, and provide counseling to survivors of 
sexual violence. 

The building provides a uniquely important 
location for the organizations operating there, 
including proximity to public transportation 
and a range of other services in Central Square. 
It is within walking distance for many families 
accessing the building's services, provides 
anonymity and a homey and welcoming 
atmosphere due to its historic design.

The CRA became involved upon a request from 
Cambridge Community Foundation (CCF), a 
tenant in the building, to help preserve the 
property’s community use.   The CRA signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with CCF and 
spent many months considering a range of 
options before making an offer.  

The CRA’s interest in the property resulted in 
significant public interest. CCF, the building’s 
other nonprofit tenants, and local residents 
publicly advocated for a sale of the property

to the CRA. Over 500 people signed an online 
petition. Seven city councilors wrote letters of 
support for the CRA offer. The CRA entered into a 
purchase and sale agreement with Enroot in May 
2019 and closed on the property in October. The 
CRA's purchase was financed with tax-exempt 
bonds issued by the Cambridge Trust Company 
and Mass Development.

During 2020-2021, the CRA will oversee 
approximately $2 million in improvements to 
the 1855 converted rowhouse building in order 
to enhance safety and accessibility, maximize 
use of space, and make the property feel more 
welcoming.  The project will utilize architectural 
services from Silverman Trykowski Associates 
whose design effort will include significant input 
from the building’s nonprofit tenants.

Long term plans focus on converting the 
building into a model nonprofit center, a 
growing movement that allows nonprofits to 
benefit from economies of scale and shared 
space in order to lower costs and gain valuable 
connections with other agencies. A nonprofit 
center would provide benefits to tenants within 
the building, but also to other Cambridge-based 
nonprofit agencies. 

Regardless of future building plans, the CRA 
will continue to provide affordable, effective 
space for community-serving nonprofits on the 
site. This acquisition is one element of the CRA’s 
ongoing efforts to support the capacity of local 
nonprofit agencies to provide vital services that 
strengthen and enhance the local community.

Workforce Development - The Link

2019 saw the launch of The Link, a 17,000 
square foot facility at 255 Main Street, created 
through a partnership of the CRA, Boston 
Properties, and TSNE MissionWorks, which 
operates the space. The Link offers 40 coworking 
spaces for nonprofit technical education, 
career development programs and related 
services, with classrooms and event facilities 
accommodating up to 120 people.
 
The requirement for below market office space 
in Kendall Square - smaller spaces that can 
be rented at lower rents than are typical - is 
written into the MXD IDCP and KSURP. Boston 
Properties’ permit to build a new office building 
for Akamai at 145 Broadway was conditional 
on providing this space. Kendall Square is 
the hub of the region’s innovation economy 
and home to a wide range of local start-ups 

14

and large-scale international companies. As 
Cambridge has continued to attract more 
employers to the area, Boston Properties and the 
CRA have made a commitment to go beyond 
their KSURP requirements. They created the 
The Link to connect residents to innovation-
focused workforce development and economic 
opportunities generated in Kendall Square and 
beyond. The Link seeks to provide a vital new 
talent pipeline for employers. During 2019, 
The Link signed leases with: A-T Children’s 
Project, Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition, CDA 
Collaborative, Mass BioEd, Coalition of Schools 
Educating Boys of Color (COSEBOC), Green Soul 
Organics, Open Ag, Per Scholas and SkillWorks/
Tech Talent Exchange. Additionally, nearly 
45 nonprofits held board or staff meetings, 
conferences, trainings, strategic planning 
sessions, or parties at The Link.

The Foundry

2019 saw many great advances in the evolution 
of the Foundry project. The City of Cambridge, 
working with Cambridge Seven Architects, 
completed design development drawings for 
the building. The building design includes a 
flexible-use performance space, maker spaces 
for woodworking, jewelry-making, fabric arts 
and digital fabrication; artist work spaces; a 
dance and yoga room; a demonstration kitchen; 
community hall; market rate and reduced rate 
office space and a range of multi-purpose 
meeting rooms. 

Through close collaboration and approval from 
the Cambridge Historical Commission, the 
Foundry will undergo extensive restoration of 
the building's historic brick masonry, windows, 
skylights, and other original details. To contrast 
with the historic features, the building will have 

a new addition with a modern metal finish and 
a contemporary entryway on Rogers Street.  
Adjacent to the building is an exterior courtyard 
that can accommodate a range of programming. 

As the building design has taken form, the 
Foundry Consortium has done the same. During 
2019 the grassroots Foundry Consortium directly 
engaged over 400 Cambridge residents through 
community meetings, festivals, and a survey 
conducted online and in person with individuals 
and small groups.  The CRA supported these 
efforts by helping to draft the survey and 
distributing it at the Cambridge River Arts 
Festival and other events. Survey highlights 
showed that a top priority for residents is for 
the Foundry to feel welcoming and inclusive.  
Residents also showed a strong interest in 
cooking, socializing, teaching and learning 

new job skills, creating and displaying art, and 
using maker spaces, among other interests. As 
building uses have been refined, programming 
has remained closely in line with the concepts 
created by the CRA through its community 
engagement process.

In the fall of 2019, the grassroots group 
transitioned into an incorporated organization 
with an active 8-person Board of Directors and 
approved bylaws. As the Board awaits approval 
of their 501(c)(3) status from the IRS, they are 
moving forward with plans to hire the Foundry’s 
first executive director. The CRA provided 
technical and administrative support to draft the 
bylaws, recruit board members, educate the new 
board about the structure and financial model 
for the Foundry, and is in the process to secure a 
firm for the executive director search.

Community Strength & Stability Efforts
In 2019, the CRA expanded its work to fill 
gaps in infrastructure in order to ensure the 
sustainability and growth of affordable housing, 
social services, and cultural programs. This work 
is evident in the CRA’s purchase of the property 
at 93-99 Bishop Allen Drive, in the partnership 
with the Margaret Fuller Neighborhood 
House to improve and redevelop their site, in 
loans to a Just-A-Start project for open space 
improvements, and capital grants made by the 
Forward Fund.  Such programs enhance quality 
of life while addressing housing instability, 
public health, youth development, and 
workforce development. 

The City of Cambridge benefits from robust 
government, nonprofit, and commercial sectors.  
However, the extreme rise in real estate costs 
threatens the effectiveness and viability of social 

16

services agencies, small businesses, and cultural 
organizations which provide essential supports 
and enhance quality of life citywide.

In recognition of the need to strengthen and 
sustain these essential supports, the CRA staff 
started drafting a Community Strength and 
Stability Plan to define and guide this kind of 
assistance. The plan will outline the range of 
tools the CRA may use, such as grants, flexible, 
low interest loans, technical assistance, and 
property acquisition, to help ensure that the 
social service agencies, arts organizations and 
small businesses remain healthy and strong. All 
projects under this plan will be driven by local 
partnerships that the CRA will develop with 
agencies who are directly addressing the issues 
at hand.

Just-A-Start Squirrelwood Project
Just-A-Start (JAS), an affordable housing 
developer, undertook the rehabilitation of 
Linwood Court, which was originally a CRA 
project, and Squirrel Brand. The project will 
modernize existing apartments, add 23 new 
affordable units in three new buildings and 
improve the site's landscaping.

In 2018, JAS contacted the CRA, requesting 
assistance to fund open space improvements on 
the Squirrelwood project site. As a pilot for the 
Community Strength and Stability Plan, the CRA 
authorized a $300,000 loan to fund landscaping, 
irrigation, paving, sidewalk installation, lighting 
features, and bike lockers for long-term resident 
bicycle parking. JAS held a ground breaking 
ceremony for the project in May of 2019, which 
the CRA Board and staff attended.

the MFNH to continue providing exceptional 
programs in the Port for decades to come.

The Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House
The Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House 
(MFNH) has provided community activities and 
social services to the Port neighborhood since 
1902. However, like many social service agencies 
that own property, as those assets age, their 
capital needs are greater than their income 
can support. In 2019, the CRA responded to 
MFNH’s request for assistance by entering into 
a memorandum of understanding to explore a 
redevelopment project with the following goals:

• Apply the value of MFNH’s parking lot to 
support facility upgrades to expand the 
organization’s capacity and strengthen and 
grow programs.

• Strengthen MFNH’s financial position.
• Supply mixed-income housing for the 

Cambridge community. 

A project committee of CRA staff, MFNH staff 
and board members advanced the project. 
CRA and MFNH staff conducted outreach to 
community members about their wishes or 
concerns for the site via community meetings 
and at Port Pride Day. They analyzed zoning, 
collected vital information through a site survey, 
Phase I environmental review, geotechnical 
review, and 3D measurements of the historic 
house and addition; and conducted test fits for 
new housing and program facilities. Studio G 
was selected to provide architecture services. 
A partnership of Stone Soup Collaborative and 
Traggorth Companies was selected to provide 
real estate financing consulting. 

During 2020, the CRA and MFNH will review 
options in order to identify the best project 
design, scope and budget that will enable

Forward Fund
Over $270,000 in grant funding was awarded to 
seven organizations in 2019, the most ever in the 
program's five-year history. Local organizations 
whose mission and projects provide City 
residents with social services and support were 
encouraged to apply. The Forward Fund sought 
to target projects that would help close the gaps 
reported in the City’s Envision Cambridge and 
the Community Needs Assessment reports.

project. Other improvements involved 
extending the application submission period 
to a rolling basis throughout the year. Altering 
the application deadline allowed the Selection 
Committee to hold three review sessions during 
the year. The CRA Board also approved the 
increase in grant funding per project, allowing 
projects to apply for up to $100,000 in the 
Community Infrastructure category.

The CRA also made revisions to the grant 
program, including a new Technical Assistance 
category. This award type allowed organizations 
to apply for funds needed for feasibility 
analysis, design and/or engineering studies for 
a future construction project. The grant helped 
organizations with planning and design to 
gather important preconstruction information 
before committing to a capital improvement 

Three awards were offered in the Technical 
Assistance category and four were provided for 
Community Infrastructure capital projects.

Technical Assistance Grants
1.  Planning & Feasibility for Renovations
     Agassiz Baldwin Community (ABC) Center
ABC plans to renovate their children’s program 
space in their building at 20 Sacramento Street. 

This space is used by hundreds of children 
annually and despite heavy use, has not been 
renovated since 1985.  The grant will fund 
a renovation feasibility study so ABC staff 
can assess design concepts and understand 
construction costs, impact on program income, 
financing and logistics.

2.  Food Pantry Renovation Planning
     Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee   
     (CEOC)
As the City’s largest food pantry, CEOC provides 
services to 1,200 individuals and families each 
month. The grant will help CEOC redesign their 
food pantry space to be more efficient, enabling 
them to accept more clients, create space to 
store extra nutritious food and improve the 
client experience at the food pantry.

3.  Dance Complex ADA Improvements
     The Dance Complex 
The Dance Complex engages those who have 
physical or societal barriers to dance, or who 
might not think of movement as a ready option. 
This has included immigrant families, LGBTA+, 
elders, those with mobility issues as well as the 
disabled. The Dance Complex's previous chair lift 
was decommissioned, which created a barrier for 
individuals who wish to access the second floor 
space. The grant will give The Dance Complex 
resources to plan and replace the existing chair 
lift with a new ADA compliant lift.

Community Infrastructure Grants
4.  55 Norfolk St Financial Opportunity Center    
     Just-A-Start Corporation (JAS)
JAS currently operates their Financial 
Opportunity Program out of their offices at 1035 

Cambridge Street. The program provides JAS 
residents, students, and other referrals one-on-
one financial counseling, workshops, and tax 
preparation assistance. JAS will use the grant 
to finance the design and renovation of their 
building at 55 Norfolk St to become a dedicated 
Financial Opportunity Program Center. This will 
allow JAS to reach more community members in 
a more public, transit-accessible setting. 

5.  Building Modernization Project
     Cambridge Community Center (CCC)
CCC has undertaken a major renovation project 
of their center that will focus on addressing 
three general priorities: accessibility, safety, and 
efficiency. The renovation project will also pay 
respect to the building's history by restoring 
the exterior to its original 1882 style. Most 
importantly, renovations will meet a pressing

In 2019, the CRA continued to mature into a 
strong and revived financial entity. New projects 
are underway which create a more complex 
financial story.  

As the CRA’s main source of revenue is from 
the sale of development rights in the Kendall 
Square Urban Renewal Project Area, income is 
dependent upon developers' schedules. Due to 
permitting delays, the revenue expected in 2019 
from the 325 Main Street commercial building 
was delayed until Q1 2020.  The CRA received the 
M
second of eleven annual payments from Boston 
Properties for the 88 Ames (Proto) residential 
building, and modest monthly payments from 
Boston Properties for access rights to CRA-
owned land for the demolition work at 325 Main 
Street.  The Food Truck program continues to 
support improvements to the 3rd & Binney site.

The investment portfolio’s dividends and 
interest are significant sources of income used 
to sustain much of the CRA’s operating budget.  
It is important for the CRA to continue its strong 
fiscal management of its financial assets to 
balance new expenses with infrequent pulses 
of development income.  Following a change to 
Morgan Stanley’s policy, the CRA’s investments 
were moved into a U.S. Bank account, although 
the funds are still being managed by Morgan 
Stanley.  Cambridge Trust Wealth Management 
continues to manage the restricted KSTEP 
(Kendall Square Transit Enhancement Program) 
and Foundry funds.  The CRA also made its 
annual contribution to its OPEB Trust Fund.  
The three major categories of operating 
expenses in 2019 were personnel, professional 
services, and community redevelopment 
investments. Personnel costs include 
employee salaries and fringe benefits, pension

The 2018 audit was completed in October.  A 
clean opinion was given by Roselli, Clark & 
Associates. As the CRA is a component unit of 
the City of Cambridge, a codependent financial 
reporting schedule was developed and met by 
all parties.

Professional services range from administrative 
services such as financial management to 
technical services supporting programs. The 
services of real estate and finance consultants, as 
well as lawyers and engineers, were heavily used 
for the purchase of the commercial building.  
Financial assistance, in the form of a loan and 
design consultants, was given to the Margaret 
Fuller Neighborhood House to help them assess 
their future existence.  The CRA Forward Fund 
distributed close to $150,000 in funds in 2019 
to Cambridge non-profit organizations. An 
expensive surplus market insurance policy was 
needed for the 93-99 Bishop Allen Drive building

 Internal Operations 
In March, the CRA rental agreement with 
Boston Properties was transferred to a leasing 
agreement with TSNE MissionWorks, the 
operator of The Link Kendall, located on the 
eighth floor of 255 Main Street.

As a government organization with 60 years 
of history, the CRA has over 1,500 cubic feet of 
public documents stored in three locations – the 
CRA office, a local off-site facility in Somerville, 
and with Iron Mountain.  When the rent 
agreement began, the office space decreased 
in size and a roomful of on-site records needed 
to move off-site. The services of an archivist and 
records management consultant were used to 
reorganize the remaining office files, reorganize 
the storage space in Somerville, and place every 
off-site record into an Access database. The 
work will be completed in 2020 and a retention 

22

schedule, in conjunction with Massachusetts 
General Laws, will come to the Board for 
approval. 

Project Director Jason Zogg left the CRA in 
February, and Project Manager Alex Levering has 
taken over responsibilities for Kendall Square. 
There have been no changes to the Board 
members or to the Board officer positions. CRA 
staff and Board members continue to give their 
time on other committees within the City.  

Digital data cybersecurity mechanisms have 
been employed on the CRA’s IT network and 
server.  Staff have been trained on the hazards of 
cyber attacks and proactive measures have been 
initiated.

Communicating information from April 7 Regular School Committee Meeting and Public 
Hearing on the FY21 Budget 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
This past Tuesday, April 7th, the School Committee and administration held a (virtual) Regular School 
Committee Meeting & Public Hearing on the FY21 Budget. Superintendent Salim gave a presentation 
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13vAGvB8T8dLQJX9SiZy2_F2Rdi2ukaT75pLLXPD6JIQ/edit> 
on the district’s new Distance Learning Plan <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rMQ7iuCF-
8HXTKVCv1Dyu7wVu4xzgTp8mYtmazdamKQ/edit>, following the COVID-19 crisis.  
 
The CPS District Learning Plan intends to provide a framework and a set of expectations for educators 
and families as they navigate the uncharted territory of distance learning. This Plan asks that students 
engage in “meaningful and productive learning for approximately half the length of a regular school day”, 
which is about 3 hours a day. Educators are asked to prioritize regular and meaningful two-way 
exchanges with their students and to focus on reinforcing, applying, and deepening the skills that have 
already been taught earlier in the school year.  
 
The utmost priority of the School Committee, as always, is to make sure that our most vulnerable students 
and families have access to the supports and resources they need to succeed. In response to the 
Superintendent’s presentation on the Distance Learning Plan, School Committee members raised 
questions around how to: address the learning loss over the summer, identify and communicate with 
students who are struggling, and leverage OST partnerships to deliver additional resources and support. 
The district is committed to leading through an equity lens, with iterations of the Distance Learning Plan 
to be informed by a strong feedback loop-hearing from and engaging with students, educators, and 
principals.  

Packet Pg. 170

6.2

 
The School Committee also approved a motion to convene the Special Education and Student Supports 
Subcommittee for the purposes of coordinating a plan to engage our partnerships with organizations and 
institutions to create an in-house consortium of resources that will establish and communicate best 
practices for supplementing and supporting the district’s Distance Learning Plan. Among these partners, 
are Cambridge School Volunteers and Tutoring Plus, who are eager to break into this space and have been 
working with my Office for the last few weeks to find solutions to the barriers they face.  
 
For the budget portion of our meeting, Superintendent Salim gave a presentation 
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OlqNciNc-
59VwugcpgS_k6QZL9PcjHEEGn4IYMNMykc/edit> on the proposed new Office of Equity, Inclusion & 
Belonging. He began with an overview of the District Plan <https://www.cpsd.us/districtplan> and the 
administration’s ongoing equity work before outlining how the implementation of this new Office and the 
hiring of its Chief Equity Officer intends to lead the advancement of: racial equity and anti-racism, family 
engagement, social-emotional learning and mental/behavioral health, as well as climate and relationships 
at every level of our system.  
 
The many comments and suggestions put forward during the Public Hearing on the FY21 Budget, 
highlighted a few common themes: 1) ensuring that the budget addresses the root causes of racial 
inequities, 2) deeper involvement of community members in equity work and processes, and 3) a culture 
shift towards more transparency and power-sharing. 
 
Until further notice, the School Committee will hold all of its meetings and hear public comment 
virtually.  
 
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.

COVID-19 Response 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
I want to thank each of you for all the work you are doing to provide meaningful responses and 
critical actions to support our communities during this evolving public health crisis. Between my 
office, City staff, and you, my fellow colleagues, we have been able to establish a wide range of 
resources in our attempt to address this unprecedented pandemic’s impact to our city and its 
residents. 
As we work to help our many constituencies, it is critical that we work together around common 
goals. In order to expand resources and mitigate any blind spots in our dissemination of aid, we 
must  pull  in  stakeholders  who  are  not  currently  “in  the  room.”  I  have  heard  from  some  City 
Councilors  regarding  their  work  on  organizing  volunteers  and  outreach  through  individual

COVID-19 Response 

To the Honorable, the City Council: 

I want to thank each of you for all the work you are doing to provide meaningful responses and 
critical actions to support our communities during this evolving public health crisis. Between my 
office, City staff, and you, my fellow colleagues, we have been able to establish a wide range of 
resources in our attempt to address this unprecedented pandemic’s impact to our city and its 
residents. 

As we work to help our many constituencies, it is critical that we work together around common 
goals. In order to expand resources and mitigate any blind spots in our dissemination of aid, we 
must  pull  in  stakeholders  who  are  not  currently  “in  the  room.”  I  have  heard  from  some  City 
Councilors  regarding  their  work  on  organizing  volunteers  and  outreach  through  individual 
networks  to  secure  donations  of  PPE  equipment,  organizing  meals  for  healthcare  workers,  and 
communicating with our homeless shelters, our interfaith community, and seniors. I am proud that 
you all have taken on issues individually to better serve our City. In addition to the work you may 
already be doing, I want to stress the importance of us working together to organize COVID-19 
related town halls, working  with  our public health officials  on tracking  infection data, and any 
other  collaborative  ideas  stemming  from  your  Committees  or  resident  networks  that  might  be

RE:  The Submission of Policy Orders that the Council has acted on earlier in the Legislative 

 
Dear City Council, 
 
The following memorandum is in response to a question from the Council that arose during the 
Regular Meeting on April 6, 2020. 
 
Please note that I am submitting this memorandum to you as the Council’s parliamentarian and 
that this does not constitute legal advice. If you wish to obtain a legal opinion on this matter, 
please direct any such request to the City Solicitor. 
 
Question presented: 
Under what authority does the Council reject Policy Orders submitted by Councillors because 
the Policy Oder is substantially similar to a Policy Order disposed of by the body earlier in the 
term. 
 
Summary of Findings: 
Rule 38 of Robert’s Rules, Renewal of Motions, states, in brief, “No motion can be renewed 
during the same session… except where its renewal is permitted by a specific rule; and such a 
rule always implies circumstances under which the motion has in some respect become a 
different question.” The City Council has not adopted a specific rule to allow motions to be 
renewed. The word “session” can mean one or multiple meetings. It has been the practice of the 
City Council, for at least the past 20 years, to reject Policy Orders which are substantially similar 
to Policy Orders previously considered during its two-year legislative term.  
 
Findings: 
The Rules of the City Council, adopted at the beginning of each legislative term, does not 
contain a rule prohibiting the submission of substantially similar Policy Orders.  However, Rule 
37 of the City Council Rules states, “The City Council shall be governed by Roberts' Rules of 
Order in all questions of parliamentary practice not provided for by these rules.” Robert’s Rules

does contain guidance on the submission of substantially similar motions.  In the language of 
Robert’s Rules a Policy Order is a “Main Motion” and would therefore be governed by this rule. 
Rule 38 of Robert’s Rules provides two general principles governing what it calls “Renewal 
Motions”: 

1.  No motion can be renewed during the same session in which it has already been before 
the assembly, except where its renewal is permitted by a specific rule; and such a rule 
always implied circumstances under which the motion has in some respect become a 
different question. 
 

2.  Any motion that is still applicable can be renewed at any later session, except where a 
specific rule prevents its renewal; and such an impediment to renewal at a later session 
normally can exist only when the first motion goes over to that session as not finally 
disposed of; in which case the question can be reached through the first motion. 

The Rules of the City Council do not contain a specific rule permitting the renewal of motions.  
Therefore, following the two principles articulated above, no motion previously acted upon by 
the City Council can be renewed during the same session. The word “session” is defined by rule 
8 of Robert’s Rules, as follows: 

A  session  of  an  assembly,  unless  otherwise  defined  by  the  bylaws  or  governing 
rules  of  the  particular  organization  or  body,  is  a  meeting  or  series  of  connected 
meetings  devoted  to  a  single  order  of  business,  program,  agenda,  or  announced 
purpose,  in  which  –  when  there  is  more  than  one  meeting  –  each  succeeding 
meeting is scheduled with a view to continuing business at the point where it was 
left off at the previous meeting. 

 
Rule 9 of Robert’s Rules provided further guidance.  Stating that for “regular meetings” of 
permanent societies, meaning periodic business meetings held weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc. 
Each regular meeting normally completes a separate session.  “Normally” in this context does 
not mean definitive. For example, the Rules of the Massachusetts Senate, the Rules of the 
Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Joint Rules of the Massachusetts General Court 
all use the word “session” hundreds of times in different contexts, each context denoting a 
different period of time: “session”, “formal session”, “informal session”, “annual session”, 
“executive session”, “open session”, “legislative session” and so on. 
 
Does Cambridge follow the normal meaning of “session”?  The Rules of the City Council do not 
define the word “session”. The word is used once in the City Council Rules, in rule 20, which 
states, “Any ordinance, order or resolution may be passed through all its stages of legislation at 
one session, provided that no member of the City Council objects thereto; but if any member of 
the City Council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.” (emphasis added).  
This usage would indicate that the word “session” has an equivalent meaning with meeting. 
However, mere usage is not always a clear indication of meaning.  Especially, in this case where 
the rule is verbatim copy of state law.  
 
The final piece of evidence for review is the past practice of the City Council.  Donna Lopez, 
City Clerk for the City of Cambridge from 2012 to 2019 and Deputy City Clerk from 1996 to

2012, confirmed that it had been the practice of the City Council during her tenure as both City 
Clerk and Deputy City Clerk to reject any Policy Order that was substantially similar to other 
Policy Orders previously acted upon by the City Council during the current legislative term.  The 
legislative term beginning in January when the sitting City Council is inaugurated and ending in 
January, two-years later, when a subsequent City Council is inaugurated. It has further been 
confirmed that this rule has been invoked repeatedly through years and discussed with several 
members of the City Council to explain why particular Policy Orders could not be put before the 
body. 
 
Conclusion 
For the reasons discussed above, most specifically the long-standing practice and knowledge of 
the Council, it is clear the City Council for Cambridge has defined the word “session” to mean 
the entire legislative session of the Council.  It should be noted that these rules are entirely 
within the purview and control of the City Council.  The City Council may amend the rules as 
they see fit to more efficiently conduct the business of the body.

suppression well, we will leave the peak with around 95% of our population remaining

should it be reintroduced or remain in circulation at a low level. This also assumes that people who have 
recovered are somewhat immune to reinfection, which is also not fully 
 
As a result of this reality, things simply cannot go back to our previous normal, at least not until we have 
a widely available vaccine. Our new normal will require us to keep a sharp eye out for the virus, through 
extensive testing and limited travel. We will have to quickly isolate any new cases that are introduced, 
and it will be important to protect our most vulnerable residents by limiting their potential exposure as 
much as possible. We will also need to continue limiting our social contacts to some extent, not only to 
reduce the chances of transmission, but also to make it easier to track down and isolate new infections via

If the virus were to start spreading widely again here in Cambridge or in nearby communities, we would 
immediately need to shut everything down again and go back into suppression in order to prevent disaster. 
The collective sacrifice that is necessary during a suppression phase is simply untenable if repeated too 
many times in quick succession. Therefore, it is crucially important that we implement the right 
mitigation strategies post suppression. Since it won’t be completely our call as to when things will begin 
to rev back up, it is important that we begin considering what every aspect of our life needs to look like 
during this new normal, in order to prevent another outbreak requiring suppression while we await a 
vaccine. We need to be ready to implement that new normal the day the Governor decides to lift his Stay 
at Home order, whether that be on May 4, 2020 or some later date. 
 
As chair of the Public Safety Committee, I intend to schedule a series of virtual committee hearings to 
begin exploring options and strategies for organizing our community during the mitigation phase so as to 
minimize the need to go back into suppression. We need to work with public health, public safety, and 
other experts to deeply explore various topics related to our daily routines and how they may need to be 
altered. 
 
I plan to start with our food supply chain and distribution system, which is obviously critical to our health 
and safety. Right now we have a good solution in place for people who are food challenged, if we can 
reach them, thanks to the hard work of Councillor Mallon and our partners at Food for Free. We have the 
beginnings of a solution for high-risk individuals who are unable to safely go shopping themselves,
