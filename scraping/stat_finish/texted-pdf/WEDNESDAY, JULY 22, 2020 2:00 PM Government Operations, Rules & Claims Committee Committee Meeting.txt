Councillor E. Denise Simmons called the meeting to order at 2:03 PM. She explained that the purpose of 
the meeting was to continue to discuss the rules of the City Council. 
 
Councillor Simmons suggested that at some point, the city council should have a refresher on the basic 
rules.  
 
Councillor Toomey moved on to 
open public comment

Kim Courtney, attorney and the co-owner of Upper West, stated that people have the right to provide 
public comment and attend public meetings anonymously. She said that the Cambridge City Council rules 
and practices requiring public speakers to provide identifying information like their name and address 
violates their constitutional rights to free speech. She said that the Cambridge City Council rules and 
practices blocking the public from criticizing the performance of our public officials’ duties is a violation 
of their constitutional rights to petition the government. 
 
Xavier Dietrich, co-owner of upper west, voiced his concerns over the rules that every person addressing 
the city council is instructed to state their name and address for the record. He said that the council is not 
allowed to make rules that violate the First Amendment to the US Constitution. He said that the First 
Amendment protects the people's right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. That is the 
right to make a complaint to, or seek assistance of, one's government, without fear of punishment or 
reprisals. He said that the right to do this anonymously is also well established, and this is for obvious 
reasons.

Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, said that the rules are a jumble with respect to reconsideration and 
that they are internally inconsistent. She emphasized the importance of public comment. 
 
John Hawkinson, 84 Massachusetts Avenue, stated that he was concerned with the possibility of reducing 
public comment. He stated that in other communities, public comment is more interactive and 
engagement between the officials and public commenters is allowed. 
 
Councillor Toomey moved to 
close public comment 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Simmons gave a brief recap of the items discussed by the committee at the last meeting. She 
expressed an interest in reviewing rule 24(c) (1)(B) due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he wants to discuss rule 27, which governs the quorum requirement for 
committees.  
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he wanted to make sure all roundtables are televised and to fix any 
inconsistencies around reconsideration.  
 
Councillor McGovern and Councillor Simmons discussed amending rule 16 to be consistent with rule 35. 
 
Councillor McGovern moved to amend rule 16 by striking the words "any member", in the last paragraph, 
and replacing this with the words "any councillor among those whose votes prevailed". 
 
Councillor McGovern explained that historically, when any member was allowed to file reconsideration, 
a councillor or school committee member who was in the minority would file reconsideration to get 
another shot at the vote. It was not because there was new information, nor was it because there was an 
inconsistency, nor because there was a rule violation. He said that the councillor or school committee 
member merely wanted to have another few days or a week to try and convince their colleagues to put 
pressure on the Council or the school committee to change the vote. He did not believe that this was good 
governance. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not believe that this amendment is necessary, because the council 
rules are governed by Robert’s Rules, and Robert’s Rules already limit reconsideration to those who 
voted on the prevailing side. 
 
Councillor Simmons spoke in support of Councillor McGovern’s amendment. She stated that rule 16 
should be consistent with rule 35.

Councillor McGovern’s motion 
passed by the following roll call 
vote. 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Zondervan and Councillor Simmons had a discussion about changing the procedure to sign up 
for public comment. Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not feel there was a need to amend those 
procedures. 
 
Councillor Simmons stated that she supported having public commenters provide some form of 
identifying information. She stated that it is important to know who is speaking to the council because it 
gives the members some context as they determine the level of importance to assign to each speaker’s 
remarks. She said that if someone who does not live in Cambridge or work in Cambridge was 
commenting on a matter before the Council, that context would be important to know.  
 
Mayor Siddiqui suggested adding “adjournment” to rule 25A. 
 
Motion to amend rule 24A to add 
"15. adjournment" by Councillor 
Toomey.

Councillor McGovern explained that the council may want to amend the rules for public comment so as 
to ensure members of the public case use remote participation. Councillor Simmons expressed support for 
continuing public comment through remote participation. Councillor Zondervan asked for guidance from 
the City Solicitor on this issue. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, explained that city council’s meetings are governed by the Open Meeting 
Law and the requirements pertaining to public participation. The emergency order of the governor is what 
is allowing remote participation. After the pandemic emergency order is lifted, she did not believe remote 
participation would be allowed in its current form. She stated that she would like to research what, if any, 
changes could be adopted through the city council rules.

Motion to ask the solicitor to report back to 
council on how to expand remote 
participation for public comment after the 
Governor's emergency order is lifted by 
Councillor McGovern 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Zondervan suggested amending rule 27 to require that five members be present for a quorum 
of committees with nine members, and a three-member quorum be present for committees with five 
members. He stated that the current quorum requirements are confusing for the public and that increasing 
the quorum will increase councillor participation. 
 
Councillor Toomey stated that he believed that the current quorum rules work and do not need to be 
changed. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that he supported the change. He felt that the current quorum 
requirements made it hard to discuss issues with other councillors due to the potential to violate the Open 
Meeting Law. 
 
Councillor McGovern stated that the quorum number was lowered to make sure that committees could 
more easily obtain a quorum and hold a meeting. He stated that he believed attendance was better now. 
 
Councillor Simmons stated that the quorum requirements were decreased to allow flexibility in 
attendance due to the constraints on councillors’ schedules. 
 
Motion to set a quorum of 5 
members for the Finance and 
Ordinance committee and 3 
members for all other committees 
by Councillor Zondervan

Mayor Siddiqui asked how members felt about splitting the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning, 
Public Facilities, Art and Celebrations committee into two committees – one for Neighborhood and Long-
Term Planning, Public Facilities, and another one for Art and Celebrations. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not believe that the committee needed to be divided, but he said 
that he would support splitting the committee if the Mayor felt that would be useful.

Councillor Simmons stated that she did not believe that it was necessary to split this committee. She 
stated that in the past, there had been too many committees and not enough councillors to populate the 
committees. 
 
Councillor McGovern suggested allowing for more than two hours for Ordinance committee meetings. 
Councillor Toomey suggested removing the two-hour limit for hearings entirely. Councillor Zondervan 
stated that he did not support removing the two-hour limit entirely, but he would support clarifying the 
rule. Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, explained that certain laws require hearings for those items and that 
those hearing require public testimony. Councillor Toomey stated that some meetings have a large 
amount of public comment, which can eat into the two hours. 
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he was concerned about deleting a limit entirely. He suggested putting a 
time limit in the call of the meeting. Councillor Simmons stated that she was in favor of removing the 
two-hour limit entirely. 
 
Motion to amend rule 32B to 
delete the first 2 sentences by 
Councillor Toomey 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Zondervan moved to delete the first sentence of rule 32B and replace it with the following: 
“The time devoted to public hearings and committee meetings shall be determined by the chair at the time 
of scheduling.” 
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he was not sure if this should apply to committee meetings and hearings. 
Councillor Simmons stated that hearings should be maintained as a separate order. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor McGovern, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, stated 
that this hearing section relates only to hearings and not to other meetings of the council, whether 
committees or of the whole Council. 
 
Councillor Simmons stated that she was not prepared to make any amendments to this provision. 
 
Councillor Zondervan withdrew his motion.

time for each councillor during debate. She was not putting a motion forward but wanted the committee to 
think about that issue for future meetings. She stated that the council should consider additional 
professional training for councillors. She also stated that the body should consider adding a second to its 
rules.
