Adam Lawrence Dyer, lead minister at First Parish in Cambridge Unitarian Universalist, encouraged the 
city to work more closely with the individuals and organizations that are working with the homeless 
population locally.   
 
Councillor Nolan asked about the timing of when a more regional approach would begin. 
 
Kate Lazar responded to councillor Nolan’s question. She stated that the New England School of English 
has dorm rooms available, they are eager to rent to the city. There are in one facility alone 50 beds 
available, together with the vouchers that the city has been granted to offer housing that would make up 
for the 90 beds that we are down this winter. She urged the city to work with a nonprofit coalition to try to 
get these dorm rooms open available.   
 
Councillor McGovern asked to re-focus this round of questions on the charrette recommendations, their 
presentation, and long-term solutions. He reassured those in attendance the importance of non-profit and 
faith-based partnerships.  
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that the city should be looking at purchasing hotels to help house the 
unhoused community. And not just as a short-term solution, but very much as a long-term solution.  
 
Police Commissioner Branville Bard updated the committee on the temporary emergency shelter moving 
to Spalding Hospital in early December that will provide up to 58 beds.     
 
The committee stressed the need for more beds and debated where they were going to come from.  
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler followed up on the points around non-congregate spaces, like hotel rooms, 
in the need to be more creative during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
Councillor McGovern answered the question by explaining the health risks of using closed-quarter spaces 
like hotel rooms during a pandemic. He also spoke to the difficulty of staffing and logistics, especially in 
the case of individuals dealing with substance abuse and recovery.  
 
Councillor McGovern extend 
the meeting to 12:15

Police Commissioner Branville Bard pointed out that many of the rooms in question had two or three 
beds and would have to be reduced because of social distancing requirements. 
 
Ellen Semonoff, Assistant City Manager for Human Services concurred.  
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon and her colleague Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler expressed their support to 
fully exploring non-congregate housing as quickly as possible.  
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan and Mayor Siddiqui voiced their support for this committee and the need for 
more resources to be put into place to help the unhoused community.

Councillor McGovern moved to send the 
following policy order to the City Council:   
 
Whereas the City of Cambridge has been 
funding a number of short term measures to 
support unhoused members of the 
community including public showers, 
portable toilets, hand washing stations and 
food programs and  
 
Whereas these supports are currently 
scheduled to end at the end of the calendar 
year, despite the fact that the COVID crisis 
will extend well into 2021. Now therefore 
be it  
 
Ordered that the city manager be and 
hereby is requested to fund these programs 
until further notice.

Councillor McGovern moved to send the 
following policy order to the City Council:   
 
Whereas many unhoused community 
members in Cambridge have lower level 
needs and are capable of living 
independently and  
 
Whereas other communities have been able 
to create non congregate spaces, and 
created assessments to determine who 
would best be served in those spaces and 
 
Whereas New England School of English 
has potential space. Now therefore, be it 
 
Ordered that the city further investigate 
renting space from the English school from 
the England School of English to house 
appropriate members of our unhoused 
community.
