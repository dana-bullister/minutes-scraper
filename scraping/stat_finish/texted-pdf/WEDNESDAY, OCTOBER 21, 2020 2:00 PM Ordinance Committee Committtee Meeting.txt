The Ordinance Committee will conduct a public hearing on the Harvard Square Conservation 
District Study Committee Report. 
 
Councillor Carlone  called the meeting to order.  He opened the floor to Charles Sullivan, Director of the 
Historical Commission, to present the findings of the Harvard Conservation district Study report.  
 
 
Mr. Sullivan explained that Cambridge adopted Massachusetts general law chapter 40 in 1963 and 
enacted the first historic districts in 1964, including Harvard Yard. In the mid-1970s, the city adopted 
zoning amendments that encouraged townhouse construction in residential districts. This caused a strong 
neighborhood reaction. The city developed the concept of neighborhood conservation districts as an 
alternative to historic districts that would be a more flexible level of regulation that could be adopted to 
the particular circumstances in each neighborhood in which they might be applied.  
 
In 1997, the council directed the Historical Commission to establish a study committee and consider a 
historic district under state statute for Harvard Square. In 2000, the committee recommended and the city 
council adopted the Harvard Square Conservation District.  
 
In 2017, the city manager appointed a study committee to take a fresh look at conditions in Harvard 
Square district and at the administration of the district. The committee met for two years. The study 
committee consisted of seven members, three members of the Historical Commission and four members 
from the community. Anyone who applied but was not chosen for this appointment was invited to join the 
Study Committee and, also that any member of the public who wanted to join, and a number of people did 
on the in the front of our study report, there's a list on page on the back of the second page of the regular 
participants who far outnumber the appointed members of the Study Committee. So the measures that are 
before the council or before the ordinance committee are to consider a an amended statement of goals and 
secondary goals and amended guidelines for demolition, construction and alterations. 
Maintaining the commercial vitality of the district is a very strong and important primary goal. The 
discussion of the of the Study Committee focused on refining those goals to provide better guidance for

the concept for the historic commission as it administers the conservation district and better guidance to 
provide clearer expectations for applicants and residents of the district.  
 
Councillor Carlone  opened the floor to public comment 
 
Denise Jillson, 2203 Massachusetts Avenue, stated that the meetings were respectful, productive, lively 
civil, occasionally passionate. The meetings represented perspectives and interests from across a wide 
spectrum of professional backgrounds and community involvement. The guidelines and procedures

In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about zoning districts and conservation district, Mr. 
Sullivan stated that the overlapping district do not present an administrative issue. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan about the recommendations in the report, Mr. Sullivan

Mr. Sullivan stated that this process worked well.  He stated that past study committee were more rigidly 
structured and depended more on the appointed members. The city wanted to make sure that all of the 
interest groups were given an equal place at the table. 
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about diversity on the study committee, Mr. Sullivan 
stated that the city cast a fairly broad net, asking for people to nominate themselves for consideration for 
appointment. He stated that no minorities applied. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon encouraged the city to work hard a recruiting diverse candidates for future 
committees. 
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about the relocation of significant building, Mr. 
Sullivan stated that the Historic Commission works with applicants to help guide applications to success.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about the roles of the National Historic 
Register in this process, Mr. Sullivan stated that properties on the register can be demolished or altered 
unless federal funding is involved.  Projects like that are fairly rare and far between. All of Harvard 
Square is a national register district. The only place of overlap with a conservation district is in mid-
Cambridge, where the binding review of projects applies to buildings that are on the National Register.  
 
Councillor Carlone stated that he believed that the study group process was very well done. 
 
Councillor Nolan stated that she supported moving this report forward.   
 
Councillor Simmons  stated that the city must to work harder to expand the representation of diverse 
groups on city committees. 
 
Councillor Carlone moved refer 
the report to the full City Council
