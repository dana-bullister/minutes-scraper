          MARY FLYNN:  Welcome to the November 17, 2020 

meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My name is Mary 

Flynn, and I am the Vice Chair acting as Chair for this 

evening.   

          The meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

October 26, 2020.  

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online 

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

          I'll start by asking the Staff to take Board 

member attendance and verify that all members are audible. 

Jeff, could you do that, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, I can, thank you Mary.  Just 

starting out with Louis Bacci, are you present and is the 

meeting audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Present and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  H Theodore Cohen, 

are you present and is the meeting audible to you?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Present and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ted.  Steven Cohen, are 

you present, is the meeting audible to you?

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Present and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Hugh.  And Mary Flynn, 

you're obviously present, but just to confirm the rest of 

the meeting is audible to you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  It is audible, thank you. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  I will note before we go on, 

there are several Planning Board members who are -- who 

indicated they would be absent -- Tom Sieniewicz, Nikolas 

Bowie, Corinne Espinoza and Catherine Preston Connolly.  

I'll just take a moment.  If any of those members are 

present, please indicate that you are.     

6

          [Pause] 

          Those members are noted as absent.  Thank you.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  Okay the first item 

is an Update from the Community Development Department, so I 

will turn it back over to Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you again, Mary.  Jeff 

Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development.  Iram Farooq is 

sorry that she couldn't be here tonight, but we do have some 

other staff from the Department that I'll introduce -- 

Swaathi Joseph from my team in Zoning and Development who is 

cohosting this and running the slides, as well as Daniel 

Messplay from Zoning and Development who's present, and Liza 

Paden from Zoning and Development.   

          We have also Erik Thorkildsen from the Urban 

Design Team and Community Development; and Khalil Mogassabi, 

the Deputy Director and Chief Planner of Community 

Development. 

          Just shifting quickly to the schedule, because we 

have an important topic to get to tonight.  Tonight we have 

one public hearing on the agenda.  It's an initiative that 

has been developing for some time.  It's the culmination of 

a pretty significant effort, in which the city was a very

active player to bring together a number of development 

entities and property owners and agencies to execute a very 

challenging utility project.  So this is something that just 

on behalf of the city and the city's administration is very 

exciting to see move forward.  So we'll be getting to that 

shortly. 

          Next week at the City Council, we have -- I'm 

sorry, the Planning Board -- we have a public hearing on 

Cannabis Delivery Zoning petition.  So the zoning petition 

that relates to delivery businesses for adult-use cannabis.  

And we will talk about that more when we get there.  It's a 

little bit of an interesting and somewhat esoteric topic.   

          And then we have another meeting the following 

week, December 1, at the Planning Board where we'll be 

having a public hearing on zoning petitions that the city 

has been involved in developing, along with -- the CDD along 

with the Council -- that have to do with our retail uses in 

our zoning ordinance, and home occupation.  So that's 

something that we're very excited to see move forward as 

well, and you'll be hearing from me directly about that. 

          We also have on the schedule for December 1 a 

review of a comprehensive permit application, which has been

submitted.  This is for development at 2072 Massachusetts 

Avenue, just north of Porter Square; an affordable housing 

development that will be Cambridge before the Board of 

Zoning Appeal for a comprehensive permit, and that will be 

the opportunity for the Planning Board to review it and make 

any advisory comments.    

          The following week, December 8, we have some 

public hearings that are currently on the docket; one for a 

development at 600 Massachusetts Avenue, a residential 

development in Central Square. 

          And we also expect to have the returning hearing 

on the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest Zoning Petition, which 

the Board has heard a few times already and asked for some 

work to be done by staff, and that will be coming forward at 

that time. 

          I'll just -- I'll stop there with the updates, but 

just to note that all of these zoning petitions have 

hearings that are going to be coming forward at the 

Ordinance Committee on November 19 next Thursday, or 

Thursday of this week.   

          There is going to be a hearing at the Ordinance 

Committee on the same zoning petition that's being heard

tonight by the Planning Board. 

          And there are more hearings scheduled at the 

Ordinance Committee in December.   

          And the Planning Board will have meetings December 

15 and December 22, and we'll talk a little bit more about 

those agendas as we get there.  Thank you.  I'll turn it 

over there.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you, Jeff.  Do 

Planning Board members have any questions for Jeff on the 

update?  If so, just state your name.   

          [Pause]  

          No? Hearing none, then, let's move forward with 

our main agenda topic, and that item is a public hearing on 

a zoning petition by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority 

to amend Article 14 of the zoning ordinance of the City of 

Cambridge.   

          CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us.  And so, once again I'll go back to Jeff.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  For the last time for 

now, Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development.  So 

this is the first hearing for the Planning Board on this 

zoning petition.  The Ordinance Committee will hold its 

hearing on Thursday.   

          This petition is part of the enabling of a 

tentative multiparty agreement that was announced by the 

city earlier this year to find an alternative location for 

an electrical transformer substation that's currently 

planned, and has been announced to be located on Fulkerson 

Street. 

          And the purpose of this is to enable the 

alternative location closer to the heart of Kendall Square, 

which the presenters will talk about more in detail. 

          CDD provided a memo on this with some additional 

background information on the planning for the area in this 

particular petition.   

          The Planning Board's action with zoning petitions 

is to make an advisory recommendation to the City Council, 

as always -- and in this particular case, it was brought to 

my attention and folks from the Cambridge Redevelopment 

Authority or the petitioners can maybe add a little bit more

detail that in addition to the zoning petition, the Council 

will need to approve an amendment to the Kendall Square 

Urban Renewal Plan.   

          And part of that process includes a determination 

from the Planning Board that the proposed change to that 

plan is in conformance with the general plan for the 

community as a whole.  So that's something else that will 

need to be covered and we can come back around to that when 

we discuss the Board's recommendation.   

          I'll turn it over there.  Thanks.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  Okay.  So beginning 

the presentation this evening is Kathleen Born from the 

Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.  Kathleen -- oh, your 

team in general will have about 30 minutes for a 

presentation.  So if you would begin and then at some point 

either you or another member of the team, if you would 

identify all the other members who will be presenting -- 

thank you.   

          KATHLEEN BORN:  Well, why don't I kick off and 

then I will let our Executive Director, Tom Evans, introduce 

the members of the team?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Perfect, thank you.

          KATHLEEN BORN:  My comments will hopefully be 

brief.  For the record, my name is Kathleen Born, 3 Walnut 

Avenue, Cambridge.  I am the Chair of the Cambridge 

Redevelopment Authority, and I am here to speak on behalf of 

the five duly appointed members of the Authority, who 

unanimously voted to file this new MXD zoning petition that 

would, if enacted, provide for the siting of the major 

utility infrastructure -- the Eversource electrical 

substation -- on land in the CRA controlled Kendall Square 

Urban Redevelopment District. 

          This major utility infrastructure was previously 

planned on an Eversource owned site on Fulkerson Street, in 

uncomfortably close proximity to a playing field, a 

playground, an elementary school and a residential 

neighborhood.   

          As many of you are aware, this plan caused 

tremendous angst amongst Cambridge residents, especially 

parents.  I was tremendously impressed that our city 

administration, in particular City Manager Louis De. 

Pasquale, took on the challenge of finding a new site in 

what has been called, "the most expensive square mile of 

real estate on the east coast," if not in the U.S.

          Senior staff of the CRA and our development 

partner, Boston Properties, will be presenting the details 

of the plan under the new zoning if enacted.   

          I just want to say that in my nearly 50 years of 

involvement with building and construction in Cambridge in 

various capacities, I don't think that I have ever 

encountered a development and construction plan this 

audacious.  In its single-minded goal of maximizing public 

benefit. 

          As you will hear, this major new utility will be 

built underground out of sight, out of hearing -- all but 

invisible to the residential and commercial and academic 

activities around it and safely separated from them. 

          So, typically at the introduction of the zoning 

petition for commercial development, the questions on the 

part of the appointed and elected officials and residents 

who are following the project begin to form around community 

benefits and environmental mitigation and support for local 

causes, and office and meeting space for non-profits is 

beginning to sound familiar -- and more affordable housing… 

community center, swimming pools, basketball courts, job 

training centers.

          I'm here to encourage you, the members of the 

Planning Board and others who will be considering this 

petition to think of this petition differently.   

          This is a different kind of petition, for two 

reasons.  First and foremost, it is a petition by a public 

entity -- the CRA -- for a public purpose, to site a public 

utility that will deliver reliable electricity to residences 

and businesses in Cambridge at a time when the aging 

infrastructure is becoming incrementally outmoded, and there 

is more and more pressure to convert fossil fuel systems to 

clean electricity. 

          Your household's ability, your business's ability 

and your successor's ability to rely on efficient and 

reliable electricity will be measurably enhanced by this 

project.  It's a major public benefit. 

          But second, and back to the more familiar genre of 

public benefits, I hope that the CRA has demonstrated in the 

last several years -- and that’s the last several years 

since we've come to the Planning Board, 2015, and then 

subsequently for the IDCP -- I hope that we've demonstrated 

in the last several years that our assets gained from the 

development piece from CRA partner projects in Kendall

Square have been imaginatively, generously and exclusively 

used for the public good. 

          We are really serious about that mission, and we 

apply that criteria -- the public good -- starting to be 

repetitive about this, the public good, to every project 

that we undertake - in East Cambridge, in the Port, and in 

other city locations.  And I'm just going to mention a few, 

and then I'm going to turn it over to Tom.   

          But just a few of our recent public projects are 

that we are as -- as you all know -- a full development 

partner with the city and the Foundry; a singular community 

benefits project.  And we will be responsible for its daily 

ongoing operation. 

          The CRA annually makes grants to non-profits for 

their physical and real estate -related needs through our 

Forward Fund Project, which we plan to expand.  Most 

recently, and since the last time we've been to the Planning 

Board, the CRA has invested close to $20 million dollars in 

acquiring and renovating a building on Bishop Allen Drive 

for use by nearly a dozen of Cambridge's most respected non-

profit organizations, which were about to lose their offices 

due a to skyrocketing real estate market.

          The CRA is a fiscal partner of -- you know, I 

don't know the exact figure, but I think it's going to be 

close to $10 million dollars with the City of Cambridge and 

COVID relief for small businesses in the city.  And there 

are many other ways in which we are investing our assets in 

the city. 

          So just to recap, I'm going to ask you to think of 

this zoning petition as a very different kind of petition, 

one in which the public benefit is upfront first and 

foremost; you can think of those public benefits as sort of 

preloaded.    

          I know we often -- this presentation is going to 

be similar when we come before the Ordinance Committee of 

the Council, but this is a public project, and I struggle to 

think of a project that is probably -- well, the Foundry, 

but before that I have to go all the way back to Neville 

Manor around Fresh Pond, which I think must have come before 

the Planning Board at some time, in which the project was so 

singularly about a public benefit. 

          So that's my introduction, and our team is going 

to take you through the details.  Thank you very much.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Kathy.  Should I turn it

over next to Tom?     

          KATHLEEN BORN:  Yes.           

          MARY FLYNN:  Tom Evans?   

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          KATHLEEN BORN:  Tom Evans? Please take it away.   

          TOM EVANS:  Thank you, Vice Chair.  Thank you, Ms. 

Born.  I am just going to go through a few technical issues 

of why we're here, and then we'll pass is on to members of 

the team from Boston Properties.  Ian Hatch will be 

presenting, though other members are here, and Tony Markese 

from Pickard Chilton will go through some design components. 

          We also have representatives from Eversource as 

well that can speak on technical matters if they come up.  

          Next slide?  Who's advancing -- there we go.  So 

as far as an outline of what we want to talk about after I 

go through a quick introduction of the project, which has 

been covered quite well so far, we want to talk about the 

development plan, some initial ideas of phasing and massing, 

and then some of the other urban design components we've 

been starting to think through in using this site for not 

only a substation but also an opportunity to revisit the 

north parcel of the Urban Renewal Plan.

          Next slide?   

          The reason we really first got involved was, as 

Kathy mentioned, the location of the Eversource substation 

next to the Kennedy Longfellow School and the John O'Hearn 

Park, the East Cambridge and Linden Park neighborhoods -- 

through a lot of interests of the neighborhood and picked up 

by both the City Council and the administration, started 

looking at alternative locations for the site. 

          The first site -- if you go to the next slide -- 

that was brought forth was actually Binney Street Park, 

which sits within the Urban Renewal Plan area, and MXD 

zoning.  And as it was -- didn't have anything on it, was 

the first place that we started looking.   

          There were technical reasons why the parcel we 

often call the, "pork chop parcel" didn't work out for the 

substation, and one of the major issues was that it is 

designated as open space that is to get under construction 

shortly. 

          Through ongoing conversations with a number of 

property owners in the area, the idea of using the parking 

garage in the north parcel rose up and was proposed by 

Boston Properties, and there's other parties involved in the

deal. 

          And so we began a technical analysis of that 

feasibility, and have yet to find a fatal flaw of this idea.  

We've actually now found a way so that we think it really 

improves the site.   

          And so, that brought us, as we worked through all 

that in the summer, we got to the point that we were ready 

to present a zoning proposal and Urban Renewal Plan change 

that would facilitate this. 

          So just a quick high level, a couple points worth 

mentioning:  This is a zoning change to the MXD district 

that would increase the commercial square footage by 800,000 

square feet, increase the height limits marginally by 50 

feet, and the two districts that applied the block.  Revise 

some of the phasing of the housing program, while 

maintaining all of the affordability requirements we put in 

place in 2015, and making some other dimensional adjustments 

in the zoning. 

          Additionally, as Jeff Roberts mentioned, we in a 

parallel path need to amend the Kendall Square Urban Renewal 

Plan Part of that is to make sure that the -- we're very 

clear about the public objective of hosting the

infrastructure of the substation.  We also need to make 

conforming changes to the plan to fit with the MXD zoning. 

          And then not really as related to the Eversource 

substation, but we're proposing to rename the plan from the 

Urban Renewal -- the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan to 

the Kendall Square Urban Redevelopment Plan, and that is for 

the objective of recognizing the historic impact of urban 

renewal programs throughout the country on black communities 

throughout urban America. 

          We felt it was not consistent with our objectives 

as the CRA, to continue to use that terminology in one of 

our formal plans.  And so, thus we also wanted to make that 

name change, as regards to this amendment. 

          So I'll pass it on to Ian and then Tony to go 

through some of the development parameters, but then we will 

dive into any of the technical aspects of the zoning or the 

redevelopment plan change, as you have questions. 

          So next I'll go to Ian, and he can talk about the 

Development Program.   

Thanks, Tom.   

          IAN HATCH:  Great.  Next slide, please?  Great.  

          Ian Hatch with Boston Properties here.  So I'll

just touch on a few quick points here related to some of the 

forces that I think are nested within the framework of 

events that Tom just gave.   

          What you see here is a timeline illustrating both 

-- you know, where we have been relative to community 

engagement efforts over the preceding six months or so, 

where we are now, where the dotted line is situated there in 

both panels there. 

          And then this panel effectively illustrates some 

of the scheduling considerations that are acting upon the 

petition from the perspective of timing.  The top panel 

refers to a Boston Properties' current existing obligations 

to deliver a residential building at 135 Broadway. 

          And then the bottom panel reflects some of the 

scheduled constraints confronting Eversource in this 

process.  They illustrate the regulatory and construction -- 

essentially LEED lag times required to actually deliver the 

Envision facility on our parcel as we understand those 

parameters today.   

          Well, I think we can refer back to this for 

questions.  Subsequently, what I would point out is that 

Eversource is currently targeting an in service date for the 

22

new facility in 2027, and that when you work backwards from 

the construction period, the regulatory periods, you're 

required to get past the FSB leads there to be considerable 

urgency relative to this petition, and we would be targeting 

having some understanding of its prospects by Q1 of 21.

advancing?       

          MARY FLYNN:  No.   

          IAN HATCH:  Okay.         

          [Pause] I apologize, are you seeing the slides 

          MARY FLYNN:  No.  I'm not sure who is advancing 

the slides.  Is it Swaathi?  Or a member of your team.   

          IAN HATCH:  There we go.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Here we go.   

          IAN HATCH:  Great.  So just as a final note here, 

I did want to offer some context as to some of the thinking 

that I think has shaped what you're about to see here.   

          In the course of honing our response to this 

request for a proposal to accomplish this relocation of the 

substation and to deliver on that public benefit, we've

effectively been required I think to confront a constrained 

optimization problem of sorts, balancing between these three 

critical objectives -- I think the first being the 

engineering feasibility of the whole proposition.   

          Naturally, we want to deliver a site layout and 

design that can accommodate the Eversource heavy 

infrastructure.   

          And that includes not only the bulk of the 

substation itself, but also sort of a network of 

transmission and distribution lines -- in many cases coming 

in from sort of other points in the city relatively far 

away, threading through the crowded streets of Cambridge, 

avoiding heat-generating utilities, et cetera, and then 

ultimately being integrated into the redevelopment 

components that we're proposing here, and then entering the 

facility itself, which is no mean feat in itself.   

          The second critical point here is to deliver a 

proposal that's responsive to keep public priorities, such 

as open space and pedestrian connectivity.   

          Fundamentally, we recognize how important those 

things are, and we want to be proud of the space we leave 

behind.  And I think that's very much been an active

conversation through the community engagement process as 

we've tried to optimize this proposal. 

          And finally, though I think it's probably of 

greater concern to Boston Properties than perhaps it might 

be to others, the redevelopment components -- the commercial 

development components of this proposal -- effectively are 

acting as the financial engine that pulls all of this heavy 

infrastructure into being kind of effectively cross-

subsidizes the heavy infrastructure investments that are 

necessary to effectuate points one and two. 

          So as you can see, balancing between all of these 

components is quite delicate at times, but we're very proud 

of the work we've done to date on this to refine this 

throughout community engagement process, and we truly do 

believe that the challenge of this notwithstanding, that 

tackling this really -- you know, instantiating this 

redevelopment proposal represents a really tremendous 

opportunity for this particular site. 

          And I think to walk you through that, I'll turn it 

over to Tony Markese of Pickard Chilton.     

          TONY MARKESE:  Thank you so much, Ian.  My name is 

Tony Markese.  I'm Design Principal with Pickard Chilton,

and I'm joined here by my colleague, Brian Skrovig.   

          It's terrific to see you all again, and I wish it 

were under better circumstances, and we could be in person 

in front of the model working the way we have in the past in 

such a collaborative manner.  But it is what it is, and so, 

happy to see you and appreciate the chance to talk about 

this project. 

          So you've heard -- I think Kathy and Tom did a 

great job of talking about the project in terms of the 

public benefit and how it's structured, and Ian gave you a 

great sense of our schedule to date, and the development 

objectives.  What I'd really like to spend my time talking 

to you about is giving you a sense of the opportunity that 

we have here in front of us.   

          And, you know, I had one picture and only one 

picture to show you today, it would probably be this very 

first picture.   

          And to me, the opportunity to take what is frankly 

a -- quite a large and impactful concrete parking structure 

that really is only there to house cars and eliminate it 

completely and create a brand-new public space in the heart 

of Kendall Square connected to the Volpe Project, connected

22

to other open spaces, connected to the neighborhood -- that 

to me represents -- without any exaggeration, really a 

tremendous opportunity, almost the opportunity of a 

generation in a way. 

          And the ability to really transform this part of 

the city and this space by taking on this infrastructure 

project, but also by eliminating this parking structure and 

creating an outdoor room.  It's really the gem of all of 

this. 

          And so, -- next slide, please? -- 

          And so, as we've begun to initially think about 

what the opportunity is and how we would create this new 

public space or public room or piazza -- however you want to 

look at it, we started by -- along with our partners at 

Boston Properties at the CRA -- to define what we thought 

the vision for the space might be. 

          And a couple of points came through as we started 

to discuss this.  First and foremost, a space that the 

community can flourish in -- a space that everyone will feel 

welcome and included, a space that has an eye towards and 

addresses issues to make it more sustainable -- a space for 

wellness and a space that really is designed to take

advantage of creating something that will impact the future. 

          Also, the idea of creating something that's at 

center of a lot of activity within the city being adjacent 

to Volpe, as I mentioned, to create a new space that's tied 

to that network of spaces -- something that enriches and 

activates the public realm, where people, bikes and cars can 

share the urban space and also, try to look for 

opportunities to create thresholds and subspaces within the 

larger context. 

          And so, hopefully by walking you through the kind 

of process and some of our early thinking, you'll see how we 

tried to adhere to this vision and create a great place.   

          Next slide, please? 

          And so, here's a plan view.  And it basically 

gives you an idea of how the blue garage and the building 

surrounding it in the center can be tied to the Volpe Plan 

to the east, to the neighborhood surrounding, to the south, 

to MIT and Kendall Square, and just an acknowledgement that 

the idea of creating a space in the center of this that 

helps connect this altogether is a terrific opportunity, and 

something that we think will really add to the context of 

the city.

21

22

          Next slide, please? 

          And so, here's that -- a similar view with the 

public spaces that surround the project that we're talking 

about.  And this is in the kind of current MBX format, where 

you see the blue garage and the two spaces that flank it on 

the north and south.   

          And then again to the right you see the Volpe 

Project with their public spaces and their network of public 

roads, and then the Binney Street Park to the left or to the 

west.   

          And then the next slide shows you our new 

proposition, which is the addition of two commercial 

buildings to the north sliding the residential building to 

the south and creating this new public space right in the 

center of that, flanked by buildings of each side, but tied 

in a meaningful way to the rest of the fabric of the city.   

          Next slide, please? 

          And there you see layered onto that space in the 

center that I mentioned this idea of streets and networks of 

pathways that would tie this new center space into the 

adjacent context and add that sort of rich character and 

connectivity.

22

          Next slide, please?   

          And then an axonometric view, where you see the 

massings of the two commercial buildings to the right-hand 

side to the north, the new Akamai headquarters, and then 

flanking that is the residential building.   

          And as Kathy mentioned, the proposition of 

creating a submerged or below-grade substation at the center 

of this, on top of which would be a new public space that 

we'll show you some images of.   

          Next slide, please?   

          This is a plan that's been caught through the 

subgrade to describe in as simple a (sic) terms as we can 

some of the below grade infrastructure and parameters that 

drove the proposed location of the substation.   

          And so, you'll see in the center the rectangular 

form of the substation with the intermediate columns.  

Flanking it on each side is a transmission zone that allows 

the cables that are running in Broadway to transition to 

bend and connect to the substation in the orange area. 

          You'll see below that there's a cross-section that 

gives you an idea of what some of those -- the scale and 

proportion of some of those connective banks are.

18

19

20

21

22

          And then on the right-hand side in the blue is the 

distribution zone that allows all of those cables and 

infrastructure to come out of the substation and spread out 

on Binney and go out into the city itself. 

          And flanking that is that dark zone where there's 

an existing utility easement.  And so, you can see by the 

plan we've worked hard to locate the substation where it can 

go best within that -- within that space between Broadway 

and Binney.   

          We've located the cores and the structure of the 

office buildings to the right, and then the core and 

structure of the residential buildings to the left, to allow 

it all to come together. 

          And the real takeaway from this slide is it's very 

tight and it's constrained, but we've had several work 

sessions with the larger team which involve structural 

engineers, electrical engineers, the Eversource team and 

their consultants. 

          And we have found a way -- all -- actually quite 

to my surprise, when you think of all the constraints, to 

make it work and to have it function well, but also lay the 

groundwork for the real benefit, which sits above it, and 

31

22

that's the public space. 

          Next slide, please?   

          And so, here's a -- just a kind of a pull-apart 

axonometric view where you see the program pieces.  Again on 

the left facing Broadway is the residential tower, the two 

commercial towers to the north in blue, the subgrade parking 

to serve both the commercial and the residential below in 

grade, and then this machine or this engine that has been 

compacted and designed to be efficient to sit below grade in 

the center of it all. 

          And the astonishing thing to think about when 

you're seeing that is you see it's a box that is set 

approximately 110 feet below grade, with slurry walls and a 

sophisticated structure. 

          It's also been designed so that it stacks 

efficiently for various uses and functionality. 

          And then again you get the green space on the top.   

          Next slide, please?   

          And so, here's a view again of the pieces, and 

this idea of the green space in the center, and the notion 

that to a very slight degree, we're overlapping some of the 

structure of both the residential and commercial buildings, 

32

22

so that their columns kind of snake through or combine with 

the subgrade structure to fit all the programs on the site. 

          And part of what drives that is making sure that 

we have commercially viable residential floorplates as well 

as commercially viable office/life science buildings on the 

north.  And, you know, that was -- part of the mandate in 

working with the team was to make sure that the massings 

that we show in this preliminary study could work well as 

they're developed and designed to be real buildings.   

          Next slide, please?   

          And just kind of a summary diagram that shows how 

we're starting to think about slicing or rotating or 

adjusting the form of the massing at a kind of a broad 

Master Plan level, so that we can create pathways that link 

to Volpe on the lower right-hand side, and then down to 

Broadway across the neighborhoods. 

          And so, some of those slices and rotations allow 

for smaller pockets of space that bleed out into adjacent 

spaces or they allow for the building to maximize sunlight 

on the green space.  They also allow for a concept that 

creates a continuous alignment of façades you see in yellow 

and orange, as though façades relate to adjacent context.   

33

          Next slide, please?   

          And then we did do a whole series of sunlight 

studies.  You can see a grid here that looked at a 

comparison between the MDX massing and the new proposed 

massing, and we just looked at the amount of sunlight that 

was available in the two instances at varying times.   

          And I'll show you one in detail just to give you a 

sense --  

          Next slide, please? 

          -- where you see this is in June, basically, at 

the middle of the day, noontime, and on the left-hand side 

again there is the kind of current MDX plan with the two 

small spaces north and south of the existing Blue Garage, 

and some spaces around the building that fronts Binney. 

          And then the new proposal with the buildings 

rotated, both in terms of being able to open up the space to 

adjacent spaces, but also open up the space to sunlight.   

          And you'll see that in this case, and actually in 

all the other cases that we looked at, we're increasing the 

amount of daylit open space over the proposed base MDX plan, 

which I think is a really great added story to the whole 

concept of the public benefit.

          It's not only that we're creating more space and 

space that creates a room, but we're also creating more 

space that receives light -- more light throughout the 

course of the year.   

          Next slide, please?  So again just to kind of go 

back as sort of laying the groundwork for some of the 

sketches that give you a better sense of how the space might 

develop, just a recap of the vision and our goals, what we 

are trying to achieve.   

          And then just a few more slides that give a hint 

of how the space can be developed.  I want to be clear that 

by no means do the sketches or the [1:03:35 indiscernible] 

in the image suggest a final design -- more a glimpse into 

what the potential for the space might be and the kinds of 

things that we'll be studying and developing as the plan 

evolves and starts to take form and become more real.   

          Next slide, please? 

          And so, this is sort of a very loose freehand, 

birds eye sketch.  On the left-hand side you see this idea 

of the residential tower and how the addition of balconies 

and carving and massing refinements and maybe some ideas 

about a sheltering cop or something would begin to give

character to the residential tower on the left-hand side. 

          And then you see the public room, or the piazza, 

or the open space in the center, and how that can be a 

combination of green areas, paved areas. 

          And then as you work your way to the right you see 

the two commercial buildings have been shaped a little bit 

to give you an idea how the form might look within the space 

-- again carving, creating ideas of overlooks and terraces. 

          And then just the potential of a real great urban 

room that is connected downward on the page in the east to 

Volpe and the Sixth Street Connector, as well as connected 

to the Sixth Street park that they're proposing and the axis 

that goes further eastward. 

          And then if you look very closely there's also 

this idea of a pathway that connects through to the back of 

the Akamai building, visually connecting to the Binney 

Street Park, and then connecting along a pathway further 

eastward, and some ideas about the degree of planting versus 

degree of paved areas -- some ideas about how we might bring 

art or other elements into the center space. 

          Next slide, please?   

          And then just again a sketch overlay that shows

some circulation paths, as well as some of the pockets of 

spaces and nodes that will make this new urban room or urban 

piazza much more rich and connected. 

          And then next slide, please?   

          Just some basic concepts about some of the 

destination ideas that could happen within this area -- 

building entries, potentials for art, ideas about shared 

entry and amenities along the space.   

          Next slide, please? 

          And then again just to zoom in to show you the 

kind of scale and texture of the space and ideas about how 

that space might eventually be developed.  And I think the 

last couple of slides are really just very impressionistic 

ideas or sketches to give you a sense of what it would be 

like to be in the space.   

          Next slide, please? Oh, sorry.   

          Just -- again, some more precedent ideas about 

some of the concepts that we're going to look at as the 

space develops.   

          Next slide, please?   

          And finally, then, two views.  This first view if 

you look at the key on the lower left-hand side has put you

at the far corner of the space looking back across towards 

Kendall Square.  

          You see the residential tower in the foreground, 

labeled, "Number One," the park in the center, and then the 

early kind of embryotic concept of maybe an overlook or a 

slightly elevated terrace that might hold in the ventilation 

from the substation below, but create a little bit of a 

perch to look into the space. 

          And then the idea of that cross path connecting 

that to the Volpe space on the left. 

          And then one last image - next slide, please?   

          This is an image on the eastern side of the space 

looking through what we envision to be an undercut within 

the residential tower, so you can look past the back side of 

the Akamai building through to the Binney Street Park in the 

distance.   

          And then the main public room to the right labeled 

Number 3, and this idea of kind of an overhang or sheltered 

space that's sort of an indoor room, but looks to the 

outside and creates this wonderful pass-through.   

          And then maybe the idea of a refinement or a 

further development of an enhancement to the two existing

service roads.   

          So I know that was quick.  I wanted to try to stay 

on our schedule and give you an overview.  Happy to answer 

any questions and elaborate, and thank you so much for your 

time.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, thanks to all of you.  That was 

a very informative presentation, and actually quite concise 

given how complex the project is.  I applaud all of you for 

the amount of work you've done.  It's certainly very 

impressive.   

          Before we go to questions and Board discussions, 

we're going to take public comment.  We've done this shift 

since we've been doing the Zoom format -- we've taken public 

comment before we get into the discussion. 

          So because it is a public hearing, we'll move 

forward with that public comment.  And any members of the 

public who wish to speak should now click the icon at the 

bottom of the screen that says, "Raise hand."  If you're 

calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had received 

written communications from Joseph Rose and Bjorn Punen [All 

names phonetic.]  Written communications received after 5:00

p.m. yesterday will also be entered into the record. 

          Okay, so let me just take a look here.  Okay.  If 

anybody has -- okay, so some hands are starting to pop out.  

          Okay.  So I'll now ask staff to unmute speakers 

one at a time.  Speakers should begin by saying your name 

and address, and staff will confirm that we can hear you.  

After that, you'll have up to three minutes to speak before 

I ask you to wrap up. 

the public participation.   

          So I will turn it over to Jeff, and he will manage 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary, this is Jeff.  So 

I'm going to read the names as they come up here on Zoom.  I 

apologize if I mispronounce anybody's name, and I'll give a 

couple of speakers so that people can prepare. 

          So the first speaker is Matthew Connolly, to be 

followed by Heather Hoffman.  Matthew, you can start by 

unmuting yourself and giving your name and address.   

          MATTHEW CONNOLLY:  Great, thank you.  Can 

everybody hear me?      

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

          MATTHEW CONNOLLY:  Okay, great.  This is Matthew 

Connolly.  I'm at 13 Cornelius Way.  I live in the Linden

Park neighborhood, and I'm speaking on behalf of the 

neighborhood association there, which consists of about 55 

houses. 

          I want to speak in favor of this amendment.  As I 

think a lot of people on the Planning Board already know, 

this is one piece to the very complicated puzzle -- an 

important, perhaps the most important piece.   

          Our neighborhood, the Kennedy Longfellow School 

and the East Cambridge neighborhood were all very many 

concerned when the substation was proposed for Fulkerson 

Street.   

          And I'll be honest, when I thought this was going 

to -- when I first heard about that proposal, I thought it 

was going to be impossible to move that substation. 

          It turns out it was next to impossible, and it 

took an awful lot of work from an awful lot of people to 

come up with this proposal, and I think it works.  It -- in 

some ways, we're actually going to end up with something 

better, because we're going to end up with the Blue Street 

Garage going away.  We're going to end up with substation 

that's underground, that's much I think better situated and 

closer to Kendall Square.

          And given the interrelationship between this and 

the proposal that the Planning Board and the Council 

ultimately approved for Alexandria, there's going to be 

about an acre of space available on the former site, 

assuming everything works -- which will be used to a public 

purpose. 

          Whether that's housing or a park or hopefully some 

combination, this proposal I think is the piece that we need 

to make this all happen.  So on behalf of our neighborhood, 

we're very much in favor.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Heather Hoffman, who will be followed by Mark Boswell.  I 

believe it's Heather Hoffman by telephone.  You can begin.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  I'm going to start out with some heartfelt 

and honest things.  First, to Alexandria for being our ally, 

because they didn't want the substation there either.  

Second, to the CRA for doing so much better a job than their 

predecessors to improve Kendall Square, where they had 

jurisdiction. 

          And to the people who made the slides and called 

at the Sixth Street Connector:  I noticed and thank you.

          So now I'm going to get to the part that they were 

trying to forestall by the way they arranged the argument at 

the beginning.  All you've heard about is the good stuff. 

And what you haven't heard about is what got us here, and 

who's paying the price for all of this.   

          So what got us here was a failure to plan.  That 

was not the fault of the neighborhood.  Commercial 

developers, Eversource, the city, all of them were supposed 

to think about the need for infrastructure.  Not us in our 

homes in East Cambridge, Linden Park, the Port, Wellington- 

Harrington.  It's not our job and we aren't the people who 

caused the need for this.   

          Boston Properties, the people who want you to give 

them a gigantic amount of really valuable building, they are 

part of the problem, and they want you to pay them -- all of 

us -- to pay them for helping to fix a problem that they 

helped to cause.   

          And who's going to pay the price?  Well, once 

again, it's all of us who didn't cause the problem. 

          So with this project, Alexandria's new building 

and the BioMed building, we are getting more than a million 

and a half square feet of commercial development with

absolutely zero housing to deal with the fact that some -- 

the people who work in these places are going to want to 

live in the area -- at least some of them.   

          So what are we going to have?  We're going to have 

more displacement, more gentrification, rising prices -- all 

of the things that we didn't cause, but we get to bear the 

brunt of. 

          So I hope that you will think very hard about 

whether the price that we're paying is higher than what 

we're getting for it.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Mark Bowell.  Before I start, I'm just going to make one 

more reminder for anybody that hasn't spoken yet and wishes 

to speak:  Please push the, "Raise Hand" button now, or if 

you're calling by phone, push *9 on your phone, and that 

will raise your hand so that we can see that you'd like to 

speak. 

          So we'll go to Mark Boswell next.  You can unmute 

yourself and begin with your name and address.     

          MARK BOSWELL:  Hello, my name is Mark Boswell.  I 

live at 105 Walden Street, Cambridge.  And I'm commenting 

this evening about some of the proposed zoning changes,

particularly for parking and more particularly for bicycle 

parking.   

          And I saw -- I'm also a member of a local bike 

advocacy group, Cambridge Bicycle Safety.  So I'm interested 

in the city's efforts with projects to build bicycle 

infrastructure, including parking. 

          So one thing that caught my attention was there's 

a mention that the article 6.100 of the zoning regarding 

bike parking requirements isn't feasible in this project, 

and there are some substitutions to replace requirements set 

forth in that section. 

          And Article 6.100 is pretty clear about bike 

parking requirements, and it also specifies how a developer 

can obtain a special permit if those requirements can't be 

met.   

          So what I'd like to understand is why it's 

infeasible?  Was there a study or some other findings that 

led to that conclusion?  And I also noticed there's a 

mention of a bike share station being 500 feet away where 

the number of bike parking spaces in the garage could be 

reduced by up to two per shared bike.   

          And so, there is one station that's within 500 

45

feet away on Binney Street. So that could -- there are 16 

bytes in that station.  So that could be a reduction of 

possibly 32 spaces.  If there are more stations within that 

radius, then we can be talking about 32 or more bytes -- 

parking spaces eliminated.   

          So it seems like this is a bit of a weakening of 

the requirements in Article 6.100, and this is a change to 

the zoning and so I'm wondering why there is a desire to 

change the existing zoning laws instead of pursuing the 

special permits, as that could affect other projects in the 

city.  That was my only question, thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  I am going to make this 

the last call then.  There's no more attendees with their 

hands raised.  So once again, if you haven't spoken yet and 

would like to speak, please press, "Raise hands" now or 

press *9 on your phone.  I'll give it a few seconds.     

          [Pause] 

          I think that's all the speakers.  So I'll turn it 

back over to the Chair, thank you.           

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.  Okay.  

So now we're going to move from public comment to Board 

discussion.  If this hearing is continued to a future date,

and additional information is received, there will be an 

opportunity for public comment on the additional materials.  

Additional written comments may also be submitted. 

          The Planning Board has received a memo from the 

Community Development staff, who are available with 

questions.  Do Board members have any questions at this 

point for either the staff or for the petitioner's 

representatives?  If so, please raise your hand or just 

state your name, and I will recognize you.   

          Hugh?  If you'd like to begin?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I would like to get some 

clarification from staff on a matter that Mark Boswell just 

spoke about.  What are the reductions in bicycle parking 

that are being requested?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, go ahead.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  Jeff Roberts again.  I'll 

take a swing at that time.  I'm just pulling up our memo so 

I can refer to it.  So under current zoning, requirements 

for bicycle parking work more or less the same as you would 

expect for auto parking.  If you have different land uses 

each of those land uses has kind of a parking ratio -- 

minimum bicycle parking ratio.

21

22

          In the case of bicycle parking, there's 

requirements for both long-term parking, which is mainly 

interior and it's secure parking for residents or occupants 

of a building, and then there's also short-term bicycle 

parking, which is kind of like bike racks that you would 

bike racks that you would find outside. 

          So the way the base zoning requirements work, for 

any particular land use you apply the ratio and figure out 

what the required number of spaces is, and then you add that 

up for all the different uses.   

          There are provisions, though, in the zoning -- in 

addition to that, there's requirements for layout access.  

There's a lot of sort of detailed requirements in there that 

are, you know, sort of dimensional in nature. 

          And the last kind of part of the bicycle zoning 

provides for some special permit relief in cases where 

either it's not possible to meet the bicycle parking 

requirements, and the Planning Board has kind of reviewed 

this in certain cases for the existing buildings and where 

it's, you know, just technically it's not feasible to meet 

the requirements and the Planning Board has granted some 

special permit relief, or it provides for the provision of a

bicycle parking plan. 

          And that's really intended for situations kind of 

like the one we're seeing here where you have maybe multiple 

uses in one kind of larger development scheme, and rather 

than having bicycle parking just broken out for each 

particular use, you could have a more comprehensive plan 

that talks about having, you know, facilities that are maybe 

shared across different uses or, you know, in some cases, 

you know, balancing -- looking at what the actual demand for 

bicycle parking will be and kind of balancing that among 

different uses. 

          In many cases, we would expect that that could 

result in a reduction in the number of spaces you might 

need.  So an example of that might be if you have lots of 

separate uses that each have their own individual short-term 

bicycle parking requirements, but they're all kind of 

grouped together.  You could try to do that through a pooled 

facility.  

          And in some cases, you can do the same thing with 

long-term bicycle parking.   

          We've also found that there -- you know, since we 

put these bicycle parking requirements in place, bicycle 

49

22

sharing programs have become much more prevalent, and we 

know that having that bicycle sharing can provide some 

reduction in the demand for bicycle parking for people who 

use their private bicycles. 

          So in terms of the proposed zoning, it provides 

for some fairly specific kind of ratios to calculate how the 

bicycle parking might be adjusted, how the requirements 

might be adjusted for this kind of a -- sort of a campus or 

larger comprehensive plan development. 

          The -- I think the reaction from staff is that in 

general the things that are being proposed are things that 

are in line with what staff has discussed in the past as 

being -- you know, potential ways to reduce the need to 

provide a specific number and a specific type of bicycle 

parking spaces. 

          But the thing that we would note is that under 

that special permit provision, and in fact all of this 

zoning is sort of encapsulated within a Planning Board 

special permit review process that has transportation study 

requirements and, you know, the other -- you know, 

requirements to actually develop a comprehensive plan that 

comes for review by the Planning Board as well as by the

Cambridge Redevelopment Authority is that providing some 

flexibility makes a lot of sense, especially given the 

complexity of this project.   

          But we would expect that when this comes before 

the Planning Board for a special permit under that kind of 

what we call -- what they call the, "Infill Development 

Concept Plan" in the zoning that there would be more 

information provided on what the expected bicycle parking 

demand would be, and how it's being accommodated within the 

sort of mix of uses that are proposed…  and that the 

Planning Board and the staff would look more closely at what 

the specific proposal is and what the data is backing up 

that proposal and be able to, you know, help work out a 

workable solution based on that.   

          So that's kind of a longwinded explanation that 

sort of covers our take on that provision.            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So if I can reply --  

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- as I understand it, during the 

kind of the Infill Concept Plan, the actual expected demand 

will be identified and there will be a plan that would be 

put forward as to how that would be met.   

51

22

          And it may require -- may not fit the old rules, 

but still the demand will be met.  It will be up to us to 

decide -- presumably the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department to comment and make sure that happens. 

          So this isn't giving it away, it's just loosening 

a more rigid set of requirements to accomplish the same 

goal.  Is that correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I would characterize it that 

way too.  When it comes to this type of zoning, which is not 

strictly speaking of PUD zoning, but it's PUD-like zoning, 

where the zoning really establishes kind of a larger 

framework of, you know, the floor area, the uses, the 

height…   and, you know, just the broad parameters of what's 

allowed, it's all subject to a kind of a closer look by the 

Planning Board when it gets to that more advanced stage, 

where the Board and the staff can look at studies that show 

how all the different pieces of the development are going to 

fit together and how they're all going to work. 

          So having some flexibility and allowing the 

Planning Board to look at what's being proposed against what 

the expected demand is going to be is consistent with the 

way we typically do this kind of zoning.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you, Hugh.  Okay.  And 

other questions from the Planning Board?  Ted?       

          [Pause]      

questions.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted, you can go ahead with your 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Sorry.  So I have a number of 

specific questions about the text of the zoning, and then 

some more general questions.  Let me start out by saying I 

think this is a wonderful idea, and that actually this is I 

think one of the better written zoning amendments we've been 

asked to comment upon recently.  But I still do have some 

questions about it. 

          And if we could look at Section 14, the proposed 

paragraph at the end of Section 14.32.2, where it says, 

"Define 'Substation Project' and define 'Substation 

commercial GFA.'"  Then it says, "For the purposes of this 

article, the 800,000 square feet of infill GFA for 

commercial uses that is not subject may sometimes be 

referred to as substation commercial GFA." 

          And then it says, "The issuance of a building 

permit for the substation project shall precede or be issued 

53

concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any 

project utilizing substation GFA." I don't understand that.  

What is the difference between the two?  It seems it's one 

and the same thing. 

          I'm going to throw in my language questions, and 

if somebody can respond to that. 

          Section -- the replacement Section 1432.2.2 ends, 

"The actual development of a substation project shall not be 

included within the scope of a special permit approving a 

concept plan, but shall remain subject to all applicable 

regulations governing the construction of such projects."   

          I have no idea what that's saying.  You know, it 

seems to me it's saying it's not subject to Planning Board 

review, but then it is subject.  I really don't understand 

what that is saying.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Let me -- while you're flipping 

through, Ted, let me just -- because Jeff --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm sorry.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- let me just -- while you're 

flipping through, Jeff is it better for you to answer 

everything at the end, or would you rather do it as Ted 

raises the points?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm fine either way.  I'm trying to 

keep notes as best I can.  So I don't know -- if Ted wants 

to power through them, then that's --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I don't really care, whatever's 

easier.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  We'll continue 

then.   I know you're very good at keeping notes, Jeff, so I 

just wanted to double check.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And then in subsection -- 

putting in the new subsection 14.32.6 but adding a section 

7, "Electrical substation -- substation products shall be 

exempt from aggregate GFA calculation, as well as the 

requirements of the floor area ratio." 

          But then it says, "Further substation construction 

shall not constitute infill GFA or substation commercial 

GFA."  Again, I don't understand what that's saying.  It 

seems to me something is or is not the substation commercial 

GFA. 

          Those are really my actual language questions.  I 

have questions about individual aspects that go to different 

things.  So maybe if Jeff or somebody else wants to address 

the language question first while we can go to some of the

other questions that happen.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, that makes sense.  Yeah.  Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'LL take a swing at it, and maybe 

Tom Evans can jump in too.  But I think in terms of all of 

your questions, maybe it's important that there is a 

distinction between what's called the, "Substation Project"  

which is the actual facility -- you know, the substation 

transformer facility -- and I'm actually not sure now 

looking back over the zoning if that's clearly defined in a 

place that's easy to find, but I believe that that's the 

intention.  Wherever it says, "Substation Project" I think 

that means the transformer itself. 

          The substation commercial GFA where that term is 

used, that's not referring to the substation itself; that's 

referring to the additional 800,000 square feet of 

commercial floor area that is being provided as a -- kind of 

as a counterbalance to the location of the substation 

project within that site. 

          So there could be maybe some improvement to the 

terminology there I see, but I don't know, is that -- I'll 

go to Tom -- is that a correct characterization of the -- 

those terms?   

56

          TOM EVANS:  Through you, Madam Vice Chair:  The 

first premise is that the additional square footage is not 

allowed to go forward unless the substation is located on 

the site.   

          And so, part of that is because although we feel 

pretty good about the technical aspect, we still have -- or 

Eversource still has to take this to a state regulatory 

process to get the substation approved. 

          And so, the commercial GFA is tied to the 

substation actually landing on this facility.  And so, 

that's why that name "Substation Commercial GFA" was 

created.   

          The first section that was referenced was -- I 

think there's a line that you might have skipped in the 

reading of it is that the 400 square feet -- 400,000 square 

feet of residential must precede or go concurrent with that 

           And so, the residential tower that was shown has 

to become with the first commercial building or go ahead of 

GFA.  

it.   

          We'd like it to go ahead of it.  There's some 

actual infrastructure related to the substation that needs

to get completed first before that can happen. 

          The second --  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Can I interrupt?     

          TOM EVANS:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I want to ask you a question --  

          TOM EVANS:  Sure.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- before we go any further.  

What is the anticipated square footage of the Eversource 

underground project?       

          TOM EVANS:  I think it's approximately 100,000 

square feet if it was like a typical building, where you're 

measuring floor plates.  But the volume of a floor is -- 

there might be three floors of infrastructure in the 

terraces and so forth.   

          So it doesn't -- it isn't really calculated in a 

typical GFA standpoint, but it's about between 90 and 100 

feet deep.  And, you know, short of an acre in space 

underground.  And I could probably have --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So that -- is that GFA 

accounted for anywhere?       

          TOM EVANS:  No.  So essentially, we're treating 

that square footage of project as if it was parking.  And,

22

like, you would treat it in lots of other areas of the 

zoning code, where if you put parking underground it doesn't 

count as GFA.   

          And so, that's just -- so that's -- so by -- so -- 

so by submerging it, we're kind of hoping -- maybe not 

completely but -- that we're just sort of burying it and we 

can not see the substation as a major part of our urban 

landscape.  So it's exempt from GFA because…   

          So the second part of the discussion as far as the 

regulatory standpoint is that the ability to actually 

control the design specifics of a substation doesn't 

necessarily rest locally, it rests with the state or to a 

facility Siting Board. 

          And so, while we want the location association to 

be clearly outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, 

so we can know where it is and how it may impact the public 

space above it, its design itself is not something we can 

specifically locally regulate.   

          We're -- we have a lot of ideas for what would 

happen on the top of the substation, which will be a key 

part of what we will be looking to as far as public benefits 

through the Infill Development Concept Plan.

          But there may still be, like, structures and so 

forth of the substation that -- vent shafts and elevator 

access panels and so forth that might still be present in 

the urban space, and we're not presuming that the special 

permit process can regulate that, because that is deferred 

to state regulation. 

          So net GFA is exempt and the design of it is 

included for reference in the Infill Development Concept 

Plan, but not subject to it.   

          So we want to know about it, but we can't 

necessarily dictate it too directly.  We can probably 

provide guidance for the state to consider.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  Let me break up what 

you're saying into two things.  So now I understand that 

better, I'd suggest -- you know, if at some point there's 

wordsmithing involved, that you change your reference to 

substation commercial GFA.  I think that's incredibly 

confusing in light of the, "Substation Project."   

          You know, as I've been reading this, I was 

assuming that part of the substation commercial GFA included 

square footage for the actual project, the Substation 

Project.

          TOM EVANS:  I think so.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  You've clarified that for me, 

but I think it is confusing and, you know, perhaps 

Inspectional Services will understand it now, but 10,15 

years from now when there may need to be some revision or 

something, it may not be clear to everyone.  So thank you.  

          So the reference you're making about the 

development of this not being included within the scope of a 

special permit relates to further permitting by the state or 

the city or for whomever?  Is that correct?       

          TOM EVANS:  Yeah, so ultimately the final permit 

that Eversource will receive is from the state electrical 

siting board and the PU -- the Public Utility Commission of 

the state.  I think usually they will take comments by local 

Boards and community feedback and so forth to those 

decisions, but the decision ultimately rests with the state.  

          I'm not sure if it would be helpful to defer from 

someone from Eversource like Todd to speak further about 

that entitlement process for them.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I guess my only question is, 

once the state issues a permit, does the city have any say 

in what it's going to look like, or that's a done deal when

the permit is issued?       

          TOM EVANS:  I mean, I think the proposal as we've 

weighed it out is that the roof of the substation is what 

we're going to see.  And I think how that is designed and 

programmed as useable open space is something we will have a 

lot of control over through the special permit process.   

          I think we have to be aware that, you know, a vent 

shaft might shift here and there and we'll have to adjust, 

but I think that the overall concept what we're doing on the 

open space can be definitely dictated by this Board and with 

input from the CRA Board as well, and the property owner, 

which I think also has some real, vested interest in making 

sure that this isn't just the roof of a utility facility, 

but actually contributes to the urban space their buildings 

          So I think everyone, including Eversource, wants 

the top of the substation to come out as a great space for 

surround.   

Kendall.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  All right, Madam Chair 

I'm satisfied with those answers.  Can I go on to my other 

questions, or -- you're muted, actually.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you for pointing that out.

22

Yes.  Why don't you go ahead and --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, thank you.  So the 

parking requirement at 0.4 was already lower than I think 

anything else we on the Planning Board have approved in the 

past.  And going down to 0.25, you know, is almost like, 

"Why is there any minimum?"      

          And I guess this is more a question for Traffic 

and Parking, but what is the rationale for that reduction?  

I don't think we have anyone from Traffic and Parking on 

with us.  So Jeff, maybe could you explain that as you know 

it?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Sure, it's -- thanks to the Chair.  

I'll note that to the Traffic and Parking has been part of 

the discussions on this petition and has looked at the this 

at the staff level.   

          I think that the -- you know, the response from 

staff is similar to the response for bicycle parking that -- 

you know, given the complexity of this project -- you know, 

providing a decent amount of flexibility makes sense.   

          But ultimately, this will come before the Planning 

Board and we'll have to -- and we'll have to provide the 

information on what the expected transportation impacts are 

63

going to be, including parking demands.   

          When it comes to parking, you know, we've seen -- 

and certainly Planning Board members have seen that that 

parking can be accommodated a lot of different ways.  We've 

seen shared parking approaches that are successful.   

          We've seen some off-site parking be provided in a 

successful way, and we know that there are sites within and 

around Kendall Square that have excess parking that might be 

available for people to use. 

          So I think this -- you know, I think the intent -- 

and I won't speak too much for the intent -- I'll let the 

petitioners do that -- but I think it goes along with the 

notion of just making sure that there's enough flexibility 

provided to make sure that this can really be accomplished. 

          But ultimately the details are going to have to 

come before the Planning Board to look at how the developer 

plans to manage the demand for parking among these different 

uses.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, well, I guess -- you 

know, the follow-up question to that is, is that then going 

to become a standard for other projects, or how we deal with 

other developers who say, "Well, you've gone down to 0.25

22

here, why can't we get 0.25 also?" Just something to think 

about.   

          And a related question is I don't know that -- you 

know, there's a reduction or an allowed increase in the 

distance of parking spaces from 1000 to 2000 feet, which is 

a fairly significant -- you know, increase of a distance 

people will have to walk.   

          And I'm -- you know, we insist on bicycle parking 

being very close, but a lot of other people, you know, may 

drive and now we're saying they can be further away. 

          And pedestrians if they're taking public 

transportation, if they're taking the T they're going to 

have a considerable walk.  I mean, I don't necessarily 

object to it in concept, but it seems like we're setting up 

all sorts of different standards for different people, for 

different citizens.   

          And, you know, for people who if they live in that 

tower, you know 2000 feet is a fair hike.  You know, if this 

is all something that Traffic and Parking is going to be 

working on and then is going to come back, you know, to the 

Planning Board to review it, I think it's still going to be 

difficult to say, "Well, the ordinance says 2000 feet, but

we want it to be less than that." I just question that. 

          Another question may simply be my ignorance, but 

what is complimentary valet bicycle parking?  I've never 

seen that term or --      

to explain that?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Can I get someone maybe from the -- 

          TOM EVANS:  Yeah.  Madam Chair, that would be a 

system where you have an on-site staff person available to 

receive someone's bicycle and park it in a manner that 

provides, I think, even more convenient service for 

commuters.                     

          But in order to use space efficiently, they may 

then use some stacking facilities or so forth to keep bikes 

closer together, just like you would if you go to a valet 

garage in those urban areas and they're just -- cars are not 

individually accessed, you need to wiggle them around a 

little bit to get your valet out.              

          So the idea is it's complimentary, so it would be 

at no cost to the commuter, and you would just show up; 

probably by then have an app and sort of say, "I'm coming 

down, I want my bike ready, and it will be there waiting for 

you."

22

          It has been -- there is precedent of this in both 

New York and San Francisco that I'm aware of, and I believe 

Boston Properties has a building in Manhattan that provides 

this service, so they are familiar with how those operations 

work. 

          There are times now that the commercial garages in 

Kendall Square have to move to a partial valet system as 

well in order to -- that's actually how the garage that 

serves the Ames Street residential -- the Proto building -- 

if there's full demand in that garage without expanding that 

garage, they're able to meet the parking demand of that 

through some valet -- some personnel are moving the cars 

around. 

          Obviously not right now, but in the future, I see 

that happening more and more as we try to use these garage 

structures efficiently, so we're not building a whole lot 

more parking garages, but using their space efficiently. 

          So for bikes it would be more that the bikes would 

be -- you know, maybe stacked together in some sort of 

vertical stacking that is not currently allowed under the 

bike standards.   

          But if you have an able-bodied person working as

that valet, they could then provide even a higher level of 

parking service.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, that's how I thought it 

might work.  I didn't know whether it's been done anywhere 

in this area.  Now, another question, the comments we've 

received have made a fairly strong case for retaining the 

concept of homeownership in the residential units.   

          And I'd like to know the rationale for doing away 

with the 2015 Letter of Commitment.  I mean, I've seen the 

statement that it's -- you know, infeasible, it's 

economically infeasible.  I'd like to know the rationale for 

that conclusion.       

          TOM EVANS:  Madam Chair, I'll start just to say 

that as everyone has already noted, this is an extremely 

complex project with lots of moving parts.  The residential 

is a part that we feel is really important and we want that 

delivered as quickly with the same levels of affordability 

that we've had in the zoning since 2015. 

          This is another layer of complexity that I'll let 

Boston Properties speak to a little bit more specifically, 

but it was not seen as a component of public housing policy 

that this CRA Board was really wed to as super vital, as 

68

compared to the affordability component or just the delivery 

of the housing to begin with. 

          And the reason why it's written as a Letter of 

Commitment in the last go around was definitely sort of an 

eleventh-hour change to the zoning petition that was done on 

the last night or ordination for the zoning.   

          And it had been determined actually ahead of going 

to City Council that zoning really is not set up to regulate 

tenancy for housing.  And so while -- when this issue was 

being presented, the Letter of Commitment was put in as 

something kind of aside but outside of zoning. 

          With that, Madam Chair, if I might pass it onto 

Mike Tilford from Boston Properties to speak a little bit 

more about their housing challenges with the condominiums.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  That would be 

helpful.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  Hello, Madam Chair, Mike Tilford 

with Boston Properties, 82 [1:53:28 indiscernible] Street.  

          A couple of things:  One is the idea of financial 

feasibility I think is a to be determined thing for urban 

condos -- sort of the present market circumstance that 

that's not necessarily where we're focused.

          I think in a vacuum anything is doable.  In fact, 

our current improved plan calls for that.  We stand by ready 

to do it if this doesn't work out. 

          What we're saying is in the context of what is 

fundamentally a much larger, more complicated -- more 

complicated than anything we've done project -- the desire 

to reduce these complications as part of the consideration 

is really, really important to us.   

          You know, we've gone through a number of public 

meetings with CRA.  We've got proposals from the existing 

improved building, which is a mixture of condos and 

apartments.   

          And it's not a simple challenge.  You layer in the 

idea of what is fundamentally a massive amount of civil 

infrastructure into this, and we have a threshold for 

complex, just like anybody else.  And so, part of our 

proposal is looking to remove that partial component.   

          In consideration for that, we're looking to 

accelerate all of our housing obligation out of the previous 

sub zoning.  You know, presently the phase is calling for 

350,000 GFA residential building, which we are now proposing 

to do -- sorry, 350,000 Part A and 70,000 part B, with this

petition looking to do all 420,000 at once. 

          Additionally, if one were to look at the spatial 

requirements of condominiums, which are usually a bit 

larger, for good reason, and transit that purely to a rental 

product, it results in a net larger benefit of more housing 

units and more affordable housing units by extension. 

          So the answer is, this is perhaps the most 

complicated project Boston Properties has ever undertaken, 

ever -- 100-foot-deep substations, 1400 parking stalls being 

moved, multiple parties, cooperation has been required from 

the CRA Staffing Board, City Staff, the public utilities of 

Eversource, Alexandria Properties, multiple stakeholders 

around the area from Biogen to Akamai to Vicinity Electric.  

This requires a lot of people and a lot of coordination, and 

this is one element. 

          The ownership piece and rental piece -- that is an 

immediate, larger burden which threatens the viability of 

it.  So I hope I've been succinct.   I don't typically 

answer.  I'm happy to answer all the questions too.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And I understand what you're 

saying, but if I can go back to Tom or maybe to Kathy, so do 

I understand it that this homeownership was not something

that the CRA necessarily wanted?  Was this a requirement of 

the Council?       

          TOM EVANS:  Correct.  Throughout the Chair, when 

we put the original MXD zoning to align with the K2 plan 

forward, we did a lot to drive the affordability component 

up and actually still rest at 25 percent overall below 

market.  So it's just higher than inclusionary.   

          But when we did this, it actually was -- 

inclusionary still sat at the previous level of 15 percent 

or 11 and a half percent. 

          So when we went through that up zoning, we were 

very insistent on wanting to go above and beyond the 

standard inclusionary zoning, and were -- and pushed both an 

affordable component and a middle income component, and 

never found the -- because this conversation had happened 

five years as well -- that the regulating tendency didn't 

have nearly as much of a public benefit or urgency as the 

affordability component.         

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mm-hm.       

          TOM EVANS:  And we've kind of considered it once 

again, because we heard feedback from some of the same 

individuals, and have been consistent that while we

understand the value of having a full range of housing 

options throughout the city -- and perhaps there isn't 

enough new condominium developments coming on the market, 

because rental is more prolific -- that it was just the -- 

I…  especially on the market rate side, whether you're doing 

market rate condos or market rate pats, just didn't seem 

like it was really central to drive that, especially if it 

was threatening the viability of the project.   

          I'll let Kathy speak to that a little bit more if 

she'd like.   

          KATHLEEN BORN:  Thanks, Tom.  I guess I'd also 

like to add -- well, I'd like to reiterate what Tom said, 

that the condominium component was not something that the 

CRA or in particular the CRA Board had any involvement in.  

          This was an eleventh-hour addition as a side 

agreement to the zoning petition in 2015.  It happened at 

10:30 at night on the night of the ordination and wasn't 

something that the CRA opposed or supported. 

          Now that it has come up again, there are a couple 

of things that the CRA Board has discussed.  One is to try 

to parse what are the benefits to having a hybrid building 

that's part homeownership and part rental, and the sort of

social benefits?   

          And the other one which I think Mike Tilford has 

addressed to some extent are the both architectural and 

marketing problems.  I'm going to take the first one first.  

          And I don't think there's any doubt that in terms 

of the 20 percent of the units in the project -- really 25 

percent, 20 percent to affordable housing and five to middle 

income housing, it would be really, really nice and really, 

really a wonderful thing to have that amount of affordable 

homeownership -- units someplace certainly in East 

Cambridge. 

          And there are sites in which the CRA is ready, 

willing and able to participate in that discussion, in which 

we see it as an opportunity. 

          The 80 percent of the units that are market rate 

condominiums -- I have nothing against condominiums, but I 

have trouble arguing for the public benefit.  And I started 

my comments by talking about public benefits. 

          I have trouble understanding where is the public 

benefit in very high priced condominiums in this project.  I 

think you know, Ted, because you're an attorney, that a 

public agency can't dictate who buys those condominiums?

          And we all know that luxury condominiums in Boston 

-- a large portion of them are owned by outside investors, 

or people who are not even using them as their primary 

residence. 

          And I think we just don't see the public bn in 

mandating that half of the units in the building will be 

condominium projects -- condominium, have the condominium 

form of ownership. 

          It also -- besides what Mike had mentioned had 

been determined in our project, you know, as we took the 

prior project, the prior housing projects through the 

permitting, that there's a great deal of duplication of 

space, because people who are paying high amounts of -- 

putting high amounts of capital into condominium projects -- 

expect amenities that are different from the rental market. 

          And so, there was duplication of lobbies, 

duplication of shared amenities, duplication of even 

something as simple as mailrooms. 

          Lastly, from a very, very particular point of 

view, this building you noticed from Tony Markese's 

renderings is conceived to have a kind of reduced entry 

level, so that the building could have a big overhang and 

75

open -- provide an opening into the public space.   

          So there is even less space on the entrance level 

for an additional set of elevators, for an additional 

mailroom, for an additional lobby that would be needed for 

the segregated rental and -- "segregated," I'm sorry I 

didn't mean to use that word -- for the separate, you know, 

rental and condo spaces.            

          So I'm sorry, that was a bit of a longwinded 

explanation, but we just don't think that this makes sense 

for this residential building.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, great.  Thank you.  

Because I mean if it really was a City Council issue, then I 

don't think I need to deal with it.  The Planning Board --    

          KATHLEEN BORN:  Let me be clear, it was a former 

City Council issue.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well.     

          KATHLEEN BORN:  Not clear whether it will be an 

issue for this City Council.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  I see that as their 

issue.  All right.  One -- Madam Chair, one last question.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Sounds all right, very good.  Mm-hm?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So in the event that this is

adopted, and then the substation cannot be relocated to this 

site, where does that leave the CRA and the city under this 

ordinance?  Will all the changes to height and parking 

requirements and frontage requirements and all of those 

things remain in existence?   

          Because if the adoption of the changes was to give 

a benefit to Boston Properties, the developer, to assist 

them in the financial issues involved, does that not end up 

being just an outright gift to them if, you know, it doesn't 

happen, even if everybody's -- you know, best efforts to get 

it to occur, it still doesn't happen.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Tom, did --      

          TOM EVANS:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- we take a crack at that?       

          TOM EVANS:  Sure.  Through you, we're very clear 

this the square footage component is not -- that Boston 

Properties has no access to the additional square footage of 

Eversource.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  I understand that.       

          TOM EVANS:  The -- I guess the height district 

would still apply, the as written.  And it kind of -- would 

be an interesting puzzle to figure out how to un -- sort of,

like, unwind all of those, like, small dimensional text 

pieces throughout the petition to only apply with the 

Substation Project.   

          I think that the actual application of them would 

be minimal, partially because the only entitlement left for 

Boston Properties is to build a 350,000 square feet housing 

project, which they would -- which they have already done 

some design work on, and would have to begin work on right 

away.   

          So I don't think that they would use the height.  

I guess there's a possibility there could be a little bit of 

shaving of the retail component, but the -- actually as 

proposed now, the building is set back in a manner that 

actually didn't trigger the active use requirement, because 

of the park that was in front of it. 

          So I guess that would leave us with the parking 

component, and that would -- figure out how to unwind the 

text on that.   

          We do -- when we -- I'm not sure if you recall, 

but when we came forth with 0.25 the first time around in 

2015 because that was I think the data we were seeing in the 

high density residential projects in Kendall as what was

being utilized.  And I think that data still tracks.   

          So I still think that from a planning perspective, 

there's value in reducing automobile parking in a transit 

rich location like Kendall Square. 

          So I -- so, but yeah, so there would be some 

component to that that I guess would still apply, though I 

think that their -- again, their application would end up 

being very limited because of the Infill Development Concept 

Plan which, you know, is moving forward with a certain 

package of entitlement.  It's already approved by the 

Planning Board and the CRA.   

          So those changes would have to -- would only be 

accepted I guess through another special permit round.  So 

that would then leave the Planning Board and CRA to 

reevaluate those contexts, because it would have to change 

the existing special permit.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Let me just move on.  We 

can come back, Ted, to that later if we need to.  But let's 

see if others have questions.  Lou?  Did you have anything 

you wanted to ask?

questions.           

          COLLECTIVE:  [Laughter]  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thanks, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Here, here.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  A couple of small ones.  I 

do agree, we don't have much say on the substation component 

of this, but all the stuff in the public realm -- that big 

green space -- we should have some input there.  

           I don't know, I know everyone's going to have 

input, but I don't know whose wins.  That could get funny 

there.  So that's one of the things. 

          On the parking rates, is there any change in the 

commercial parking rates at your commercial buildings?  You 

have some sizeable parking garages there.  And while I'm at 

the parking, I don't believe there are any provisions in 

your residential component for parking, is that correct?       

          TOM EVANS:  So in the -- first off, nothing 

changed in the commercial parking caps.  So in the MXD, as 

is true in some of the other PUDs in Kendall Square, there's 

no minimum at all for commercial.  There's a cap of 0.8 0.9, 

depending on whether it's office or lab.   

          The proposal that was kind of working it was way

through in the Infill Development Concept Plan was planning 

to basically reuse the Blue Garage and reapportion some of 

those parking spaces for residential.  I think that the 

proposal from the structural standpoint was that a third of 

the garage would have been taken down and then rebuilt with 

the housing on top of it. 

          So certainly there probably could be some 

efficiencies gained in a redesign.  But yeah, there was not 

a significant amount of additional parking supply created by 

that.  It would have just been either partially valeted and 

partially redistribution between the residential and the 

commercial. 

          As it works at the Proto, which is set up in a 

similar way, the -- when people were leasing their 

apartments, they are given the option to have a parking 

space, and then that parking space is taken out of the 

commercial pool.   

          So it's not creating a new space, it just means 

really ends up being there's less transient parking 

available in that garage, as renters come that actually want 

to take advantage of the parking provided. To date, I don't 

think that that has surpassed the 25 percent of the

apartments at the Proto. 

          But yeah, so then in the Infill Development 

Concept Plan, besides a little bit of efficiency, there 

wasn't much new parking being built for the housing.  I can 

double check on exactly --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So the residential component 

provides no parking, and I believe you're using that area 

actually under the building and beside the building to feed 

the new substation, correct?       

          TOM EVANS:  Oh no, so -- I'm sorry, in the plan 

moving forward, the residential parking would be provided 

not on the site of the residential building, but in the new 

commercial garages that will be built on the other side of 

the block.   

          And I believe one of the reasons for needing the 

2000 feet for offsite location is that there's probably a 

phase -- there's a phasing challenge, where the housing may 

go before the commercial buildings.  And so, that -- those 

residential parking spaces may be a sign to different 

garages at different times, as the project builds out.   

          So it might be across the street in the parking 

garage that the Brode [phonetic] sits in.  It might be back

in the Green Garage.  It might be supplied in one of 

Alexandria's buildings, because they have a role in 

balancing the parking.  That's part of the complex deal that 

was discussed earlier in the year for the net pipe site. 

          So the -- to meet those residential parking 

minimums and or the demand, they may have to shop around for 

available parking spaces in a couple different places, until 

their commercial buildings, which may lag a little bit, have 

their garages completed. 

          We want -- we really look forward to the housing 

component being accelerated, and we think technically that 

the housing component can get underway ahead of -- 

significantly ahead of the substation construction and the 

commercial, because they just have to engineer a duct bank 

for the cables to run under.  And once that structure is 

figured out, the housing can go up above it.   

          So there's a very complex phasing component of 

this, and a plucking would be part of that dance between 

where exactly renters might have their parking provided.  It 

could be a couple different garages, so they need a little 

bit more range of walking.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You are going to depend on

the commercial components of parking at some point to share 

their loads with parking?       

          TOM EVANS:  Probably --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So I was curious.  I also -- 

that's what I thought the 2000 feet was about also.       

          TOM EVANS:  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  one other thing I had:  Can 

you go over a quick -- just a quick and rough phasing of how 

you see this being built out?       

          TOM EVANS:  Yeah, there's actually -- we tried to 

keep our slide deck pretty short, but there's a couple good 

phasing diagrams that I don't know if we have the --    

          MIKE TILFORD:  We can -- if it's -- if Swaathi's 

able to give screen sharing to Brian Skrovig or Tony 

Markese, and if they can pull up that sequence to answer Mr. 

Bacci's questions, that might be the most efficient.       

          TOM EVANS:  Yeah.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  I don't know Swaathi, is that 

possible?       

          MARY FLYNN:  She might be able to do that, but 

quite honestly from my point of view, that slide was so, so 

jam packed with info, it was really hard to read it.  So I

think if you could just do a verbal explanation, that would 

be more helpful.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I was going to say 

just verbally would be good enough.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  Yeah, okay.  It's -- and I'll rely 

upon my team to correct me where I stumble because, you 

know, it's funny.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  If you need to see it, that's 

fine.  They don't have -- you know --    

          MIKE TILFORD:  No, I can do it verbally --     

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  -- as well, and if we have 

something that works, Swaathi, on this that would be great.  

Probably not with schedule constraints.  This one is 

definitely worth studying later.  I don't think this speaks 

well.   

          We have a -- we've got a supplementary deck, but 

I'll go through it.  You know, we have to demolish the Blue 

Garage.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  We have to take --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Excuse me.         

85

          MIKE TILFORD:  -- those parkers --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Excuse me.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  -- who we have obligations to and 

locate them temporarily.  We then have to dig out a new 

garage, effectively, and a new substation.  When the 

substation is complete, including the cable spreading floor 

which you alluded to and studied, what happens underneath 

the residential, we then can build the buildings.   

          So I guess in three simple steps:  demolish Blue 

Garage, reallocate parking, dig down for both the permanent 

parking as well as the substation, and then from that point 

build the buildings up.   

          Ian, do you want to add any color to that, or is 

that a good breakdown thing?   

          IAN JOHNSTON:  No, I think you got it.           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Excuse me.  If somebody wants to 

share their screen for the discussion, you're more than 

welcome to do that.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  Well, that's wonderful.  You know, 

Brian and Tony:  Again, just for graphical purposes, if you 

like, there's that sequence of about four slides, if it's 

possible to share.  It's a little clearer, Madam Chair.

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, sure.  That would be helpful.  

          BRIAN SKROVIG:  I believe -- Swaathi, this is 

Brian Skrovig speaking -- when we go to click on, "Share 

screen" it says, "Host is disabled participant screen 

sharing."          

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Can you try now?   

          BRIAN SKROVIG:  Yeah, no problem.  There we go, 

yep.  We got it now.  I'll pull it up, one second.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  Okay, great.  So here we have -- 

this is just a little clearer, I know we've packed a lot in 

-- the existing condition of the north parcel, and that the 

orange block is the Blue Garage approximately 1140 parking 

stalls.  Let's go to the next slide. 

          So we demolished that garage and dug these three 

separate facilities.  And again, the parkers that were there 

are accelerated temporary parking facilities while this

          You see the substation 107 feet, which is steeper 

than we have historically gone, but we have been excavating 

this area for a while so we're familiar with the subgrade 

          You see what's called the, "Below grade cable 

spreading floor" underneath the residential site, which is 

an important part of Eversource infrastructure to allow the 

transmission cables to come into the site and reach the

          Let's go to the next slide?  [Part of the below-

          So there you see, okay, one commercial building, 

the important open space above the substation below grade, 

and the residential.   

          And let's go to the next slide.   

          We would then demolish what is known as either 14 

CC (phonetic) or 250 Binney -- my apologies for the address 

confusion there.  That's the existing two-story building on 

the edge of the connector on Binney.   

          Next slide?   

          And then that would again become another building 

site with more parking.  Those two garages, the two purple 

sections, are joined to be the combined garage. 

          And then last slide? 

          And then there is the final condition there.  So I

hope that explains it a little more clearly.  It's a lot of 

moving pieces.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I pretty much had 

that idea.  Don't these buildings bear on the structure for 

the substation also?  Is that correct?     

          MIKE TILFORD:  The residential is presently 

anticipated to partially bear on it.  You know, where (sic) 

we come before the ICP Master Plan, I think we'll probably 

have some more refinements to that, but yes, there is a -- 

it's really almost impossible to untangle it.  And our 

Construction Department very much would like us to do that, 

so we've tried as hard as possible.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And the new commercial 

buildings, they will -- the parking will be built to the 

max?  Will be maxed out?         

          MIKE TILFORD:  No.  The parking maximum is 0.9 per 

thousand.  So we have to replace -- we have 1136 spaces, and 

then you know, what is additional to that will be at a 

lesser ratio than would otherwise be allowed by max.  So in 

the end, this results in a net decrease in parking from what 

would be allowable under the maximum commercial.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And I guess you know how of

much of a reduction?     

          MIKE TILFORD:  We're working on that.  You know, I 

think with these garages, PC -- Pickard Chilton -- does a 

wonderful job.  You know, I can get you a specific ratio, 

honestly, Mr. Bacci, so we'll work on that.  But it is -- 

geez, at least half.  But yeah, it's not immaterial, if that 

helps.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It's substantial, yeah, 

that's what I thought.  My concern is the parking for the 

residential buildings.  Pretty soon, people will be taking 

the train to go to their cars.  So we just have to be 

careful of this.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  Well stated and understood.  We're 

going to rely upon some of the 88 Ames data and some 

countercyclical parking elements to help net aggregate 

reduction of parking within Cambridge, but your point is 

very well taken and will be studied I'm sure by TP&T 

thoroughly.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Steve, do you have 

questions?  You're muted.   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, I had a number of

questions about the parking and the parking ratios, but I 

think they've been clarified.  And just if I could just 

quickly give comment.   

          On the parking, you know, these are the owners of 

the properties and, you know, if they think that they have 

enough parking for all of their -- you know, tenants and 

users, I'm happy to defer to them.  Usually it's the other 

way around.  You know, we want to reduce the number of 

spaces and the owner developers wish to have more.  Things 

have shifted. 

          I think the only other question that I had at this 

point is sort of the economics of this entire proposal.  You 

know, we're talking about big numbers here.  The value of 

800,000 square feet is -- gosh, I don't even know, somewhere 

between $100 million dollars and $300 million dollars.  But 

on the other hand, the developers have a lot of obligations 

at great cost. 

          I guess I just -- you wonder if there's anybody 

from the city that has really gotten into the weeds in the 

economic analysis and come to the conclusion that this is 

from a financial perspective -- forget about planning for 

the moment -- just from a financial perspective, whether

this is a reasonable balance of costs and benefits.   

          And I'm sure there's some in the study, and I 

guess we already heard it from Ms. Hoffman earlier.  You 

know, we want to be sure and we want to be clear when we 

speak to the city that this is not perceived to be a 

giveaway.     

that?       

          MIKE TILFORD:  Would you like me to respond to 

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure.     

          MIKE TILFORD:  Okay.  so there are two -- I don't 

want to speak for the CRA, but we are presently engaged, or 

have been engaged by two independent financial analysts -- 

one by the CRA and one by CDD staff, which we can belief is 

consistent with the new Council order, and it's a new 

process to me.  I think they're in the process of 

determining that.   

          You, roughly speaking, the costs of bearing the 

parking as well as replacing the substation is in the $350 

million-dollar range.  I think if one were to divide public 

benefit costs in between what I'll call, "elective and 

statutory" -- statutory being things like incentive linkage, 

which are very well-defined, elective being somewhat

dependent upon the circumstance -- I think the number is 

well in excess of elective zoning efforts elsewhere.   

          However, there are two independent consultants to 

look into that, and, you know, our economics are based upon 

our costs at work.  And, you know, we understand if it's not 

acceptable, but we think it's a very strong and large 

number.       

          MARY FLYNN:  So, Mike, if I could ask you:  Those 

two financial -- sets of financial analyses, does the City 

Council review those prior to making -- well, obviously they 

would if they were going to do it, they would do it prior to 

making a final decision on this?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  If I would --  

          MIKE TILFORD:  Oh, go ahead, please.  Yeah, Jeff 

probably knows better.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is -- yeah, there's maybe a 

better question directed to Staff.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  And thanks for the 

question.  So, as Mike noted, the City Council -- I believe 

this was last year -- sent a request to -- a policy order --

to the administration to begin providing the Council with a 

financial analysis of zoning petitions.  And that's the way 

that we are proceeding with this effort.   

          So it's -- and we provided updates to the Council 

on this.  You know, it takes some time to do the analysis, 

so there is some -- you know, between the filing of the 

petition and then having results to give to the City 

Council, there's a little bit of time.   

          But our expectation is we'll be delivering that, 

and the consultant who's doing it is Karl Seidman and in 

partnership with another firm.  He's done work for the city 

in the past, looking at these types of questions. 

          So we'll have that analysis for the City Council 

at some point in the future.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, all right.  Steve, did you have 

any other follow up or other questions?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  No, just as far as questions go, 

I think the financial thing was a big one, and knowing that 

there's a third party analysis coming, I think it's 

essential not only from our perspective, but from a 

political perspective for the city. 

          And again, parking -- gosh, if that number of 

94

parking works for the owners, and it works for the tenants, 

then it works for me, it works for us.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted, did you have your hand up again?  

Did you have a follow-up question?  No?  Okay.  Hugh, 

anything else?  Any other questions from you?  Or are you 

good?             

have a few comments.       

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I don't have any questions; I do 

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  We're going to move into 

comments.  Actually, yes -- and I don't have any additional 

questions.  The -- I had the same one as Steve in terms of 

the economics.  So that's been asked and answered.   

          So let's go to comments, then.  Hugh?  Let's start 

with you.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I was afraid that might happen.       

          MARY FLYNN:  You can't open the door there.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So my basic reaction to this 

proposal is that it's solving a very important problem, 

which is providing electricity to the eastern portion of the 

city, which -- I think it was Heather pointed out -- 

represents playing sort of catchup with this -- dealing with 

this question.  But it's a very serious effort to find the

resolution.  And that's good. 

          And on some sense, providing more commercial FAR 

in Kendall Square in the next decade is an advantage, 

because there seems to be a strong demand for people to want 

to have their technology businesses in Kendall Square, and 

we should do it if it's possible to do it. 

          So the concerns I have are sort of, in a way 

they're planning concerns, and this is a zoning enabling 

act, a zoning act that enables stuff, but it's going to come 

to us as for a special permit.  But I am concerned about the 

distance between the parking and the residential building, 

and whether that becomes a burden.   

          I'm concerned that in other projects over the last 

couple of decades, we have usually tried to get a mix of -- 

if there's new FAR being created, that it be a mix of 

housing and commercial.   

          And I see the 400,000 square feet in this proposal 

as actually the mix for a bunch of other commercial 

development that’s already gone forward.  So it doesn't 

essentially count, and it appears that there is no way on 

site to provide additional housing.   

          Kathy Born in her remarks suggested that the

Redevelopment Authority was eager to work to provide other 

housing sites, work to facilitate people at other housing 

sites.  Maybe this is something that a Letter of Commitment 

that permits not the CRA, who I believe has -- we can, let's 

put it that way -- you know?   

          But is there something that Boston Properties can 

do?  Some commitment they can make to facilitate other 

housing projects, some of which might be condominiums, to 

meet that segment of the population in the eastern part of 

the city?  Or maybe just anywhere in the city. 

          Now, saying that, I -- Boston Properties is not a 

company that has particular skills in doing small housing 

projects.  That's not their expertise.  But they might be 

able to partner in some way to help facilitate that.   

          Two more points:  The illustrations on pages 13 

and 14 of the presentation show the building that’s adjacent 

to the Sixth Street Connector to be visually considerably 

lower than -- as I say, the East Building is lower than the 

West Building, although the zoning doesn't require that.  

And right now, the Connector has a two-story building, and a 

view of sky and lights.   

          If there's a 250-foot building right next to that 

97

Connector, and there's going to be three of them between 

Binney Street and Broadway, because two of them are on the 

Volpe site -- you know, the Volpe site has really 

substantial setbacks in some of those parcels -- but is the 

Connector viable if it's a pedestrian connector going 

through a canyon that's in the -- between 20-story high-rise 

buildings.  Does that change the character?  I'm concerned 

about that. 

          And then the other thing I'm concerned about is -- 

and I'm not certain of this, but it looks like the existing 

commercial buildings on the -- in this block that are 

between the garage and either the Volpe site or Galileo 

Street and Binney Street -- that the loading is on the 

present roadways next to the Garage. 

          So if you're constructing an open space in, you 

know, roughly a third of that length, is it going to be 

actually -- are there going to be loading docks that are 

going to be the defining features on either the building -- 

the existing buildings on either side?  And that's seems 

something that needs to be thought about.   

          And I do think open space bounded by loading docks 

is probably not as valuable as other kinds of open space.

          So I -- how does this fit in our response to the 

City Council?  I'm on board with the overall concept.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I do think there are things that 

need to be worked out in the design.  I was interested that 

Tony's were -- had, like, eight massing strategies for the 

commercial and residential buildings, which indicates, you 

know, the point at which the design has progressed.  It's -- 

and some of them look more interesting to me than others.   

          I assume when they come for a special permit there 

will be a single proposal that will be better than any of 

the ones they’ve shown, because that seems to be the Packard 

Chilton way of doing things.   

          So I -- can't we go forward tonight to craft a 

recommendation, or are there too many points from my 

colleagues on the Board and their questions have raised a 

lot of questions?  Do those questions need to get answered 

at the Planning Board, or are they questions that need to 

get answered at the Council level?  I don't know the answer 

to that.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, we will all consider 

that as we move forward with thoughts from your colleagues.

All right, Steve, would you like to go next?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Well, I guess I would only -- to 

some extent reiterate what I said before.  I think generally 

speaking, it's a great plan.  But picking up on the last 

comments, you know, I had some concerns about the economics 

but that's ultimately going to be reviewed by other parties 

and ultimately decided by the City Council.   

          So other than raising the issue, I have no further 

concerns about that.  And as I said, parking was my only 

other concern.   

          But, you know, the impact of having inadequate 

parking is on the tenants and on the owners.  And they are 

clearly -- they are thoughtful, you know, serious, smart 

guys and they have gone through the analysis, and they have 

determined that they have enough parking. I am very happy to 

defer to their judgment in that regard.   

          So those are the only two areas of concern I had.  

Other than that, great project.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  How do you feel about the 2000 

foot distance on the parking?  The residential parking?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  You know, again, that's -- it's 

really a marketing question.  And was that too far?  You

know, I don't know.  Would that work for me?  I don't know.  

But that's their judgment to make, and if they're wrong, 

they're the ones that suffer the consequences.  You know, 

maybe they have more difficulty leasing.  But I don't think 

that it's necessarily a city public issue, I think it's a 

private issue.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So you're ready to give it a 

positive recommendation?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes, I am.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Lou, what are your thoughts?  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Well, overall I think it's a 

great effort.  And to Hugh's point, I do agree.  This is 

leftover housing; it was never created and I think it 

shouldn't really even come into consideration.   

          The only thing that's going to be traded here is a 

substation for two new commercial buildings.  That's the 

real question. 

          I would like to see as much parking as possible 

put into the new commercial buildings, just to help with the 

parking load from the residential.  I don't know how this 

works.  I'm sure Traffic and Parking will do a lot of work 

on it.

          One of my problems -- and I'm sure this is so 

early in the game that they just haven't really gotten their 

heads wrapped around the parking is there was no really 

concise place to put the parking, and could be here, could 

be there, it could be -- well, we need to know a little more 

than, "it could be."  That's part of the problem.   

          But all in all, I think they've done a great job, 

and I'd like to see it go forward.  And I do agree that the 

2000 feet is kind of stretching it.  I wouldn't like to see 

it go any further, that's for sure.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.  Well, I think relocating 

the substation to this place is a great idea.  I think it -- 

you know, the Metropolitan Pipe project is more or less 

premised on it.  You know, we've got Linden Heights, we've 

got -- you know, the people near the Kennedy School.  It's a 

benefit for a large portion of these neighborhoods in East 

Cambridge. 

          And I'm prepared to go forward and make a 

recommendation now, you know.  The questions I have, you 

know, they were answered to my satisfaction.  I think as the 

CDD Staff memo suggested, that they be instructed to

continue working on the language.  I think just clarifying a 

couple of the issues in the language would be fine.   

          Knowing that the CRA was not particularly 

interested in the homeowners' provision, I think that's a 

political decision for the City Council to make.  You know, 

I may disagree with the CRA's position about the benefit of 

homeownership capacity, but, you know, I think that's really 

something for the Council to determine if they were the ones 

who inserted the commitment letter. 

          Personally, you know, I don't really mind the 

changes in the density and other dimensional requirements, 

should this whole thing fall apart.  And I think, you know, 

they will have to come back to the CRA, the Planning Board 

to change what's already been approved, if they should wish 

to do that. 

          The financial issue I think is one that if there 

is indeed independent analysis being made:  Again that 

becomes a political question for the City Council to 

determine, you know.  But financial aside, I think 

aesthetically it will be a big benefit to the entire city, 

not just these neighborhoods.  You know?  I'm -- parking is 

a concern.  I agree with Steve, you know, that it is a 

103

marketing issue.   

          But, you know, there are going to be afford 

housing there and people are going to be living there, and 

they should have, you know, the same access to parking that 

everyone else throughout the rest of the city has.   

          And, you know, 2000 is a long distance to say 

you've got to walk a third of a mile back and forth to get 

your car, you know, in the middle of the winter in the rain 

or whatever the weather is.   

          I don't know that distance to the Kendall Square T 

stop.  I mean, obviously a lot of people who are going to be 

living in the Volpe site or working in the Volpe site are 

going to have similar commute issues.  But it -- you know, 

the 2000 is a lengthy break.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  But, you know, if we -- I 

think we can point out to the Ordinance Committee and to 

City Council what some of our concerns are.  But otherwise, 

I still think -- you know, on the whole it's really a 

benefit to this part of the city and to the entire city.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you so much.  Jeff, in 

regards to the planning issues that Hugh raised,

particularly the loading dock areas and the potential 

impacts of the heights on the Sixth Street Connector is that 

-- what is the best way to address that?   

          Does it make sense to deal with that as part of 

the special permit, or should we say something in the letter 

to the Council?  Or yet again have the proponent think about 

it a little bit and maybe come back to use?  What are your 

thoughts?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, thanks for the question.  

From my perspective, I'm not really sure how much could be 

done at the zoning stage.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So one of the interesting things -- 

I pointed this out to the petitioner when they were coming 

forward was that, you know, 250 feet historically has for a 

very long time been the height limit in this district.  It 

was I think a few years ago the zoning petition lowered it 

along Binney Street, and now is -- you know, in order to 

accommodate these new buildings sort of raising it back up. 

          So the question of how to accommodate a building 

of that height and scale in that location is something that 

always would have had to come -- you know, as part of the

Design Review process -- you know, before the Planning Board 

and would have to, you know, be looked at and assessed. 

          And I think it's really difficult to -- it's 

difficult to really study it much more than that without 

having a -- you know, a development proposal before the 

Board.   

          As Hugh suggested, that's really the opportunity 

to get into -- you know, more depth about, you know, 

answering those questions about the impact of the building 

mass and how it's being articulated, and the location of 

loading and other functions. 

          It's hard to do that with the zoning.  In fact, 

the zoning doesn't even really say where buildings are or 

how they're arranged or configured, it just has the amount 

of development and the other parameters, and everything else 

is subject to that Design and Development review.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Jeff, what are the criteria that we 

apply to the project for the special permit?  Because it 

seems like if we can state some of these concerns as 

criteria or maybe they're already in the criteria we're 

going to be addressing, that's a way of --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- proceeding?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's a good question.  So this 

was all -- as we noted in our memo, a lot of these kind of 

broader planning questions about the review process and, you 

know, what the criteria were were all sort of addressed in 

2015 when the zoning was amended.  And I just kind of 

happened to pull it up.   

          You know, it talks about what the different plan 

requirements are for sort of the Infill Development Concept 

Plan, what has to be provided -- it's very similar to sort 

of PUD zoning.   

          "The Planning Board shall grant a special permit 

approving a concept plan upon finding the new development 

identified within the plan meets the criteria for approval 

of a Planning Unit Development," so that you're using the 

same general criteria that would be used for a PUD project. 

          "In making its findings, the Board shall consider 

the objectives set forth in the Kendall Square final report 

of the K2C2 Planning Study." So that's the K2 Plan that we 

are generally referring back to, and the Kendall Square 

Design Guidelines.   

          And then Article 19 also applies to the citywide 

107

Urban Design objectives in Article 19.  So it's really the 

same set of planning documents that guide, you know, the 

plan review for other development in Kendall Square.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And others.  And I think the key 

with these provisions is, you know, when it comes -- when a 

project comes before the Planning Board -- you know, 

stepping way back in a much broader sense, we are -- you 

know, helping the Planning Board, and the Planning Board is 

referring to all of the planning work that the city had done 

to that point to inform the review process and decision-

making.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Would this also be subject to the 

CRA/Planning Board Design Review Process; which I can tell 

you is very thorough and very effective?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, that's correct.  I neglected 

to mention that, but this -- unlike other development 

proposals, it does have that kind of two, sort of two 

elements to it, with both the Planning Board and the CRA 

working together in a coordinated review process, which -- 

you know, it goes all the way from the Master Plan level to 

individual buildings, individual components of buildings and

open spaces, so it's a pretty exhaustive process.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  So it sounds as 

though we have agreement that we want to send a positive 

recommendation to the Council, but we do see tremendous 

benefits in the proposal and moving the substation to both 

address the needs of the -- the electric needs of the city, 

but also to make the environment better for the 

neighborhood, the East Cambridge and the Wellington-

Harrington neighborhoods, and also, to just improve the open 

space network in the eastern part of the city. 

          The concerns we have I think are kind of getting 

down to really just a few.  Obviously, as Ted mentioned, we 

would need a review of the language to clarify some of the 

points that he raised about interpretation of the substation 

FAR and other things. 

          The -- I think we're all in agreement that the 

2000 square feet needs to be looked at in terms of the 

parking distance.  And I understand -- I do understand that 

it's a phasing issue.   

          So I don't know if there's a way of maybe allowing 

2000 for a certain period of time during the construction 

period to accommodate that phasing, with the ultimate

solution being that there is no distance greater than 1000 

square feet when the project is built out.  So could look at 

the language for that, that would be helpful.   

          Let me just see.  Parking distance…   

          And I guess -- and do we want to say anything 

about the parking ratio?  I mean I think everybody is 

feeling as though it's relatively okay.  You know, as Steve 

has said it's really more of an issue for the owner than it 

is for us.  So is everyone comfortable with just leaving it 

as is, without further opinion on it in a recommendation to 

the Council?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'd like some more 

recommendations from Traffic and Parking.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, all right.  So we want then 

Traffic and Parking to weigh in on that, plus also then 

maybe on the bicycle parking as well, right?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yep, Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yep.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  One of the things I 

believe in their plan, that 2000 feet is the best that 

parking will ever get in distance.  They're expecting to use

their new garages for parking for the housing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So unless I'm mistaken, I 

think that's as good as its going to get, unless there's 

something else that changes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, all right.  I misunderstood that, 

then, because I thought it was really a question of interim 

flexibility.  Tom, could you address that?  I see your hand 

going up.       

          TOM EVANS:  So I -- the parcel is only 1000 feet 

in every dimension.  And so, if it's within the parcel, 1000 

I think works.  But the issue is if there's a need to meet -

- if to meet a commercial need in the existing commercial 

building, maybe the residential goes to one of the other 

garages within the MXD. 

          I think that still isn't really -- is more like a 

-- I don't think there's any garage in the MXD that's 

actually 2000.  It's more like 1500 is the range of spaces.  

So I think we may have just picked a round number so we can 

look at adjusting it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  Personally, I think 2000 

square feet -- 2000 feet rather in distance is way too much.

I mean, people -- if they have cars, they're going to want 

to be close to their residence.  I mean, they're going to 

have packages to carry, you know, groceries -- whatever.  I 

mean, it's the closer you can get the better.  So.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  But, you know, its about a 10-

minute walk.  Maybe people could live with it and maybe not, 

but to what extent is it the city's interest?  Doesn't it 

just impact the marketability of the space that they are 

building?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, I suppose, but still.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Until you get into the 

nuisance problem of people trying to park on Broadway and 

drop off their groceries and their children and the so forth 

and so on in the bike lanes -- a lot more to this than it 

appears.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  I think it needs some further 

study.  You know, I don't know what the -- you know, maybe 

that's not the right answer, 1000 or 2000.  But --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  If I could suggest, just because 

the -- you know, I think this conversation is sort of 

indicative of the kinds of issues that -- you know, that 

come up with when we try to have this discussion at the

zoning level, we -- you know, we find that we always need, 

you know, more, you know, particulars about what is actually 

proposed, how the system is supposed to work of how people 

get parking, what -- you know, what parking is available?  

What options are available to people at a particular point 

in time.   

          And that's really the purpose of having a kind of 

robust transportation study that gets provided at the 

special permit stage, gets reviewed by Traffic and Parking.  

I can just to -- you know, just to be candid, we can -- you 

know, like I said we have spoken with Traffic and Parking.  

          We can give this back to them for some more 

further look and further comment, but it's generally -- you 

know, hard for them to, you know, make a strong 

determination at this kind of high level.  Usually they have 

to look at the specifics before saying, "Okay, this is 

something that's going to work" or, "This is something where 

we recommend they do something a little bit different in 

order to make it work better and not have negative impacts 

on the public."           

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think it's a matter of Traffic 

and Parking verifying that they have the tools to make sure 

113

that the transportation needs are met in a reasonable way at 

the special permit level.  If the zoning -- you know, 

essentially says that they do have the tools they need, then 

that should be enough, because Steve's point is correct; 

it's in the --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- Boston Properties' interest that 

the transportation needs are met.  You know, walking six 

blocks to my car I did it actually once, when I -- just this 

year I came back from the early hours at the grocery store 

into a street cleaning situation on my street, and I ended 

up parking on the other side of Prospect Street on Harvard 

Street, which was about six blocks away. 

          So it's -- on the other hand, 2000 feet, that's 

what I have to walk to get to the T station.  So --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, it's -- well, it's not the 

walk, it's the walk with things, you know?  From -- but, you 

know, again, maybe that is not -- this isn't the correct 

place for that discussion.  I mean, I -- again, it's more a 

matter of convenience as you are -- you know --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Right, and they can --      

          MARY FLYNN:  You did it once, because --

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That could facilitate --      

          MARY FLYNN:  -- if you had to do it all the time  

--            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It would facilitate the dropping 

off.  They can have valet services, and I've seen suburban 

parking lots where there are actual shuttle buses in the 

suburban parking lot to get people from their incredibly 

remote parking places to the places they meet.  So they're 

tools.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Mm-hm.                 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And as long as we can have the 

confidence that Traffic and Parking can work with Boston 

Properties and the CRA so that it's a reasonable situation, 

both during construction and afterwards, then that's what 

we're going to be concerned about.  And -- but that's -- we 

don't have to have the solution today.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  We have to have the solution 

literally years from now.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.       

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  You know, if I could add one 

last thought:  In other locations in the city, when a

development, a developer doesn't provide enough parking or 

enough convenient parking, our concern is that people will 

park in the neighborhood, and the neighbors, needless to 

say, would be very upset about that, because parking in the 

city is at a premium to begin with.   

          I don't think given the location of this project 

that that creates the same concern -- that because this 

parking lot is a 10-minute walk that they're going to just 

park in the neighborhood.  There isn't the opportunity to 

park in the neighborhood here, I don't believe. 

          So for that reason, from a -- you know, municipal 

perspective, I'm not concerned about the distance.  It may 

have had an impact on marketability again, but I don't think 

it has a negative impact on the city.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  So in that case, I 

think that the motion is becoming even narrower.  It's -- 

because I think, based on what Jeff has said, that the 

traffic and transportation issues can be addressed further 

down the line as part of the review process. 

          So I think we're in agreement that we're 

recommending adoption with just review of the language to 

make it clearer and make sure it's consistent with other

parts of the zoning.   

          And we may want to add -- you know, a statement 

just saying it's important -- you know, and we support the 

Council's, you know, taking a look at the economic analysis 

and, you know, to give final determination that 800,000 

square feet is the right number.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN: No.       

as a motion?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Does that sound reasonable to people 

          MARY FLYNN:  Others?  Changes to it at all?  All 

right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I would add the concept that we'd 

like Traffic and Parking to make sure they have the 

necessary tools in the zoning.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- so they can do their job.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Me too.       

          MARY FLYNN:  With that addition.  Okay.  Can I 

have a motion, then, to that effect?       

          TOM EVANS:  Can I ask a procedural question to --

I guess to Jeff about whether the urban or redevelopment 

plan change would be a separate motion, or should we --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, that is a procedural one.  

Should I do a separate one, Jeff, or just do it as one?  I 

think we said we could do it as one, when we talked earlier.  

Is that right, Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is -- yeah, so this is Jeff 

Roberts.  This is a little unusual to me, but I think that 

it makes sense to have the Planning Board, you know, make a 

motion in favor -- to make a favorable recommendation to 

adopt the petition, and at the same time to make a finding -

- I'm sorry I have the text here on a different page --      

          MARY FLYNN:  It's right here, "-- determination 

that the proposed changes in conformance with the general 

plan for the community as a whole." Okay?   

          So the motion, then is recommend adoption of the 

petition with the changes we've discussed, which are 

basically just review the language, make sure that Traffic 

and Parking has the tools that they need in the zoning to be 

able to do analysis going forward, to support the idea of 

looking closely at the economic analysis to make sure that 

the 800,000 square feet is appropriate, and then also making 

118

the determination that the proposed change is in conformance 

with general plan for the community as a whole.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Mm-hm.       

          MARY FLYNN:  So would someone make that motion, 

please?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure, sure.  So moved.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, Steve.  Second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted makes the second.  Okay, Jeff, 

could we have a roll call vote, please?  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  On that motion, Lou Bacci?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That was a yes.  Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And Mary Flynn?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.   

          [All vote YES]  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all five members voting in

favor.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Well --    

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.         

          MARY FLYNN:  -- Thank you very much.  It was a 

very good presentation.  You've obviously done lots and lots 

and lots of hard work and we have a lot more coming up, so 

good luck with everything.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  What a project! Wow!       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, it's really something.  I hope 

I'm still alive when it's all done.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'd love to see the economics of 

the project when it's all done.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  We never get to see that.      

          MARY FLYNN:   I know.  Thank you all very much.  

Okay.  So that concludes the business on our agenda.  Are
