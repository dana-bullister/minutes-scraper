o  Phased in approach to Family Level Outcomes, per Grantee Timeline(s) 

•  Drafted Evaluation Tools  

o  Social Network Analysis survey 
o  Organizational Capacity survey  

•  Recommendations from Planning Phase Evaluation Report 
•  Next Steps for Evaluation  
 
CBAC Discussion:  
•  CBAC should do 1:1 process check-ins with each partnership 

o  Get a snapshot of Now; CBAC does not have a good sense of where partnerships are in their 

implementation – Core Team also does not have this sense  

o  Hear from organizations what makes sense in terms of data collection 

Important for CBAC to get started with data collection now – and take time to check in with each partnership  

• 
•  CBAC should reestablish role as lead communicator with partnerships – and be primary contact with 

partnerships re: forthcoming evaluation tools  

•  HRiA tools:  

o 

Intention with these tools was to collect data every 6 months, starting with baseline data that was 
originally scheduled for collection in April  

o  Questions seem leading; seems like we are already making assumptions about what is not working/ 

gaps/ what we want to see?Is there a way to make questions more open-ended?  

o  Tools are designed to get at boxes within Evaluation Plan and Logic Model  
o  Tools will be completed by one person per partner organization; i.e., if a partnership is made up of 3 

partner organizations, 3 people will complete each tool  

• 

In Logic Model, what boxes lead up to, “Robust, widespread coordination and integration between non-
profits…”? For the larger system evaluation pieces, what tools will be used?  

•  How much is COVID a massive confounding event that will ruin data we are trying to collect? 
•  Planning Phase Evaluation Report – when will CBAC receive it/ have an opportunity to review it?  
 

II.  Emergency & Recovery Grants 
 

Where are we now?  
•  City Manager approved funding for all 106 organizations that met eligibility  
•  Grant agreements have been signed by 72 organizations 

•  Grant agreements were all sent by City on 8/3; some organizations indicated that they need time to get 

approval from their board for the Certificate of Authority 

• 

Initial checks ($6000) have been sent to 10 organizations, 28 checks will be cut and sent Thursday, and 30+ will 
be sent next week 

•  Request from one applicant that CBAC reconsider its decision not to fund 
 
CBAC Discussion:  
•  Were there any nonprofit applications for the City’s small business grants?  

o  Only for profit organizations were eligible  

•  Did any of the Business Associations apply for this CBAC grant? 

o  Central Square BID applied and was determined to be eligible based on delivery of services to residents 

•  Has City received any communications from other organizations not funded 

o  Yes – from one organization 

•  Request for reconsideration:  

o  Based on organization’s articulation of service delivery to residents, CBAC should reconsider 
o 
If CBAC reconsiders this one, we should review all of the applications that were not funded 
o  CBAC needs more time to discuss before reaching a final determination
