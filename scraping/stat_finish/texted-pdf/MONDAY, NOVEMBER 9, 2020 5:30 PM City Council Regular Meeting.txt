To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it 

Packet Pg. 61

 
ORDERED: 

 
That section 2.119.020(D) of the Ordinances of the City of Cambridge be 

2.4

amended to read as follows:

amended to read as follows: 

E. 

Subsequent  to  the  filing  of  a  registration  form, 
the existence of  a "family"  relationship  may be 
shown  by  evidence  relevant  to  the  following 
factors:  

The  manner  in  which  the  people  live 

1. 
their daily lives;  

2. 
the world;  

3.

October 19, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
This is in response to Policy Order Number O-13, of October 5, 2020, which requests that the 
City Manager work with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department and the City 
Solicitor with regard to a draft Truck Safety Ordinance which “would provide requirements for 
safety improvements made to trucks owned by companies which have contracts with the City.”  
 
After consultation with the Law Department and the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 
Department, as well as the Department of Public Works, the Police Department, the Purchasing 
Department and the Community Development Department, I am forwarding a Truck Safety 
Ordinance that contains the measures that could be taken to improve the safety of large trucks 
utilized by City vendors, particularly in relation to the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.  Similar 
to the ordinance in Boston, the attached ordinance requires side guards and other safety measures 
with respect to trucks operated by vendors contracting with the City.  
 
 

 

Very truly yours, 

 

Louis A. DePasquale  
City Manager

COUNCILLOR CARLONE 
 
WHEREAS: 

City of Cambridge 

O-6 
FIRST IN COUNCIL 
June 22, 2020 

 

 

The City of Cambridge publicly acknowledges we are facing a climate change crisis 
due to increasing dangers of fossil fuels impacting public health and quality of life; and 
 
The intent of Article 22.000 of Cambridge’s Zoning Code is “to promote 
environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient design and development practices in 
new construction and renovation of buildings in the city”; and 
 
The city has set goals for different building types to meet the highest standards for 
environmentally sustainable design in the coming years; and 
 
Costs for different forms of clean energy are equal to or less than fossil fuels; and 
 
Cambridge set a building standard for utilizing clean energy in their non-zero buildings 
to minimize adverse environmental impacts and as examples for private industry and 
all public facilities design to replicate; and 
 
It is of utmost importance that new and renovated projects seriously explore the 
environmental and likely cost advantages of using alternative and renewable energy 
resources during the design development of their projects; now therefore 
 
Under 22.20 Green Building Requirements, the following will be added as Section 
22.25.1 (c) (6): 

an assessment of renewable energy systems that do not consume fossil fuels on-site (to 
include solar photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source 
heat pumps, district energy and geothermal systems, and/or similar systems) that 
examines technical feasibility to meet the projected HVAC and domestic hot water 
demands of the building based on the information provided in 22.25.1(c)(2), and cost 
of installation, the cost of maintenance and operation of the renewable energy system 
and its components, and the amount of any greenhouse gas emissions by source (other 
than from a public utility or municipal lighting plant), taking into account incentives 
provided in 22.25.1(c)(5), and other federal, state and local incentives available to the 
developer, building owner and tenants, all compared to code-compliant energy systems 
that consume fossil fuels on-site and any energy system (other than from a public 
utility or municipal lighting plant) that consumes fossil fuels to be constructed or 
expanded off-site to provide energy to the building. The assessment and any review by 
the CDD as to the assessment shall be made available to the City and to the public and 
shall be part of the Planning Board special permit application submission and any 
hearings before the Planning Board.

In regards to the above  reference  address and the application for the projecting sign,  the abutters

Subject: POR 2020 #218

Dear Councilors, City Manager, City Clerk, Charles Sullivan, CHC, Executive Director:

Please enter this email into the record in opposition to Policy Order #218 under consideration:

"That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Cambridge Historical Commission and 
other relevant City Departments to ensure that any report or recommendation for a new Neighborhood 
Conservation District in Cambridge presented to the City Council include an analysis of the potential effects on 
City housing affordability based on current research, as well as any mitigations that the Cambridge Historical 
Commission recommends, so that the City Council may holistically evaluate the matter. CHARTER RIGHT 
EXERCISED BY COUNCILLOR CARLONE IN COUNCIL OCTOBER 5, 2020 POR 2020 #218."

While at first glance this may seem like a reasonable directive, given the claimed need for affordable housing in 
Cambridge and the allegations of elitism lodged at proponents of the East Cambridge Conservation District, the 
task is far more complex and demanding than I suspect this body anticipates. I have read the data presented by 
Suzanne Blier in comparing conservation/historic district property values and rents with unregulated 
neighborhoods over a five year period and find her presentation and analysis undeniable. I am attaching here a 
recent paper (warning it is 90-pages) that describes the intricacies and complexities that are required to arrive at 
any reliable conclusion. Therein the author cites the following:

"In a 2011 report to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Measuring the Economic Impacts of 
Historic Preservation, Donovan Rypkema, Caroline Cheong, and Randall Mason argue for consistent and 
rigorous data analysis across five major economic measures: jobs and household income, property values, 
heritage tourism, environmental measurements, and downtown revitalization."  

I do not see this approach as part of the policy order mandate. Instead, it questions one variable alone: the 
effect on affordable housing. Please scan through the attached paper to get a feel for the task that you are 
demanding of two City Departments. While I am eonfident, based on data presented by Suzanne Blier, that 
property values in East Cambridge are a direct response to proliferation of development surrounding it, a real 
analysis entails far more variables. Having grown up in East Cambridge, I have first hand knowledge of just 
how much our property values have increased and it has absolutely nothing to do with preservation efforts at 
all. Some 25 years ago my mother and siblings sold the family homestead on Gore Street for 
$200,000. Several months ago that same property sold for $3.7 million dollars and it is in far worse condition 
than it was 20 years ago. It is amazing that anyone would suggest that somehow this astronomical increase is 
not due to the surrounding mega developments. To be sure, that is what is driving the rents and property 
values.

 

I am synopsizing a bit of the attached paper, using linear regression analysis, to display the asassociation 
between the full set of predictor variables and the dependent variable assigned task:

Linear Regression
A linear regression model determines the mathematical relationship among a collection of predictor variables 
associated with a set of observations, which in this case are individual residential property transactions.71 The 
resulting function consists of a yintercept and several variables, each with its own coefficient that weights that 
variable’s contribution to the overall transaction value, holding all other variables constant. By plugging values 
into the equation for each variable, one obtains an expected transaction value for a given property at a particular 
time. A general linear regression model can be written as: 
represents the dependent variable (residential sales price), 
coefficient for each independent variable from 1 through k. An interpretation of 
one unit increase in the predictor variable, the value of the dependent variable is expected to increase by 
units, holding all other predictors constant. For example, if the number of bedrooms is a predictor variable in a 
regression model, then for each additional bedroom, the sales price can be expected to increase by the 
coefficient’s number of dollars, holding everything else constant. Note that the line of best fit, which is given by 
the main equation above with the error term removed, does not represent the exact relationship among the 
variables for the full population, but rather an approximation of that relationship using the available data.72 
Because it is impossible to reduce transactions to a finite set of measurable variables, the linear regression 
equation cannot perfectly predict each transaction’s exact price. Furthermore, a model that could do that would 
be said to be overfit, meaning that the model’s coefficients would be too closely aligned with the existing data, 
and the model would erroneously treat anomalies in the dataset as meaningful. . . "

"By comparing the transaction values as predicted by the model to actual transaction records, it would be 
possible to see how well the models perform on those transactions that were not used to build the model. This 
would be done by looking at the final term in the regression equation, which is the residual, written as 
. The 
residual is assumed to be normally distributed and have a mean of zero. In the form of an equation, the residual 
(cid:157)(cid:157)
for each individual observation (sales transaction) i is: (cid:127)i = yi - (cid:129)i Where (cid:129)i is the expected transaction value 
based on the equation above, and yi is the actual (observed) transaction price. Understanding Regression 
Outputs The regression output includes values that allow one to evaluate whether the relationships among

variables are significant. The F-ratio test evaluates whether there is likely to be an association between the full 
set of predictor variables and the dependent variable. . . "

There is absolutely no reason to treat East Cambridge differently than any other district that has petitioned for 
conservation or historic status in this City. It shows a blatant elitism on the part of this Council and a profound 
ignorance of the heritage and history of the neighborhood. There is simply no reason to impose this study on 
those interested in historic preservation, while giving a free pass to the real driving force behind property value 
and rent increases.

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors,

Enclosed please find the following additional information regarding the curbcut 

application for 101 Cambridgepark Drive that appears under the Charter Right section of 
your Agenda.

Existing Conditions Plan
Proposed Site Plan

Please be advised that the Planning Board approved the proposed Site Plan as part 

of the Special Permit issued by them on August 25, 2020. If you compare the two plans 
you will notice that the “new” curb cut is in reality a relocation of the existing curb cut by 
only a few feet.  In addition to relocating this curb cut, a second curb cut at the property 
will be removed. 

The applicant was encouraged to relocate the existing curbcut in order to better 

accommodate the new multi modal path it is installing on the property that will provide a 
direct connection to the Alewife Bike path behind the building.

A copy of the aforementioned plans have been uploaded to the City's viewpoint 

portal.

Very truly yours,

Why is Cambridge silent on devastating MBTA service cuts?

To The Honorable, The City Council,

Today, the MBTA’s Fiscal Management and Control Board is discussing service cuts that will be devastating for 
Cambridge and the region.

Tomorrow, the State Legislature begins discussion of a budget which will either embrace these cuts or cure them.

In the face of this, Cambridge is silent.

I certainly understand that there’s a lot going on but how hard would it have been to have gone on record to oppose 
these cuts?

As a member of the Manager’s Transit Advisory Committee since its creation (disclaimer: I’m speaking for myself) I’ve 
long since given up on City administration advocating for transit. City staff’s comfort zone is negotiating at the margins 
to make things less bad and, without any high level leadership, that’s their proper role. But the Council, as the policy 
making body in Cambridge, is not so constrained.

Your silence speaks volumes.

POR #246

I just wanted to write again to support POR #246. Also, along the lines of the policy order, I just want to voice my 
support for the City, in general, looking into using existing parcels it already owns – parking lots, for example – for 
affordable housing. In that specific case, there is clearly a city-wide goal of reducing car usage, and even barring that, 
underground parking could be built to accommodate the loss of spaces – or, if the location is reasonable for it, the 
parcel could be used for a parking garage, which affordable developers could use to meet their parking minimums, or 
could be used to offset the loss of parking elsewhere on another parcel, say. There are probably many ideas along these 
lines; but I just wanted to add my support for that sort of proposal.

Finally, I just wanted to echo what I've written in past weeks: that in all of policy choices right now, I believe that we 
must continue to recognize that rent burdenship and homelessness are political choices that we collectively make and 
maintain, and we need to have the political will to not continue to treat these as anywhere near the status quo.

Tree Protection Ordinance

Dear members of the City Council,

I have great concerns about the future of our trees in the City of Cambridge and the implications 
for all residents. The Tree Protection Ordinance proposal looks great in many ways, assuming it 
would be passed.

The TPO should expand to all property and affordable housing should not be exempt as it means 
that backyards and their trees will disappear over time. 6,000 single family homes are 
potentially a target for transformation and added density. Many mature trees will need strong 
protections.

The last session on the Tree Ordinance confirmed that most of the tree canopy is in West 
Cambridge and most mature trees are on residential property (80%?). The GREATEST LOSS IS 
IN RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY (slide 8 of the deck). It's visually clear from any aerial view. Clearly 
we are not replanting at the rate that we are losing trees. We were told at the last city council 
meeting on trees that we'd need 2,700 trees a year to curb the loss by 50% but it was also 
admitted that this would be unrealistic. 

Furthermore, the population at risk essentially overlaps with locations where density is higher 
(East Cambridge, Cambridge Port, Riverside among others).

Plus this is just counting trees, it's not measuring health and climate/pollution impact.

I am advocating for:

Transparency and accountability:
• Share with us applications granted to cut a tree and why. This should be linked to a map. 
Understanding "problem trees" would be educational. Information is power. If a dead tree is 
removed it should be replaced and why not help with funds from the tree fund? 

The reasons for removal permits listed don't provide enough information.
-> Losing 84 trees to City Parks is hard to understand. Parks should ADD trees. 

• Trees recently planted should not be removed/ replanted "ad hoc". See the story of crabapple 
trees in Kendall Sq at the end of this message. Once a tree is planted it stays or we'll never 
catch up.

• Greater protection for trees on residential property. 
If we don't have the data, enable residents to share/create a map of all mature trees (or 
future ones as they are planted) on private property. We can figure out a criteria. 20" in 
diameter could be one. The canopy size is another one. I counted up to seven or ten 30' or 40'

tall trees on many properties just by walking around West Cambridge. We need a map to track 
them. We currently already have a great map tracking all the trees on public property and 
allowing people to adopt trees to help care for them. How about a campaign to promote this?

4.6.a

"The greater opportunity to plant is on private property" (slide 9). 
Why not also protect what we already have that took decades to grow?

• Connecting trees, health and housing 
With 6,000 single family homes in Cambridge that could each be converted by developers and 
with a large percentage of them holding mature trees. This is not "us (people) vs them (trees)". 
There is a high correlation between density and population at risk (based on the TPO deck).

• Mitigation options with stronger tree protection:

From the presentation it's not clear what a "large project" is (unless you have expertise).
This is a big issue if developers take over new property with non binding guidelines.

-> A mature tree does not equal multiple smaller trees in terms of impact. Those should 
be new trees, adding to the canopy. 

-> Developers and owners should not just pay into the tree fund. Education is critical to engage 
and take responsibility. Tree protection should be attached to regular building permits.

-> Paying for the right to cut trees ($850 per inch) should not be possible. Large trees take 
decades to grow. Replanting should not be the answer either. We are beyond replanting! 

-> 402 trees were dimmed "dead or dangerous" and removed in the last year: were they 
replaced? I believe not. That's a LOT of trees. 

• The creation of a category for "exceptional" trees (but not as a last resort):
3% of the trees and mostly on private property (70-80% per the presentation?) Again we need 
data and transparency on the numbers. The same criteria used to track trees could be used 
here. The main issue I see with creating the category is that it implies that somehow other trees 
don't deserve protection. It's like creating a last resort protection to allow other mature trees to 
get cut at will.

"Some trees while having a nice full canopy do not have very thick trunks, for example: Dogwood or 
Stewardia." – Carolyn Shipley Blade and Blossom Gardening

• Using funds in Tree Trust to help private owners care for trees we need to protect. There 
is no way we'll be able to catch up with the loss that already occurred and those trees need help! 
Also the current city crew working to plant, prune and maintain trees seems to be stretched. 
Empowering residents to supplement them makes sense. [see quote from owner caring for 20 
trees at the end].

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
- Quote from a neighbor looking after 20 trees on their property

"Twenty six years ago, and in the intervening years, we have planted (or maintained the few 
then existing trees) on our private property. I counted them sometime back and, counting things 
like our huge Rhody (probably 50 years old), we have something north of 20 trees here. 
Many of those we planted were 20' or more.

The average person has no idea how much it costs, in $ and in time, to find/buy/haul 
home/plant/fertilize/water a tree, much less many of them."

- "trees are not more or less important than people"
Someone argued to me once that "trees are less important than people". This made no sense to 
me based on everything we know about climate change and the role played by trees and green 
spaces in cities. It is not about choosing one of the other.

Trees are critical to the health of ALL citizens. We need them because we are about people. They 
prevent heat pockets, help overcome depression and bring oxygen. Any plant and green space 
actually serves that purpose (backyards with grass and bushes). It's also been demonstrated 
that lack of trees affect the most low income neighborhoods. 

If trees are cut to build larger buildings it will affect everyone's wellbeing, including people 
moving into those units. 

Backyards around our neighborhoods bring kids together without having to cart them around to 
playgrounds and sit on benches to watch them, doing not much else. I have been there and I 
highly value those spaces but families use and share yards and trees provide them with the 
shade needed to be there.

- We should not play musical chairs with trees. 
Based on an earlier session for the public: crabapple trees in Kendall sq were planted and 
blooming beautifully, then came new plans for a bike path and they had to be removed! 

I was told during that meeting by the arborist that "new new" trees would replace them (not 
adding to what we had planted) but they could not be crabapple trees due to the new location I 
believe. 

This kind of "ad hoc" planning should not happen.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

Support for POR 2020 #246 — Build Affordable Housing at 35 Cherry Street

The City has done its homework. It's surveyed its residents, and knows what their most critical need is. (It's affordable 
housing, in case you forgot!)

Seven years ago, MIT gave the City a 10,500+ square foot lot (see photo below). The City has done nothing with it, 
despite a long community process conducted years ago. This is embarrassing for the City. MIT must regret its decision. 
And, as long-time neighbors of the lot (2 blocks from our home), my husband Ming & I are dismayed to see this valuable 
lot sitting useless, a hole in the fabric of our community.

We strongly support building affordable housing on the lot. We support having a community process to determine 
what type of affordable housing gets built. But not whether housing is needed; it is. Further, we support building at 
least 12 units of housing. Preferably more.

I’m writing in support of Councilor Simmon’s policy order, POR 2020 #246. We need affordable housing in Cambridge,

RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

An essential part of a world class government is providing reliable and accessible 
transportation to all residents; and 
 
The essential, frontline workers who have protected our health and supported our 
economy throughout this pandemic are especially reliant on a well-functioning public 
transportation system; and 
 
The MBTA Fiscal Management and Control Board recently announced its “Forging 
Ahead” Plan, calling for budget cuts and the reduction of bus, ferry, and rail services, 
which will soon be debated by the Massachusetts state legislature; and 
 
As low-income residents are more likely to use public transportation, while middle-
income or high-income may be better positioned to opt for private transportation, 
cutting service and overcrowding on MBTA transit service would only further 
exacerbate the disparate health impacts the COVID-19 pandemic is having on low-
income communities; and 
 
The City of Cambridge has stood up for continued investment in public 
transportations, recognizing it is a matter of equity and climate urgency; now therefore 
be it 
 
That the City Council go on record as supportive of all efforts to fully fund the MBTA 
without any of the cuts to service detailed in the “Forging Ahead” Plan; and further be 
it 
 
That the City Clerk prepare a suitably engrossed copy of this resolution and transmit it 
to the Cambridge legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  expressed disappointment that big trucks cannot be banned in Harvard 
Square and the city could not build protected bike lanes. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked Mr. Barr if the truck safety ordinance is something that the council could start 
to move forward. 
 
Joseph Barr, Director of Traffic, Parking & Transportation, explained that the city has been working on 
draft language internally, and that it will be presented to the council soon. 
 
In response to a question from vice Mayor Mallon, Mr. Barr stated that there will be modification to 
Church street to increase safety. 
 
Ms. Watkins  stated that construction on the kiosk will start sometime in November. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan, Mr. Barr explained that in order to limit truck traffic in 
Harvard Square to certain times the City would need approval from the Massachusetts Department of 
Transportation.  He stated that overnight restrictions on residential street were more likely to be approved. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan, Mr. Barr explained that the City did have the regulatory 
authority to close a street at certain times of the day as long as the closure applied to all traffic. Mr. Barr 
explained that there can be pushback from residents about street closures. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  stated that she was excited by and supported pedestrianizing parts of Harvard 
Square. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:16:05 
Thank you come through to me, is there anything you'd like to add? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  stated that he would like a concise and simple document explaining the 
council’s authority to regulate traffic on city streets. He expressed support with moving forward with a 
truck safety ordinance. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Toomey, Mr. Barr stated that he was not aware of any progress 
in the creation of truck depot to allow cargo from larger trucks to be transferred to smaller trucks when 
entering Cambridge. 
 
Mayor Siddiqui stated that she agreed that the administration should get the truck ordinance to the 
Council as soon as is feasible. 
 
Councillor McGovern  stated that it was his understanding that most of the businesses in Harvard Square 
were not receiving deliveries from big trucks. Mr. Barr stated that he did not have any specific 
information about the percentage of the trucks making deliveries to versus passing through the square. 
 
Councillor McGovern expressed concern about the possibility of diverting trucks down smaller side 
streets.  He urged the council to carefully consider how changes will affect where truck traffic will be 
directed. 
 
Mr. Barr stated that City should be clear about the expected benefits when it chooses to close streets. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  stated that Denver, Santa Monica, Charlottesville, Chicago have closed streets 
and New York City is beginning to design closed streets. And San Francisco is planning to close its main

street, which is Market Street to traffic and allow only mass transit and special vehicles delivery. He 
stated that he supported making Harvard square more pedestrian oriented. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Ms. Watkins explained that a raised crosswalk 
encourages pedestrians to cross at any time, but the preference is to have pedestrians cross the street when 
indicated by traffic signals. 
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about closing traffic to Harvard Square on certain 
days, Mr. Barr stated he would consult with the public health department about that in terms of 
encouraging gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon, Kathy Watkins that the paver cross walks in Harvard 
Square are not historic.  The issue with the existing cross walk is sightlines in terms of visibility. The 
current plan is to add high visibility markings. 
 
In response to Councillor Nolan’s question about moving forward on a pilot, Mr. Barr stated  that the city 
must notify local businesses and ensure residents have some awareness of closure, even if the closure is 
just for the weekend.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about closing Harvard Square portion 
of Massachusetts Avenue to truck traffic or all traffic, Mr. Barr explained that Massachusetts Avenue is a 
state route. Therefore, closures to all traffic or daytime closure to truck traffic are unlikely to be approved 
by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.  He added that there was a concern about this traffic 
being diverted down smaller streets should this portion of Massachusetts Avenue be closed to traffic. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler moved to 
suspend the rules to extend the meeting

already has a 20 mile per hour speed limit. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  encouraged the city to consult with homeless resident about

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge has witnessed two the deaths of Cambridge residents killed by large trucks 
in Harvard Square in the past year; and    
 
A Truck Safety Ordinance would provide requirements for safety improvements made 
to trucks owned by companies which have contracts with the City; and    
 
The City of Boston currently already has a Truck Safety Ordinance and a similar 
ordinance in Cambridge is something that has been talked about for multiple years in 
Cambridge; now therefore be it    
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Transportation 
Department and Solicitor to provide the City with an update on the progress toward a 
draft Ordinance as soon as possible and with the draft of an Ordinance by October 19, 
2020.

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
On Friday, October 30th, the Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee convened to discuss the current 
health and safety metrics and hear from CPSD’s scientific advisors. The scientific advisors wrote 
a letter with proposed revisions to the metrics, suggesting that the scope of our metrics narrow in 
order  to  focus  on  more  Cambridge-specific  data.  The  Buildings  and  Grounds  Subcommittee 
unanimously passed a motion onto the full School Committee to accept the recommended changes. 
The video for this meeting is available here.   
 
These proposed revisions are to be discussed and voted on at the School Committee’s next Special 
Meeting on Thursday, November 5th. Please see the agenda here.  
 
In keeping with guidance established by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, 
for this year only, CPSD will not cancel school on days of heavy snow, and instead will have a 
remote learning day on such days. Remote learning on snow days will be required to meet all the 
state's requirements governing remote learning. 
 
On Saturday, November 14th, I will be hosting one more Family Resource Fair with the 
Cambridge Public Schools outside the Pisani Center from 10:00 AM-12:00 PM. I will share 
more details on this next week. 
 
As I announced last week, Elevate Youth, the WorkForce Program, and my Office are extending 
the Local Parks Program through November 18th. Due to daylight savings, programming will 
run from 2:30-4:30 PM (instead of 3:30-5:30 PM) on Mondays and Wednesdays at Danehy 
Park. If you have or know of a 4th or 5th grader who would benefit from social and emotional 
learning activities centered around structured time in the outdoors, please have them submit an 
application ASAP. We still have spots!
