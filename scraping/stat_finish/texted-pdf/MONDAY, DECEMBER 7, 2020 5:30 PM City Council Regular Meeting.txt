December 7, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am forwarding for your consideration a Home Rule Petition seeking special legislation from the 
Legislature which would authorize the City of Cambridge to provide police, fire and other 
emergency services (“Emergency Services”) to portions of the Cambridge Crossing project that 
are partially located in the cities of Boston and Somerville, with one such property wholly 
located within Somerville. As you know, Cambridge Crossing is a large mixed-use project 
situated on over 45 acres of land located in the cities of Cambridge, Boston and Somerville, and 
containing residential, office, laboratory and retail uses (the “Project”). Portions of the Project 
are not accessible by streets located in either Boston or Somerville and are only accessible by 
emergency responders by streets located in the City of Cambridge.  
 
The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts generally prohibit municipalities from 
providing emergency services to properties located outside of their municipal boundaries.  While 
there are certain exceptions for instances of mutual aid, the municipality in which a specific 
parcel of real estate is located is generally responsible for the provision of police, fire and other 
emergency services to such parcels and the buildings located on the parcels and the occupants of 
those buildings.   
 
In addition, Massachusetts law prevents municipalities from assessing taxes or other municipal 
charges against properties not situated within its municipal boundaries.  Therefore, the special 
legislation that is enclosed here also would authorize the City to impose fees on the owner of any 
parcel located within the Project for the provision of these Emergency Services.

AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO PROVIDE POLICE, FIRE, 
EMERGENCY AND OTHER MUNICIPAL SERVICES TO CERTAIN PROPERTIES IN 
THE CITY OF SOMERVILLE AND THE CITY OF BOSTON. 

Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the City of Cambridge is 

 
hereby authorized to provide police, fire and other services and the City of Somerville and the 
City of Boston are authorized to acquiesce in the delegation of such services to the City of 
Cambridge relative to the certain identified portions of the City of Somerville and the City of 
Boston and to take such other actions as are provided for in this Act. 

 

SECTION 1.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE  

WHEREAS, Cambridge Crossing (also known as North Point) is a mixed-use, smart 

 
growth master plan development containing 20 separate and distinct building parcels and 
comprised of approximately 45.37 acres of land, situated in the Cities of Cambridge, Boston and 
Somerville (the “Development”) or (“Cambridge Crossing”); and 

WHEREAS, the majority of the Development, (approximately 38.77 acres), is situated in 

the City of Cambridge, with the balance of the land located in the City of Boston, (1.29 acres), 
and the City of Somerville, (5.28 acres), with the majority of the buildings constructed or to be 
constructed (with the exception of one building which is wholly situated in the City of 
Somerville) to be located in whole or in part in the City of Cambridge (collectively, the 
“Serviced Parcels”, and each individually, a “Serviced Parcel”); and 

WHEREAS, emergency access to the Serviced Parcels is only feasible by public ways 

situated in the City of Cambridge and the City of Cambridge will be providing the water, sewer 
and other municipal services to the entirety of Cambridge Crossing and neither the City of 
Boston nor the City of Somerville will be providing those municipal services to Cambridge 
Crossing; and 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of a Memorandum of Agreement between the City of 

Cambridge and the current owner of the Cambridge Crossing, the roadway network and 
municipal infrastructure being (or to be) constructed therein by the current owner, will be 
conveyed to the City of Cambridge and become part of the City of Cambridge municipal system; 
and 

WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston each desire to enter into 
agreements with one another to have the City of Cambridge (i) provide police, fire and other 
emergency services, including but not limited to, emergency communication and ambulance 
services (“Emergency Services”), and (ii) offer and provide such other municipal services to the 
Serviced Parcels as may be reasonably required and/or requested from time to time as a result of 
the Serviced Parcels being accessible solely from roadways situated in the City of Cambridge 
and the utilities owned, or to be owned, by the City of Cambridge located therein, including, 
without limitation, the provision of water, storm sewer and sanitary sewer (and the ability to 
charge normal and customary fees associated therewith) and services provided by the fire 
department (such services, “Other Municipal Services”); and

WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston agree that having 

Cambridge provide the above services to the entirety of Cambridge Crossing will enable 
increased efficiency in, and the expeditious delivery of, public safety responses; and 

WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston agree that the City of 
Cambridge requires the authority to assess any unpaid fees for Emergency Services to a Serviced 
Parcel. Specifically, the Cities seek authority to allow the City of Cambridge to (a) assess any 
unpaid fees for these services that are attributable to (i) a Serviced Parcel situated partially in the 
City of Cambridge to the real estate tax bills of such Serviced Parcel issued by the City of 
Cambridge and (ii) the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of Somerville against tax 
parcels located in the City of Cambridge containing only the common open space areas of 
Cambridge Crossing, but not any tax parcels containing occupiable buildings (collectively, the 
“CX Open Space Parcels”), and to issue a real estate tax bill to such assessing parcel(s), and (b) 
make such assessments, pursuant to its assessment and collection authority contained in Chapters 
59 and 60 of the Massachusetts General Laws. 

 
THEREFORE, the purposes of this Act are to: 
 
1.  authorize the City of Cambridge (a) to provide Emergency Services within the 
Serviced Parcels as if such parcels were entirely situated within the City of 
Cambridge; (b) to make assessments against any Serviced Parcel to reimburse the 
City of Cambridge for the provision of such services to such Serviced Parcel, against 
only the portion of such Serviced Parcel situated in the City of Cambridge; (c) to 
make assessments against the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of 
Somerville to reimburse the City of Cambridge for the provisions of such services to 
such Serviced Parcel, against one or more of the CX Open Space Parcels; (d) to 
collect and enforce, including, without limitation, the rights to pursue takings for non-
payment of such assessments allocable to (i) a Serviced Parcel, against the owner of 
such Serviced Parcel, or (ii) in the event of the Serviced Parcel situated entirely 
within the City of Somerville, against the owner(s) of the CX Open Space Parcels; 
and (d) to offer and provide the Other Municipal Services as if the same were situated 
entirety within the City of Cambridge; and 

2.  authorize the City of Somerville and the City of Boston to delegate the Emergency 
Services and Other Municipal Services related to the Serviced Parcels to the City of 
Cambridge. 

SECTION 2.  The City of Cambridge is hereby authorized to provide the Emergency 

Services to the Serviced Parcels, specifically including, but not limited to, authorizing 
Cambridge Police Officers with full arrest powers, as if those parcels were wholly located in the 
City of Cambridge. 

SECTION 3.  The City of Cambridge shall have the right to provide such Other 
Municipal Services as are reasonably necessary to be provided to the Serviced Parcels and as are 
otherwise agreed to with any other municipality in which a particular Serviced Parcel may be 
located.

SECTION 4.  The City of Cambridge, the City of Somerville and the City of Boston are 
each hereby authorized to enter into agreements with one another, to the extent such Cities deem 
such agreements to be necessary and/or convenient, concerning Cambridge’s provision of 
Emergency Services and, to the extent applicable, Other Municipal Services to the Serviced 
Parcels, upon such terms and conditions as the Cities may agree.  In the event that the Cities fail 
to or have not entered into an agreement and the provision of Emergency Services or Other 
Municipal Services are required by a Serviced Parcel, the City of Cambridge shall be permitted 
to provide the services in connection with specific Serviced Parcels. 

SECTION 5.  The City of Cambridge shall have the authority to charge fees to the owner 
of a Serviced Parcel relative to the provision of Emergency Services or Other Municipal Services 
provided and allocable to such Serviced Parcel (“Assessments”).  

SECTION 6.  The City of Cambridge shall have the right (a) to assess and collect such 

assessments against each of the Serviced Parcels in such amounts as will be set forth in the 
agreement identified in Section 5 above, in a manner consistent with the manner in which it 
assesses real estate taxes in the City of Cambridge under M.G.L. c. 59, and (b) to enforce the 
collection of such amounts in the same manner in which it is entitled to enforce the collection of 
real estate tax assessments pursuant to M.G.L. c. 59 and c. 60, including, without limitation, the 
rights of the City of Cambridge to pursue takings for any unpaid amounts and foreclose on such 
takings pursuant to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 60, § 53.  The City of Cambridge shall (i) with 
regard to the Serviced Parcels situated partially in the City of Cambridge, make such assessments 
against the City of Cambridge tax parcel(s) containing a portion(s) of such Serviced Parcel; and 
(ii) with regard to the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of Somerville, make 
assessments against one or more of the City of Cambridge tax parcels containing the CX Open 
Space Parcels.  Any and all such assessments have the force and effect of real estate tax 
assessments made under the provisions of M.G.L. c. 59 and c. 60.

From: 

Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development; 

Joseph Barr, Director, Traffic, Parking, and Transportation  

Awaiting Report 20-12 dated February 10, 2020 regarding feasibility of adding bike 
parking rings to parking meters. 

KHALIL MOGASSABI 
Deputy Director 
Chief Planner 

Date:   December 2, 2020 

 

 
 

 
      
This response addresses the request to examine the feasibility of adding bike parking rings to 
automobile parking meter poles in order to increase the availability of bike parking without 
having to add stand-alone bike parking infrastructure. 
 
The demand for bike parking continues to rise as the city grows and more people are 
choosing to bike. The City of Cambridge allocates funds in its capital budget to install up to 
150 new post and ring bike racks each year, in addition to providing some larger bike shelters 
at public facilities and providing seasonal bike parking corrals in priority locations in place of 
car parking spots. The racks and corrals are placed in places of high demand for bike parking, 
such as in the city’s main squares, along retail corridors and near educational facilities and 
high-density housing districts. Racks are also installed upon request from residents or 
business owners. New development projects are required to provide bike parking on their 
property not only for employees but also short-term visitor parking, which adds significant 
numbers of new bike parking spaces throughout the city each year. In combination, these 
different approaches to increase the availability of bike parking in the city each year are 
intended to address the growing demand. 
 
We recommend not adding bike parking rings to active automobile parking meter poles for 
several reasons. First, meters are placed closer to the curb than the typical standard for bike 
racks. This could mean, if one or more bikes are parked at a rack, that vehicles would end up 
being parked further away from the curb, intruding into bike or travel lanes and reducing 
overall travel safety. In addition, accessing the meters to empty the coin compartment and 
service the meters could become more difficult. A larger bike, a badly parked bike, or a 
tipped over bike would impede the collection of coins or maintenance of the parking 
meter. However, there are some “orphaned” meter poles where curbside parking has been 
removed to install bike lanes for other reasons.  These poles might be good candidates for 
attaching rings as they do not affect how cars would park or coin collection/meter 
servicing.  These empty poles will be examined and bike parking rings, or replacement racks, 
installed where feasible and where demand exists.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-134, regarding increasing funding to the City's 
HomeBridge program, Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq reports the 
following: 
 
The City has worked with the Affordable Housing Trust to plan for expanding the HomeBridge 
program to serve homebuyers earning between 100% and 120% of area median income (AMI).  
The Affordable Housing Trust recently approved changes which will allow for this program 
expansion.   
 
HomeBridge is a component of the City’s homebuyer assistance programs which offers direct 
funding to homebuyers purchasing homes on the market.  Through HomeBridge, the City 
provides buyers with between 40% and 50% of their home purchase price.  HomeBridge, and 
similar prior assistance programs, have been funded by the Trust with Community Preservation 
Act (CPA) funds.  CPA funds can be used to assist households whose incomes are less than 
100% AMI.  Homes purchased with HomeBridge funding become part of the City’s stock of 
deed-restricted affordable housing. 
 
At its meeting on November 19th, the Trust approved measures needed to expand HomeBridge to 
households earning up to 120% AMI.  The Trust also approved $3 million in funding for 
households earning between 100% and 120% AMI, which is expected to serve at least 8 to 10 
homebuyers.  CDD is now planning for the launch of this new program component which is 
expected to be available in January.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of Federal CARES Act funds in the amount of 
$1,256,118 to the Public Investment Fund Community Development Department Extraordinary 
Expenditures account.   
 
This is the second round of funding that the City has received through The Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act; a law intended to address the 
economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  The City plans on using the 
funds to assist residents and small business owners who are impacted by the virus, and to support 
emergency housing assistance efforts.    
 
Half of the funding ($628,059) will support the Small Business Relief Grants program. Funding 
will provide short term financial assistance to approximately 100 eligible businesses impacted by 
the COVID-19 pandemic. The program provides grants of up to $6,000 and may be used for 
commercial mortgage/rent, inventory, payroll, or purchase of Personal Protective Equipment 
(PPE). 
 
The other half of funding ($628,059) will support the continuation of the City of Cambridge 
COVID-19 Housing Stabilization program which provides up to 6 months of housing assistance 
to eligible Cambridge residents. These additional dollars will support approximately 150 
households who have not already received 6 months of assistance through this program.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of new Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds from 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the amount of $2,268.869.00 
to the Grant Fund Department of Human Services Programs Salary and Wages account 
($106,013.00) and to the Grant Fund Department of Human Services Programs Other Ordinary 
Maintenance account ($2,162,856.00). 
 
These funds are received from HUD as an entitlement grant awarded to the City, and are 
authorized by the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Funds will be 
used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus pandemic among individuals and 
families who are homeless and will support shelter operating costs and provision of essential 
services to homeless persons outside of a shelter setting.  
 
Funds for the initial ESG-CV award were appropriated in July and October 2020. The current 
appropriation of $2,268,869 will support: BayCove’s enhanced medical street outreach, 
HomeStart Rapid Rehousing project, support for the daytime expansion of the seasonal Warming 
Center, Rapid Rehousing assistance through the Multi-Service Center, and HMIS costs to ensure 
compliance with reporting requirements.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it 

Packet Pg. 57

 
ORDERED:

such  other  areas  or  spaces  determined,  or  approved,  by  the  Planning 
Board to be open space. 
Perimeter  and  Transition:  Any  part  of  the  perimeter  of  a  PUD  which 
fronts on an existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed 
as to complement and harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to 
scale,  density,  setback,  bulk,  height,  landscaping,  and  screening. 
Development  in  the  PUD-CDK  District  should  provide  integrated 
pedestrian  circulation  systems,  particularly  strong  linkages  between  the 
Broad Canal and Kendall Square. 

Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the 
off-street  Parking  and  Loading  Requirements  set  forth  in  Article 6.000, 
except as modified by this Section 13.205. 
Parking: 
Minimum  Parking.  There  shall  be  no  minimum  parking  requirements 
within the PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in 
approving  a  Final  Development  Plan  may  specify  a  minimum  parking 
requirement  based  on  review  and  analysis  of  Transportation  Impact 
Studies  and  other  relevant  information  on  parking  demand  provided  in 
application documents, and with the guidance of City agencies. 
Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a Development Parcel 
within the PUD-CDK District shall be limited by applying the rates set 
forth  below  to  each  use  within  a  Development  Parcel  subject  to  PUD-
CDK and taking the summation of the result for all uses. For any use not 
listed below, the maximum parking ratio set forth in Article 6.000, to the 
extent  provided,  shall  apply.  Exceeding  the  maximum  allowed  parking 
shall  require  a  waiver  of  maximum  parking  required  under  the  general 
provisions of Article 6.000. 
i. 

Maximum  of  0.8  spaces  per  1,000  square  feet  of  Gross  Floor 
Area for office and laboratory uses. 
Maximum  of  0.5  spaces  per  1,000  square  feet  of  Gross  Floor 
Area for retail space. 

ii. 

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall  make  a  finding  that  that  the  Final  Development  Plan  provides 
adequate parking for the proposed uses and that the Final Development 
Plan  does  not  substantially  increase  net-new  off-street  parking  spaces 
within the PUD-CDK District. 
The  parking  requirements  of  this  Section  13.205.2  may  be  satisfied  (a) 
anywhere  in  the  PUD-CDK  District,  or  if  located  outside  of  the  PUD-
CDK District, within 2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in 
part  by  an  easement,  lease  agreement,  occupancy  agreement, license  or 
other  comparable  legal  instrument  between  the  developer  and  the  City, 
other  public  entity  or  private  owner  or  consortium  for  use  of  parking 
spaces in the public or shared parking facilities within said area. 
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  Article  6.000,  this  Zoning 
Ordinance  shall  not  restrict the  management  and  assignment  of  parking 
spaces  in  a  way  that  will  most  efficiently  utilize  the  existing  and 
proposed parking spaces to serve all approved uses. 
Loading:  The  Planning  Board,  in  its  approval  of  a  Final  Development 
Plan, may waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of

Section  6.100  of  this  Zoning  Ordinance,  provided  that,  in  accordance 
with  Section  6.108,  any  of  the  requirements  in  Section  6.100  may  be 
modified  by  the  Planning  Board  through  its  approval  of  a  Final 
Development Plan. 
Special  Requirements,  Standards,  and  Provisions  Applicable  to 
Development  Authorized  by  the  Planning  Board  in  the  PUD-CDK 
District. 
Relationship  to  PUD-3.  The  previously  issued  PUD-3  special  permit(s) 
shall  remain  valid  and  in  full  force  and  effect  for,  and  govern  with 
respect  to,  all  remaining  land  of  the  PUD-3  District  outside  of  a 
Development  Parcel,  including  without  limitation  with  respect  to  a 
rebuilding due to casualty, provided that the terms of such PUD-3 special 
permit(s) shall be applied to such remaining land without regard to any 
rights granted to a Development Parcel pursuant to a PUD-CDK special 
permit. For the avoidance of doubt and subject to this Section 13.206.1, 
the Planning Board shall administer the applicable PUD special permits 
in  accordance  with  the  applicable  PUD  overlay  zoning  provision  that 
govern such special permits (e.g., PUD-3 or PUD-CDK, as the case may 
be). 
Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit to a Development 
Parcel shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-
3 special permit to that Development Parcel, and the PUD-CDK zoning 
shall govern with respect to such additional rights. A PUD-CDK special 
permit  application  may  request  that  the  Planning  Board  simultaneously 
issue  a  minor  amendment  to  any  special  permit  under  PUD-3  covering 
such  Development  Parcel,  including  to  establish  that  the  Development 
Parcel is no longer subject to such special permit, so long as such minor 
amendment  does  not  alter  the  remainder  of  the  development  that  is 
subject to such special permit under PUD-3. 
To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more  special  permit(s),  site  plan  approval(s)  and/or  variance(s)  issued 
prior  to  the  issuance  date  of  a  PUD-CDK  special  permit  granted 
hereunder and the provisions of such existing approval(s) conflict or are 
inconsistent  with  the  PUD-CDK  special  permit,  the  provisions  of  the 
PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 
Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District 
shall comply with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 
22.20 of this Zoning Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain 
documentation showing how the development at an aggregate level will 
comply with the requirements of Section 22.20. The conditions of a PUD 
special  permit  shall  set  forth  procedures  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
Section 22.20. 
The  Sustainability  and  Resiliency  Plan  component  of  a  Development 
Proposal shall describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will 
incorporate  a  comprehensive  design  approach  and  incorporate  the  best 
practices  for  meeting  sustainability  as  outlined  in  the  City’s  Net  Zero 
Action  Plan,  Climate  Change  Preparedness  and  Resilience  Plan,  and 
other sustainability plans and guidelines promulgated by the City at the

time  the  Development  Proposal  is  submitted.  The  conditions  of  a  PUD 
special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be reviewed as 
part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within  an  approved  Final  Development  Plan.  At  a  minimum,  buildings 
shall incorporate best practices in the following areas: 

2.3

to 

the  potential 

the  extent  practicable, 

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve 
reduce 
building  energy  and, 
carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new building within 
the  PUD-CDK  District  will  evaluate 
for 
implementation  of  net  zero  ready  measures  and  on-site  energy 
generation  (which  may  include  rooftop  solar  pv)  within  the 
PUD-CDK  District  in  the  context  of  ownership,  economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  analysis  for  such  new  building  and 
will implement energy efficiency mitigation for such building to 
achieve  the  maximum  energy  reductions  possible  identified  in 
such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial 
building  shall  include  a  study,  prepared  by  the  developer, 
considering the feasibility of connecting the proposed building to 
the existing district steam system, if available. 
(b)  Urban  Site  and  Landscaping;  Water  Management.  The 
developer  of  a  new  building  must  explore  opportunities  for 
potable  water  use  reductions  and  the  ability  to  enhance 
indigenous plantings in and around the development site. 
(c)  Cool  Roofs.  All  new  buildings  approved  in  the  PUD-CDK 
District  must  employ  Functional  Green  Roofs  (as  such  term  is 
defined in Article 22.000 of this Zoning Ordinance), high-albedo 
“white” roofs, or a functionally equivalent roofing system. 
(d)  Monitoring.  All  new  buildings  in  the  PUD-CDK  District 
shall  be  required  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the 
Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance, Chapter 
8.67 of the Municipal Code. 
(e) Healthy Living and Working.  All new buildings in the PUD-
CDK  District  shall  provide  people  with  access  to  daylight  and

(g)  Flood  Resiliency.  All  new  buildings  must  incorporate  the 
City  of  Cambridge’s  most  up-to-date  standards  to  address 
projected future flooding impacts. 
(h) Site Cooling Strategies. A Final Development Plan within the 
PUD-CDK  District  shall  incorporate  measures  to  reduce  urban 
heat  island  effects  and  identify  interior  and  exterior  spaces  in 
designated locations to act as cooling areas. 

Letter  of  Commitment.  The  Letter  of  Commitment  date  ____________ 
13.206.3 
by _____________ is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the Cambridge 
Zoning  Ordinance  and  shall  be  binding  upon  ______________  and  its  successors  and 
assigns. To the extent the provisions of the Letter of Commitment are inconsistent with

Re: Re-Submission of Zoning Amendment Petition 

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance 
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey, 
and Zondervan: 

On behalf of BMR-Third LLC, a subsidiary of BioMed Realty, L.P., we are pleased to re-

submit for your review the enclosed rezoning petition for a proposed amendment to the Zoning 
Ordinance and the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, which, upon adoption, would result in 
a new Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) District CDK. As you know, on March 11, 2020 we 
submitted the enclosed rezoning petition to the City Clerk, and the City Council referred the 
rezoning petition to the Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee at the March 16, 2020 
City Council meeting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Planning Board cancelled its 
meetings for the months of April, May and early June, and has since re-commenced remote 
meetings on June 16, 2020. Accordingly, in July we re-submitted the PUD-CDK rezoning 
petition but due to certain scheduling constraints we are re-submitting the enclosed rezoning 
petition. The enclosed rezoning petition is exactly the same as the March and July petitions other 
than any revised dates or references to this re-submission, as the case may be. 

As you know, we have worked closely with the City to see to the stewardship of what is 

now branded as Canal District Kendall (formerly Kendall Square and Cambridge Research Park) 
since completing the acquisition of the former Lyme Properties portfolio in 2007. Specific 
stewardship projects include ongoing improvements to the public realm (including renovation of 
the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the introduction of public art, improvements to the ice

skating rink and boat launch, a commitment to local retail, and the on-going redevelopment and 
dedication of Termeer Square) and the development of 450 Kendall Street. We now come to you 
with what we hope is the final step in finishing what Lyme Properties started in 1999 by 
realizing on the longstanding goal of having a significant arts and culture facility in the 
neighborhood. At the same time, we hope to replace the Eversource gas facility located along 
Third Street to make way for an iconic architectural building that enhances the public realm and 
the connections among surrounding open spaces. As you will see in the enclosed proposed 
Zoning Map amendment, the new overlay district covers the portion of the Canal District 
Kendall that was originally developed as Kendall Square plus the Eversource site (referred to 
here as the gas transfer station site, or “GTS Site,” for ease of reference). 

A. Background. We submit this petition after soliciting extensive public feedback 

through community open houses, surveys, deeply engaging with the arts community, and other 
means to determine what type of arts and culture facility the City wants to see at 585 Third 
Street, the former Constellation Center site (also known as “Parcel C”). As you know, 
Constellation acquired the site in 2002 and spent over 15 years trying to raise the capital for a 
theater complex at the location. In the interim, the rest of the area within the proposed PUD-
CDK has been improved to now include approximately 757,970 square feet of office and 
laboratory space, 75,500 square feet of retail and restaurant uses, and 465 residential units. 
Unfortunately, a standalone theater proved not to be economically viable on Parcel C. We 
acquired Parcel C in 2018, and have subsequently entered into an option agreement with 
Eversource that creates the possibility of combining Parcel C with the abutting GTS Site. The 
finite duration of the option agreement and the unique ability to  relocate the GTS in 
coordination with a development spanning both parcels makes this a one-in-a-generation 
opportunity. We continue to work diligently on establishing a new location for the GTS facility, 
and are nearer than ever to achieving our goal, but have not yet completed that effort. 

We and our affiliates are the owners of abutting first class laboratory facilities that serve 
as key locations for companies like Takeda, Alnylam, and Eli Lilly; the success of development 
on Parcel C was and is highly important to us and our shareholders. As majority owners in the 
association that manages the public realm of the Canal District Kendall, the public realm is also 
essential to us and to our tenants – both biotech and retailers alike. We are convinced that we can 
make a significant impact with an arts and culture facility in a way that fits into the 
neighborhood, is attractive to a diverse set of Cambridge residents and visitors, enhances the 
public realm, is economically viable, and otherwise furthers the development goals of the 
community, while being within the guidelines of our mission as a real estate investment 
company focusing on high quality life sciences space. 

B.  Summary of Petition. Our zoning petition memorializes the previously approved and 

constructed density at each site within the proposed PUD-CDK, and allows for additional 
development on Parcel C and the GTS Site to achieve the project concept described below. The 
proposed amendment permits a mixed use development project that is a new building containing 
an arts, culture, and public space component that complements the existing 465 apartments and 
commercial space, and, as noted above, creates incentives for incorporating the GTS Site by 
allowing for greater bulk and height, and public realm amenities, if the GTS Site is included. The 
height and floor area, under a scenario where the GTS facility is removed from Third Street,

would be 250 feet and up to 550,000 gross square feet, respectively. The proposed amendment 
does not grant further development potential to the existing buildings constructed within PUD-
CDK. 

C. Project Concept. Since acquiring Parcel C, we have worked tirelessly with our 
consultant team to unlock the full potential of the site. The renderings enclosed show the fruits of 
our labor. To accommodate the building and concepts shown, the proposed PUD-CDK allows us 
to combine Parcel C with the GTS Site and construct mixed use laboratory and office above 
approximately 40,000 square feet of arts, culture, and public space, all in a striking 21st-century 
building consistent with existing and other proposed building heights in the vicinity. This 
building will significantly enhance the open spaces surrounding it, and will help strengthen the 
pedestrian corridor that ties together Termeer Square to the north, the Broad Canal and Broad 
Canal Way retail to the south, and the future Volpe Center project to the west (across Third 
Street).  All of this can be done in a manner that meets the sustainability practices of modern 
construction and caters to a community as economically and culturally diverse as Cambridge. 

Compare the renderings of our proposed project to the existing condition, also shown in 

the enclosed renderings. Parcel C is the “missing tooth” in the Canal District Kendall, and the 
location of the GTS Site (the last remnant of an industrial zone on Third Street) exacerbates the 
problem from an urban planning perspective. We believe that the project facilitated by the 
enclosed rezoning is a massive improvement, and a welcome addition, to the Cambridge 
pedestrian environment. 

We note that we have every intention of including the GTS Site in our proposed project. 
Although the ability to move the GTS facilities is not entirely within our control, we have been 
working continuously with Eversource and others to reach agreements that are necessary for the 
exercise of our option to acquire the GTS Site and move its facilities to a non-residential 
location. However, some details remain to be worked out and, out of an abundance of caution, 
we have drafted the petition allowing for the possibility that the project might not include the 
GTS Site by providing for a more limited scope of improvements utilizing only Parcel C to 
advance the vision of a community arts facility on the ground floor of a mixed use building. 
While not our preference because its impact would be less transformative and enriching for the 
neighborhood, we believe it is a viable alternative project. 

D. Benefits. Our preferred proposed project, utilizing the GTS Site, will result in many 

benefits for the East Cambridge community, and the community close to PUD-CKD in 
particular. Those benefits, many of which will be memorialized in a commitment letter to be 
submitted to City Council, have an approximate value of at least Sixty Million Dollars 
($60,000,000), and include the following: 

 A commitment to use reasonable efforts to relocate the existing utility facilities 

from the GTS Site to a non-residential location. 

 An arts and culture component of 30,000 square feet, inclusive of a 250-300 seat 
state-of-the-art theater, if the GTS Site is included (and, in any event, arts and 
culture space of at least 15,000 square feet).
10,000 square feet of indoor all-season public space.

Practical  measures to support  a diverse,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  operatine
model  for the arts and culture component.
No new parking.
Use of best practices  for meeting  sustainability goals in areas  such  as energ).
emissions, water,  materials,  urban site reuse,  and landscaping.
No new  gas connection.

Our proposal  is the end result  of many  community  meetings  and public  presentations

with neighbors,  neighborhood  stakeholders, and with stakeholders  at City Hall, including  three
open  houses, multiple  meetings with an Arts Advisory Committee  comprised  of community  arts
advocates,  a public  survey,  and solicitations for public  comment  on presentation  boards  that we
displayed  at our open houses.  Key takeaways from  the public  process  included a focus on the
need for flexible performing  arts spaces  for small  and larger  productions,  community  arts  spaces
(such  as classrooms for leaming art and exhibit space),  public gathering  spaces  available  across
all four  seasons,  and relocating  the GTS facility away from  Third Street.  Our proposed zoning
overlay  text and map encourages  achievement  of these goals, with the publicly  accessible
facilities  within  and commanding  the lower  levels  of a unique  and beautiful  commercial  building
that will provide over an acre of new  landscaped  area (indoors and outdoors),  subject  to further
detailed  review by the Planning  Board  under the contemplated  special  permit process.

We  are excited to work with you in the formal  review process  for the zoning amendment
and again  upon  submission  of an application for a PUD-CDK  special  permit.  We  are committed
to East  Cambridge  and to doing all that we can to make Canal District Kendall  a shining  example
of the best of mixed-use  transit-oriented  development  for the 21st century.

Very truly  yours,

13.201

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 

Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use district that is 
comprised of high quality general and technical office and labs with diverse active 
commercial and community uses (including retail and restaurant uses, and arts and 
cultural uses), all of which promote, create corridors among, and enhance the existing 
open space network within and surrounding the district, and provide benefits to the 
surrounding community through community arts and publicly accessible interior 
gathering space. In particular, the district facilitates strengthening the public open 
space connections among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the 
Broad Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street. The PUD-CDK District creates incentives to 
(A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and culture facility that will further diversify the 
mix of uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade utility 
and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station on Third Street to 
enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street and provide an attractive 
connector corridor between the district and the East Cambridge neighborhood. The 
parcel on which the existing gas regulator/transfer station is located is referred to 
herein as the “Gas Transfer Station Parcel”. 

13.202

PUD-CDK Special Permit

13.202.1 Eligible Development Parcel. To further the purpose of this Section 13.200, an 

applicant may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the 
Planning Board approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel 
located within the PUD-CDK District that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK 
special permit, consists of at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the 
foregoing, the Final Development Plan for a currently vacant or undeveloped 
Development Parcel under this PUD-CDK overlay zoning shall include either an Arts 
and Culture Center or Community Arts Facility, as further provided in Section 
13.204.1(b) below. 

13.202.2 PUD-CDK Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-CDK 

special permit approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel upon 
finding that the Final Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, 
and all other criteria applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought. 

13.202.3 PUD-CDK Special Permit Requirements. Within the Development Parcel the 
locations of the open spaces, the quantities of proposed land uses, the building 
envelope, and heights shall be indicated in sufficient detail that the Planning Board 
can reasonably assess the impact of the PUD-CDK special permit and its general 
consistency with the PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 13.202.4 
below. At a minimum, a Development Proposal and subsequent Final Development 
Plan must contain the following components:  

(a) Site Development Plan: describing how the Development Parcel is divided 
into use areas and their development characteristics, including potential uses and 
Gross Floor Area.

Culture Center that may be required by Section 13.204.1(b) and strategies for 
programming and activating such spaces.  

(g) Sustainability and Resiliency Plan: describing: (1) how the sustainability 
requirements set forth in Section 13.206.2 below will be met; (2) how the proposed 
development will promote best practices for environmental sustainability and 
resiliency; and (3) how the proposed development serves nearby East Cambridge 
community-wide needs for emergency refuge or shelter during heat or storm 
emergencies in coordination with the Cambridge Climate Vulnerability Assessment 
dated February 2017.  

(h) Transportation Plan: incorporating: (1) a Traffic Study as required by Section 

19.20 of this Zoning Ordinance or a Transportation Assessment pursuant to Section 
13.205.2; (2) a shared parking study to demonstrate that the district’s parking supply 
can accommodate future anticipated demands at full build out; (3) a study of the

(i) Arts and Culture Operations Plan: To the extent a Community Arts Facility or 

an Arts and Culture Center is required by Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK 
overlay zoning or the proposed development project will include Arts and Culture 
Uses, identifies opportunities and strategies for promoting inclusive engagement of 
local residents and the general public, promoting intergenerational interactions 
through arts and culture programming, and stimulating community gatherings and 
interactions for extended hours throughout the day and seasons.  

(j) Local Retail Plan: identifies opportunities and strategies for promoting retail 
collaboration with local independent artists for the display and/or sale of their work,

13.202.4 PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria. In approving a Final Development Plan, the 

Planning Board shall consider the following objectives with respect to any new Gross 
Floor Area or the construction of a new building:  

(a) If Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires a 
Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, such Community Arts 
Facility or Arts and Culture Center (i) takes into consideration the orientation of the 
uses, location of building entrances, pedestrian connectivity between such uses and 
adjacent open space areas, and the ability of such uses to promote diversity and serve 
all residents of the City of Cambridge; and (ii) creates a facility available for the 
neighborhood that supports or promotes small arts or theater organizations, 
independent artists, art co-working opportunities, or partnerships among the 
foregoing and the local community. Furthermore, the developer of such Community 
Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center shall have demonstrated a commitment to 
establishing an arts and culture operational plan for space within the new building 
that will be made available for teaching, learning, rehearsing, or idea exchange. 

(b) Contributes to the diversity of East Cambridge and Kendall Square through 

encouraging innovative uses, activities, programs, or opportunities that will be 
publicly accessible such as art galleries or community gathering spaces.  

(c) Enhances the Third Street corridor by improving the streetscape through 
visible activity and publicly accessible elements within and adjacent to the ground 
floor if the Development Parcel includes the Gas Transfer Station Parcel; or otherwise 
enhances ground floor connectivity to the adjacent streetscape by use of publicly 
accessible interior ground floor areas or spaces if the Development Parcel does not 
include the Gas Transfer Station Parcel.  

(d) Integrates development with new and existing open spaces physically and 

functionally.  

(e) Enhances the pedestrian connections among Termeer Square, the plaza 
abutting the Broad Canal, the Broad Canal, and Third Street, and creates publicly 
accessible interior ground floor pathways to such areas to the extent feasible if the

Broad Canal) by use of publicly accessible interior ground floor areas or spaces if the 
Development Parcel does not include the Gas Transfer Station Parcel. 

(f) The developer shall have demonstrated a commitment to seeking solutions to 

relocate applicable above-grade utility infrastructure on the Gas Transfer Station 
Parcel to other appropriate locations and away from key streetscape corridors if 
Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires an Arts and Culture 
Center. 

(g) Demonstrates a commitment to seeking high quality, locally-based retail and 

restaurant owners or operators where such uses are part of the Final Development 
Plan, and promotes collaboration between any retail component and the Arts and 
Culture Uses that are part of the Final Development Plan. 

13.202.5 Condominium Property Regime. A developer may submit a building subject to PUD-
CDK to a condominium property regime. A violation of one or more conditions of a 
PUD-CDK special permit by one condominium unit owner (or its occupant) shall not 
be deemed to be a violation by another condominium unit owner (or its occupant). 

13.202.6 Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. A violation, with respect to an 

individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any 
provision of this Section 13.200 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any 
other individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel. A 
PUD-CDK special permit may specify that certain modifications to the Final 
Development Plan do not alter the concept of the PUD and such modifications shall 
be considered minor amendments under Section 12.37 of this Zoning Ordinance 
subject only to written approval of the Planning Board if the developer demonstrates 
that such modification(s): (i) constitute a reallocation or reconfiguration of Gross 
Floor Area among uses in the Final Development Plan or otherwise allowed in the 
PUD-CDK District, (ii) do not require a new type of zoning relief (other than the 
categories of relief previously granted for the proposed development project, whether 
by existing PUD special permits or otherwise), and (iii) maintain the same percentage 
of Minimum Open Space as approved by the PUD-CDK special permit. 

13.202.7 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a development proposal for a 

Development Parcel, the developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD 
Pre-Application Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site 
arrangement, building massing, and public space arrangement, as well as general 
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the Planning Board to 
provide the developer informal feedback prior to preparing the Final Development 
Plan materials. As set forth in Section 12.33.2 of this Zoning Ordinance, any 
statement made by the Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application 
Conference shall not be legally binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3 of this 
Zoning Ordinance, the developer shall present graphic and written materials as 
needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development alternatives.

frontage along at least 75 linear feet of Third Street or otherwise, at the developer’s 
option, provide an appropriate pedestrian corridor between the existing or planned 
open space in the PUD-CDK District and open space to the west of Third Street. In 
addition to the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its review of a special permit 
application under this Section 13.204.3, may except from the calculation of the height 
of buildings and structures in the PUD-CDK District chimneys, water towers, air 
conditioning equipment, ventilators, and other necessary features appurtenant to 
buildings which are otherwise typically carried above roofs and are not used for 
human occupancy, including mechanical floors within a building where for functional 
or aesthetic reasons such equipment, structures, or features are on above-grade levels 
of the building other than the roof level or above. 

13.204.4 Other Dimensional Requirements: There shall be no minimum lot area, no minimum 
lot width, no minimum frontage, and no minimum front, side or rear yard

than fifteen percent (15%) open space as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 in 
the PUD-CDK District except as modified below.  

13.204.5.1

13.204.5.2

The Planning Board, in its review of any special permit application for a 
development containing a Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, 
may consider indoor or covered pedestrian ways, decks, arcades, loggias, and 
gallerias appurtenant to the Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center, 
even if located on a different Development Parcel in the PUD-CDK District, to be 
open space provided that the same is publicly accessible during normal business 
hours. The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall make a finding that there is no net-loss of open space already existing within 
the PUD-CDK District (other than within any previously undeveloped or vacant 
Development Parcel). 

Open space, whether already existing within the PUD-CDK District or to be 
constructed by the developer or its affiliate, shall include, without limitation, the 
following: parks; plazas; lawns; landscaped areas substantially open to the sky; 
playgrounds; balconies; roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage; 
pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified 
by the Planning Board; and such other areas or spaces determined, or approved, 
by the Planning Board to be open space.   

13.204.6 Perimeter and Transition: Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an 
existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and 
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, 
height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-CDK District should 
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages 
between the Broad Canal and Kendall Square.

Parking and Loading Requirements.

13.205.1 Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the off-street 

Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as modified by 
this Section 13.205. 

13.205.2 Parking:  

13.205.2.1 Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements within the 
PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in approving a Final 
Development Plan may specify a minimum parking requirement based on review 
and analysis of Transportation Assessments and other relevant information on 
parking demand provided in application documents, and with the guidance of City 
agencies.  

13.205.2.2

13.205.2.3

13.205.2.4

13.205.2.5

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, shall 
make a finding that that the Final Development Plan provides adequate parking 
for the proposed uses and that the Final Development Plan does not substantially 
increase net-new off-street parking spaces within the PUD-CDK District. 

The parking requirements of this Section 13.205.2 may be satisfied (a) anywhere 
in the PUD-CDK District, or if located outside of the PUD-CDK District, within 
2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in part by an easement, lease 
agreement, occupancy agreement, license or other comparable legal instrument 
between the developer and the City, other public entity or private owner or 
consortium for use of parking spaces in the public or shared parking facilities 
within said area. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 6.000, this Zoning Ordinance 
shall not restrict the management and assignment of parking spaces in a way that 
will most efficiently utilize the existing and proposed parking spaces to serve all 
approved uses. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 19.20, the Planning Board 
may permit the Developer to substitute a Transportation Assessment in form and 
substance acceptable to the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department if the 
Planning Board otherwise determines that the materials submitted with the Final 
Development Plan adequately describe the impacts of traffic and parking on the 
area surrounding the Development Parcel.  

13.205.3 Loading: The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may 
waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities 
within the PUD-CDK District, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across 
various uses within the PUD-CDK District or the adjacent PUD-3 District. 

13.205.4 Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100 
of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the 
requirements in Section 6.100 may be modified by the Planning Board through its 
approval of a Final Development Plan.

13.206

Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to Development 
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK District.

13.206.1 Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s) shall remain 

13.206.2 Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District shall comply 

valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, all development 
projects constructed pursuant thereto and existing prior to the enactment date of this 
Section 13.200 for the PUD-CDK District, including without limitation with respect 
to rebuilding due to casualty. Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit 
shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-3 special permit, 
and the PUD-CDK zoning shall govern with respect to such additional rights, except 
however any rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit shall 
automatically supersede any undeveloped rights for the applicable development 
parcel as provided for under the PUD-3 zoning. Such undeveloped rights, and any 
associated outstanding obligations with respect to such rights, under a previously 
issued PUD-3 special permit shall be deemed automatically extinguished as of the 
date that the subsequent PUD-CDK special permit becomes valid and effective, and 
such automatic extinguishment shall be deemed to be a minor amendment of such 
previously issued special permit under PUD-3 under Section 12.37.2 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to the 
issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted hereunder and the provisions of 
such existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the PUD-CDK special 
permit, the provisions of the PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 

with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain documentation showing how the 
development at an aggregate level will comply with the requirements of Section 
22.20. The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the 
requirements of Section 22.20.  

The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development Proposal shall 
describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will incorporate a 
comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best practices for meeting 
sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero Action Plan, Climate Change 
Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and other sustainability plans and guidelines 
promulgated by the City at the time the Development Proposal is submitted. The 
conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be 
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall 
incorporate best practices in the following areas:  

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve building energy 
and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new 
building within the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for implementation 
of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may include rooftop 
solar pv) within the PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse gas 
emissions analysis for such new building and will implement energy efficiency

(h) Site Cooling Strategies. A Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK 
District shall incorporate measures to reduce urban heat island effects and identify 
interior and exterior spaces in designated locations to act as cooling areas. 

13.206.3 Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment dated _________ by 

____________ is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the Cambridge 
Zoning Ordinance and shall be binding upon __________ and its successors and 
assigns. To the extent the provisions of the Letter of Commitment are inconsistent

The City Council was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Brian Flynn on 
November 25, 2020; and 
 
Brian was Managing Attorney of the Asian Outreach/Employment Law Unit at Greater 
Boston Legal Services (GBLS); and  
 
In 1996, Brian joined GBLS’ Cambridge office, Cambridge and Somerville Legal 
Services, later joining the GBLS Welfare Law Unit before ultimately moving to the 
Employment Law Unit; and 
 
As a legal aid attorney, Brian was a champion for low-income people and anyone who 
suffered injustice; and 
 
Brian was passionately committed to helping others, and always made time to share his 
expertise with colleagues and mentor law students; and 
 
Brian’s passing will leave a void in the lives of his surviving family, friends, and 
colleagues, and he will be greatly missed by all the lives he touched; now therefore be 
it 
 
That the City Council go on record extending its deepest sympathy to Brian Flynn’s 
family at this time of such personal loss; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of

WHEREAS: 

Envision Cambridge includes the following goals: 
 

•  Shared Community Prosperity: Provide opportunities for Cambridge 

residents of all educational backgrounds and skill levels to access jobs that pay 
a living wage in Cambridge and the surrounding region so that they can share 
in the city’s prosperity 

•  Equity and Fairness: Support efforts to erase racial and gender disparities in 

economic opportunity; and 

 
Cambridge owns an underutilized property at 105 Windsor Street; and 
 
The activation of this property is a clear opportunity to create business opportunities 
for Black and brown community members in the Port neighborhood; now therefore be 
it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to provide a report on the condition 
of the building and a cost estimate of any repairs needed; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to initiate a community process to 
develop the property at 105 Windsor Street with an eye towards using the building as a 
community space that will create economic opportunity in the neighborhood, as part of 
an overall neighborhood plan that includes looking for ways to create affordable 
housing, open space and urban agriculture opportunities; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ripple across our 
community, and thanks to the swift actions of the City, programs like the Mayor’s 
Disaster Relief Fund for Small Businesses have offered a lifeline to numerous 
businesses that have been struggling to survive until this crisis abates; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  While the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund for Small Businesses stopped accepting new

applications from businesses seeking relief on May 29, it remained an open question as 
to whether this program might be opened back up to new applicants at some point in 
the future; and  
 
As we near the one-year mark of this pandemic, the need from many businesses for 
financial assistance remains as great as ever; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Mayor’s Office, 
the Finance Department, and any other pertinent City staff to determine the remaining 
balance in the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund for Small Businesses, to determine 
whether this fund will be opening a second round of fiscal assistance to local 
businesses, and to report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

As the pandemic has caused widespread layoffs and business closures, food insecurity 
has skyrocketed, with Massachusetts experiencing the highest increase in food 
insecurity of any state across the country, rising from 1 in 13 Massachusetts residents 
being food insecure pre-pandemic, to 1 in 7 residents currently, a 59% increase; and 
 
Food insecurity has drastically increased within the two Congressional districts 
Cambridge is a part of as well, with the Seventh Congressional District rising from 
13.7% in 2018 to 18.8% in 2020, and the Fifth Congressional District rising from 6.9% 
in 2018 to 12.0% in 2020; and 
 
Food insecurity in Cambridge is currently estimated by the Greater Boston Food Bank 
to be 13% of all residents, or approximately 15,000 residents; and 
 

struggling to keep up; and 
 
The Greater Boston Food Bank, for example, currently distributes 2.5 million pounds 
of food to 660,000 people each week, significantly more than the 1 million pounds of 
food they distributed to 415,000 people each week before this public health crisis 
began, and the numbers have only been growing; and 
 
Anecdotally, food pantries in Cambridge are reporting a 10-15% increase in food 
pantry usage in recent months, and use has been increasing steadily as we head into 
what is likely to be another COVID-19 surge, with many unemployment benefits due 
to expire on December 31, 2020; and 
 
In order to meaningfully intervene and help fight food insecurity in our community 
during this critical time, we must learn more about what our local food pantries are 
experiencing and how the City can support them as they fill in this critical resource 
gap; and 
 
7,338 residents are impacted by the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program) Gap, which is the difference between the number of low-income residents 
receiving MassHealth who are likely SNAP eligible and the number of people actually 
receiving SNAP, creating a City-wide SNAP Gap of 46%; and 
 
One way the City may help alleviate the skyrocketing burden on local food pantries is 
by launching an educational outreach campaign to close the SNAP Gap in Cambridge 
and encourage more low-income residents to take advantage of long-term, sustainable 
government assistance programs; now therefore be it

ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of 
Human Service Programs, Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee (CEOC), 
local food pantries, and food access organizations to gain firsthand insight on what 
these organizations are seeing on the ground, and to develop ways to provide increased 
support for the food pantry network; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of 
Human Service Programs, the Public Information Office, and other relevant City 
departments to develop a comprehensive outreach campaign centered on closing the 
SNAP Gap in Cambridge, and educating low-income residents on how they may 
access government assistance benefits; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back on this matter by the

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

Across Massachusetts and in the City, food insecurity has skyrocketed amid mass 
layoffs and business closures, and 15,080 Cambridge residents, or 13% of all 
Cambridge residents, are currently experiencing food-insecurity; and 
 
Of these residents, 7,338 are impacted by the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program) Gap, the difference between the number of low-income residents 
receiving MassHealth who are likely eligible for SNAP, and the number of people 
actually receiving SNAP; and 
 
The SNAP Gap places an immense burden on our local food pantries, who have, 
anecdotally, seen a 10-15% increase in pantry use during the past few months, and who 
are struggling to keep up with the growing need in our community; and 
 
Government food assistance programs, like SNAP, serve as a longer-term, more 
sustainable intervention to hunger that also accommodates recipients’ cultural and 
medical dietary needs more easily and provides economic stimulus in the communities 
they are used in, but many residents may not fully understand how to access the 
benefits they are eligible for, or may struggle to complete the tedious process of filing 
an application for SNAP; and 
 
On December 4th, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Conference report passed in the 
Massachusetts Legislature, which would authorize the Baker administration to use 
$5,000,000 to develop a ‘common application’ that would allow MassHealth 
applicants and recipients to submit an application for SNAP at the same time they are 
applying for medical assistance, and which is currently awaiting approval from the 
Governor; and 
 
The Massachusetts Legislature also authorized the Executive Office of Health and 
Human Services to use $5,000,000 to create such a common application system 
enabling MassHealth applicants to simultaneously submit a SNAP application in An 
Act Financing the General Governmental Infrastructure of the Commonwealth (“IT 
Bond Bill”); and

WHEREAS: 

 
RESOLVED: 

 
ORDERED: 

By streamlining the application process and making it easier for residents to access 
critical food assistance benefits, a common application would help support our low-
income, food-insecure residents during their time of great need; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record as urging Governor Baker to adopt the Fiscal Year 
2021 Budget Conference report and move forward with creating a streamlined 
“common application” to help expand access to and participation in SNAP; and be it 
further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of 
this resolution to Governor Baker, Secretary Sudders, Assistant Secretary Tsai, and the 
Cambridge legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
On Tuesday, December 1st, the School Committee had its last Regular Meeting and both motions that 
I mentioned in the last communication—exploring the implementation of a pool testing strategy as 
well as determining when the Field House can be made for school use—were adopted.  
 
While  the  recommendation  for  approval  regarding  the  winter  sports  guidelines  for  CRLS  remote 
learners was withdrawn by the Superintendent at the December 1st meeting to allow for a discussion 
with the Health and Safety Committee prior to a School Committee vote, CRLS Athletic Director Tom 
Arria still gave his presentation on the proposal for winter sports. The sports that are being considered 
for this year’s winter season are basketball, ice hockey, swim and dive, alpine and Nordic skiing, and 
gymnastics and will follow all state and district guidelines. The recommendation will be placed on the 
agenda for the next Regular Meeting on Tuesday, December 15th.  
 
On Wednesday, December 2nd, the School Climate Subcommittee convened to discuss revisions to the 
elementary  school  check-in  policy  that  the  School  Committee  passed  in  June  with  educators  and 
caregivers.  
 
Following the implementation of this policy, which required weekly individual relationship-building 
check-ins  between  school  staff  and  scholars  and  families,  several  concerns  had  been  raised  by 
elementary school principals. While some schools implemented with success, others reported that the 
requirement felt more like a compliance exercise than a value-add and they did not have the bandwidth 
to deliver.  
 
We  had  an  important  conversation  about  these  challenges  with  some  educators  and  caregivers  of 
varying  perspectives  at  this  meeting  and  discussed  alternative  approaches  to  effectively  building 
relationships between families and schools without losing sight of the emphasis on anti-racism.

Please visit the new CPS COVID-19 Data Dashboard for up-to-date information on the risk of COVID-
19 transmission in our schools. The data is reviewed daily by our Department of Public Health and we 
plan to re-evaluate our metrics again next month.  
 
CPS  has  also  updated  their  “What  Should I  Do?” document,  which  outlines  that  students  and  staff 
should not come to school if they: 

•  Have symptoms of COVID-19 
•  Have tested positive for COVID-19 and have not yet been cleared from isolation to return 
•  Had close contact with a confirmed case within the past 14 days 
•  Have symptomatic household relatives or housemates that have not yet received a negative test 
•  Have traveled to high-risk states within the past 14 days and have not yet received a negative 

test 

 
This  month,  CPS  will  be  engaging  with  families  through  feedback  surveys  and  listening  sessions 
(focused on different groups, including grade bands, in-person and remote learning families, different 
language  communities,  special  education  families,  etc.)  to  hear  their  perspectives  on  the  student 
learning experience thus far, as well as to discuss possible expansion of in-person learning. A link to a 
survey as well as invitations to the listening sessions will go out soon.  
 
The  Department  of  Elementary  and  Secondary  Education  has  provided  districts  with  the  option  to 
decide locally whether snow days will be complete closures that are made up later in the school year, 
or remote learning days. CPS has decided to treat “snow days” as remote learning days for the 2020-
21 school year and those who would normally attend school in-person will continue to learn remotely 
on those days.  
 
We have begun our free virtual winter programming with Elevate Youth and are seeing excellent 
engagement in the first week. The winter programming will continue until at least mid-February, 
before we launch our free in-person spring cohorts again, so we are continuing to accept applications 
for 4th, 5th, and 6th graders. Please share this link with any families you know who may be interested! 
Weekly themes this winter will include learning about wildlife in our neighborhoods, cooking and 
eating new and interesting foods, participating in group yoga and exercise classes, learning tips and 
tricks to getting outside during the winter months, and much more. 
 
Our upcoming meetings are as follows: 

•  Friday, December 4th, 2020 

o  Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee Meeting | 4:00 PM 

▪  To discuss safety policies and the health metrics to ensure they reflect the 

disproportionate risk of COVID-19 to some communities and as part of the plan 
to expand in-person learning 
 

•  Tuesday, December 8th, 2020 

o  Roundtable Meeting | 6:00 PM 

▪  With upper and high school principals 

•  Tuesday, December 15th, 2020 

o  Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM
