just going to go through quickly the attendance and ask if 

the meeting is audible to Board members.   

          I'm starting with Louis Bacci.  Is the meeting 

audible to you?

Shulman from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department is listening in at the meeting and will be 

available for the last item on the agenda.   

          And as for the updates, just welcome to August.  

We are going to have a very full set of meetings as we go 

through the month.  We have two items of business tonight, 

both items that will be seeking recommendations -- Advisory 

Review by the Planning Board.   

          We have next week August 11 two public hearings 

scheduled, they're both new public hearings, cases that 

would have been scheduled in past months that were moved. 

          August 18, we have a public hearing on a zoning 

petition, as well as a hearing on a special permit case.  I 

guess I should just say what the cases are.  

          On August 11, it's 101 Rogers Street, which is the 

Foundry building -- a special permit case, and 1908 

Massachusetts Avenue, a retail cannabis store.   On August 

18, we have 759 Mass Ave, a retail cannabis store and a 

hearing on the fossil fuel City Council Zoning Petition. 

          And we will have a meeting August 25, where we 

will be having a continued public hearing on a proposal for 

75 through 115 Smith Place.  That is a special permit case

for an office laboratory building out in Alewife Quadrangle 

area.  So it'll be a very full August.   

          We also have some -- three zoning petitions that 

have been referred by the City Council at their summer 

meeting last week, which we'll be plotting into the 

schedule, and business to come that we'll be updating you on 

as time goes by.  That's all for me, thanks.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Are there any 

questions on that update from Board members?  All right.  

Hearing none, the next item is approval of meeting minutes. 

The Board has received certified transcripts for the 

meetings held on June 30 and July 14.   

          If there are any questions from the Board, please 

say your name and state your question.  Okay, is there a 

motion to accept the transcripts as the meeting minutes?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved, Steven Cohen.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Steve.  Is

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   Okay, then we are 

moving onto the next item on our agenda, which is a public 

hearing on a zoning petition by the Council to establish a 

new Section 11.207, Affordable Housing Overlay.  We'll hear 

first from the CDD staff, who will summarize why this is 

before us.           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Iram 

Farooq, Assistant City Manager, Community Development.  I 

was going to introduce staff, but I will just say that from 

our Housing Division Chris Cotter and Cassie Arnaud are 

here, in case the Board has specific questions for them; and 

also, from Urban Design, Erik Thorkildsen, who have all been 

central to putting together the work that we're sharing 

today. 

          So I'm going to begin by -- oops, pardon me, I'm 

having -- I apologize.  I am having a little technical 

difficulty, so I'm just going to try one more time.  Thank 

you for your patience. 

          So I'm going to begin by just taking a moment to 

look back at what the city has done to support affordable

housing development in recent years.   

          Some of this thinking dates back as far as 2014, 

when the City Council asked us what the city would need to 

do in order to create a thousand new units of affordable 

housing by 2020? 

          So we workshopped and got all the holders in the 

creation of affordable housing, and came up with a series of 

recommendations that we presented to the Council in early 

2015.   

          We have been working gradually on accomplishing 

these action steps in the intervening years.  The Planning 

Board has been a key participant in this process since 

several of these items involve zoning tools.   

          So in 2015, we completed a Nexus Study and looked 

at our Incentive Zoning Ordinance, and the City Council as a 

result adopted a significant increase in the incentive 

contribution, which is the contribution from nonresidential 

development to the Affordable Housing Trust. 

          This was adopted as an annual increase through 

2018.  Last year, we conducted another study, and the 

Council adopted a further increase to that provision early 

this year.

22

          So the rate that started off in 2015 has just over 

$4 a square foot contribution, is now at over $20 a square 

foot.  So last year, we started receiving funds that 

resulted from the change -- you know, given that development 

cycle.  

          And the change has had a significant impact, and 

we've had much larger contribution in the one year from the 

incentive payments just last year, than we had in the 

history of the provision since its inception. 

          The second idea, staying on the funding team was 

to increase funding for affordable housing utilizing city 

funds.   

          So in 2017, for the first time since the adoption 

of the Inclusionary Zoning Ordinance, a percentage of 

building permitees were allocated to the Trust through the 

city's operating budget.   

          This amount has been increased continuously every 

year since then, and if we look at all of the city funds 

that are allocated to the Affordable Housing Trust, this 

would be the operating funds combined with the Community 

Preservation Act funds.   

          The amount is expected to double in the fiscal

year 2020 compared to what it was in 2019.   

          So I mentioned Community Preservation Act.  Since 

the adoption of the CPA, the city has consistently allocated 

the maximum amount permissible under the law to affordable 

housing.  That's 80 percent of the funds. This is an ongoing 

intervention, and was one of the key goals that was 

identified in 2015.  

          In 2017, the City Council adopted changes to the 

Inclusionary Zoning provisions, which is the companion piece 

to the Incentive Ordinance.  This is the percentage of new 

residential construction that is required to be affordable 

to families who make 80 percent or less of the area median 

income.   

          That percentage used to be just over 12 percent, 

and with that change it has now increased to 20 percent -- 

and again, has had significant [impact.]   

          So that brings us to what we are discussing today.  

That is, changes to the zoning ordinance to allow additional 

density to facilitate the creation of affordable housing, 

and to also make additional sites available and in 

conjunction to streamline the permitting process. 

          So what are we really talking about when we speak 

15

on behalf of affordable housing?  In this case, what we are 

focusing on is buildings that are 100 percent affordable.   

          So they do not have a market rate component.  They 

are permanently affordable, meaning that there is a deed 

restriction that ensures that the only people who will be 

eligible to be tenants or to purchase homes in a building 

would be families who are in the low moderate or middle-

income category, which is essentially families who make up 

to 100 percent of the area median income or lower.   

          And there are really only a handful of entities in 

Cambridge who develop affordable housing.  Most of them are 

non-profits:  the Cambridge Health Authority, Just-A-Start 

and Homeowner's Rehab.  And we have had recently a Capstone 

Communities and Hope Real Estate, which is not a non-profit, 

but through their affordable housing development is not 

making a big profit. 

          So development of affordable housing is not an 

easy proposition.  As I said, no one is making a big profit 

by building affordable housing.  In fact, it's sufficiently 

financially challenging that every 100 percent affordable 

housing building that we have seen developed in the city in 

recent years has required significant subsidy -- from the

city, from the state, as well as from federal sources. 

          So all of these buildings have had to work with 

city staff and have had to channel through the Affordable 

Housing Trust. 

          So here, then, is a map of where the affordable 

housing is located in the city right now.  One of the things 

that has really been talked about is to ensure that 

affordable housing is equitably distributed throughout the 

city, and that's one of the cornerstones of the petition 

that is before you today. 

          So as you can see, there are parts of the city 

right now that have very little affordable housing.  These 

are the parts that appear white right now on the map.  And 

then there are other parts where there's a significantly 

greater contributions -- these are the darker oranges on the 

map.   

          So the principal reason behind this is just the 

difficulty in being able to compete for sites, for building 

sites -- in some of those areas that are lighter colors. 

          The second part is the zoning itself, which 

creates significant limitations -- for instance, in the 

districts that show up as white on the map, where there's a 

17

lot of concentration of white, many of them don't permit 

multifamily housing.   

          So they're also some of the most expensive 

properties in the city, and together this is something that 

the Affordable Housing Overlay is attempting to address.   

          So this is really the positive, or the flip side 

of what I just pointed out as challenges.  So I'm not going 

to go into too, too much detail.  But really the intention 

of the Overlay is to reduce risk a little bit to make it 

easier to procure sites for affordable housing. 

          It's important to note that the city is very much 

a partner with our affordable housing builders in the 

procurement of sites.   

          The Affordable Housing Trust typically is the 

funder at the time of purchase of the sites.  But despite 

that, the risk is something that is an important one for the 

builders to consider, because ultimately what is allocated 

as construction cost per unit of housing is something that's 

really important in terms of being able to effectively 

utilize the resources that the city has. 

          And the second part of this is to make it easier 

to permit to streamline that process, and to reduce the

jeopardy in the permitting process, which can often hold up 

a development and really result in increase of cost, and 

sometimes reduction in the number of units, which we've seen 

in certain projects in the city. 

          And while for a market-rate developer this may -- 

you know, the holding for a while of a site and the slight 

increase in cost may not be -- maybe within the realm of 

tolerance, it's much harder for an affordable housing 

builder. 

          So we have been asked the question of what is 

likely to be the impact of the Affordable Housing Overlay?  

Will it create more units of housing?  Is there even any 

value in adopting this ordinance?   

          And I'll say that, really, the three things that I 

mentioned in terms of procuring the sites is something that 

is going to be really important to allow affordable housing 

to be competitive in parts of the city where we have not 

been able to so far.   

          So in terms of -- let's see -- so for each unit, 

as each unit gets more expensive, it means less units can be 

financed with the same amount of funds.  And in order to 

meet our goals for affordable housing creation, we need to

ensure that we're using the city's funds in the most 

effective way. 

          So that projects get -- as projects get more 

expensive, it means that reaching our goals for housing 

production become more expensive.  And so, we may in fact 

over time be jeopardizing our ability to meet that goal.   

          But if the zoning, the permitting and the 

financing, or the funding, are the three pieces that really 

go hand in hand for creation of affordable housing, and the 

Affordable Housing Overlay is intended to address the first 

two of those, the zoning and the permitting?   

          Let's seeâ€¦  So this is a Redlining Map for 

Cambridge.  This was used in circa 1930s by the banking and 

lending industries to determine what were suitable parts of 

the city, where they would lend money for mortgages and for 

housing creation? 

          So the areas that are red were considered 

hazardous.  The areas that are yellow were considered 

definitely declining.  The blues are still desirable, and 

the greens were classified as, "best."  So you can see we 

don't have a ton of blue and green in Cambridge.   

          And what we have done here is to overlay the

existing affordable housing in the city on top of the 

Redlining Map.   

          So these are the purple dots. The size of the dots 

is based on the number of units.  So the larger dots mean 

more affordable housing, and smaller dots represent fewer 

units of affordable housing.  And as you can see, the bulk 

of the dots are clustered in the red and the yellow areas.   

          So I neglected to mention the white areas.  Those 

were the areas on the Redlining Maps that were not rated.  

Often because housing was not expected to be built there.   

          In our case, if you look at the map, these are 

largely industrially Zondervan areas, and the zoning did not 

historical allow residential development there. 

          So we can see this map as something to be really 

despondent about, because it shows how the systemic aspects 

of segregation have been reinforced through our zoning 

patterns.   

          But we can also look at it and have reason to be 

optimistic.  So when you look at the dots in particular, 

especially those that are in the white areas, you'll note 

that those are the result of zoning interventions that the 

city has undertaken over time.

          So when we adopted the Inclusionary Zoning 

Ordinance, it included densities and those allowed for 

creation of affordable housing in conjunction with market-

rate housing, and many of the dots -- the purple dots -- are 

market-rate buildings that include inclusionary housing 

within them.  And many of those are in -- you'll see -- in 

the white areas as well.   

          Also, on a personal note, one of the first things 

I worked on when I started working with the city was a 

zoning change that allowed residential development in the 

industrial districts, the white areas.  This was not 

something that was permitted prior to 2001.   

          So it's important to recognize that the zoning 

ordinance is not a static document.  And nor should it be.  

It should evolve as our aspirations and our goals for the 

city evolve.   

          So I'm going to leave you with this historical 

piece, as something to mull over and just turn it over to 

Jeff Roberts to talk to you about the specifics of the 

zoning petition that is before you today. 

          Thank you.  Jeff, you're on.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Iram.  And while we --

pause on this slide for a second, and before I launch into 

it, just wanted to situate the Board a little bit, before we 

get into the details of the petition. 

          So this -- the Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning 

Petition was heard by the Planning Board in 2019.  At that 

time, the Planning Board recommended adoption.  Ultimately, 

the City Council did not vote on the petition, and it 

expired due to no action being taken. 

          So this version of the petition that's before the 

Planning Board at this hearing was referred by the City 

Council in February.  It would have been heard in April, but 

that meeting was canceled, and the petition was referred 

again in June.   

          And as this is an initiative of the City Council, 

before I go through a brief explanation of the zoning 

petition, which is largely based on the version of the 

petition that was presented a year ago -- I guess most of 

the main points of the petition are the same -- I wanted to 

recognize Councillor Mark McGovern, who's present at the 

meeting, and ask if he'd like to say a few things before I 

go through my part of the presentation.   

          MARK MCGOVERN:  Thank you Jeff.  So good evening,

Chair Preston-Connolly and esteemed member of the Planning 

Board.  As you know, my name is Mark McGovern, and I reside 

at 17 Pleasant Street in Cambridge, and I thank you for this 

opportunity. 

          I'm currently serving my eighth term of elected 

office for the City of Cambridge; four terms on the 

Cambridge School Committee, and four terms on the City 

Council; one of the terms serving as Mayor. 

          And in that time, you can likely count on less 

than one hand the number of times I have come to address 

this body.  My absence has not been from a lack of caring 

about the issues you discuss, but rather out of respect that 

your deliberations should be independent of Council 

influence.  You have your process, and I respect that. 

          So why am I here tonight?  I'm here as the lead 

petitioner on the refiled Affordable Housing Overlay.   

          I'm here because I truly believe in this 

ordinance's ability to help us reach our goal for the 

creation of more affordable housing, our goal of greater 

equity, and our goal of doing all we can to maintain the 

racial and economic diversity we all say we love about our 

city.

          Will the AHO solve all of our affordable housing 

problems?  Of course not.  But will it make building 

affordable housing more financially viable?  Will it help to 

create affordable housing in neighborhoods devoid of such 

housing opportunities today? 

          Will it be an important piece of the puzzle to 

address our affordable housing crisis?  Yes, yes and yes.  I 

want to thank you for the work you have done on this 

ordinance thus far.   

          In my 16 years of public service, I cannot recall 

an ordinance that has been so heavily debated, publicized or 

amended.  In total, there have been five Housing Committee 

meetings on the AHO with 170 speakers; three Planning Board 

meetings, not including tonight with 34 speakers; 15 

neighborhood meetings; seven Open Houses, and six Ordinance 

Committee meetings, including the most recent, that had 49 

public speakers -- 45 of which spoke in favor of passing the 

overlay as soon as possible. 

          In total, this ordinance has been discussed at 36 

public meetings with approximately 300 public comments.  

This of course does not include the numerous news articles, 

candidate forms, neighborhood list serves, advocacy group

fliers, e-mails, or the numerous other ways the AHO has been 

debated and publicized.   

          In addition, this ordinance saw the Council debate 

73 amendments, of which we adopted 47.  Of those 73 

amendments, 67 of them were filed by Councillors who ended 

up voting against the Overlay, despite having 45 of their 67 

amendments adopted. 

          My point is that the AHO has gone through a public 

and political process like no other ordinance in recent 

memory.  Not everyone, including myself, is pleased with 

every aspect of it.  But everyone has had a chance to help 

shape it, and it is time to be voted on without further 

delay. 

          We have tried to address many of the concerns 

raised by members of this body and members of the public.   

          Some were concerned that the original version left 

FAR open-ended.  The new version caps it at 2.0.   

          Some were concerned about Design Review.  We 

adopted a comprehensive, 40-page document to provide Design 

Guidance that covers everything, from responding to site 

design, building design, sustainability, open space, 

landscape design, circulation, parking, utilities, outdoor

lighting, building massing, faÃ§ades, architectural details, 

materials, even building color.    

          This ordinance has been cooked and it is ready. 

          Now, I was not planning on going into the 

Redlining Map tonight, but I just jotted this down when Iram 

included it in her presentation. And again, after seeing it, 

this is has moved me.   

          I think we can agree that redlining was a racist 

and classist decision that served to segregate 

neighborhoods.  When we look at where our affordable housing 

is located today, it is almost a perfect match to our 

Redlining Map.   

          This, of course, is not the fault of anyone here 

tonight and is not the fault of anyone who resides in those 

neighbors.  But we have a chance now to help rectify that 

injustice by making it easier to building affordable housing 

in areas where it currently doesn't exist. 

          I would like to end with a quite from a well-known 

Cambridge resident and progressive leader, "The rising cost 

of rent reflects a basic supply and demand problem.  There 

aren't enough places to rent that are affordable to lower-

income families.

          "That's because developers can usually turn bigger 

profits by building fancier, new units targeted at higher-

income families, rather than units targeted at lower-income 

families.  The result is a huge hole in the marketplace. 

          "There's another driver of expensive housing 

costs.  Some state and local zoning rules needlessly drive 

up the cost of construction.  These are rules like minimum 

lot sizes or mandatory parking requirements.  These kinds of 

rules raise the cost of building new housing, and keep 

families from moving into areas with better career and 

school choices." 

          That is a quote by a Cambridge resident and our 

Senator, Elizabeth Warren.  She was not talking about the 

AHO specifically, but she could have been.   

          "I again wish to thank you for your time and 

deliberation.  I wish to thank you for your positive vote 

previously, and I hope that you will pass this ordinance 

favorably again tonight, as the Council has the votes 

required to move this forward, and we simply cannot wait any 

longer to make the building 100 affordable housing in all 

neighborhoods in our city a reality.  Thank you."  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So Jeff, are you

ready to continue with the presentation at this time, then?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I am.  And I have so many windows 

open now that just finding the mute button was becoming a 

chore.   

          I apologize to the Chair and to the Board, but I'm 

going to very quickly now go through just an overview of 

this zoning petition, hitting the main points.  And as 

always, we're happy to answer more detailed questions. 

          So to start, the city is divided into zoning 

districts. The zoning ordinance sets rules for development 

in each of those districts.  In some districts, the rules 

make it very difficult to build affordable housing in a 

density that's financially feasible.  And in many cases, the 

zoning rules are even more restrictive than what exists 

today.   

          By state law, affordable housing developments 

currently have the option of seeking zoning relief through 

our comprehensive permit process.  But as discussed, that 

can be risky and can be cost prohibitive. 

          So the effect of an affordable housing overlay 

would be to provide an alternative to the process of seeking 

zoning relief by creating an alternative set of development 

29

standards that are specifically for affordable housing.   

          These standards are intended to enable greater 

density to make affordable housing development feasible, to 

provide a predictable, as-of-right permitting process, and 

to apply citywide, including in areas that currently have 

more restrictive zoning.   

          And I'll just quickly summarize some of the key 

sections of the Affordable Housing Overlay Petition in its 

current form.   

          To be eligible for the Affordable Housing Overlay 

standards all units in a development must have permanent, 

deed-restricted affordability requirements, including income 

eligibility limits, and limits on rent or sale price. 

          Generally, this could be up to 80 percent of 

areawide median income, but in some cases that could be up 

to the median income.  Lower-income eligibility thresholds 

would also be allowed. 

          Developments under this zoning could be single-

family, two-family, townhouse or multifamily housing in any 

zoning district, including districts that don't otherwise 

allow those types of housing. 

          Also, a project that qualifies under this zoning

could have ground floor, nonresidential uses that are 

otherwise allowed in the district. 

          The proposal creates a new set of relaxed 

development standards, including standards for height, 

setbacks and open space that would apply just to affordable 

housing developments. 

          Developments would be limited primarily in terms 

of their height and the number of stories above grade in the 

building, rather than by density limitations, although there 

are some density limits in this version of the proposal.  

The allowed height would vary based on what the underlying 

zoning district is. 

          In districts that generally allow three-story 

buildings, affordable housing developments could be up to 

four stories above grade.  And in these districts, there 

would also be a floor area ratio limit of 2.0. 

          In districts that generally allow four-story 

buildings, affordable housing developments could be up to 

six stories above grade.  And there would be a required 

stepdown to four stories, where the building abuts a lower 

height district, and we have an illustration of that coming 

up.

20

21

22

          In districts that generally allow more than four 

story buildings, affordable housing developments could be up 

to me stories above grade.  There would be a required 

stepdown to five stories where the building abuts a lower 

height district.   

          This slide shows a little about how the stepdown 

would work.  So in districts where as noted you might allow 

a six-story building under the affordable housing Overlay, 

and it abuts a district where it would only allow four-story 

buildings under the Overlay, there would be a required 

stepdownâ€¦  so that within 35 feet of the property line 

abutting a residential lot in the lower height district, the 

height of the building would have to go down from six to 

four stories.   

          This provision changed a little bit since last 

year's Affordable Housing Overlay Petition, and so, we 

updated the diagram. 

          The setback requirements would start with what 

existing in the underlying zoning district, except that in 

more restrictive zoning districts, which include the 

Residence A and B districts, setbacks could be reduced to 15 

feet in the front -- 7.5 feet on each side -- and 20 feet in

the rear.  In most other districts, the setbacks are already 

less restrictive than that. 

          Open space would work largely the same way, with 

the underlying zoning applying, except that it could be 

reduced to 30 percent in more restrictive districts or to 15 

percent to facilitate preservation of an existing historic 

building. 

          Some other more complicated dimensional standards 

that were required in open space are waived, so long as the 

total open space ratio is met.  But at least three-quarters 

of the required open space must be at grade, and all of the 

open space at grade must be permeable. 

          There would not be a minimum parking requirement, 

but parking would be allowed.  So parking for development 

under the Affordable Housing Overlay could be determined 

based on the needs of the project.   

          If a parking ratio of less than 0.4 space per unit 

is provided -- which was found to be about the average 

parking demand for current affordable housing -- a program 

of transportation demand management would be required.   

          There's also greater flexibility on where parking 

could be located, if it's off-site, and some flexibility in 

33

the layout requirements for spaces. 

          Bicycle parking would be required, but could be 

reduced in exchange for providing bicycle sharing stations 

and some standards could be waived, and if an existing 

building is being reused. 

          And speaking of reuse, many of the standards in 

the Affordable Housing Overlay are intended to make it 

easier for an existing building to be reused and converted 

to affordable housing for it to be preserved and expanded 

through an addition or an enlargement. 

          This is because under current zoning, adding 

housing units within a building can require zoning relief 

for density, parking, setbacks, open space or other 

standards.   

          Also, this petition only deals with zoning, and it 

should be noted that other historic ordinances will continue 

to apply, which includes the Demolition Delay Ordinance, 

Historic Districts, and Neighborhood Conservation Districts. 

          The proposed Affordable Housing Overlay contains 

many design-based standards.  Most of these are standards 

that already exist in the zoning ordinance, and are intended 

to promote development that's consistent with the city's

Urban design objectives, including pedestrian orientation of 

buildings, engaging positively with the public way, and 

screening functions such as parking, mechanical equipment 

and trash handling that can have negative impacts. 

          A note here, although it's not on the slide, that 

the city's green building requirements that were just 

updated last year would still be applicable to these 

developments.  Those green building requirements would not 

be relaxed for development under the Affordable Housing 

Overlay. 

faÃ§ades.   

          Some of the standards that are included -- 

particularly for the Affordable Housing Overlay, include the 

minimum requirements for breaks in the building faÃ§ades, and 

a minimum area of transparent windows along public-facing 

          All development under the proposed Affordable 

Housing Overlay, regardless of size and location, would be 

subject to an Advisory Design Review process conducted by 

the Planning Board.  It's similar to advisory review 

processes that are currently in place for larger development 

and specific districts. 

          This would include a neighborhood meeting,

followed by a minimum of two meetings with the Planning 

Board, the first of which is to make an additional 

presentation, and the second to present feedback that is 

incorporated from the first meeting.   

          The Board's final report would go to the 

developer, to staff, and to the Affordable Housing Trust.  

It's a nonbinding review, because -- as noted earlier -- 

this is intended to allow development to proceed as-of-

right, rather than through a permitting process that's 

subject to appeal and litigation. 

          When this proposal was discussed last year, CVV 

Urban Design staff and consultants developed a set of design 

guidelines that were intended to inform the design of 

buildings and the review process. The idea behind this was 

to create and share a vision for the qualities that were 

desired in new, affordable housing.   

          The Planning Board reviewed these guidelines and 

responded positively to them, which we appreciated.  And 

before this meeting, we sent an updated version, where some 

of the text and images have been improved, but substantively 

that remains the same as what you saw before, just a little 

better.

          The guidelines cover several different aspects of 

design, and help provide a framework for studying and 

evaluating development proposals as they come forward.  

          And Erik Thorkildsen, from the Urban Design team, 

who's been heading up this effort, is here at the meeting, 

and he can answer more questions as needed.                  

          So just as a quick reminder, the Planning Board 

spent some time on the Affordable Housing Overlay Petition 

last year; ultimately made a recommendation in favor of 

adoption, which we included in the Board's materials for 

reference. 

          We included the current version of the petition, 

which was submitted by the City Council in February of last 

-- I'm sorry, we reviewed the current version of the 

petition against the version that the Board last saw in 

September.   

          We found that the main elements of it remained 

largely the same as in the previous version, but some of the 

standards have been adjusted to provide some additional 

flexibility.  And we provided a chart that details all of 

those changes between the previous and the current petition, 

and we can discuss any of those in more detail as well.

          So this last piece on our slide is just a one-page 

summary of the key aspects of the Affordable Housing Overlay 

Zoning, and we're happy to go back to this if there's any 

more questions.   

          And just as a reminder, since I didn't get to do 

it at the beginning as a zoning petition, the action that 

the City Council would take would be to make a 

recommendation to the City Council.  Thank you, and I'll 

turn it back over to the Chair from here.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you, 

Jeff.  So Board members, we're going to try to do a couple 

of things differently here tonight in an effort to 

streamline our meeting, both because we're on Zoom, and 

frankly because we have had extensive discussion on this 

topic before. 

          So what we're going to do now to be more efficient 

with the hearing, we're going to go directly to public 

comment, and after that we'll have our Q&A from Board 

members to staff, and then move to deliberation.   

          So make note of your questions, and you'll have a 

chance to post them later, but we're trying to have less 

back and forth so that we can all spend fewer hours on our

computers these days. 

          So with that, we will go to public comment.  This 

is a public hearing.  Any members of the public who wish to 

speak should now click the button that says, "Raise hand."  

If you're calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by 

pressing *9. 

          And I'll just note that as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, 

the Board had received frequent communication from 11 

individuals and from the Cambridge Bike Committee.  

Additional written communication received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will also be entered into the record.   

          So yep, we've got a whole bunch of folks 

interested in speaking.  Great! So now I'll ask staff to 

unmute speakers one at a time.  You should begin by saying 

your name and address, and then staff will confirm that we 

can hear you.  And after that, you will have up to three 

minutes to speak before I ask you to wrap up. 

          Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  I'm going 

to just make sure that the timer is set.  I'll be reading 

off the names.  I'm going to -- just for the sake of 

expediency, what I'm going to do, I'm going to do two

things:  I'm going to read the next speaker, and then the 

following speaker, just so the next person knows that 

they're coming up.   

          And rather than have you wait for me to confirm we 

can hear you, I'll just let you proceed, and if a few 

seconds go by and we don't hear anyone, we'll note that 

we're not hearing you, so that you have a chance to start 

over again. 

          So the first speaker is Lee Farris, followed by 

David Sullivan.  Lee Farris, you can start.       

          LEE FARRIS:  Good evening. Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk 

Street.  I assume you can hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.       

          LEE FARRIS:  So I'm speaking tonight for the 

Cambridge Residence Alliance, and we generally support the 

idea of an Affordable Housing Overlay.  We appreciate that 

some of the changes that we requested were made. 

          And we would still like to see some additional 

changes.  And I want to draw your attention to the June 21, 

2019 CDD response to the City Council pages 3 through 8, 

which said that the Assessor's Office found that in 2018 

there would have been 45 parcels sold that could have been

developed under the Affordable Housing Overlay.  So we 

believe that if our proposed changes were included, that 

number would be slightly reduced.   

          And since the CDD memo said that if the Overlay 

were passed, funding would likely only allow for one to two 

projects per year, we feel a small reduction in the number 

of parcels would still leave many other developable parcels.  

          For example, if there were a parcel with three 

healthy larger trees over eight inches in diameter in the 

middle of the parcel, it would suggest that it would be 

better to develop a different parcel. 

          We believe that the affordable housing developers 

would still have substantial flexibility if these changes 

were enacted. 

          So some of the changes that we would like to see 

is a requirement that at least 20 percent of the units 

completed overall using the Affordable Housing Overlay be 

homeownership units, which would help reduce racial 

inequities in the homeownership of housing in Cambridge.   

          We would also like to see a requirement added for 

larger family-sized units, and we would like the affordable 

housing that is built using the Overlay to follow the Tree

Protection Ordinance, which prevents removal of larger 

trees, until such time as that Tree Protection Ordinance may 

be revised.  We would like new buildings to fit into their 

context.   

          So in addition to the required 7.5 foot side 

setback from the lot line, we feel there should be a minimum 

of a total of 15 feet between any new building and any 

existing adjacent residential buildings.  We would also like 

the top floor of the building to step back five feet from 

adjacent buildings on the sides. 

          I think, importantly, we'd like to see a guiding 

document established with goals on a number of things like 

income levels, types of sites, open space, transit, et 

cetera. 

          And that guiding document could be the basis for 

review over every five years. 

          Lastly, we opposed three changes that were made 

since the 2019 Council votes, and I refer you to my letter 

for those changes since I'm out of time.  Thank you very 

much for your consideration.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is David Sullivan, 

followed by Ruthan Rudel. David Sullivan, you can start.

     DAVID SULLIVAN:  Thank you.  Madam Chair, members of 

the Board.  My name is David Sullivan.  I reside at 16 Notre 

Dame Avenue in North Cambridge, and I am a former member of 

the City Council.   

          I want to be recorded in wholehearted support of 

the Affordable Housing Overlay, as it has been refiled by 

the City Council.  I want to thank this Board for its very 

helpful recommendations last year in support of the Overlay.  

I want to call your attention to two of the key 

recommendations you made last year, and hope that you will 

repeat them this year.   

          One is that the decisions about what to allow need 

to be as-of-right.  There should not be discretionary 

decisions because -- as the CDD has pointed out, and as the 

Planning Board pointed out in its report last year, the 

effect of any discretion will be to encourage litigation and 

delay, which will have the effect of killing these projects.  

That is an essential part of this proposal. 

          Secondly, also as the Board recommended last year, 

it is very important for this to be citywide in scope.  And 

I want to again call attention to the great maps that the 

Department presented, which show the need for affordable

housing in every neighborhood of our city, not just a few 

neighborhoods.   

          That is one of the main purposes of this proposal, 

and I hope that the Board, as it did last year, will support 

that purpose and emphasize the need for citywide coverage. 

          So again, thank you very much for your careful 

consideration of this, for your report last year, and I want 

to encourage you to come back with a similar report this 

year.   

          Very briefly, I also want to say that since I 

can't stick around for the second hearing, I want to be 

recorded in support of the Rindge Commons proposal, which is 

your second hearing today.   

          I will send you a written confirmation of that.  

But as a neighbor in North Cambridge and for many of the 

same reasons, I want to see that proposal go forward as 

well.  Thank you very much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Ruthan Rudel, 

followed by George Metzger.  I apologize if I'm getting 

anyone's name wrong.   

          [Pause]  

          RUTHAN RUDEL:  Hi, this is Ruthan Rudel.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I apologize.  I think you may have 

been accidentally muted.  You can unmute yourself and try 

again.   

          RUTHEAD AND NECK RUDEL:  Can you hear me?    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes. 

          RUTHAN RUDEL:  This is Ruthan Rudel.  I'm speaking 

on behalf of the Cambridge Bicycle Committee, and I'm 

writing to -- and we submitted written comments that sort of 

provide this information.   

          But our specific comments are a request that the 

ordinance be modified to require equivalent bicycle parking 

facilities, as would be required for any other private, 

residential development in Cambridge. 

          The current proposed ordinance has substantially 

reduced requirements for both secure and short-term bicycle 

parking, compared to what's typically required of private 

developments.  And this disparity is inconsistent with 

Cambridge's goal of fostering equity.   

          The reduced bicycle parking requirements for 

affordable housing is also inconsistent with a well-

documented need for more, not less, secure bike parking 

facilities and economically disadvantaged communities.

          And it creates barriers for future residents, who 

wish to take advantage of bicycling as an affordable and 

sustainable transportation option in Cambridge. 

          Lack of access to secure bicycle parking in 

economically disadvantaged communities was identified as a 

barrier to using bicycles for transportation or recreation 

in two recent reports or studies, both of which I provide 

links and sites in the letter. 

          The students -- one of them was a Tufts UEP 

student who interviewed residents of Roxbury and concluded 

that the lack of secure bike storage and parking is a major 

concern for local bikers, and noted that the disparity in 

bike storage and parking is one example of a difference in 

bike infrastructure between wealthier and low-income 

neighbors. 

          Another study in Boston concluded that bike 

storage is a major barrier for low-income cyclists, as they 

do not have enough room to store bikes in their apartments.   

          Cycling is an affordable, fun, healthy and 

efficient method to get around Cambridge, which is compact 

and flat.  It's important the AHO contributes to creating 

transportation equity by making cycling a safe option for

everyone and reducing known barriers.   

          It's difficult to understand the rationale for an 

ordinance that provides lower quality bike storage 

facilities and affordable housing in Cambridge.  If 

anything, affordable residential developments in Cambridge 

need more, not less, bike parking. 

          So thatâ€™s the letter, and again, you can find the 

references for those studies in my written submission.  And 

I thank you for the time you're taking to consider this 

important ordinance. 

          And then speaking just as a personal -- as a 

Cambridge resident, and not as a member of the bike 

committee, I support the AHO, and I also want to speak in 

support of the Rindge Ave Development.   

          But I need to point out or add something really 

important to consider, which is to add a tunnel, or a 

footbridge -- a way for people who are living on the Rindge 

Ave side of the train tracks to get over to the Fresh Pond 

Shopping Center, and where the CVS and the Trader Joe's and 

the Whole Foods and all of those stores are. 

          If anyone has ever had to walk up over that train 

track bridge right alongside Alewife Brook Parkway, it's 

47

extremely unpleasant, and I consider that an equity issue -- 

an important quality of life issue that disproportionally 

affects people who are living in the housing and will affect 

people living in the new housing to be built. 

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is George Metzger, 

followed by Peter Daly.

          [Pause]  

          George, you can unmute yourself and begin 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We can't year you.     

          GEORGE METZGER:  Can you hear me now?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.     

          GEORGE METZGER:  Thank you.  This is George 

Metzger.  I reside at 90 Antrim Street.  I have been the 

architect of a number of affordable housing developments 

over the years for seniors, for families, for people in 

housing transition and insecurity.  And Cambridge has done a 

great job of building affordable housing for those in need. 

          I spoke a year ago in support of this project.  At 

that time, the Planning Board, as David Sullivan noted,

supported the ordinance and offered very thoughtful 

recommendations for the committee.   

          But a lot has changed in the last 12 months.  We 

do have a new Council.  We're here remotely because of the 

pandemic that has shown all too vividly that there are 

inequities in our community that needed to be addressed -- 

equities of resources, economic opportunity, racial equity.  

          And these are some of the issues that this 

ordinance does address. 

          The need for affordable housing hasn't changed at 

all.  It is greater than ever, as unemployment, housing 

instability, business vultures are rolling through our 

community in ways that we couldn't have imagined when we 

last met last year. 

          The Affordable Housing Overlay Petition corrects 

patters of development that have denied the ability to 

develop multifamily housing and give people equal housing 

opportunity throughout the city of Cambridge. 

          Everyone should have a choice on where they are 

allowed to live in Cambridge, and do so with dignity.  The 

pattern of racial and economic alignment has denied black 

and brown people equal opportunity to live anywhere in the

city of their choice.   

          We can't explain any longer these systematic 

patterns in our community.  We can no simply say, "I'm in 

favor of affordable housing, but --."  We need the Planning 

Board to support equity and opportunity and inclusiveness in 

our planning policy, and we ask -- I ask you to support the 

Overlay Housing ordinance as it has been presented to you, 

and please do so quickly. 

          I would also like to speak, as others have, or 

just comment in that I am in favor of the Rindge Common 

proposal because it does achieve many of the same things of 

this housing opportunity goal.  Thank you very much.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Peter Daly, 

followed by Kathleen Higgins.  Peter, you can start.  You'll 

need to unmute yourself.     

          [Pause] I think you're still on mute, if you've

          PETER DALY:  Oh, great.  My name is Peter Daly.  

I'm the Executive Director of Homeowner's Rehab in Central

to ask you to pass the Overlay as presented.  Just want to 

talk a little bit about why this is so important, and also, 

a little bit about need.  It wasn't that long ago that we 

were before you with our Concord Highlands project.   

          For those of you who have been by there, it came 

out great.  We had planned on having a big celebration, but 

the pandemic got in the way.  We hope to do something in the 

future. 

there.   

          But, as I said, there are 98 apartments, and with 

a relatively short application period, we ended up with 2500 

applications -- just overwhelming, and just a real clear 

indication of the need for affordable housing that's out 

          And even then, people come in, still come in and 

we tell them that you have very little likelihood, but they 

want to get on the wait list because they are that desperate 

for need.   

need sites.   

          Going forward, this is a big week for affordable 

housing.  You have people ask us why we aren't doing more, 

and there's really two big reasons:  We need funds, and we 

          The funding, we are looking to the CPA Committee.

This week they will be meeting.  We will be asking them 

again to provide 80 percent of CPA funding for affordable 

housing.  And that will be a huge benefit to helping us 

developing more housing.   

          But we still need the sites.  As has been 

mentioned, we continue to get outbid.  We need to get some 

way to level the playing field.   

          And the affordable housing Overlay will in fact 

level that playing field off.   It'll give us the 

opportunity to acquire sites where the door is shut on us 

right now, and I do really hope that we can get this thing 

passed now.  Because every day that goes by, we're losing 

more opportunities.  And again, the need is so desperate out 

there. 

          And lastly, I do also support the Rindge Project.  

I think that's a great project, a great location, and I hope 

we can get that done as well.  Thank you so much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Cathleen Higgins, followed by Susan Blier.  Cathleen?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Please give your name and address, 

thank you.   

          CATHLEEN HIGGINS:  Thank you.  My name is Cathy 

Higgins.  I live at 345 Norfolk Street.  I very strongly 

support the Affordable Housing Overlay, and I urge the 

members of the Planning Board to pass it as soon as 

possible, with no additional amendments.   

          Since this body voted favorably for the AHO last 

September in a 6:3 vote, there should be no need to revisit 

the various arguments in this vital, much needed zoning 

change. 

          Some will say that because the world has changed 

since then -- and indeed it has -- more discussion is 

needed.  But if anything, the events of 2020 from the 

pandemic calls for action to address systemic racism only 

make passage of the AHO more urgent.  The AHO is about 

writing the wrongs of zoning policies that have resulted in 

racially and economically segregated neighborhoods in 

Cambridge. 

          Some those opposed to the AHO and other affordable 

housing initiatives have unfortunately chosen to advance a 

faulty premise in their arguments -- that is that density,

or increased density, leads to more COVID infections.   

          In fact, density is not the problem.  Overcrowding 

is actually the issue, and is a symptom of our affordable 

housing crisis.  The solution:  More homes, and more 

density. 

          The New York Times article from August 2 entitled, 

"12 people in a three-bedroom house" points out that a 

number of studies have concluded that for virus spread, 

"density is less important than crowding" and describes the 

experience of one family's housing crisis and overcrowded 

housing made worse by the pandemic. 

          The article also presents data from Chelsea, Mass.  

There, 375-unit subsidized apartment building owned by the 

non-profit neighborhood developers with a total of 968 

tenants only had eight COVID cases, which calculates to 

about one-tenth the rate of the demographically and 

economically similar surrounding Chelsea neighborhood. 

          These subsidized apartments are less crowded and, 

"so far, healthier." 

          The slightly increased density and heights allowed 

by Cambridge's AHO for buildings created by our non-profit 

developers will likewise lead to the creation of secure,

safe homes and communities.   

          This example also highlights why the Rindge 

Commons mixed-use project deserves a swift approval also.  

The addition of 101 permanently affordable subsidized homes 

outlined are another step toward meeting the unmet demand 

for low income housing, that included a training center 

fulfill major city goals. 

          The fact that 20 percent of the units will be 

three bedrooms also speaks to a city goal.  Thank you for 

considering my comments.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Suzanne Blier, followed by Esther Hanig.   

          SUZANNE BLIER:  Hi.  Can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

          SUZANNE BLIER:  Thank you.  This is Suzanne Blier, 

5 Fuller Place.  And one thing that we know about affordable 

housing from the Furman Center for Housing Policy at NYU is 

that research shows that the care taken by developers to 

develop designs that are suitable in scale and design to the 

surrounding neighborhood is critical to the success of these 

projects. 

          Unfortunately, CDD did no models of affordable

housing projects development in Res A or Res B -- Res A-1 or 

A-2, which are very different settings.  The current CDD 

designs are along main corridors, or places where adjacent 

three-story or even two-story structures don't setback so 

out of scale with the proposed four-story, much larger 

models. 

          On the redlining, I just would point out that many 

of the blue areas are institutions -- Harvard, in particular 

-- or historically preserved and many of the white areas, 

again, are university property, parks, cemeteries. 

          And what one sees here in Cambridge, like many 

places, is a history of factories -- factory development -- 

putting affordable housing in those areas funded by the 

federal government, and then the legacy of farms or selling 

off properties. 

          The key issue -- and there are a number of them, 

and I was one of the signers of an affordable housing zoning 

Petition -- the Donovan petition that you'll be seeing 

shortly -- but it has it's really important to limit the FAR 

to something that is reasonable for the communities in which 

these will be built, doubling the current district 

requirement for let's say a maximum of 1.5.

          Right now it is five to seven times the density of 

these areas in a place like Blanchard Road, with largely one 

story or 1.5 story homes will be really greatly impacted. 

          We did an analysis of some 1200 properties in the 

city that will be targeted for this once it passes, over 200 

or 10,000 square feet or more, which would allow for a 40-

unit structure.  So there are plenty of properties. And even 

now, right now available there are eight of them. 

          And if the city is looking for the most 

reasonable, these again are going to target areas largely 

outside of West Cambridge, where these properties are least 

expensive. 

          We are hoping that you will agree to a design 

Review Board, because right now it's not so much an issue of 

suit, because as-of-right in fact doesn't exist, because 

when the permit is pulled, one could respond at that point.  

          But we have no real design review with oversight, 

because it's largely the developers themselves who sit on 

this Board who are reviewing and approving their own design. 

          So there's a seeming conflict of interest and a 

real need to get this right through independent oversight.  

Let's keep the denser structures on the corridors, as is

done in the best urban planning context, follow current tree 

protections, open space, and provide a means so that 

neighbors and others can review the affordable housing 

developers and developments, and give a sense of how well 

they're actually doing. 

          On the issue of race, there are many ways that we 

can address it.  I've dedicated my whole career -- I'm the 

Department of African and African-American studies at 

Harvard -- to this issue.   

          But if we wanted to do this, we could easily do a 

three-year moratorium on condo conversions or provide funds 

for minority homeownership, funds for creation of more ADUs, 

require hiring of African-Americans and others by the city, 

or get MIT to build its housing requirements to 3.0 FAR. 

          Or even if it is a factor of cost, require 

factory-made affordable housing developments like many other 

cities do.   

          But I don't think that this is the key issue.  And 

again, I hope that you will support amendments along the 

lines that we are suggesting that will make this better, 

more viable for the various neighborhoods in which these 

will go.

          And when the Donovan zoning petition comes before 

you for enhanced affordable housing for the very first time 

to end zoning for exclusively single-family housing in the 

city, to decrease the amount of open space required in Res A 

and A-1 and A-2, and to increase moderately size, we hope 

you would support this as well.   

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Ester Hanig, 

followed by Elizabeth Gombosi (phonetic). 

          ESTHER HANIG:  Hi.  My name is Esther Hanig, and I 

live at 136 Pine Street.  I want to express my strongest 

support for the Affordable Housing Overlay, and urge you to 

recommend its swift passage.   

          As mentioned earlier, while the Overlay was 

initially introduced to respond to an overwhelming need for 

affordable housing, unfortunately the need continues to 

increase exponentially. 

          According to the 2017 Cambridge Community Needs 

Assessment, housing affordability is the most pressing issue 

that Cambridge currently faces, and while housing affordable 

is a challenge for many, there are vulnerable subpopulations 

that face particular challenges with this issue, including

black or African-Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, seniors 

and the homeless. 

          We have become painfully aware that the economic 

disaster caused by the pandemic has only increased this 

already huge need, and is experienced disproportionately by 

black and Latino populations.  So this is why this addition 

is so important. 

          And as this need is so great, I would also like to 

express my support for Just-A-Start, the Rindge Commons, as 

that would be another really wonderful addition. 

          I supported the Overlay as a longtime advocate for 

affordable housing, but I have also been a strong supporter 

of the initiative because of the impact it would have on 

expanding diversity in all the neighborhoods in our city. 

          We have recently seen a long overdue spotlight on 

racial inequity and the results of white supremacy.  This 

inequity can be found in Cambridge's own neighborhoods.   

          I am a proud resident of the Port.  The percentage 

of affordable housing in my wonderful neighborhood, which 

retains some diversity, is 34.5 percent and 20.5 percent of 

our population is black. 

          By comparison, in the neighborhood with the lowest

grade of affordable housing, West Cambridge, the percentage 

of affordable housing is only 1.3 percent, and only 2.2 

percent of their population is black. 

          This Overlay proposal is an important tool in 

providing a route to find new, financially feasible 

opportunities for additional affordable housing that has 

never been more correctly. 

          Our economic, racial and social equity crisis 

demands that there be no more delay in making this 

invaluable tool available for our affordable housing 

developers.  I urge you as you did previously, to recommend 

its swift passage, and thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Elizabeth 

Gombosi, followed by Christopher Schmidt.   

          ELIZABETH GOMBOSI:  Elizabeth Gombosi, 42 Irving 

Street.  Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.  I 

very much support affordable housing, but I do feel this 

proposal could be easily improved.   

          I strongly support continuing current oversight of 

planning by the Planning Board of all projects, including 

100 percent affordable projects. 

          I feel there must be some process for appeal by 

61

residents of environmental impacts and design issues, which 

affect existing architecture in their neighborhood. It is 

critical, especially at this time, that the Tree Protection 

Ordinance apply to 100 percent affordable housing projects.  

We cannot allow the continued loss of our tree canopy. 

          If we are to provide a healthy -- and I mean 

physical and mental -- environment for residents of this 

housing, we must provide ample, open green space and light.  

That means we cannot cram excessive density into every 

available building lot.  An FAR of 1.5 should be the highest 

density allowed, not only on main corridors near public 

transportation. 

          Thank you. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Christopher 

Schmidt, followed by Lauren Curry.   

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  My name is Christopher 

Schmidt of 17 Laurel Street in Cambridge.  Thank you, 

members of the Planning Board, for once again considering 

this petition, which you have considered so much up to this 

point.   

          I know that you've heard me before, and you've 

heard so many of us before saying how important this is.

          I do know that one thing has changed -- one thing 

that has changed is the world that we live in and the 

politics in the world that we look around us in have 

changed.   

          We have seen in many cities across the country a 

movement towards rectifying the wrongs that we have carried 

forward from the past and continue to carry forward to this 

day, in keeping people locked out of our neighbors with 

signs that are as good as saying, "You are not welcome 

here." 

          I believe that the Affordable Housing Overlay, by 

changing to allow the creation of more dense housing in 

every neighborhood in the city doesn't just say, "You are 

not welcome here," but in fact opens the door to the 

residents of Cambridge who we have historically not valued. 

          I don't want to speak for anyone else, I only want 

to speak for myself.  For myself, I can speak to the 

community that I have lived in for 15 years in 

Cambridgeport.  I can speak to the community of people that 

I have seen again and again and again, and I can speak to 

the loss of my friends, of people in the community and of 

community members, as they have been priced out of a

Cambridge that is ever increasing in price.   

          I have seen the waitlist of tens of thousands of 

names, as we look at the Cambridge Housing Authority list 

and other affordable housing lists, and I know that this 

need is urgent.   

          I also know that there are many who will say -- 

you know, we value trees more than houses.  We believe it's 

okay to accept that we simply have less affordable housing.  

And that's just not something that I personally can agree 

with.   

homes. 

          I think that we should be seeking to maximize our 

ability to solve for the needs of our Cambridge residents, 

and until we have created a home for every person who wants 

to live here, I think that we should keep creating more 

          I know that it is important to all of us to create 

a city that is welcoming to all.  And I think that it is 

important to do that by -- as has been pointed out -- 

creating an opportunity for housing to be created in every 

neighborhood, by creating housing that is affordable to 

lower-income residents who had been priced out, by creating 

opportunities for these things throughout our communities

across the city. 

          I hope that you will move forward with this 

tonight.  I think this discussion has been happening for 

quite a while, and I look forward to the quick passage, so 

we can move onto the next things -- you know, such as the 

Just-A-Start buildings, and all of the other things that we 

have coming down the pike to meaningfully improve and create 

more access to affordable housing throughout the city. 

          Thank you for your time and have a great day.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Lauren Curry, 

followed by Tina Alu.    

          LAUREN CURRY:  Good evening, Madam Chair and 

members of the Planning Board.  I would just very briefly   

like to request that the Board follow its decision of last 

year and send its recommendation to the Council for the 

adoption of the citywide Affordable Housing Overlay. 

          This proposal for zoning that allows affordable 

housing in larger, sometimes denser developments and in more 

parts of the city is really the only way that the need for 

anywhere near the amount of new housing that we need to meet 

the needs of Cambridge residents is going to be met. 

          I really don't have much to say that people

haven't said before, but as a person who has been -- I don't 

think I gave my address; 3 Concord Ave -- as somebody who 

has been in support of affordable housing in Cambridge in 

many guises over the years, and who was part of the housing 

portion of the Envision Cambridge, I really look forward to 

this becoming a reality for us.   

          And I think that we have to understand that some 

of the history of exclusion that has happened has created 

patterns that it may not be entirely comfortable for people 

to see change.   

          Change is hard for some people, but sometimes the 

plea to have everything be in context or fit into what's 

already there is a plea for certain kinds of exclusion to 

continue to occur. 

          And I would hate that to be an obstacle to your 

recommending that this ordinance in its present form go 

forward, be enacted by the Council, and begin to allow the 

creation of larger numbers of affordable housing and in 

places where it hasn't previously been available.  And I 

thank you for your time.

          TINA ALU:  Hello.  My name is Tina Alu, and I live 

at 113.5 Pleasant Street.  I'm speaking as a Cambridge 

resident, but mostly as the Executive Director of the 

Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee -- CEOC -- 

Cambridge's designated anti-poverty agency. 

          I want to speak tonight on behalf of CEOC's 

participants and low-income residents citywide.  I've spoken 

many times in support of the passage of the Affordable 

Housing Overlay in order to share the dire situation that 

CEOC participants are struggling with financially in order 

to pay their rent, afford their medical prescriptions, and 

perhaps have a little money left over to buy food for their 

family. 

          And this was all before pandemic hit. 

          During the past five months, CEOC staff have 

talked with hundreds of low-income individuals and families 

who asked over and over again what will happen to them now 

that the pandemic unemployment benefits are ending, and even 

more when the eviction moratorium ends? 

          They don't anticipate any increased income or 

benefits to sustain themselves and their families.  They are 

terrified that they will lose their homes. And we all know

that if someone loses their home, they will be displaced and 

lose everything. 

          We have lost precious time in delaying the passage 

of the overlay, which if implemented last year could have 

already been providing affordable housing to those at 

greatest need.   

          The Boston Globe reported recently that minorities 

are regularly discriminated against in seeking housing in 

the greater metropolitan area.  Of course, no one could have 

foreseen the pandemic coming that would further impact 

racial minorities more than others.   

          But in Cambridge, we have known right along that 

Cambridge's zoning has created and maintained a segregated 

city that negatively impacts Cambridge's black and brown 

families. 

          Currently, Cambridge zoning predetermines who gets 

to live in which areas of the city.  It's time to change 

that fact.  I urge you to once again favorably recommend the 

Affordable Housing Overlay.   

          I also want to speak in support of the Rindge 

Commons project.  Thank you for your time.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Next speaker is Carl Nagy Koechlin,

followed by Aron Homer.  I apologize for the pronunciation.   

          CARL NAGY-KOECHLIN:  No, that's okay.  This is 

Carl Nagy-Koechlin, that was close enough.  I'm the 

Executive Director at Just-A-Start, and thanks for the 

opportunity to testify.   

          I work at 1035 Cambridge Street, and I live at 52 

Carruth Street in Dorchester.  And I'm not going to go over 

territory that other people covered, but I do want to say 

that I'm strongly in favor of the Affordable Housing 

Overlay.   

          I guess it goes without saying that I'm also in 

favor of the Rindge Commons Project that's before you later 

(sic), which is, of course, a Just-A-Start project, so I 

appreciate people's support for that.   

          We and other affordable housing developers have 

worked very closely with the City of Cambridge over the 

years to develop quality affordable housing that's enabled 

thousands of low and moderate-income individuals and 

families to remain in Cambridge, where they have access to 

all of the tremendous things that Cambridge has to offer, 

including its abundant economic opportunities. 

          These developments have also enhanced Cambridge's

diversity and vitality.  We and other developers have been 

resourceful in recent years at identifying opportunities to 

develop affordable housing in the city, despite the very 

expensive and competitive real estate market.   

          The project you'll hear about this evening is one 

such case of Just-A-Start sort of picking some of the last 

bits of low-hanging fruit, namely the parking lot around a 

Rindge Tower project to develop affordable housing. 

          But these opportunities are fewer and further 

between, and we now are at a point where we need to compete 

on the private market for sites, if we're going to develop 

affordable housing.   

          And to do so, we need density bonuses that will 

allow for the spread of acquisition costs across more 

apartments.  And we also need the certainty that goes along 

with the as-right provisions of the Affordable Housing 

Overlay.   

          Last year during similar proceedings, my 

predecessor at Just-A-Start provided some information on a 

couple of sites that Just-A-Start pursued, but were unable 

to secure, because we could not compete on the private 

market.  We would have been viable competitors under the 

70

Affordable Housing Overlay, for all the reasons I mentioned 

          I want to also assure the Planning Board and 

others that Just-A-Start is committed to maintaining our 50-

year track record of developing high-quality, affordable 

housing that enhances the neighborhoods in which they're 

built. 

          And I know our partners at the Community 

Development Department and the Housing Trust on whose funds 

our projects depend, will hold us to those same high 

standards under this new Affordable Housing Overlay 

environment. 

          So thank you for this opportunity.

Grosio (phonetic) Road.  I don't have as informed and 

detailed thought as many of the other people who have

both the Affordable Housing Overlay as it is currently 

stated, as well as the Rindge project.  Thank you very much.

Camacho.  I live on Corporal Burns Road in Cambridge.  I'm 

expressing my concern that the Planning Board is considering 

a version of the Affordable Housing Overlay that as far as I 

know does not reflect the latest thinking on the matter -- 

specifically, the Donovan petition, but it also does not 

contain some of the important items already approved by last 

year's Council. 

          I believe it is crucial that Planning Board design 

overview not be removed from this bill.  To give all 

oversight for Cambridge affordable housing to developers and 

none to current Cambridge residents as provided by the

Planning Board -- I feel that that is a travesty.   

          Let's not forget that when the Affordable Housing 

Overlay was initially proposed, Cambridge citizens were 

given only one alternative to consider, and no choice.  I 

believe we were given no choice because those writing the 

proposal did not want there to be any option. 

          To my knowledge, there is still no request from 

Cambridge Council members or the city manager's office to 

Governor Baker to make sure that surrounding cities live up 

to his desire for more affordable housing development 

between the state and all the cities and towns in the Boston 

area. 

          As far as I know, neither the City Manager nor 

anyone on the Cambridge City Council has appealed to anyone 

in the surrounding town to try and find out why no more 

affordable housing is going up in other areas. 

          As considered so far, the backers of the AHO on 

the Council are proposing a complete abdication of their 

responsibility for affordable housing in Cambridge. 

          While pretending to be progressives in favor of 

affordable housing for current Cambridge citizens, they are 

adhering to the corporate point of view of housing

developers.   

          Witness the housing choices amendment ploy just 

passed in the State House.  The loss of a two-thirds voting 

requirement promoted by developers and Governor Baker is an 

attack on the responsibility and powers of all towns and 

small cities of the Commonwealth by lobbyists for real 

estate developers, for whom too much is never enough. 

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is James Zall, 

followed by Susan Schlesinger.   

          JAMES ZALL:  This is James Zall at 203 Pemberton 

Street in North Cambridge.  I'm speak to tonight in favor of 

the Affordable Housing Overlay. 

          In the years since the Planning Board voted 6:3 to 

support the Overlay and its as-of-right approval process and 

7:2 in favor an equitable, citywide application of 

affordable housing incentives, a housing shortage has only 

become worse. 

          Many Cambridge residents are now in need of 

support from a safety net which, with respect to housing at 

least, is far too small to accommodate the need. 

          The Overlay has been extensively vetted by the

Housing Committee, thoroughly debated by the public, and 

heavily amended by the Ordinance Committee.   

          The Overlay has perhaps been improved since last 

year's Planning Board review, but the housing situation has 

only become worse.  It's time for the City of Cambridge to 

move forward on its goals for more affordable and equitable 

housing.  Another strong, favorable recommendation from the 

Planning Board will help move us forward in that direction. 

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And the next speaker and the last 

speaker with a hand raised is Susan Schlesinger.   

          Before I turn it over, I'll just remind everyone 

listening if you're an attendee and would like to speak on 

this matter, please be sure to push the "Raise hand" button.  

If you're participating by telephone, you can push *9 on 

your phone, and that will raise your hand, so that we know 

that you can speak.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  At this time, I'll move to Marilee 

Meyer, who's the next speaker on the list.  You can unmute 

yourself and begin.     

          MARILEE MEYER:  Good evening.  There's a couple of 

key issues that are worth reiterating.  We heard at the 

beginning of the meeting all the statistics about the 

meetings and Envision and how many Ordinance meetings, et 

cetera, et cetera. 

          But at the Envision meetings, not one straw poll 

supported the AHO.  To this day, many laymen don't even 

understand what's in it, except for a certain persuasive 

faction.

          And the Planning Board is reduced to an advisory 

role with developers being members of that advisory role.  

And with as-of-right, which doesn't have teeth. 

          Standardizing eighteenth-century cow paths is 

really absurd.  There are 13 districts that are being 

reduced to one blanket, and it's not a one-size fits all.  

And how many public meetings will there be at these advisory 

role meetings with the public?   

          But the big thing I have -- issue I have -- is 

generational housing, how is that identified?  That can be 

identified as affordable.   

          People who have been staying in their houses and 

renting to family members for decades -- that can be 

considered affordable housing.  And mid Cambridge has many 

multiple -- long-term family housing.  So to have a blank 

space in mid Cambridge is, I think, disingenuous. 

          The FAR drawings are still misleading.  I would 

welcome a building using traditional proportion, scale and 

architectural vocabulary, but developers aren't obligated to 

take advice.  And going from 40 feet in height to 70 feet 

height is not incremental for a mere 10 units a year. 

          And also, the AMI of 60,000 to 80,000 per person

is not affordable.  What about the rest of -- a lot of the 

public would not qualify for a lot of this housing?  And I 

do agree with the multifamily units over single housing, and 

also, to promote ownership.  But with the virus, it is 

cheaper and safer to keep people in place than financing new 

units. 

          The city has lost creative opportunities to 

subsidize potential purchases.  I think the Manager has been 

too conservative in those particular cases.  People are 

working from home, businesses are being reshaped, schools 

are being restructured, and I do not think that density is 

our friend. 

          We have the time to ask responsible questions, 

rather than business as usual.  We can't legislate emotion, 

and detail matter.  We can tweak this so we have a better 

outcome.  We obviously need affordable housing, but this all 

or nothing just doesn't -- I don't find that equitable 

either.  So thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Francis 

Donovan, followed by Steve Revilak. 

          FRANCIS DONOVAN:  Hey, I can unmute.  I'm speaking 

tonight about the 100 percent Affordable Housing Overlay

which failed to past last year, and is back before you again 

tonight.   

          The primary reason for its failure was lack of 

balance between the critical need we all recognize to 

increase the supply of affordable housing for low-income 

individuals in Cambridge, and the need to protect our 

environment and quality of life for all occupants of our 

city and the planet. 

          Preservation of open space, protection of our 

threatened tree canopy, provisions for non-polluting energy, 

promotion of livable density, access to daily accommodations 

and general quality of life were all long-debated amendments 

proposed to last year's AHO.   

          Unfortunately, several important amendments agreed 

to last year are missing from the document submitted for 

your consideration tonight.  They made a lot of sense last 

year, and they make a lot of sense this year.  So we all 

have some work to do. 

          But this is a democratic process, and what why the 

Planning Board and Ordinance Committee exist.  Several 

exciting new ideas have been proposed since last year's 

version lapsed, that will significantly broaden the scope 

79

and impact of the 100 percent Affordable Housing Overlay.   

          I particularly draw your attention to those ideas 

presented in the detailed letter submitted by Professor 

Suzanne Blier, who spent long hours last year and this 

working with a wide range of Cambridge residents to advance 

the 100 percent Affordable Housing Overlay in Cambridge in a 

sustainable, balanced and commonsense manner.   

          We have much negotiation ahead to get this 

proposed ordinance into workable form. 

          But the fundamental issue tonight is whether the 

Planning Board will continue to serve its charter to oversee 

and guide the planning of our wonderful city.   

          To retreat into a merely exclusively advisory 

role, which builders of the proposed 100 percent affordable 

housing structures are free to ignore would violate the very 

purpose for which this Board was created, and would deprive 

this city's residents at all income levels of one of their 

most vital protections.   

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker, and the last 

speaker with hand raised, is Steve Revilak.  And I'll remind 

everyone again before we start, if you havenâ€™t spoken yet

          STEVEN REVILAK:  Hello, greetings to the -- my 

name is Steven Revilak.  I live at 111 Sunnyside Avenue in 

Arlington, Massachusetts.  Yes, I'm from your neighbor to 

the west.   

          I'd like to first say that I've been following the 

progress of this ordinance proposal for some time.  I really 

want to commend the job that the Community Development 

Department has done in putting it together.  I think it is a 

wonderful proposal.   

          I also think it -- you know, you've put emphasis 

in the right places, particularly in removing the -- 

attempting to remove the threat of litigation as a way to 

prevent affordable housing projects from being built.   

          Now I'm -- to be honest, I'm -- although I'm not 

from Cambridge, I would hope that I could get some folks in 

my town of Arlington on board with a similar idea, because 

to be perfectly honest, we have a real need for affordable 

housing ourselves.

Williamson, followed by a phone participant -- last digits

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  I'm seeing the clocks saying 

1:55, okay thank you.  James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place 

in what people call, "Affordable housing." Maybe I'm one of 

the few speakers tonight who actually lives in the house and 

that everybody's extolling the virtues of. 

          I've had tremendous trouble participating.  I 

think it's shocking the hurdles you have to go through to 

participate in this rapidly public process.   

          For starters, couldn't hear half of what Iram 

Farooq said.  Maybe it's because I live in affordable 

housing and they don't do anything in the 13 years that I've 

lived here to previous better Internet access, which is 

vitally important to everybody, including the people who 

people talk about as -- you know, deserving of equitable 

treatment. 

          So four minutes of Iram Farooq's testimony I could 

not hear.  And then when I went to sign up to speak, the 

message at the city website said there are no meetings to 

register for.  Okay?  So I would -- if I were a lawyer, I 

would put this whole evening's hearing in question, just for

the lack of ability to participate. 

          There are plenty of alternatives to -- you know, 

this is one thing three developers have -- you know, 

reminded, learning for the first time Capstone Oak aren't 

even a non-profit.   

          So two supposedly non-profits, one for-profit 

compare; that's what we're talking about tonight, and they 

are the proponents of this proposal, and have been from the 

very beginning.   

          And they also have people on the Community 

Preservation Act.  They pass money over to the Affordable 

Housing Trust.  Then they recuse themselves and vote each of 

the money. 

          I think there's a real serious question about how 

this whole process is being don't even.  Are there other 

ways?  You bet there are.  There's a vacant lot at Cherry 

Street.  What's been done there?  It was donated by MIT.   

          What about the site that was acquired at Bishop 

Allen Drive that's been -- you know, apparently tied up in 

another kind of litigation?  Maybe that could have been 

handled differently a lot earlier than it was. 

          What about the three hotels in Porter Square, two

of which are in Cambridge?  What about the residential units 

that were turned into a hotel to Central Square?   

          What about the building that the Historical 

Commission -- the Commissioner, the Executive Director 

signed off in Central Square that's going to be a three-

story addition for a boutique hotel?  If you care about 

affordable housing where are all these people fighting for 

housing instead of luxury and boutique hotels?   

          Now, what about trees?  Apparently, it's 

equitable, but we who live in affordable housing don't get 

to care about trees.  They clear-cut 96 trees when they did 

the state (sic) side of Jefferson Park.  They kept eight, 

and then during construction they took down another four.   

          You know, we don't get to have trees?  Oh, but we 

have to have bicycle racks, which -- the rooms for the 

bicycle racks are largely empty here at Jefferson Park.  But 

somehow, because some people like bicycles, that is 

required, but trees don't matter to poor people. 

          So to me, there is tremendous inequity in this 

proposal.  And with nine seconds left, there isn't a lot -- 

there isn't an opportunity.  But when I hear people talking 

about quality housing from Just-A-Start, please go and talk

to the people who live in the close building, and ask

housing is.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is a phone 

participant, ending in 11.  

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  You can start again.  

There was an issue with the buttons.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Sure.  Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  And I would like to talk trees too.  I have 

said many times in City Council testimony that poor people 

have souls too.  When people talk all we need to do is put 

up boxes, and shove the poor people in them, I fail to see 

how that is different from what we decry -- redlining, 

exclusionary zoning and all of that. 

          I believe that poor people deserve decent homes.  

I believe that poor people deserve open space, trees, 

greenery, because they have souls -- just like all of the 

rest of us. 

          And if this proposal says all we need all we need 

to do is make boxes for people, then it's a lousy proposal, 

and nobody should support it.

          If on the other hand, it sets out a framework so 

that we can create good homes for people, so that they can 

look out their window and see something green and growing, 

so that they can have -- I would -- like James, I would also 

like decent Internet service here in the formerly redlined, 

now God-awfully overpriced East Cambridge. 

          What is our goal?  And does this get us anywhere 

close to it?  If this is just going to produce a couple more 

units a year, then it's a waste of everyone's time.  If on 

the other hand, it is actually going to produce more real 

homes for people, then I can support it.   

          I have not been convinced yet that it's really 

aimed at doing anything other than producing more boxes to 

shove people in and pat ourselves on the back for being so 

forward-looking and progressive. 

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I saw, again, Susan 

Schlesinger's hand raised, and I want to ask if you are 

ready to speak at this point?   

          SUSAN SCHLESINGER:  Can you hear me?

my incompetence in dealing with the Zoom, but I want to 

thank the -- my name is Susan Schlesinger.   

          I live at 34 Glenwood Ave in Cambridgeport, and I 

want to thank the Planning Board in general for the 

tremendous support that you've given to affordable housing 

over the years, you know, looking back at inclusionary 

zoning, incentive zoning, and in support of many 

developments that are now not boxes, but beautiful homes 

where people are living in safety and uncrowded conditions. 

          I want to thank you in particular for the approval 

-- your recommendation to the Council last year about this 

time I think to approve the affordable housing ordinance 

that is essentially the same ordinance that's in front of 

you, with the few changes that Jeff went through. 

          People have been extremely articulate about many 

aspects of this ordinance, and I'm not going to go over them 

again, because I think that you've heard them clearly, but I 

do want to speak about the urgency issues around this 

petition. 

          We've waited a year to get this ordinance in front 

of you, and hopefully with your positive recommendation it 

can move to the Ordinance Committee on the nineteenth and

then to City Council and ordination before the time runs 

out. 

Commons.   

          If we had been able to do this last year, we would 

have had many more projects in the pipeline similar to what 

you're looking at tonight, great projects like Rindge 

          The need for affordable housing is if anything 

going to be greater in the future. In July nationally, about 

30 percent of renters had not been able to pay their full 

rent.  We're fortunate that we have a moratorium on 

evictions in Massachusetts which has been extended, but it 

won't be extended indefinitely. 

          And the job loss and the loss of income is 

disproportionally affecting our black and brown population.  

The rents in Cambridge remain high, they're not going to 

change significantly, and if evictions occur, we really need 

to get these projects going as quickly as possible. 

          I also want to echo some of the comments of       

Councillor McGovern.  I've been around city government for a 

long time, I have never, ever seen a process as inclusive as 

this.   

          Being included in conversations, appearing talking

to a whole range of people across the city is a great thing 

to do, but at some point a decision has to be made, both so 

the goal can be met, which in this case I think are two 

goals - to create more affordable housing, and also to 

really step out on not just talking about diversity -- but 

trying to undo some of the historic, restrictive zoning 

that's resulted in primarily white neighborhoods in the 

city.  And it's time to do that.   

          I mean, we've looked at the this really enough to 

do it, and we should join the growing number of cities and 

states around the country that are looking at different ways 

to change the restrictive zoning that has resulted in real 

racial injustice in their cities and states.  And we need to 

join those and amplify those efforts. 

          I guess those are my major comments.  I think it's 

just really important to move forward.  I think that this 

process has been done very completely, and we really need to 

step out and get the development of affordable housing 

across the city going on, and then turn to the next steps 

and policies that we need to look at to continue to create 

more affordable housing and more diversity in our city. 

          So again, thank you very much for your support.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Linda Vick. 

          LINDA VICK:  Can you hear me?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

          LINDA VICK:  Hi, my name is Linda Vick.  I 

actually live at 402 Rindge Ave.  So I do live in affordable 

housing, and I do believe that affordable housing definitely 

needs to increase in Cambridge.  As a resident, I think a 

lot more people should have the advantage of what Cambridge 

has to offer, but they can't afford to live here.   

          I have a son with disability, and he gets great 

service in Cambridge, so I think other people who can't 

afford the high prices should be able to get the prices that 

they can and get the services they need.  It shouldn't just 

be fair because, you know, I liked here most of my life.   

          I believe that throughout Cambridge there is a 

need for more economic socially (sic) and diversity 

definitely.  I believe that Cambridge could be a great 

community for low-income.  I do believe that Cambridge 

should be very cautious of who they hired to build and to 

fix the low-income places they are producing or want to

produce.   

          I do think a lot of research should be put into it 

before just hiring a company.  And I do believe that they 

should hire a company that is non-profit.  Because if 

they're looking to affordable, we shouldn't be paying huge 

prices.  That's all.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That was the last raised hand.  

Once again, I will give a few seconds.  If anybody hasn't 

spoken yet, and would like to speak on this hearing, please 

push the "Raise hand" button, or if you're participating by 

phone, press *9 on your phone. 

          There was one more speaker that raised hand, and 

then the hand went down.  So the hand went up again, I will 

call on Lia Dege, or Dega, followed by Doris Behanzin.  And 

again, I apologize for the pronunciation.  Lia, you can 

start. 

          LIA DEGE:  Yeah, hi, my name is Lia.  I live in 

Forest Range.  So I support, like, all the building and 

everything.  But my question is regarding parking.  I mean, 

for most of us a car is not a luxury; we have children and 

we are in the transportation business.  So we need, like, 

more parking.

          And I heard, like, you guys are parking one 

parking for us per resident.  So how can we do that.  You 

know, this area is not like, you know, it doesn't have, 

like, street parking all the time, because it's not like we 

are on the highway.  So how are we going to do that moving 

forward?   

     But having affordable housing for everyone is a great 

idea.  I like that, because Cambridge is a good neighborhood 

for children and everybody.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Doris Behanzin.  You can begin by unmuting yourself. 

          DORIS BEHANZIN:  Hello, my name is Doris.  Thank 

you for having me on here.  I definitely -- I like the idea 

of bringing -- yes, my address is 402 Rindge Ave, I'm one of 

the residents at the Ranch Tower.   

          So me and my Mom were benefitting from this 

opportunity of having housing.  You know, it really helped 

us this season in times that -- you know, especially during 

this coronavirus that a lot of people are not able to have a 

full-time job.   

          You know, just having housing is really helpful, 

because the state is really providing and helping us.  We're

not like other people who have, like, no apartment who have 

to pay so much money, and then they don't know how to do it. 

          We have the peace of mind, you know?  And we also 

receive a lot of help -- like the $500 reward card that was 

given to us and the $30 for food.  It was so beneficial.  

And I definitely -- I definitely think it's a good idea to 

have more housing, build more housing. 

          And definitely also see, like the previous lady 

who just spoke, how they can deal with the parking, so 

everybody can be put.  And I'm also an African, and bringing 

this housing really helped.  Because, like, we have a lot of 

Indians, Pakistanis -- we have people from all over, you 

know?   

          And it's not just like we feel like, "Oh, no, like 

we live in a neighborhood, Cambridge is all white." No, at 

402 there are so many different races, you know?  And I feel 

like Cambridge opens this opportunity not to just have one 

race, but different people.   

          And Housing is doing that, and it's really 

beneficial, and I really want to thank you.  That's what I 

have to say.  That's what I have to say.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So, again, there are -- so a few

hands going up.  I would say I appreciate it if you do want 

to speak now is the time to raise your hand.   

          I think we'll exhaust the list at this point.  

Jason Alves is the next speaker, followed by M.K. Greenidge.   

          JASON ALVES:  Hi, this is Jason, East Cambridge 

Business Association at 877 Cambridge Street.  We went in 

some comments a little bit late, so I just wanted to 

highlight some of the points we made in our e-mail. 

          Currently, the AHO -- there's a -- I just want to 

make sure the Planning Board is aware that it doesnâ€™t really 

protect existing commercial spaces the way that it's 

written. 

          And we're just asking that the Planning Board 

really take a look and see if we can make sure that however 

this passes that there's some sort of provision that if 

you're building in the business districts, that there's real 

-- that you're conscious of making sure of preserving our 

commercial spaces. 

          So many of our businesses are under intense 

pressure right now.  There's a real possibility we're going 

to be seeing prolonged vacancies.  With that comes lots of 

pressures on the landlords to meet their own financial 

94

comments.   

          And, you know, we could lose these spaces.  

Especially on Cambridge Street, these spaces are some of the 

more affordable commercial spaces in the city.  And, you 

know, we really can't risk losing these.   

          It's also -- preserving these is also in line with 

the recent retail strategy study that was done by the 

Economic Development Department.  It's in line with many, 

many suggestions in Envision Cambridge, and the Council as 

recently as June passed the policy order sort of saying, 

"Hey, we need to be aware of these things, of these 

pressures that are on the Small Business community, we need 

to preserve these spaces." 

          So it's really in line with a lot of city goals to 

preserve these.  But there's this one little piece of the 

Overlay that is contradicting that.  And we would really 

appreciate the Planning Board to pay close attention to 

that.   

          Thank you.   

Greenidge. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And the next speaker is M.K. 

          M.K. GREENIDGE:  Yes hi, good evening.  Can you

hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, could you please give your -- 

          M.K. GREENIDGE:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- name and address.   

          M.K. GREENIDGE:  Yes, thank you.  My name is 

Myniece.  I am at 402 Rindge Avenue in Cambridge.  I speak 

tonight on behalf of affordable housing and in support of 

affordable housing development, and inclusive of the Rindge 

Commons development.  

           I speak because I have spoken year after year to 

the Board in support of affordable housing, and my question 

every year and year after year up until the question 

presented itself was, "At what point is affordable housing 

no longer affordable?"  

          Year after year, rents increased and increased and 

increased by the developers continuing to develop in 

Cambridge and the rents rising and rising and rising and 

rising without rent control, I continuously ask, at what 

point is affordable housing no longer affordable?   

          At this point, affordable housing is no longer 

affordable for the majority.  I have lived in Cambridge 

since I was two years old, and I can say that diversity is

lacking.  We can see diversity at 402 Rindge Ave, and we 

hope to preserve that.  But it should not just be the case 

at 402 Rindge Avenue.  Diversity should be what it was 

previously in Cambridge. 

          And the only way to preserve diversity is to 

preserve affordable housing.  The only way to maintain a 

space that is safe and that is inclusive of everyone is to 

preserve the fact that everyone can afford to live here and 

benefit from Cambridge's resources.   

          I do support affordable housing.  I do support 

continued development of affordable housing, and even 

increasing the percentage in which the developers have to 

maintain affordable housing. 

          I would greatly, greatly advise and appreciate if 

the Board would consider please vote in honor and in favor 

of supporting of Cambridge's demand for affordable housing.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Those are all the names on the 

list.  And I will turn it back over to the Chair at this

point.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you,

few more words before we move to Board questions.   

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  Thank you, Madam Chair and 

thank you all.  I have to say whoever came up with the timer 

on the side, could you please talk to the folks who do the 

Council meetings, because that's awesome, and we should have 

it too.  So that's -- I wanted to point that out. 

          A couple quick things that I wanted to just 

mention.  One was we heard a few folks tonight talk about 

the Donovan petition.  The Donovan petition was a resident 

petition that was sent to the Ordinance Committee at the 

last City Council meeting.   

          The -- it included a lot of things in it, 

including some suggested amendments to the AHO.  The author, 

Fritz Donovan, as well as Suzanne Blier, who both spoke 

tonight, were very clear that the Donovan petition has 

nothing to do with the AHO.  It is not meant to replace the 

AHO, it is not as a supplement.  So I was a little bit 

surprised to hear it brought up in that context tonight.   

          But I wanted you to know if you did not see the 

City Council meeting, that they are going to be issuing a 

statement to you and to the Ordinance Committee, asking that 

appendix that talks about the AHO in that petition not be

considered as part of their petition.  So that is -- I'm not 

sure why that was brought up tonight, but I wanted to make 

sure you had that information.   

          Secondly, we heard a lot of folks talk about 

making sure the AHO projects fit the character of the 

neighborhood.   

          And I just want to point out that other than 

Brattle Street, and maybe even including Brattle Street, 

there isn't a street in Cambridge that you can go down that 

doesn't have different types of housing and different types 

of architecture.   

          I live on the corner of pleasant and Franklin 

Street.  My family has been in this house for 101 years, and 

when I was growing up in this house, our street was mostly 

single-family, two-family housing.  There was JB Sash & Door 

Company.    

          OVER the years, properties sold, and we now have 

three apartment buildings, 2 six stories and 1 seven 

stories, both taller than what the Overlay would allow, both 

more dense than what the Overlay would allow, on just my 

block.   

          And you know what?  My street is beautiful, my

street is diverse.  I love it.  I love my neighbors.  I've 

gotten to meet more people; they stop and they talk to me 

about the fig tree that my great grandfather planted that's 

95 years old.   

          There's really not a lot to be afraid of folks.  

You know?  And I've lived through it.  And so, I just want 

to share that I've lived through what the Overlay might 

bring to some of these streets.  And you know what?  It's 

wonderful and I love it. 

          And then lastly, I just want to say that the two 

main reasons, or two of the main reasons for the Overlay was 

to make it easier to build affordable housing in 

neighborhoods currently off limits to low and moderate-

income housing, and the second was to make building 

affordable housing more financially viable. 

          So we heard a lot about -- we heard a lot of 

proposals for amendments, a lot of them very interesting, a 

lot of them very good.  But what these amendments will do is 

only make it that much more difficult to build affordable 

housing in neighborhoods currently off limits to that type 

of development.   

          We hear over and over, often from those speaking 

100

22

out against the Overlay, that there is too much market rent 

development being built.  One major reason for that is 

because they're the only ones who can afford to buy anything 

and build anything.   

          If we add so many amendments to the AHO, if we 

kill it by 1000 cuts and we end up taking away the financial 

viability of the affordable housing developers to actually 

do what the AHO is designed to do, then what are we doing?  

Then there's no point in going through this exercise at all. 

          And so, I want to remind folks that we passed 45 

amendments.  The majority of those amendments came from 

Councillors who got those amendments and those ideas from 

people who were opposed to the Overlay.   

          And so, I'm not sure that if 45 amendments isn't 

satisfactory enough, I'm not sure that 50 will be 

satisfactory enough.  I think there are folks who don't want 

it.  And I can respect that, we'll have different opinions.  

But, you know, this has been vetted.   

          And if we kill this by 1000 cuts so that we don't 

end up getting any affordable housing out of this because 

we've added too many, you know, costs, then we've gone 

through this incredibly difficult conversation for nothing.

          And so I respect your deliberations, thank you so 

much for doing this.  I would -- Madam Chair, I would ask 

you I have a quick comment to make about Rindge Commons.  I 

don't know if you want me to wait and just kind of raise my 

hand or make it now.  I'll yield to your judgment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  If it's quick.  Given 

that the lots of other people in public comment have thrown 

in their comments pro or against.  I certainly would take 

that at this time.       

          COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  Okay.  The only thing I 

would say is yes, I support it.  But one thing to note is 

that one of the things I love about this is that when we 

were -- when the city was talking about moving forward with 

the Tobin School renovations, one of the things that we 

wanted to do is we were going to add eight classrooms for a 

preschool.   

          And through the course of community conversations 

and people being concerned about the size of a project, the 

city reduced those eight classrooms to four, which is 

roughly 80 kids, 80 to 100 kids that now will not have 

access to preschool classrooms. 

          This project at Rindge Commons is replacing those

four classrooms that we lost at Tobin.  And so, that is a 

huge, huge benefit.  And it's also in a neighborhood where 

there is a lack of preschool programs, when you look at the 

map of where they are.   

          So I just wanted to point that out as an important 

component.  I didn't want it to get lost in the shuffle, 

because we are trying to move forward with universal Pre-K, 

and this project would help with that as well. 

          So I thank you again for your deliberations and 

your time.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Okay, 

Board members, we have received a set of materials from the 

Community Development Department, and we have staff here 

from all over Community Development, including the Housing 

division. Are there any questions for staff? Anyone want to 

say their name and ask a question?                    

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh.  Go ahead.  So 

my question has to do with the Design Guidelines in the 

advisory role of the Planning Board.  And I tend to think 

that it's going to be nearly impossible to reach a 2.0 FAR 

in the lowest density districts and follow the Design

Guidelines.   

          I'm an architect, I've don't even 50 projects -- 

many of them affordable.  The -- so my question is what 

happens if someone comes to the Planning Board and says, 

"Well, we can't do that.  We can't meet this deadline, 

because otherwise we won't be able to get the 2.0 FAR" and 

we say, "No, you've got to meet the guidelines."   

          So what then?  How does that play out?  Can they 

just ignore our comments, or is there enough pressure on the 

designers and the funders that the Design Guidelines will be 

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So Jeff, do you or 

someone else from Staff want to how such a scenario would 

followed?  

play out?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I certainly can.  And I will maybe 

begin, and then throw it over to Erik Thorkildsen.  And I 

can also, you know, give Chris Cotter a chance to weigh in 

if he has thoughts about that.  I know that Erik is 

certainly well-versed in the Design Guidelines.   

          And I think the question is, you know, one that 

maybe Erik has put some thought into particular guidelines 

that would be relevant.  I'm not sure exactly how to respond 

104

to the particular concern about what guideline would or 

wouldn't be met.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I see Iram has 

popped in here.  Iram, do you want to weigh in on this 

question and give Jeff a break from being our answer to 

everything?               

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I guess I 

would also look to Chris, to see if he wants to add 

anything.  But I will just say that just like with any other 

part of the city or citywide guideline, you know, a 

guideline is not expected to be a regulation.   

          So the things that we expect in regulations are in 

the zoning ordinance.  There's such a series of guidelines, 

that I think it's really hard to imagine that any project -- 

just like, again, in any other context -- that every single 

box for guidelines must be checked off. 

          However, on balance, the guidelines and the spirit 

of them, the goals of them are intended to be met.  So the 

intention behind it -- I think this is written into the 

ordinance -- is the fact that somebody will come, each 

project will have to come before the Board twice, allows an 

opportunity for people to really have to explain why if 

105

12

16

20

21

22

they're not meeting the guideline, or at least the spirit of 

the guideline, why is that happening?   

          And if the answer is as simple as we cannot 

achieve the 2.0 FAR, I think that the next piece of 

conversation has to be with both staff and the Affordable 

Housing Trust, because the report from the Planning Board 

will go to the Trust as well. 

          And there is an interest that the Trust has, as 

well as staff have, to make sure -- and I would say even 

most of the affordable housing builders have, because they 

are not here for one project, right?  And if one project 

goes badly, it essentially impacts the next project. 

          So the entire affordable housing development 

community has an interest in making sure that each project 

is the best that it can be. 

          I will also point out that for the Planning Board 

to have -- to not have discretionary review is actually not 

a change in how affordable housing projects that are not 

building to the base zoning or to special permit zoning are 

dealt with. 

          So today, if affordable housing buildings end up 

going through the comprehensive permit, which is a BZA 

106

permit, and the Board has -- the Planning Board has advisory 

review of those projects, and you have often noted to us 

calling on folks Erik or Suzannah to take a look at those 

buildings and provide additional advice and convey those 

comments to the BZA -- the BZA is not obligated to take up 

the comments from the Planning Board. 

          So it's in essence, right now you are depending on 

one Board, and if the Affordable Housing Overlay were to be 

adopted, it would be a different body that would be looking 

at the Planning Board's comments.  So I will actually just 

leave it there and see if Chris has anything to add.     

          CHRIS CHANDOR:  Hi, folks.  Yes, I would add just 

a couple things just to kind of build on what Iram said, in 

that this is the setup that exists now in terms of the 

comments that the Board makes on 40B requests.  And in the 

case of the Overlay, that design report would go to the 

Affordable Housing Trust.   

          In the case of the current situation, the report 

goes to the BZA.  But very often, what we end up doing as 

staff, working with the affordable housing builder after 

that report, or our recommendations or advice from the 

Planning Board comes, is to then work with the affordable

housing builders to determine how best to respond to those 

comments, those suggestions -- really in advance of getting 

to the BZA in some cases, so that we're able to know that 

we've got a builder there with recommendations from the 

Board, being able to say that they've responded to them. 

          And this, I think, goes back many, many years.  I 

can think of at least four or five examples from the top of 

my head, where we have seen that, and that that's worked 

well.  In this case, with the Overlay, those comments would 

be made to the Affordable Housing Trust.   

          As Jeff noted earlier, the report on the Planning 

Board would go to the Affordable Housing Trust, so we would 

then look to review that report with the Affordable Housing 

          And I could say that as one of the principal 

funders for affordable housing in the city, the builders 

take very seriously the comments of the Trust, and we're 

often working with them to adapt projects to meet the 

comments and try to achieve the outcomes that the Trust has 

Trust. 

set. 

          And certainly ensuring good design, ensuring that 

there's good outcomes is going to be a prime goal for the

Trust, as it is for staff, as it will be for the affordable 

housing builders, recognizing that this is -- you know, this 

will be a critical tool, and to the extent that it's there, 

and leading to good outcomes that will work well. 

          But if it's there and leading to outcomes that are 

not deemed to be positive and having a good impact, that it 

will be easy to then see this tool pulled away.   

          So there will be a vested interest in everyone 

involved to try to achieve those good outcomes.  And, you 

know, we would certainly want to work with the Trust and 

ensure that they take seriously what the report from the 

Board, and I expect that they would.    

          I know a number of folks on the Trust and -- you 

know, recognize the partnership that the Trust has seen in 

the Board over the years, given the support that the Board 

has lent to projects that have been funded by the Trust.   

          So I would be sure that the Trust would want to 

look at that in the same way under this new setup.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I would only add one point to 

that, looking at it again from the -- just from the zoning 

angle.  You know, this kind of framework of this zoning is 

built not around density the way that a lot of our current 

109

base zoning is built; it's really built around these 

limitations on dimensions like height and the number of 

stories in the building, and setbacks and open space. 

          So it's really not -- it's not built towards a 

notion that there's a density and that that density should 

be achieved on every site, no matter what.  If the 

dimensional constraints make it impossible to achieve, you 

know, to get to that 2.0 density, the other limitations are 

still what control. 

          And the density impact was added during the 

discussion last year, just because there was concern about 

cases where there might be too much flexibility on the site, 

and there was a concern about having -- you know, too much 

building in those cases.   

          So that FAR cap was really put in kind of as a 

stopgap for those types of cases.  But a lot of cases are 

going to be controlled more by the dimensional standards.     

          MARY FLYNN:  Can I follow up, Catherine?  Or maybe 

Hugh has more.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Nope, that was a very thorough 

explanation.

there and trying to call on Ted, who had had his hand 

raised.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, I'm sorry.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sorry, Mary, I'll get 

to you next.       

          MARY FLYNN:  That's fine.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I just wanted to follow up on 

what Iram and Jeff and Chris said, is that it's very 

explicit in the ordinance with regard to the Design Review 

process and the Design Guidelines.   

          It says it's intended that designers of AHO 

projects, City Staff, the Planning Board and the general 

public will be open to creative variations for many detailed 

provisions set forth in such objectives and guidelines, as 

long as the core values expressed are being served. 

          And so, I think that, you know, resolves the 

potential problem that Hugh is raising, is that -- as Iram 

said -- these are guidelines, not regulations.  But the 

overall intent of to create the housing and to create the 

housing in a manner that's in keeping with the guidelines, 

with the intent of the ordinance.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mary?

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  I -- first of all, I want 

to say that I find this petition -- this version of the 

petition to be improved, in comparison to what we saw last 

year.  And part of that is the FAR limitation.   

          I was very worried about not having anything that 

did cap how much could go on a site in the ordinance in the 

neighborhoods without at that time a -- you know, a more 

robust, and actually a process that required design 

approval. 

          So I think this does move us forward and gives me 

comfort in terms of what can happen on certain sites.  But 

the number itself -- I have a question about that.  How did 

you determine that 2.0 was the correct FAR for those sites?  

For the lower density residential areas?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So Jeff or Iram, was 

that a staff determination, or was that provided by City 

Council?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  My recollection is that it was a 

recommendation by Council.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This was something that was added 

during the review of the petition by the Ordinance

Committee, and, you know, staff sort of weighed in on this.  

          I think we had indicated that during the initial 

planning stage for the Affordable Housing Overlay there was 

some analysis of what level of density is needed in order to 

make affordable housing developments feasible in the more 

restrictive residential neighborhoods. 

          And it, you know, the results will vary site by 

site, and there are a lot of different factors that are 

going to play into answering that question, but that 

analysis arrived about a FAR of 2.   

          And it's actually it didn't really arrive at a FAR 

of 2, it arrived at a sort of general number of units that 

would need to be built.  And that was kind of translated 

through -- you know, various permutations into that FAR.  

And so, that was what was suggested to be that kind of tab.   

          The one thing I'll note, just to make it sort of 

visually easier, for a -- if you can visualize in your mind, 

you know, residential development often has -- you know, we 

don't control -- there's something called, "lot coverage" in 

zoning, which we don't really control in our zoning, but 

it's a way of thinking about -- like, what's the footprint 

of the building on the site?   

113

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

          And for a lot of residential buildings, you know, 

the footprint will often tend to be about 50 percent.  So 

the site will be about 50 percent open, and then 50 percent 

building footprint.   

          And so, if you imagine a building that's four 

stories covering 50 percent of a lot area, supporting half 

of a lot area, that gets you to that FAR of 2.   

          So it fits sort of with the notion of a four-story 

building.  Although, like I said, it -- depending on the 

conditions of the site, you know, you might not be able to 

achieve that density, because there's also requirements for 

setbacks and other things on the site that might be more 

constraining.   

          I don't know if anyone else wants to add.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, that's very, very 

helpful.  I think I understand and I appreciate Councillor 

McGovern's comments about the A-1 and A-2 districts and how, 

you know, things change over time, I understand that. 

          I do find lacking, though, a written or a drawn 

example of what such a project would look like in an A1 or 

an A2 zone.  I can see it much more clearly in my head in 

Residence B, because I think they exist.   

114

          In the A-1s and A-2s, you know, I guess 

particularly the ones that I'm familiar with, which are 

along Brattle Street and perhaps part of Fairweather and 

Lakeview and those streets, it just -- I have a hard time 

envisioning how a large, in my opinion, multifamily project 

fits in there.   

          So I am happy that there is a limit.  I like the 

heights, and I'm -- you know, pleased with the setbacks and 

all of the other dimensional requirements.  But I do think 

that not having some illustration to help us be sure that 

these dimensional requirements really are appropriate for 

those districts is -- it's lacking.  It's a bit of a problem 

to me.   

is going.    

          But in general I'm very pleased with the way this 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I want to make 

sure that all Board members who have questions are able to 

get out questions for the staff, before we go to more 

general discussion.  Are there any -- Lou, you have your 

hand up.  Do you have a question?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, just a quick one.  It 

sounded like from the conversation that we would consider

exceeding the guidelines to make the FAR fit.  Is that true?      

          IRAM FAROOQ:  If I could say, we -- you would look 

115

at it -- the Board, we expect, would look at it just like 

you do in any other project that is subject to Design 

Guidelines.  Any -- some of the guidelines are based on a 

district, and some are city wide.   

          But as you know, when you look at a series of 

guidelines, there are often dozens of guidelines for an area 

or a particular project subject to, and rarely is a project 

made to meet every single guideline.   

          And the Board -- I hope if you think back to some 

of the projects that you've reviewed recently, it is rare to 

have a project that is checking off every single box, 

because the guidelines are intended to be a series of design 

intentions that guide the project.  Hence, they are 

guidelines as opposed to the regulatory elements.   

          And if you look at just the AHO, it actually pulls 

certain aspects that have to do with building form into the 

regulation, so there are certain components that are thought 

of as immutable, whereas others are thought to be more 

variable.  And those end up in the guidelines. 

          I did want to also address Mary's question while I

have the microphone, which is that the Council -- the 

Ordinance Committee when they met asked us to for a diagram 

that models out the building potentially in the A districts.  

And so, Erik is currently working on that, and we expect to 

have that for the Ordinance Committee hearing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  I'm very happy to hear that.  

Thank you.    

your hand up?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Steve, I see you have 

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes, I'm -- I guess I'm still a 

little bit confused about the guidelines.  Because we're 

saying that [2:41:32 audio unclear modifications are 

essentially as of right guidelines.   

          And I'm not clear what role our Board really has 

other than to make some suggestions which may or may not be 

taken. 

          So -- and frankly, you know, with some of the 

organizations that we've dealt with, I think, you know, we 

were in the] and I know we would try to be responsive, to be 

the only applicants in the future. 

          So I have several questions, but if I can do one 

by one on that one, you know, is there any mandatory nature 

there, or are our comments purely advisory and without any, 

you know, teeth?               

          IRAM FAROOQ:  The Planning Board's review is 

117

advisory  

          [Pause]  

          Sorry, I think I muted myself midway.  I was just 

saying that the Planning Board's review is advisory.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  and if I could add one point, this 

is just to really make it clear for everyone, and everyone 

listening.  And I think -- I'm sorry, I'm not sure if Steve 

is still speaking?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Go ahead, Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes, I'm still here.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  I thought you were maybe 

saying something.  So when we talk about, "Design 

Guidelines," we're really talking about more of the sort of 

subjective, interpretive types of characteristics of design 

that lend themselves to discussion and give and take, and 

conversation.  And the Board is used to having those kinds 

of conversations. 

          But those are different from standards, from

development standards, that would have to be met.  So you 

wouldn't be able to simply bypass the height restrictions or 

the setback restrictions, the open space or any other -- any 

of the specific design standards that talk about having a 

minimum faÃ§ade transparency and a minimum break in faÃ§ades, 

and having entrances that face the street. 

          So there are specific standards that do have to be 

met, or else they would have to -- development would have to 

seek a variance, or go through a comprehensive permit 

process. 

          But the Design Guidelines aren't meant to 

establish specific, objective standards.  They're meant to 

lay out the different considerations that would be 

considered and discussed through an Advisory review.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Tom, you have 

your hand up?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Could I just follow up?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  To the current ones, before Tom 

jumps in.  So one of them is on parking.  You know, 

apparently there are no parking requirements, if I 

understand that correctly.

          And, you know, I don't know how much discussion 

there was in the development of this application, but I can 

imagine certain projects of certain sizes in certain 

locations, where no parking will not be a problem.  But I 

can certainly imagine other projects of other sizes in other 

locations where parking would be a problem.   

          And in the world that we live in, in the 

communities that we live now, you know, it may be once upon 

a time one might assume that folks who qualify for 

affordable housing don't have cars or need cars or can't 

afford cars, but that was a different place in a different 

world.  In this world, those folks have and frequently need 

cars.   

          And I think depending on the nature and size, it's 

a significant problem, and the fact that there's no 

requirement, and that we in our --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Steve, is there a 

question in there?     

cannot -- [Laughter].    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- impression in our review

questions out, and then give everybody a chance to discuss.  

And --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Okay, well thank you.  Fair 

enough.  I guess what I -- I'm sorry, you know, I guess what 

I'm asking is for the staff to explain why they felt that 

there's no need for parking?  And similarly why, after we've 

addressed the issue of bicycles in the city, why the staff 

has determined that there's no need for bicycle parking 

either?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'll try to cover those fairly 

quickly.  So the original proposal developed by staff at the 

beginning part of this discussion last year had a reduced 

parking requirement.  It was actually the Ordinance 

Committee and City Council through their amendment process 

that removed the requirement for minimum parking as part of 

the Affordable Housing Overlay.   

          I think the feeling -- I can't speak for the 

Council, but I think the feeling was that given that this 

entire effort is about what are the tradeoffs that need to 

be made between flexibility and having hard requirements for 

affordable housing development and how that impacts the 

121

feasibility of projects, the Council felt that parking was 

one of the areas where they could let go, and allow some 

flexibility. 

          One thing to note -- and, you know, this is the 

conversation that's happening in sort of the zoning world 

all around right now, there is a principle to parking that 

says -- you know -- that the amount of parking that's 

necessary for a project is better determined by the 

developers of the project itself, because they will need to 

-- in order to serve the people that they're serving -- will 

need to provide the amount of parking that's necessary, 

given the context and given the circumstances of that 

project, and that's it's not as necessary for the zoning to 

set those requirements. 

          So that's sort of the general thinking about it.  

And again, it was really the City Council that decided to go 

in that direction. 

          In terms of bicycle parking, I was honestly a 

little confused by the commentary.  Because the zoning -- 

there was no change from last year's version to this year's 

version.  Bicycle parking is required.   

          There is some flexibility provided in the

22

Affordable Housing Overlay in terms of the location of 

bicycle parking spaces that need to be provided.  But the 

number of spaces is only changed, or can only be reduced or 

waived under specific circumstances. 

          One is in order to provide Bluebikes as a public 

bicycle sharing service.  There was a discussion around 

providing additional public service, reducing the need for 

onsite bicycle parking for -- you know, for residents and 

their private bicycles. 

          And then secondarily, whenever there's a rehab of 

an existing building, often it's very difficult to design 

access and layout of a bicycle parking room in a way that 

meets the city's standards when you're working with an 

existing building.  And so, some relief is given.   

          Again, it goes along with the theme of trying to 

encourage and facilitate preservation of existing buildings, 

wherever that's possible.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  But other than those exceptions, 

you're saying there is a parking requirement?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The bicycle parking is required.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Okay, thank you.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

questions for Staff?  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Just a couple of more 

clarifications.  So on my original question of the 

guidelines, so if it bumps up against the zoning, the zoning 

will prevail.   

          So what I'm curious about is so if somebody says 

if we can move the setback -- side rear front, whichever 

occurs -- back by five feet and attain the two FAR, would 

that be allowed?  Is it that flexible?   

          And on Steve's point, so now we have a place that 

has no parking for your car and only a half a spot for a 

bike, I believe, so now we'll take the bike and put it in 

the car and hope to find a place on the street?  This is a 

funny way to do business.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So correct me if I'm 

wrong, Jeff, but if someone wanted to not meet setbacks in 

order to achieve a 2 FAR, they would still need a variance 

for that, is that correct?  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's correct.  So they would be 

following the setback standards that are in the Affordable 

Housing Overlay, which, you know, it's -- again, if you're

in a restrictive district, it's 15 feet in the front, 7.5 

feet on the sides, 20 feet in the rear.  Some -- you know, 

you have to use the standards that are in the zoning.  If 

you wanted to get relief, that would be a variance.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My 

question was largely answered in Steve's follow up related 

to bicycles.   

          But the third speaker with Rudel did -- and the 

memo that was submitted on behalf of the Cambridge Bicycle 

Committee in advance of the hearing did raise an issue 

around social equity in bicycles that I have never -- that 

never occurred to me before, that in fact the importance of 

bicycles and proper storage actually may be an issue of 

          And so, thank you, Jeff, for addressing what the 

detailed requirements are within the ordinance.  That 

largely answers my concern about making sure that we do not 

lose focus of that alternative mode of transportation, thank 

equity. 

you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Okay.  Steve, 

do you have any clarifying question?

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  No, I'm sorry.  That does it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Just making sure I'm getting all of them.  All right.  Then 

we can move to discussion.  Tom, can I ask you to kick us 

off on that?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Sure.  Look, I appreciated 

Councillor McGovern's start to the evening explaining to the 

process that the ordinance has been through.   

          My feeling is that it's not perfect, but one of 

the things that we discussed at length not too long ago was 

the fact that this is reviewed not only there will be 

reports on the success or failure of the ordinance to do 

what it intended to do, but then there are -- each five 

years there's an annual report. 

          So of course it's a Sisyphean exercise, right?  

Some speakers said, "Oh, well, I'm not going to stop until 

everybody who wants to live in Cambridge gets to live in 

Cambridge."  Well, of course, that requires mathematics 

beyond even MIT to make that work, right?  So it's not going 

to work that way. 

          But there is a point where we have fulfilled our 

goals and obligations as a community, and every five years

we'll get a chance to look back and see whether this 

ordinance is helping in that regard.  So that check and 

balance for me deals with an ordinance that's pretty close, 

but not making everybody happy.   

          So I'm good to go on this.  Really appreciate all 

of the work over the last months.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted, do you 

want to go next?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Sure.  So Councillor McGovern 

covered most of the things and made most of the comments 

that I would make. 

          What I will say is in the quarantine of the past 

six months or so, I spent a lot of time learning more about 

the historical impacts of zoning, and its negative approach 

or application to racial and economic diversityâ€¦  and 

similarly about the impacts of discretionary special 

permitting on reducing the size of affordable housing, 

and/or killing affordable housing. 

          So I think that the purpose of the AHO to promote 

diversity throughout the entire city is admirable, and is 

something we need to do.   

          And I similarly think that in order to promote the 

127

affordable housing, there has to be an as-of-right process, 

so that the developers who want to build it will know or 

have a pretty good idea of what they can achieve, and what 

they can pay for for their property. 

          I think the Design Review provisions of the 

ordinance are as good as what we do in comprehensive 

permitting, and that the number of public inputs, the number 

of public hearings and the oversight by the Cambridge 

Housing Authority will guarantee that we will get at least 

decent developments, if not really good or excellent 

development. 

          I agree that not everybody is going to get 

everything they want, and that waiting for the perfect is 

not a viable option that we have to take -- move forward 

with something that is at least good, if not very good.   

          And that with the periodic reviews, we will be 

able -- the city will be able to change things that aren't 

working or not working in the manner that they were intended 

to. 

          So I -- you know, there were minor nits that I 

would make, minor changes.  But I think it's time to move 

forward with what the City Council adopted.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, how about 

you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I had quick information on 

what Chris probably -- or whoever wants to field it -- I'd 

like to know what the minimum income requirement is to 

qualify for the affordable housing units?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So under the Overlay, 

the zoning includes maximum income limits, but there's no 

minimum income.  So the idea would be that any target or 

minimum income would be set by the funding program that's 

involved with the production of the housing.   

          So, you know, you take for example the building 

that was just completed up on Concord Ave by Homowners Rehab 

Finch, Cambridge.  In that case, it's 98 units.  There are I 

think four tiers of affordability with households earning up 

to 100 percent of ones here up to 80 percent of the 

difference here, night and up to 60, and then in some cases 

households earning less than 30 percent. 

          All of those are predicated upon the funding 

that's available, and the requirements that come with those 

funders.   

          So what we did with the drafting of the Overlay 

129

was to try to keep it flexible in terms of where the target 

was, and the minimum, hoping that we would see a range of 

incomes of housing created through this, but that we would 

have a maximum income in every case.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So there is no minimum -- I 

don't exactly know how that works.  How do you qualify 

people for this?  I'm very -- it's always bothered me, this 

question, about no minimums.  We know the maximums you're 

going to get a lot of people that are mixed.  But what about 

the moderate and minimum?  How -- what kind of, how does 

that break down?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, again, it goes 

back to the subsidy that's available that's there to create 

the how deep the affordability is.  So a lot of programs 

will target affordability at a household at 60 percent.   

          There are programs that will utilize their funds 

to target units to become more deeply affordable to 

households under 50 or under 30 percent.  So in the case of 

Finch, there is some funding targeted there to try to create 

some -- a small number of very deeply affordable units.   

          What we do with the affordable housing builders is 

also work very closely with the Cambridge Housing Authority

to use housing choice vouchers that the Housing Authority 

has to make units that are -- say targeted at a household at 

50 or 60 percent of the median to make those units even more 

deeply affordable, the households with housing vouchers who 

-- you know, are generally under 30 and I think 

predominantly are under 40 percent, if you're looking at the 

need for that assistance. 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay.  So you would transfer 

vouchers?  That's what I had heard in the conversations with 

other people.  I was just curious.  Because it doesn't seem 

like we're going to get a lot of very low-income people at 

these units.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Actually, one of the advantages of 

working with the way that we do development in Cambridge 

with the housing agencies that all work in partnership is 

really they collaborate to really look at the best way to 

use the local resources, and the CHA's participation is 

really essential and critical in doing this.   

          And this is an important distinction I would make 

but what we're able to do with the Housing providers and 

seeing what we're able to do in the inclusionary context 

with the market is really work with the CHA and bring

vouchers in to try to make units more deeply affordable, and 

work with the providers to bring in the subsidy that's 

needed to do that, to really ensure a pretty good mix of 

incomes in those units.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, did you 

want to make any comments for the deliberation?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Kind of still stuck on the 

as-of-right, but I know why the requirement is there.  It 

may be the best we can do at the time.  That's as good as I 

can get it.  Still got a lot of holes in it, but we'll see 

where it goes.    

want to go next?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve, do you 

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Okay, sure.  You know, it's 

certainly not controversial to say that any program that 

supports affordable housing in the city of Cambridge is an 

important, desirable thing.  So there's, you know, not much 

debate in this city about the fundamentals of this proposal.  

And so, it's just the details. 

          I'm afraid that we're all so supportive of the 

fundamentals that we're willing to just, you know, sort of 

132

22

cross our fingers and hope that the details somehow work out 

okay.  For me, design is part of that.  You know, I just 

hope design works out okay. 

          I am a little concerned about parking, though.  

You know, if you have a substantial project there and no 

parking is provided, and every neighborhood is already tight 

on parking, and suddenly there's another 10,20 cars to be 

parked on that street for this new development which doesn't 

provide for any parking, that just seems to be fundamentally 

bad planningâ€¦  and to the folks who are already living in 

the neighborhood, and the folks who have absolutely no idea 

that this proposal is being discussed this evening.  95 

percent of Cambridge has no idea that this proposal is being 

discussed. 

          So, you know, what can I say?  This is a 

fundamentally good, necessary proposal.  But, you know, 

there are details I'm nervous a little bit about design, but 

I think parking, as so often turns out to be the case, and 

in urban areas like ours parking could be a really 

problematic issue in the neighbors where these projects are 

to be built in the years to come.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh, do you

want to go next?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Sure.  I've been thinking about the 

process we went through just about a year ago the first time 

we reviewed this, and in particular the leadership that our 

Chair provided in structing our discussion.   

          I was actually surprised in the discussion to find 

that I was supporting it, and that the super majority of the 

Board supported every piece of it.  It's not changed 

fundamentally since then.  The situation about housing has 

only gotten more critical. 

          So I think to be responsible, to be consistent, we 

need to forward this with a favorable recommendation.  You 

know, I think all of us realize we're breaking new ground in 

the process, and I'm convinced that the incentives are there 

to produce very reasonable and pretty good budgets, and 

perhaps some wonderful projects. 

          If it doesn't play out that way, then as Tom 

points out, we don't have to live with this forever, we can 

tweak the process, we can tweak the program.  So again, I 

think we should proceed and give this a favorable 

recommendation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary?

          MARY FLYNN:  I agree with my colleagues that we 

should give it a favorable recommendation.  I was one of the 

Board members who had some hesitations last year.  I was 

always supportive of the notion that it should be citywide.  

I think that it was important then for equity and diversity 

across the city, and it's probably more important today than 

it was then. 

          My biggest concerns -- again -- were really 

related to design and, you know, the potential bulk of 

buildings in the lower density districts, as I said before.  

          I think, you know, the Design Review, it's not -- 

if I had to create it, it probably isn't what I would do, 

but I think having read through the steps that the developer 

will have to take, that there is enough there to make me 

feel comfortable that we will end up with a product that has 

had a lot of thought put into it.  It might not be perfect, 

but I think all of the right topics are going to be 

considered and considered carefully. 

          And again, the -- in terms of the dimensional 

requirements, the fact that we now have the FAR limit is 

very reassuring, and I'm pleased to know that the Council 

had asked for the illustration of what a project could look 

135

like, because I think that will inform their deliberations 

going forward, as to whether the 2.0 is the right number, or 

whether that should be tweaked a little bit. 

          So as others have said, it's not perfect, nothing 

ever really is, but we are going to learn from the process, 

as others have pointed out. 

          And I think we already have, as -- you know, as 

Steve says it's not -- you know, major changes, but it is 

tweaks that have improved the petition.  So, like my 

colleagues, I would give the petition as drafted a favorable 

recommendation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  And Niko?          

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sure.  So I support this proposal.  

I supported the Affordable Housing Overlay the last time I 

was before the Planning Board.  I agree with Councillor 

McGovern.  I also just want to echo everything that Ted 

said.   

support it.   

          I think this is a good proposal, and I thought 

that the first one was a good proposal, so I continue to 

          I think there's one thing that I'll add for the 

sake of enriching the further discussion is I think that we

are in a moment nationally when there is more attention to 

the procedures that lead to housing shortages and racial and 

economic segregation around the country. 

          As cities like Minneapolis are abolishing single-

family zoning and states like California, which have been 

gripped by housing crises for decades, are moving away from 

discretionary review and eliminating the role of 

organizations like Planning Boards in new developmentâ€¦  as 

the President is tweeting about the role of HUD rules in, 

you know, abolishing the suburbs or, you know, what the 

Obama era rules were designed to do, was just to increase 

racial integration and economic integration. 

          I think all of this is just suggesting that we're 

at a moment in the zeitgeist where there is more attention 

being paid to housing, and it's our responsibility to look 

at the forms of the zoning code and look at the forms for 

our own role and really be critical about what role we are 

planning on the Planning Board in contributing to 

segregation. 

          I think, and segregation not just in terms of 

within Cambridge, but Cambridge relative to the Boston area, 

to Massachusetts as a whole, and generally.

22

          And I think Ted is absolutely right that it's 

important to look at history.  You know, today many of the 

policies that we look back on and say, "Well, that was 

obviously bad."  And, you, for example redlining: Councillor 

McGovern put up the Redlining Map of Massachusetts -- or of 

Cambridge.  Redlining was common practice for, you know, 

five decades.   

          And redlining, when it was practiced, was treated 

as, "Well, you know, we don't make the rules, we just -- you 

know, put the money where we can get FHA loan guarantees."  

Or, "We just direct the new tenants, or the new homeowners 

to where they will fit within the racial character of the 

neighborhood."  

          It wasn't all just a bunch of racist people 

getting together and deciding how to best be racist, it was 

individuals who were not critical about the roles that they 

were playing in contributing to, you know, structural 

inequity and to the problems of racial segregation. 

          So I honestly think that we're going to look back 

in 20 or 30 years to our own moment and see all sorts of 

ways in which we are contributing to the world that we don't 

want to live in, by virtue of our lack of examination about

how we are contributing to it. 

          And so, I think that discretionary permitting 

generally, I find myself being more critical of that, and so 

in terms of as-of-right permitting for affordable housing, 

this strikes me as a good first step to reevaluating the 

role of the Planning Board generally in the process of 

permitting new development 

          I would encourage every member of the Planning 

Board to read the recent book by Katherine Einstein, David 

Glick and Maxwell Palmer at BU, "Neighborhood Defenders," 

which just came out.  And it's a study of Planning Boards 

across Massachusetts.   

          They've looked at the data from the past several 

years and found that the people who participate in public 

comment tend to be whiter, richer, older, more male, more 

longtime residents, more homeowners, and overwhelmingly 

opposed to new housing -- and particularly affordable 

housing. 

          And I think that's just -- it's really striking 

data; that it would be a disservice to our role as being 

stewards of the community to ignore.  Cambridge as a city 

developed most of its neighborhood character and the things

that we'll love about it without any Design Review or zoning 

at all.  Zoning is a relatively recent phenomenon.   

          You know, there's nothing that's unsafe or 

unsanitary about a four-story or a five-story or a six-story 

building, it's just illegal.  And the whole zoning code is 

just a code of making it illegal to building things that 

people want.  And it's illegal to building housing that 

people want to live in.   

          And, you know, there may be good reasons to ensure 

that we have safe places to live and great places to raise a 

family, but honestly, I'm just not sympathetic to rules that 

are just designed to preserve some -- you know, really 

abstract idea of character, especially when it's a character 

designed by, or favored by people who currently live there, 

and this is totally ignoring all the people who want to live 

here, except they can't afford to make their voices heard.  

          So, you know, I think it's important to recognize 

that not all of Cambridge is here today, even though this 

meeting could go on for a very long time.   

          You know, most people don't show up to Planning 

Board meetings -- even the most packed meetings.  But even 

if they did, we also have to think about the thousands and

thousands of people who do not come to meetings because they 

don't yet live here.  You know, we have future neighbors who 

want to live in Cambridge and they will be able to, with new 

affordable housing.   

          And it's important for us to recognize that there 

are voices that won't be heard in this setting not only 

because it's, you know, on a weeknight and, you know, 

requires child care and all sorts of other things in order 

to participate, but also because what we're talking about is 

expanding our neighborhoods and making them more accessible 

for our new neighbors.   

          And I think that it's important to think about all 

of the people who we want to live with, and how we can make 

our community more inclusive and acceptable, so that when we 

do look back in 20 and 30 years, we think about, "Yes,  I 

know, I was on the Planning Board, and I voted to support 

increasing the amount of economic diversity in my city and 

the racial diversity in my city.  And one way I did it was 

by supporting an extremely modest step to making it slightly 

easier to build affordable housing." 

          So yeah, I support this.  I think we need more 

petitions like this, and I look forward to seeing more

aggressive proposals to make sure that everyone who wants to 

live in Cambridge can afford to.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you for 

the reading recommendation.  I've made a note, and really 

look forward to looking at that.  I have to say I totally 

agree with everything Niko and Ted said. 

          And I did in preparation for the meeting today 

kind of go back over the recommendation we forwarded to the 

City Council last September.  And I've had it kind of up on 

my screen as we've been talking to see if there's anything 

that we're going over or that people are raising concerns 

about that we didn't raise previously, if there was anything 

new. 

          And a lot of this is ground we've covered before, 

and I think Steve is absolutely right in that to a certain 

extent, there are things about this that make a lot of 

people uneasy.  And there's never going to be a level of 

certainty about those things.   

          And that's why the five-year review is built in.  

It is because we do -- we recognize that we are going into 

unchartered territory here, and there are some things that 

we're trying.

          You know, the parking thing we actually covered 

that in our recommendation last time, because there was 

quite a bit of discussion about it, about having no minimum 

versus the additional cost to every affordable housing unit 

that requiring parking makes.  And it's a huge tradeoff.   

          It's an important one, it's an important one to 

the current residents, but it's also an important one to 

think about, as Niko says, to potential future residents.   

          If having a parking spaces or on the is the 

difference between having a unit or not, there are people 

who will figure out how to do without the parking space.  

And sometimes that'll mean parking on the street, and 

sometimes it'll mean -- you know, using a bike or the T. 

          And one of the reasons why we have specialty 

developers in this area is because they are the experts in 

their field who are best suited to figure out what's really 

going to work for the communities they are marketing to.   

           I am really pleased, frankly, at how this 

discussion has gone tonight.  I think, you know, it's 

refreshed all of our memories of where we were a year ago.   

          But it's added the context of, I think, as Ted 

rightly noted, a lot of us have been paying a lot more

attention to our role in structural inequities and racism in 

the past three, four, five months, than we were even a year 

ago.   

          And it is a ripe time to take a step towards 

seeing if we can do some small part towards making Cambridge 

the more equitable place we want it to be. 

          So I'm also supportive of moving forward a 

favorable recommendation tonight, which I -- my sense of the 

Board is there's at least majority support for that 

recommendation.  And therefore I will ask at this time if 

there is a motion to make a favorable recommendation on the 

petition to the Council?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I would move that we make a 

favorable recommendation to forward the petition and forward 

the petition to the Council?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted seconds.  All 

right.  Then we will have a roll call vote.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Myself on the motion to forward 

that recommendation.  Lou Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

144

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Oh, boy, I'm having a hard time. 

I just put the phone down.  I guess I would vote aye.  But I 

really want to convey to the Council my concern about 

parking, and I guess I'll convey that again.  Nay in this 

case. 

          Did that go through?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Jeff, confirm 

that was a "nay" -- you heard "nay" there?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Was that a "nay" a no vote?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes, that was a nay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No, okay, thank you.  I'm sorry, 

the audio was difficult.   

          Mary Flynn?  

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.  A very un - 

          [Pause]

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I have -- correct me if I'm 

wrong, but I've recorded seven in favor, one opposed? 

          [7 VOTE YES, 1 VOTE NO]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That is also what I 

heard.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  And we have 

confirmation.  Excellent.  All right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Madam Chair?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, sir.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Could I just say I really have 

to echo Niko's recommendation of the book, "Neighborhood 

Defenders." It really is -- it tells us the obvious, but 

it's also eye-opening, and it starts out with a discussion 

about this Planning Board's action on one particular 

project.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, okay.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So it really is an excellent 

book that we all should read.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, again, thank 

you for the recommendation.  I look forward to diving into 

that.    

          I know I have seen just in the literature from the 

American Planning Association and various other professional 

groups I'm a part of a big uptick in articles and editorials 

on the roles that planning professionals and planning boards 

play in perpetuating inequality in our societies, and it's a 

welcome discussion -- not always an easy one, but one I am 

glad we're having.  So thank you all. 

          We do have -- as impossible as it seems after 

three hours -- we do have another item on the agenda.  I'm 

going to give the Board seven minutes.  So back here at 9:45 

to go to our next item.  And we will -- as Tom loves it when 

I do, I will start promptly at 9:45.  So we are in recess.  

Thank you all.

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  It is 9:45, so 

the Board is back in session.  We are waiting for some of 

our Board members to come back on camera here, but they 

should be assembling very quickly. 

And then we will go to our next item on the 

agenda, which is a review of a comprehensive permit 

application to the Board of Zoning Appeals for the 

construction of 101 units of affordable housing at 402 

Rindge Ave. 

Board members may note that this project was 

referenced by a number of speakers on our earlier public 

hearing tonight, so we have heard some about this already, 

but this will be the actual official public hearing on the 

matter. 

Missing Lou and Steve.     

STEVEN A. COHEN:  I'm here.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Of, thank you.  And 

there's Lou.  Okay, great.  So we'll start with CDD staff, 

who will summarize why this is before us.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Just quickly, this is a 

comprehensive permit application under Chapter 40B, Section 

21 of Massachusetts General Laws.   

          So the way that this process works, as we 

discussed a little bit at the last hearing, is that for the 

development of affordable housing, an applicant can make a 

single application to the BZA instead of separate 

applications to other local Boards.   

          So for this, and the way this process works, the 

Planning Board has the opportunity to review the application 

and make advisory comments to the BZA.  So I won't go into 

the application, the representatives of the project team are 

here, and they can provide an overview.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thank you, 

Jeff.  So I believe the presenter for the project team, 

we're starting with Craig Nelson -- Nicholson, excuse me.  

Is that correct? 

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yes, it is.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  If you could 

begin by introducing yourself and any other speakers on your 

team, and then begin your presentation, please?   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Great.  Thank you very much to

the Chair and the rest of the Board.  We're excited to talk 

about Rindge Commons here.   

          With me, I have a number of people that are part 

of the team.  I have Robert McArthur and Noah Sawyer as part 

of the Just-A-Start organization.  However, the only other 

person speaking, other than to respond to a question, is 

going to be Janice Mamayek, who is a Principal at Icon 

Architecture, and she's our Lead Architect on this project.   

          So rather than going through all the other names 

and everything else, I will call them out and introduce them 

if they need to respond to a specific question.  And from 

here, I'll hop into the project and the presentation, and 

discuss what we're trying to -- what we're trying to do. 

          One thing I'd like to spend just a second on is an 

introduction to Just-A-Start.    

          I know we've been referenced in the previous 

meeting, but maybe not everybody who's participating and 

watching from home knows who we are, but we're a non-profit.   

          We've been in Cambridge for 52 years at this 

point, and our mission is to promote equity by creating 

access to stable housing and building pathways to economic 

opportunity.  We do this through really three areas within

our organization.   

          One is, obviously the real estate branch of the 

organization -- that's what we're talking about here in some 

regards, and to a large extent -- but we also do that 

through an education and training program, which is another 

key factor as to why we're doing what we're doing here at 

Rindge Commons.   

          So we provide access to certificate programs for 

low-income individuals to gain better employment as well as 

a youth-build program to facilitate high school equivalency 

and job skills for at-risk youth. 

          We also have a Housing Resources group that helps 

with preventing homelessness by mediating issues between 

tenants and landlords, and as well as providing services to 

our residents. 

          You know, as you see in this picture, there's the 

two new buildings, but there's also the Tower.  We, you 

know, in looking to add the units here and looking to 

develop what we develop, it's -- we can't forget that this 

is already the home to 273 units of housing, 650 people.  A 

couple of the folks that spoke earlier mentioned how vibrant 

a community it is.  And, you know, we really want to 

151

maintain that and we want to enhance it.   

          And so, we've done, you know, several things 

throughout this process, including multiple community 

meetings, multiple meetings with our residents, taking into 

account what was said, and trying to adapt the design to fit 

and, you know, work with the community that's there. 

          Obviously, construction on the site exists, with 

people living there as an inconvenience, but we understand 

that, and we do what we can, and we'll do everything that we 

can to mitigate that impact on the residents there, while 

we're going through this process. 

          As I mentioned, we did do a bunch of community 

meetings.  We actually spent more than a year talking to the 

public at various points in times, as well as city officials 

and the like.  So given our mission and the site, you know, 

what are we trying to accomplish?   

          And the general concept here is to put two new 

buildings on the 402 Rindge Site.  And one of the key things 

that our residents have said is that they want to maintain 

as much parking as possible. 

          This is a balancing act that, as owners of the 

property and, you know, the -- you know, being in charge of

these people's homes, you know, and housing and their 

environment we want to respect, but we also have the mission 

to create affordable housing and provide ourselves with an 

opportunity to, you know, stabilize our expenses to be able 

to continue offering our education and training programs 

well into the future. 

          So, you know, we have a little bit of balancing to 

do between those kinds of goals.  And we're trying to strike 

the best balance that we can as part of the process.  And 

what results is two-phased project.  The first phase is the 

building that's right up on the corner of the Parkway and 

Rindge Avenue.  We call that Building A. And this is going 

to be a mixed-use building.  It'll house Just-A-Start's 

education and training programs.   

          And this is a key thing for us because right now, 

a lot of the space that we use for that program is leased.  

And as you're all probably aware, the lease rates in 

Cambridge continue to go up, and this is a way for us to own 

our own space, and make sure that we're able to control 

those long into the future. 

          This will also be the place where -- as Marc 

McGovern had mentioned -- Councillor McGovern -- that the

city's Pre-K programs will go into this space.  So we are 

looking for classrooms in the space.  We've been in 

discussions with running that program, and are proceeding 

along those lines.  We will have 24 units of housing on the 

upper floors, and then there will be some extra community 

space.   

          And our goal there is to provide that at 

reasonable rents to other service-oriented providers -- 

other providers that will give benefit to the community at 

large and to Cambridge.  It is not our intent to just lease 

that as, you know, a law office or something along those 

lines, unless of course it's a law office that caters to 

low-income individuals at reduced rates.   

          The second phase is a larger building.  It's 

towards the back of the lot, closer to the railroad tracks.  

It's 77 units of housing.  This is where the larger three 

bedroom units are going to occur, as well as more amenities 

for the existing residents. 

          Next page?  Thank you. 

          So the existing site -- you're all pretty familiar 

with it -- it's, it has some issues, mainly based on when it 

was developed original.  There's not a lot of shading on the

site.  There's a lack of kind of connectivity to the 

neighborhood, which is one of those design concepts as part 

of Envision Cambridge and the Alewife Plan that is looking 

to be addressed.   

          We have basically a very large heat island.  You 

know, but beyond the Tower, which has a light roof, which is 

great, it's mostly a parking lot.  Actually, it's over 90 

percent parking lot, with very dark pavement. 

          And so, it's really unfortunate in that sense is 

that it really does create a heat island in connection with 

the other tower, in connection with Fresh Pond Mall.  That 

area really does kind of just capture everything going on 

there. 

          And based on when it was developed, it really does 

incentivize other use.  And, you know, we can't just jump 

forward and say that it shouldn't have any anymore, but at 

the same time, we do want to start moving towards a more 

carbon-neutral impact on our properties. 

          So if we take those concepts, and then look at the 

challenges of the site, we really want to find a way to 

enhance the site and, you know, accomplish our mission and 

still provide a place that the vibrant community that exists

can continue to grow and thrive.   

          You know, one of the things that we did is we made 

sure that the buildings don't obstruct any of the site lines 

of the existing tower.   

          So right now, the thin parts of the building don't 

have any windows; those are basically just stairwells and 

sides of units.  So the buildings -- you know, the windows 

face to the west and to the east.  So we structured the 

building so that they don't block anybody's view.   

          We also made sure that, you know, as we continue 

to look at this site, that we offer things in the traffic 

demand management that help -- again -- move us towards that 

goal of not having as many cars on the site, and the more 

carbon neutral environment, but also giving our residents 

more options on other ways to commute and travel throughout 

the city.   

          We also took into account the site cooling, and 

the environment thatâ€™s created from the heat island and 

wanting to address that.   

          And last but not least, as we'll go through some 

of these other things, another key area that we wanted to 

address was stormwater management.  The site does have a 

156

portion of it that falls into a flood zone, and -- you know, 

right now the site doesn't have any capacity for stormwater 

management.  And adding that to the site really does provide 

a more resilient and livable area. 

          So, as I mentioned before, most all of you know 

where the towers are.  But the Tower itself is kind of a key 

piece, and as we are trying to think of what to call our 

project, it really became clear that it was a common point, 

a common focus, of the Alewife area.   

          We have those lower density triple deckers to the 

west, we have the new development that's going on in the 

Quadrangle and the triangle -- much denser housing, as well 

as commercial development.  We have the shopping areas to 

the south, which is walkable.   I know the trip over that 

bridge is not always pleasant, but it is walkable. 

          And then we do actually have a quite extensive 

amount of open space and parks, and that is accessible from 

this site as well.   

          Next page?   

          It's also extremely well-situated from a 

transportation way of going about things.  There's ways to 

access Cambridge, Boston through the Red Line and the 83

bus.  There's buses from Alewife Station that take you west 

to the 128 tech loop.  There's bike paths that exist -- 

Bluebikes stations that exist.  And one of the areas that 

we're enhancing this is to put a Bluebikes station at the 

site, or on the site itself.   

          Next slide?   

          So as we went through this development process, 

there was a component where we were going to lose parking 

spaces.   

          And, you know, hearing what our residents said, 

understanding what cars mean to people -- you know, we 

wanted to minimize that, yet still have -- do what we can to 

make sure that the fact that we don't have a one-to-one 

parking ratio at the end of the day would be mitigated with 

other things that we're doing to make sure that bicycle use, 

public transportation use and understanding what other 

options are there and educating our residents on, give them 

a chance to move away from a single-occupancy vehicle. 

          Next slide?  Great.   

          I mentioned earlier that one of the challenges we 

wanted to make sure we were addressing is in regards to 

climate change and cooling strategies on the site.  You

know, the existing tower does have a white roof.  But beyond 

that, the site is not particularly great in terms of heat 

island like or cooling or providing an environment for our 

residents in the open space that we have, to be 

exceptionally enjoyable. 

          With the addition of the two new buildings, we're 

taking more of that blacktop and turning it into white 

roofs.  Both of the buildings will have a component of the 

roofs that are green roofs as well. 

          And then the tree canopy, while we are going to 

take down some trees as part of the development process, we 

will be planting more trees, and we'll be planting more 

trees in a pattern that provides a more even and consistent 

shading across the entire site, but to provide a greater 

benefit.   

now.   

          Ultimately, the trees that we plant, and the 

additional trees that will be on the site at the end of the 

day, will provide a greater canopy coverage than what exists 

          In addition to that, there will be some shading 

associated with the buildings, further cooling the area and 

giving the residents some expanded open space and some ways

to enjoy it much more than they can now.  

          And next slide?   

          You know, the resiliency side:  I mentioned we are 

in a flood zone.  I mentioned that back when this was 

created on the left, the existing situation, there is no 

capacity for stormwater management.  So we will be adding 

that.   

          We are going to be doing things as well that 

really focus on making sure that we do our part, as we 

develop and redevelop this site, and take that at -- you 

know, take an existing site that didn't even consider 

stormwater management when it was developed 50 years ago and 

improve it. 

          So we'll be doing stormwater retention.  We'll be 

doing phosphorous mitigation.  We're going to be putting 

solar on these roofs to help with reducing that carbon 

impact.  And then, again, the tree canopy, the permeable 

open space.  We're actually increasing our open space on the 

site from 10 percent to 13.3 percent.   

          So we're giving the residents more space that they 

can provide (sic) and enjoy the outdoors, and increasing the 

amount of permeable space that the stormwater can actually

be recaptured and brought into the ground on its own, rather 

than being forced into municipal systems.    

          So those are kind of the goals that we are trying 

to hit.  You know, as we went through this process, we 

wanted to make sure that we took into account the site and 

we did what we could to further our mission, be good 

stewards of the property, be good landlords to our existing 

residents.  

          And, you know, we think with this ultimate design 

that we've worked on with Planning staff a great deal -- 

actually we've been working with Planning staff -- I think 

the first time we presented something to Planning staff was 

December of 2018, so it's been a while and it's come a long 

way.  And so, we're pretty happy with the. 

          And at this point I want to hand the presentation 

over to Janice Mamayek from Icon Architecture, so she can 

actually walk you through what these buildings look like and 

how we got to where we are and how they accomplish our 

goals.   

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  Great, great.  Thank you, Craig. 

Am I -- there we go.  Can you hear me?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, we can.     

161

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  Awesome, thank you.  Exciting 

day.  Yeah.  So we want to walk through the proposed design 

that was developed in response to those planning principles, 

as well as one that supports that existing community, that 

diverse community at 402, while also striving connected to 

the greater context. 

          So yes, next slide. 

          So this view is the current view of the site, 

rendering of the site, somewhat truncated of the tower 

there.   

          But it shows that the tower is looming over that 

open asphalt, to that somewhat exposed, horizon plane -- 

very uninviting, lacking that transition of scale of that 

tall, vertical element and the horizontality, lacking 

shelter from views and the exterior elements. 

          Again, no indication of the social community and 

core that's living there. 

          The Parkway address you can see to the right is 

somewhat tight, as it approaches the intersection at Rindge, 

and somewhat difficult to maneuver, whether you're on foot, 

a bike or even a vehicle.  And it feels more like a highway 

than a neighborhood.

162

          [Next slide?]  

          So this is that same view with our proposed 

design, that really engages the edge.  It shows the two 

buildings as infill on the site at each end in the 

foreground, our building A, that sits at Rindge Ave.  And in 

the background is the building B, both of them wrapping the 

tower with the new unified palate of color and materials, 

lighting and planting that will really tie that whole site 

together. 

          You could see that the massing of the site steps 

down from the 23-story tower to the seven-story building at 

the rear, and then Building A at the front goes from 6 to 5 

to 4 as it turns the corner at Rindge, and then down to the 

lower residential scale of the adjacent condos and beyond.  

This somewhat sets the context or backdrop to the Parkway, 

becoming much more inviting at a pedestrian scale.   

          Looking at the building then, you can see more of 

the varied scale at the streetscape entries into the common 

space and residential area, and much more transparency at 

that ground floor.   

          [Next slide?]  

          So looking at the Alewife Brook Parkway elevation,

22

this presents as a much larger civic-focused faÃ§ade.  The 

site sets lower as it goes down from the Parkway itself.  So 

it somewhat is minimizing the height to the right.  Again, 

you can see the stepping of the six stories down to six and 

four -- the green roof that was mentioned previously visible 

at those levels as well. 

          You can see in the middle their entry to the 

residential component, and then as we start to turn the 

corner, more of that glazed opening.   

          So next slide?   

          We're turning the corner, then, to the Rindge Ave 

elevation; much more neighborhoodlike in its scale, 

presenting with the four stories to the left, five stories 

beyond.  Again, focus on that commercial entry right where 

the Rindge common signage is.   

          The pedestrian zone is articulated at that ground 

level with the green panels.  A much wider sidewalk is 

created by the building setback that we've developed, 

allowing much more accessible, because we've raised the 

finished floor elevation of that first floor above the flood 

plain. 

          We've also -- that also allows us to introduce 

more planting at this level, and still allow the greater mm 

of pedestrian, which is currently a pretty tight, congested 

164

situation.   

          Next slide?   

          This is now as if you went -- continued down 

Rindge to our entry dive and went into the site, and then 

turned around to look back at Building A. Again, you see the 

continuity of the pedestrian zone articulated in the green 

panels.  You can see an entry in that inner knuckle, the 

through lobby of the commercial and the residential off to 

the left, sharing that core.   

          You can see the massing again stepping down the 

bar of the residential components above articulated in the 

darker grey colors. 

          Next slide?   

          So just looking at the floor plan a bit.  Again, 

this is the mixed-use building of the two.  The lower floors 

are primarily the commercial space.  The slide here 

indicates the Just-A-Start education and training components 

in the blue.  The Pre-Kindergarten area is in the pink; the 

yellow, the through lobby from Rindge going through towards 

that inner knuckle; and the orange being the residential

lobby.  

end of the L. 

          And then you can see bike parking off to the left 

          If we go to the next slide?   

          The second floor will continue some of that Pre-K 

and more of Just-A-Start education and training -- again, 

that shared lobby in the yellow going up.    

          Next slide? 

          Third floor will be fully Just-A-Start's education 

and training program.  

          And then next slide. 

          At the fourth floor is when we switch over to both 

a commercial tenant -- to be determined, as Craig mentioned 

-- serving at some other service-oriented organization, and 

then starting with the orange being the residential units. 

          This is primarily ones and twos.  The mixed-use 

buildings typically work better with those smaller units.   

          All right, next slide?   

          And then the upper floors, the fifth and sixth, 

are more of those 24 residential units, with you can see on 

the sixth floor towards Rindge Ave the setback for that 

patio and green space.

          All right, next slide. 

          We're going to transition now to the building B, 

towards the rear of the site.  Again, this is looking at the 

current condition, the imposing -- the view of the three 

towers there in the distance, and not really connected at 

all to the street -- again, reinforcing that highway feeling 

and no context.   

          So if we go to the next slide. 

          This view integrates the view of our proposed 

building -- the seven-story that isn't really perceived in 

that level, because -- again, the site is slipping off.  But 

it's using the same colors and materiality for tying the two 

buildings together.  The focus is away from those towers and 

much more drawn to the foreground. 

          Then let's go to the next slide. 

          Now we have gone down the Parkway to the corner.  

We've turned around and we're entering into our site.  We've 

gone past Building A on the right.  The Tower is that 

somewhat fuzzy area to the left, and we're focusing on the 

entrance to Building B.   

          This pedestrian focus is really focused on the 

entry of this building in that two-story; again, articulated

with the green panels, that pedestrian zone.  That is 

entering into a two-story lobby that then brings you up to 

the upper levels of amenity areas and residential space. 

          To the right off the parking, you see a two-story 

opening that allows that drive-through through the site for 

both school buses and fire apparatus, to make that complete 

loop and continue on through the site. 

          On the left, along the pedestrian way, you see the 

Bluebikes station that we are introducing to the site and 

get a sense of the play comings that are to come, and we'll 

look at those in the next slide. 

          Next?  Yeah, there we go.  So we walked a little 

bit further down that pedestrian path, and we viewed to the 

left what we are describing as our play commons.  It is that 

existing top lot that will be reconfigured.   

          We are able to enlarge that area, and make it a 

real social center for the community, connecting the tower 

and its residents to both of the buildings; particularly 

this one building B, being where the larger family units 

will be. 

          You can also see at the second floor a raised deck 

which overlooks that play area, adding to the additional 

168

22

open space that we are offering on this site, and also 

providing that opportunity for supervising children at play 

or other adult kind of respite area. 

          The parking is below.  Again, this building's 

footprint retains a large percentage of the existing parking 

that sits below, and we are screening that with the play 

panels that can be seen, the kind of rectangles underneath 

the play deck. 

          So it's engaging some kind of interaction between 

the play area while providing screening. 

          Next slide?  We'll look at some of the plans.   

          So this is the ground floor.  Again, as I just 

mentioned, very little of this building is actually hitting 

the ground.  It's really just what needs to.   

          So we have in orange in the center there our entry 

lobby.  We've got some bike parking right off to the right 

of that, and the pink you can see.  But the large percentage 

of that is the existing parking that will remain. 

          You see the black dashed outline?  That is the 

footprint of the building above.  So if we go to the next 

slide?   

          This is the second floor.  You can see to the left 

169

the white area, that double height pass-through where that 

will remain open for the -- you know, cars, buses, fire 

trucks to get through and loop the site.  But you can see 

that the yellow being the elevator lobby right off of that 

open entry lobby.   

          We've got an open stair that invites the use of -- 

you know, just pedestrian access up there, before you get to 

more of the amenity spaces.   

          In the pink is articulating a common room that 

opens up onto the deck, the ever busy laundry area of family 

life, a computer lab, and to the far left the majority of 

the bike parking will be at that second-floor area. 

          But then you can see starting at this floor the 

one, two and three-bedroom residential units are shown in 

the orange.  As mentioned previously, we'll have 22 three-

bedroom units in this building, you know, which doesn't 

exist currently on the site.  The tower has none of these 

larger units. 

          Next slide? 

          So this is a representative plan of the third 

through seventh floor, which -- again, is strictly 

residential and it's one, two and three-bedroom units.

          And then next slide?   

          Finally, I just wanted to note that the design and 

construction of both of these buildings will be guided by 

the Passive House guidelines, and we will be seeking 

certification in that program.  You may be familiar with 

that.   

          The project that Peter Daly just mentioned -- the 

Concord Highlands, currently known as "Finch" -- is just 

opening now.  But that just got certified in that Passive 

House program.  It is highly dependent on high-performance 

building skin, so really tight building envelope, as well as 

a high consciousness on indoor air quality.   

          So while we talk about equity in universal design, 

it's really providing a conscious effort towards healthy 

living, as well as university design aspects through the 

site for accessibility play areas in all of the amenities. 

          And with that overview, I'm going to hand it back 

to Craig.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Thanks, Janice.  So this line 

represents kind of the Rindge Commons before and after, in 

terms of the various unit sizes, what exists now, what we're 

developing in Building A and Building B, and what ultimately 

171

12

13

22

will exist on the site.   

          As you can see now, Building A, as Janice 

mentioned, does not have any three-bedroom units, and we 

have a number of households that are underhoused, that use a 

larger unit, but we just don't have anything to offer them 

in the building.   

          And Building A will not actually provide those, 

either because of the mixed-use nature -- the idea of larger 

families being in a situation where they're interacting, 

although we do have separate elevators and lobby space.   

          But, you know, the potential for interaction with 

offices and businesses we felt was not ideal, and we're able 

to address the need for those three-bedroom units in 

Building B. 

          Ultimately at the end of the day, between two and 

three-bedroom units, 60 percent of the units in this 

building will be larger and family-sized units.   

          You know, I think the comments here in regard to 

what we're trying to accomplish is a lot.  You know, we have 

a community that we want to see thrive.  We want to be able 

to provide them with larger units.  We want to provide them 

with more open space.  We want to provide them with

22

additional bike options -- the Bluebikes station, the bike 

parking, the community space in the buildings.   

          I didn't mention it earlier, but our plan to -- on 

the operation of these buildings is that community space in 

one building is accessible by residents in all buildings.  

You know, there will be a key card system, so although the 

tower might not have a computer lab, Building B will.  

Residents of the tower in Building A will have access to 

that computer lab.   

          The bike parking is available for all of the 

residents.  What exists there now is 26 spaces of covered 

but unsecure parking -- bike parking.  You know, we're 

adding the Bluebikes station to mitigate.  As I think, one 

of the comments in the Overlay was, "It's hard to envision 

bike parking for a building in the site that didn't have it 

to begin with."   

          And adding the amount of bike parking we would 

have needed; the tower would have been extremely difficult.  

And a Bluebike station in our traffic demand management 

systems that we're implementing are trying to mitigate that. 

          So overall, we think this is a -- you know, a good 

balance and good use of the site.  We really do appreciate

22

the idea of what it can provide, and if we go to the next 

step, we'll kind of highlight some of those things that 

we're going to accomplish.   

          So first and foremost, with Just-A-Start being 

able to provide a space for our education and training 

programs, where we're in control of the space and our costs, 

we can control our own schedule as to when we hold classes, 

and how many classes we hold.    

          We're going to be able to have up to 84 or 

possibly more students graduate each year with a certificate 

in Biomedical Manufacturing or Information Technology help 

us.  This is roughly double what we can do now in our 

current facility. 

          We're also going to be able to have 45 kids go 

through our youth program and get a high school equivalency 

and job skills.  And this is, again, also -- you know, a 

significant increase over what we can do today.   

          We are having those 101 additional units of 

affordable housing, which I think we've all discussed a lot 

tonight of the critical need in Cambridge and the community 

in general, as well as the benefits that they provide people 

by having a safe and secure, affordable place to live.

22

          Beyond those, we're also doing what we can to be 

good stewards of the earth and the environment.  We're 

adding solar panels, we're adding more trees, we're 

providing mechanisms and incentives to move away from 

single-occupancy vehicles and get some of that carbon out of 

the air, either from reducing car trips or adding trees, 

adding open space, adding green roofs and the like to really 

bring that to fruition. 

          And then we're also adding amenities.  One of the 

things I skipped over, grudgingly -- I forgot about it 

earlier -- is that one of the things we're adding in 

Building A as a community space that is for the larger 

community.  It is not a community space just for our 

residents.   

          It will be something that would be of significant 

size that could be reserved to host meetings, to -- you 

know, have different functions that can be programmed.   If 

the city wanted to have a meeting at a remote site in that 

part of town for something that's going on there, it would 

be available for that.   

          So, you know, we're adding stuff that the 

community can use beyond just our residents, and something

          With that, I thank you and would be happy to hear 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  

We're actually going to hold questions for the moment.  

Though this is not a public hearing, the Board can take 

public comment.  Is there any objection from Board members 

to doing so at this time?             

          Okay, hearing no objections, any members of the 

public who may wish to speak should now click the button 

that says, "Raise hand."  If you're calling in by phone, you 

can raise your hand by pressing *9.   

          And while they're doing that, I'll note that as of 

5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had received written 

communications from 19 individuals, which have been reviewed 

and will be entered into the case file.  And any additional 

written communications received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday 

will also be entered into the case file. 

          So I see we have some hands.  I'll now ask staff 

to unmute the speakers one at a time.  You should begin by

saying your name and address, and then staff will confirm 

that we can hear you, and after that you'll have up to three 

minutes to speak before I ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I'll do this the same way I did 

it the last time.  I'll read two speakers.  You can just go 

ahead and give your name and address and proceed to give 

your comments for efficiency.  And if it's a few seconds and 

I don't hear you; I'll prompt you to unmute. 

          So the first name is James Zall, followed by Linda 

Vick.  You can start, James Zall.   

          JAMES ZALL:  I'm James Zall of 203 Pemberton 

Street in North Cambridge.  And I'm speaking in favor of the 

Just-A-Start proposal for 402 Rindge.   

          As you've heard over and over again, Cambridge 

badly needs more affordable housing.  This project is 

proposed by a community foundation with an exemplary track 

record.  It's been reviewed and recommended by several city 

departments, and it includes changes on the site that move 

it in the direction that's more compatible with current city 

policies. 

          I'd also want to note that many of the Cambridge 

residents who have come out to city meetings over the last 

177

year to oppose the zoning changes that are in the Affordable 

Housing Overlay have often insisted that new affordable 

housing be limited to areas that are on or near major 

corridors, that are near public transportation, and they've 

expressed concern that new affordable housing would be very 

tall and would overshadow existing buildings. 

          This project even checks off all of those boxes.  

So I would urge that it be sent onto the BZA with a 

favorable recommendation.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Linda Vick, 

followed by Theresa Sullivan.   

          LINDA VICK:  Can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

          LINDA VICK:  My name is Linda Vick.  I am a 

current resident of 402 Rindge Ave.  I am in favor of the 

units, but there are some concerns with me and a bunch of 

residents that live here.  One is the traffic getting out of 

the complex.   

          As it stands right now on a 7:00 a.m., it could 

take us 20 minutes just to get to the end of Rindge Ave.  

People literally get out of their car and fight, because we 

have to cut people off to get out of the building.  So that

is a huge concern.  And probably people who live around here 

know how long it takes to get off of Rindge Avenue.   

          Another one is he said that they want people to 

move away from owning vehicles, but what are you going to do 

for people who have current payments that currently own two 

vehicles that currently live here?  Do you expect them to 

give them up and get repod?  You can't give the car back. 

          So in the side streets, this is already, there's 

not enough parking for everyone, including the residents 

that already live ones side streets.   

          So I don't know how they plan on mitigating the 

fact that most people here still own two cars currently, and 

what are they going to do with these vehicles?  There's 

nowhere to put them.  The parking garage you have to pay 

for, so I think they need to take that more into 

consideration, because most people here do have two 

vehicles. 

          As for the playground, I'm all for it.  But I 

think with the additional 101 units, adding a three bedroom, 

it's going to be overcrowded.  Maybe there should be an 

option to put a second playground for the tower and for that 

unit itself.  I don't know if they're taking away the

current playground.   

          Also putting in a fence around the playground, 

because with all these additional children coming, it's 

going to be very hard to run around, keep track of all the 

kids, especially there's a few kids here with disabilities, 

-- including mine -- that, you know, I'd be worried about.  

Thatâ€™s another concern with people living here. 

          Also the other concern I think is the sewer 

drainage.  Currently in 402 Rindge Ave, there is a nasty 

smell coming out of the lobby, and we believe it's the pipes 

under the ground, which from what I understand, they're 

refusing to fix.  

          And we'd like to get that fixed before they put 

more units, because it's just going to get worse.  So I 

don't think that that should be looked at before additional 

units are put on the ground, where it's already not working 

functionally. 

          Other than that, I support the units.  We need it.  

But I think those concerns should be addressed first.   

          JOSEPH OKPAKU:  The next speaker is Theresa 

Sullivan, followed by Mike Nakagawa.

Sullivan, 6 Acorn Street, and I'd like to speak in support 

of Rindge Common.  I am proud to have been born and raised 

in Cambridge, and I'm grateful to still be here.  And I'd 

like more people to be able to have that experience too. 

          We need projects like Rindge Commons to help make 

housing and education available to more people.  I remember 

what Alewife was like 20 years ago, and so when I'm in the 

area today, I notice all of the market-rate apartments and 

the lab and office campuses that have sprung up.  It's 

smart, and it's fair to also move affordable apartments 

forward, as well as the training that unlocks quality jobs 

here for residents. 

          I think this type of project represents the future 

of Cambridge.  We can build high-quality housing that people 

with a range of incomes can access, combined with community 

services.  We can take a huge parking lot and transform it 

into a transit-oriented place for people to live.  We can 

prioritize people's basic needs, and not lose sight of that 

as we chase innovation.   

          I think the future of Cambridge is really the 

commitment to put people first, to accept and embrace that 

city's change, and we can decide to be out front changing

for the better. 

          In this case, we have the ability to make a real 

difference for real people.  We can't just talk housing 

policy or the opportunity gap, we have to actually take 

action to permit and build space for people to thrive in our 

city.  Thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Mike Nakagawa, 

followed by Heather Hoffman.  

          MIKE NAKAGAWA:  Hi.  This is Mike Nakagawa, from 

51 Madison Avenue.  People know me from being on the 

Cambridge Climate Change Preparedness and Resiliency 

Planning Alewife Focus Group and part of the Climate 

Resilient Zoning Task Force.  I have an interest in climate 

and environmental equity.   

          A lot of the parts of this project are -- I like 

seeing that although it's 40B, they going to look at some of 

the flooding issues of the 20/70 level which I find 

encouraging, and going towards the Passive House, and using 

air-source heat pumps for heating. 

          Instead of natural gas, I would encourage them to 

change away from hot water natural gas and make preheat with 

solar to allow on demand tankless.

          But my -- two comments.  One is Alewife is not 

that great of a transit center.  Although it is close by, it 

is the end of the line.  It only has buses outbound.  The 

Red Line is the only way in, except for limited-use bus at 

Russell Field.  So it doesn't quite -- and the Red Line gets 

backed up a lot, so it's not that great.  But it is 

something.   

          My main concern is with the urban heat island efts 

of the tall buildings, which can't be shielded by trees 

because of the -- not only the towers, obviously, but even 

the other buildings are tall enough that you can't shade the 

thermal mass of absorbing all that heat with trees, because 

they are too tall. 

          I would also note that the trees that they are 

planting are on the north and east sides, which are not 

going to do much for shielding the heat.  There's almost 

nothing on the west sides to help shield the buildings from 

the sun.   

          And I would maybe suggest being this limited area, 

that maybe you could put like a carport over the on-grade 

parking, a covering, so that add some shading, that it could 

have solar or green roofing, so the towers could look down

on something a little nicer than parking area, and have a 

benefit.  So there's a green roof and it would look a little 

better and be an improvement for the climate.   

          I just would like to note that the building on 

Rindge is imposing on the sidewalk.  It's very tall, 

overhanging the sidewalk.  I'm concerned about that.  The 

trees on the north side don't grow off.  You look at 30 

Cambridge Park Drive, you can see what happens.   

          I'm concerned about 100 percent affordable in 

general as lacking Empowerment with the tenants.  They don't 

have some groups to really support them from their tenant 

group.   

          But overall, I think it's -- with some tweaks, 

this could be made into something good, but it's a lot of 

density where there is maybe a lot of density.  We're the 

fourth largest -- densest city in the country, over 100,000 

people. So just concerned about climate justice, and thank 

you for considering.  Thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Heather 

Hoffman, followed by M.K. Greenidge.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello.  Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  I wanted to talk about trees again.  I think

that -- well, I was sad to hear that you're planning on 

taking down some trees that are already there.  I've pointed 

out many times that trees transplant well, and I hope that 

you will consider that.   

          Cutting down trees is something that we should 

never consider the first choice.  And I hope that you will 

also take every opportunity you have for landscaping, not 

just for trees but for flowers and other things to make this 

a pleasant place to be. 

          And I also felt the need to respond to some 

comments made earlier about housing and how people in 

various parts of the city do or don't support it.   

          And I will point out that in my neighborhood, we 

have repeatedly called for more housing.  The Planning 

Board, the City Council and the city administration keep 

telling us, no, we can't have that, we must have more and 

more and more millions of square feet of commercial 

development.  So I'm glad to see that somewhere you're happy 

to have housing. 

          I hope that you will make these the very best 

units that you can, so that they will be good homes for 

people to live in for many, many years, and that you will do

something about that smell.  That sounded awful.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is M.K. Greenidge, 

followed by James Williamson.  M.K.  Greenidge, you may need 

to unmute yourself to begin.     

          M.K. GREENIDGE: Yes, thank you.  Can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.     

          M.K. GREENIDGE: Yes, hi.  My name is Myniece 

Greenidge.  I reside at 402 Rindge Avenue.  I'd like to just 

say that as a resident -- a lifelong resident of Cambridge -

- I am encouraged by the City of Cambridge and Just-A-Start 

that they have a commitment to developing additional 

affordable housing.  I expect that we should evolve as a 

city.   

          And I expect that when we see all of the 

commercial development and all of the high-income luxury 

housing that for every one that we see go up, we should also 

see an equal amount go up for affordable housing.  So I 

support this project. 

          My concerns that I have -- and I will also 

piggyback off of former speaker Linda Vick -- I do have 

concerns about parking.  Me as a resident, I -- currently I 

got rid of my vehicle.  However, I will need one in the

coming months, because my job is moving 50 miles away.  And 

so, I will need to add to the population of vehicle owners.  

          This is something that troubles me, because 

although I don't want to add to being a vehicle owner, I 

must.  And my concern is will there be room for me?   

          My other concern is regarding the dumping site on 

the other side of the train tracks or the fence.  The smell 

that comes from that site, even as you walk across the 

bridge, is just unbearable.  I could not imagine living in 

Building B and facing and having to deal with that smell for 

the water dumping site. 

safe. 

          And I am also concerned that it's definitely not 

          In terms of everything else, I mean I fully 

support the first thing we are adding additional housing, 

and especially more two- and three-bedroom units.  I would 

just say that I would be very courteous and considerate of 

the fact that we do have also a need for additional 

amenities that are not currently available at the current 

property that I have not seen available or made available in 

the slides during the presentation. 

          So that is -- you know, I'm not taking up a lot of

time this evening, but that's a future discussion.  But 

overall, I do support the project.  And I thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is James 

Williamson.  I'm sorry, you moved on my screen.  James 

Williamson?   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  I moved on your screen?  

[Laughter] I didn't do anything to your screen.  So can I 

start?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Okay.  First of all, you let 

Mr. Nicholson slide by without giving his home address, so 

I'd ask that for the record you insist that Mr. Nicholson 

give his home address, and if we're making reading 

recommendations, I would urge you all to read just about 

anything written by Adolf Reed, who's the Professor Emeritus 

of urban Politics and Political Science at UPenn, who might 

speak to things of interest. 

          At the earlier hearing, there was a map presented.  

There's just one spot in that map of the most dense areas of 

Cambridge.  There's this one spot that is the darkest of all 

of Cambridge, and that is the area where the towers are.  

This is the most dense area in all of Cambridge. And JHS,

because they own the land, want to put more stuff there and 

make it even more dense. 

          I think that's unfair.  There's a lot of talk 

about equity tonight.  There's a lot of talk about sort of 

discrimination against people of color.  What could be more 

inequitable than dumping, cramming even more density and 

it's not just housing -- onto people who already live in the 

most dense, uniquely most dense part of Cambridge?  I think 

that's -- you know, a pretty, let's say hypocritical.   

          For the last four months -- and we hear people 

talking about, well, you know, Susan Schlesinger earlier 

talked about not in -- you know, this is affordable housing 

-- not in crowded conditions.  This is the most crowded 

conditions in all of Cambridge.   

          For the last four months, during the four and a 

half months, I've been going right across the area.  I don't 

know how many of you looked at the pictures, I took numerous 

pictures.  I showed that dumping area.  I hope you took a 

look at that.  It's there and what I contribute, if you want 

to take a look and see what it actually looks.  You won't be 

able to tell what it smells like. 

          But, you know, it's parking.  It's empty, because

people are parking across the state in Comeau Field.  But 

nevertheless, it is a kind of open space at that busy, 

dangerous corner next to basically a highway.  And the 

trees, which were shown in their rendering as, like, 

saplings, are actually mature trees that are going to get 

cut down.  I kind of get sick of the dishonest renderings 

that are put forward. 

          But I think there's something nice about that 

existing open space, green space, and the trees that are 

currently there.  And thatâ€™s not really replaceable, 

although there are going to be saplings in other parts of 

the project. 

          As for parking, I mentioned the first thing the 

parking across the street is full every night.  Where do 

people think they're -- that's not included in their traffic 

study.  What about transportation?  I actually take that 

transportation.  For the 13 years that I've lived out there, 

I've tried to get people to do something about the 83 bus.  

Nothing, it merely tips over when it goes onto Rindge Ave. 

          What about shuttle service to Fresh Pond Mall, so 

people can shop?  Nothing's been done about that, and I 

predict nothing will be done about that.  What about the

unsafe crossing of Alewife Brook Parkway to get to this 

fantasy of wonderful public transit that is also not going 

to actually serve people for years to come if we're lucky 

eventually, if we live that long?  That's an extremely 

unsafe pedestrian crossing.  The cars rip around the corner 

from Alewife Brook Parkway onto Rindge Ave.  This is going 

to be commercial space.   

          They said there was going to be Urgent Care for 

people who have money and nice insurance.  Is it -- have 

they given up the idea of having an Urgent Care piece of the 

part that was unnamed?  There's -- you know, you can't get 

it all into three minutes, I'm sorry. 

          I appreciate what some of the people who live 

there have said.  I was really struck by some of their 

contributions.  If you want to listen to the people who live 

in 402, why not -- instead of debating who gets heard and 

who shows up, why don't you do a survey?   

          Why don't you require that JAS do a survey where 

everybody in that build has an opportunity to speak to 

important, relevant topics.  Then we don't have to debate 

who shows up, who doesn't show up, why they don't show up.  

There will be an objective survey, but then you can debate

who responded to the survey.   

          Finally, JAS:  They have a terrible track record 

in the management of some of their properties.  They may do 

all right in some respects for this property -- it's a 

different management company than the one that's -- to the 

property at the Close Building.   

          Talk to the people who live in the Close Building, 

and talk about, find out what the nightmare that they've 

been subjected to for -- I don't think it's over a year, and 

what -- how JAS managed the parking situation for people 

there, parking their own cars, telling people they couldn't 

call the tow truck company because JAS had their cars parked 

there.

am the Director of Education and Training at Just-A-Start, 

and I work at the 35 address.  I'm a resident of Hyde Park.  

But I appreciate the Planning Board's availability to, you 

know, for me to express my support for the Rindge Project.  

          But specifically about -- I want to speak about 

the value of the training programs.  I think that we spent 

quite a bit of time tonight talking about affordable housing 

and how that is such an important cornerstone to a family's 

ability to be stable. 

          But I think that I am pleased to hear that there 

were so many of our current students were able to submit 

written comments about the impact that these programs have 

in regard to creating pathways to economic mobility.  It's -

- you know, we're talking about a comprehensive issue. 

          And, you know, I think that it was mentioned 

before the current location that we occupy in these programs 

is really not -- doesn't honor the vision of what these 

spaces should be.   

          And, you know, we're grateful that we're able to 

offer them in the city of Cambridge, but I think just 

highlighting that this new space really opens up opportunity 

for us to deepen and broaden our impact and think about

innovation and not being at the sort of -- you know, in 

regards to our biomedical career program the availability of 

lab space is really important. 

          So consolidating this into a single building would 

really be incredibly impactful for our students in making 

this more broadly available.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And the next speaker is Nancy 

Porcaro.   

          NANCY PORCARCO:  Hi.  Excuse me, can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.    

          NANCY PORCARCO:  My name is Nancy Porcaro.  I'm 

the Community Coordinator for Rindge Commons.  I'm an 

Arlington resident.  But I can say I've been at the property 

for over six years, and I work with residents on a daily 

basis, and over the last six years, I've heard a very sort 

of pulling support for three bedroom apartments -- which 

people are outgrowing -- and two bedrooms, for families. 

          The second thing is there's a lot of residents 

that would like to participate in the IT or the biomedical 

program, but it's across town.  It's very inconvenient.  

It's difficult for them to geographically deal with that.  

So having training on site would be a huge opportunity for

multiple residents to move forward and sort of break out of 

where they are in their career and move towards something 

that's more lucrative and more satisfying. 

And the third thing I'd like to say is we have so 

many families with so many children and so many young 

families beginning to have children, that I think the Pre-K 

would be nothing short of a miracle for our residents.   

I know a lot of them sent letters in.  Some of 

them I think dropped off the radar here because of the time 

frame.  But I can say -- and this is not coming from just a 

JAS employee, but from someone who really sits with the 

residents and talks with them about various issues -- and I 

can honestly say that a great deal of them are excited about 

the expansion.   

be worked out.   

They do have concerns, such as parking.  I think 

that's probably their biggest concern.  And I know that will 

And I think that what we're presenting outweighs 

anything of a concern to a lot of residents.  And this would 

be ideal for so many of them.  And I hope this comes to 

fruition, and I can just only say that hopefully we'll get 

more residents on board to let you know how they feel.

JEFF ROBERTS:  And that appears to be the last 

speaker.  I'll turn it back over to the Chair.

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We will 

now move from public comment to Board discussion.  If the 

hearing is continued to a future date and additional 

information is received, there will be additional 

opportunity for public comment at the time. 

We have received memos on this application from 

Community Development and Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation Department staff who are available.  And we 

have also received a memo from the Department of Public 

Works.  Now I'll turn to Board members and ask if there are 

questions either for staff or the applicant at this time?

Tom?   

TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.  It's actually -- I don't 

know if this is for staff or the applicant, but, you know, 

if you look at the program breakdown -- and I appreciate the 

presentation, it was very clear, but program breakdown.  And 

I also appreciate the importance of the program elements 

that are not housing. 

Now, this is 40B, which is legislation that give 

special privileges if you're developing housing.  There's a

sizable percentage of the square footage in Building A which 

isn't housing, right?  It's offices, it's training, it's 

kindergarten.  And so, is that okay under a 40B application, 

or are we supposed to be considering affordable housing 

proposals?   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yeah, Tom, that's a great 

question.  You know, we looked at the this with our 

attorneys to make sure that this did follow the spirit of 

the 40B statute and, you know, the theory on the 40B is that 

the predominant use for the site is housing.   

          And when you take into account the existing Tower, 

because the application is against the whole site.  So you 

take into account, you know, the Tower.   

          And even amongst the two new buildings, you know, 

101 units of housing, all of Building B, plus the housing 

portion of Building A, it still does pass that predominantly 

housing-oriented focus of the bill.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  That's terrific, thank you.  

That assuages my concern.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions from 

Board members at this time?  Ted?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, one very minor question

first.  Do you own the other two towers?  And if not, who 

does own them?  And I guess has there been any discussion 

with those owners about trying to do a project that 

incorporates that property?     

CRAIG NICHOLSON:  We do not own that tower, or the 

other two towers.  That's owned by the Shock I.T.  

companies.  I believe they just did an agreement with the 

Affordable Housing Trust to preserve the affordability of 

those two towers.  We do not know of any of their plans of 

further development at this time.     

H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  And then another 

question is, I guess really for your architect:  Do you have 

a rendering of building B that will show the parking area 

and this drive-through?     

JANICE MAMAYEK:  The rendering that was shown in 

the presentation was the one -- I don't know, can we go back 

to the presentation?  But there was one slide that did 

illustrate that drive-through.   

Are you looking at it from a different angle?  I 

mean, the one that was presented was as you're coming down 

the drive to Building B.    

H THEODORE COHEN:  I can see in that was there was

an open area with some cars appearing to be parked in it.  I 

was wondering if you actually had rendering that shows it up 

close so that, you know, I would actually know what it looks 

like, and also, what you would see when you're on the 

Parkway.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yes.  That was page 24 of our 

presentation.  Yeah, that one.  Page 55, yeah.     

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  The one right before it?   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yeah.       

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  So in this slide, you can see the 

two-story opening.  There's a white car there that is 

driving down the lane.  It is the higher height for the 

buses and fire apparatus that can go through, but parking 

would be consistent on either side, much like it is now.  

You'd go kind of through the building and continue around 

the site.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm so -- there's a gray stripe 

across the bottom of the building.  What is that?  I mean, 

how is the car going through it?     

          JORDAN NOLLMAN:  The structure -- the piers just 

are showing that there's -- you know, that's essentially the 

depth of an adjacent parking, so that's the structure thatâ€™s

coming down.   

          So it's not like there's program space behind it.  

It's just the structure of the building above.  And there's 

green -- kind of like a green screen.  So that would provide 

some kind of screening to the parking and straight through, 

and ground that building a bit more.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  I still don't quite understand.  

But also, do you have a rendering from the other side, 

looking down from the Parkway, so you can see what that 

building is going to look like?     

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  Well, if you go back a few 

slides, that was the view from the bridge.  There we go.  

That's the back side.  So directly opposite that is where 

the top lodge, or the playground area is down that grade.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  But you don't have a 

rendering without the trees, so I can see what it looks 

like?     

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  Correct, we do not.  But that is 

open parking.  As it sits on the site, it's kind of 

straddling two different parking bays.  And so, in order for 

the drive lane to be open and cars to park, that is -- 

that's open parking.

H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  I mean, if we go beyond 

tonight, if this hearing gets continued, I would really like 

to see a rendering from that perspective of how the building 

is sitting over the parking.   

CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yeah, so I'll add onto that.  

You know, a couple of key things are -- first of all the 

sight line from the Parkway at that point is 20 to 30 feet 

above the parking lot.  So where the people that are at the 

-- on the sidewalk or in their cars are actually going to be 

looking at the second and third floor, not the ground floor 

where the parking is.   

And even beyond that, what we'll do is provide -- 

again -- some sort of green screen, so that it is not people 

looking at cars, it will be a screen.  We will probably 

mostly put, you know, vegetation on it -- again, not having 

kind of surface-level parking which exists there now being 

the primary focus of that elevation.     

JANICE MAMAYEK:  We do have elevations as part of 

the backup, if we want to look at it elevation.  It's not a 

rendering perspective view, but it is an elevation. 

Craig, do we have access to those?   

CRAIG NICHOLSON:  I do have backup slides, and I

do have that elevation.  If I'm able to share my screen I 

can pop it up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  You should be able to just push, 

"Share Screen" and share it.     

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  So that's the front elevation, 

the elevation that is facing the playground area with the -- 

this is the south.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yeah.  So this would be the -- 

the elevations are a little --    

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  Well, the building isn't 

orthogonal, it's kind of splayed.  So some of the shaded 

elevations are where you're seeing it at an angle.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yeah, I think the upper part of 

this one, if you can see my mouse kind of circling it, 

that's the part that hits the DCR land that would be 

directly facing the Parkway.  It's two stories tall, and you 

can see a screening on it.  That would ultimately have some 

vegetation attached to it to block that view, being the 

primary focus of just cars.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  I'm sorry, I'm not an 

architect.  So what is to the right on that elevation?  On 

the ground level?

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  It's also parking, but we have a 

row of parking behind that as well, before we hit the fence 

and the railroad tracks.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And maybe Tom or Hugh, can you 

explain it better to me?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  This is Tom, I'll try.  So if you 

look at the top elevation, marked, "West Elevation" what 

you're looking at from the elevated perspective, which was 

hidden by the trees, is a screen as I understand it, which 

would support vegetation to screen the pass-through, 

essentially.  But that's down the slope, right?  And it's at 

the base of the hill. 

          The emergency apparatus drive underneath the 

building and the parking that Craig was just describing it 

outside the structure, right?  It's between the building and 

the railway tracks.  Have I got that right?  Craig?   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yes.  And actually, this dotted 

line here, if you can see my mouse, is actually the 

elevation of the Parkway.     

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  I would also say on that west 

elevation what may be confusing is the shaded area that 

you're seeing is actually the south elevation.  And as

Janice was saying, it's not orthogonal.  It's not a 90-

degree turn, and that's why you see it there.  But it is 

turning to the south, if that helps understand that 

rendering.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So these emergency vehicles, 

can they drive straight through, or are they going in and 

then turning around and going out the way they came in?   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  No, they are able to drive 

straight through.     

          JANICE MAMAYEK:  We'll go back to the site plan.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  Yeah, I'm trying to get out of 

the presentation and get to -- so we'll use this one for -- 

so as they come through the site, first of all, we've moved 

the driveway down a little bit away from the Parkway to 

alleviate some of that congestion.   

          And as they come through, they'll be able to pass 

-- just like this arrow -- all the way through and 

underneath to this back row of parking -- and again, to make 

an entire roundtrip around the site and have access to all 

sides of all buildings for any fire safety needs.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other

questions for the applicant or for staff?  Mary?         

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, thank you, Catherine.  I'm just 

curious about the mix of units in the new projects.  It 

seems like on the chart that you showed, you know, there's a 

significant number of one and two bedrooms already in the 

towers.   

          And given the need for three-bedroom units, I know 

you're doing 22, but my question is, did you look at the 

feasibility of maybe doing al three bedrooms, or, you know, 

a mix of maybe just the two and the three?   

          Because I'm thinking the fewer units you have, you 

know, that's going to help with the parking and with the 

traffic situation.  And it would also meet the need that the 

city does have for more family-sized units.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  That's a great question, thank 

you very much.  You know, we generally try to structure our 

buildings in a way that are able to accommodate various 

levels of housing at various times in people's lives.  If 

one of the nuances of affordable housing is that you are -- 

we're kind of stuck within, --quote, unquote-- "the project, 

" which means the entity that builds it and runs it. And 

it's a financing thing, and it gets a little arcane.

          But, you know, we want to make sure that we can 

move people within the existing building that they live when 

their housing needs change. 

          So if they're in a two-bedroom and they need a 

three bedroom, and the goal is to have a three bedroom in 

that same building.  If they're in a three bedroom and their 

children grow up, we want to make sure that we have two-

bedroom and one-bedroom units so that they can go to the 

right size unit and open up that three-bedroom unit for a 

family that needs it.   

          If we were to put only three-bedroom units in 

Building B, then as soon as those kids left, you would have 

a couple or a single parent in a three bedroom unit, and we 

really wouldn't have an option of having them go somewhere 

else in their home to make room for another family. 

          So as we look at this, we look kind of more at the 

long-term on what the housing needs will be for families at 

all stages.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Hm.  Well, thank you for that 

explanation.  I didn't -- I hadn't thought of that.  I was 

looking at it as more like a complex, as opposed to thinking 

about someone thinking of that particular building as their

home.  Thank you for the explanation.   

          CRAIG NICHOLSON:  You're welcome.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Do any other Board 

members have questions for either staff or the applicant?  

No?  Okay, then we can move to Board discussion.  Let's see. 

Hugh, do you want to start us off this time?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Sure, I'm happy to.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  So this 

is a very geometrically complicated project, particularly on 

the site.  And it's pretty ingenious what they've managed to 

accomplish.   

          Maybe I should back up one step.  I looked at the 

Design Guidelines with the AHO while I was looking at this 

building, and one thing just leaped out at me, which was 

this building does not respect the existing context.   

          And when it does it says, "How can we fix the 

existing context? How can we get -- " you know, and I think 

it does a very good job of fixing the existing context.   

          So in a way that's an answer to the question I 

posed at the last hearing, which is when you're looking at 

guidelines, you have to look at guidelines with some level 

of intelligence.

          You know, the other thing that's really great 

about this is that they're adopting the Passive House 

standard for energy.  That's a very demanding standard, and 

it's -- you know, thoroughly out on the forefront.   

          But, as Mike Nakagawa said, "Well, if you're 

really looking down the road, even being forefront today, 

even being ahead of it may not be as good as it ought to 

be." I'm impressed. 

          There are four things that I wish were better.  I 

wish there was more space for more bikes.  I wish there were 

more trees in the parking lot, and then I find the charcoal 

gray and white and intermediate color scheme to be just too 

aggressive for my taste.  I'd like the charcoal gray to be, 

you know, a little lighter and warmer, the white to be a 

little off-white.   

          I think it's a lively elevation -- you know, 

facing other buildings that are really incredibly bizarre in 

the triangle.  You know, so it's trying to hold its own, I 

think.  But I could see a little -- what I like to see is 

that be involved with graphs reviewing materials and trying 

to pull it together a little bit. 

          The last piece is as an architect that has

designed or been involved with 9000 units of housing.  I 

wish there were more privacy at bedroom to bathroom access 

in all of the two and three-bedroom units.  Some are fine.  

Some you can move a door and get a little more privacy like 

in the three bedrooms.   

          But you have to imagine that kids will go to bed 

early, and to have their bedroom doors open right into the 

public areas I think it's not ideal.  But I think this is a 

very deserving project.  I think the -- you know, I think 

making it even better is going to be very difficult.  I just 

-- so those are my -- I would recommend that the Zoning 

Board grant all the relief necessary to make this happen.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary?  Do you 

want to go next?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.  I like the project.  I think it 

does -- not only does it provide space for much needed 

services and housing, but I think it really improves that 

corner almost beyond belief.   

          You know, it actually makes it start to feel like 

there's a neighborhood beyond that corner, and that it's not 

just a wasteland of parking. 

          So I'd like it.  I am concerned a little bit about 

209

the additional traffic on Rindge, because I've been hearing 

horror stories -- not just tonight, but previously from 

people in North Cambridge about how long it's taking to get 

down Rindge Avenue these days. 

          But, you know, I mean, there's not much we can do 

about that, unless the traffic changes the whole traffic 

pattern in the area, which isn't going to happen.  So I 

agree with Hugh.  I think, you know, more trees would be 

nice if we could get it to happen.  But all in all, I am 

very supportive.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Not too much.  Very similar 

remarks.  I'd like to see some more trees in the parking 

area.  Possibly you can reconfigure the parking and make 

some islands in there, some green space, even some 

stormwater retention. 

          And the white on the faÃ§ade seems like it really 

washes out.   I know there's some joining in it.  Hopefully 

the shadows will show it off better.  The drawings don't 

really show it too well.  But that's about it.  I think it's 

a great infill project.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Tom?

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, Ted was right to focus in 

on a particularly unusual portion of the design and try to 

understood it and given its situation at the bottom of that 

steep slope on the edge of highway.  Yes, it's strange to 

run the fire trucks underneath the building.  But I think 

it's a reasonable solution -- actually pretty clever in 

terms of the way it makes the site function.   

          But thank you, Ted, for picking that apart.  

Hugh's right on.  I think the elevations are graphic.  They 

appear graphic, but that may also be the level of where the 

proponent is in the design, and I'm confident that the 

elevations will evolve. 

          I agree with Hugh that they just seem a little too 

black and white or, you know, too contrast-y for my taste as 

well. 

          You know, the striving for a Passive House is 

amazing.  I just am sitting here thinking, "Okay, 40B I'm 

balancing planning concerns versus the need for affordable 

housing in this community, and what could I possibly hold 

this proponent's feet to the fire on relative to that.  

What's my concern with planning?   

          And actually all -- universally, the Planning

Board members thus far have said, "How about a few more 

trees?"  You've mentioned heat island as being a particular 

concern here.  You feel it every time you're in Alewife.  

And a few more trees, given the cost of this project 

probably is not an uneconomic ask.  Somebody else will have 

to make that judgment.   

          But I would also be a strong proponent to try to 

do something to shade the vast parking areas, if you 

possibly can.   

          And I agree with Mary.  You look at this like, 'Oh 

my God.  Could we really do this here?  This would be 

fantastic."  So in terms of suggesting a sense of normality 

at the point.  So thank you.  I'm in favor and I think we 

should encourage the Zoning Board to give the relief they 

need.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Steve, 

are you still with us?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.  Somehow or another, my 

video got locked out.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  But nevertheless, I just think 

this is a fundamentally good project.  I'm just thinking as

I'm looking at it, this one good project is probably going 

to make more affordable units than the zoning law that we 

and the entire city has devoted, you know, so much time and 

effort to.   

          But I don't know, time will tell on that.  This is 

a great project.  And, you know, details aside, which I will 

leave to the architects, this is a really great addition to 

affordable housing in general, but also to -- really a 

fundamentally unpleasant, unappealing site.   

          And this is going to really ameliorate some of the 

worst characters of that site, and certainly on the ground 

level to passersby and cars.  And otherwise, I mean this is 

really going to improve it aesthetically, as well as, you 

know, from the perspective of the affordable housing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Very good.  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.  So I like it a lot.  You 

know, I didn't have much to criticize about, so I was 

focusing on the drive-through and the parking.  But, you 

know, the '60s concept of a tower, and it's surrounded by 

parking, was not a great idea.  And this really improves 

that space and the whole entry to the city on the Parkway. 

So I think it's really a great improvement.

          Mary, I do live at the other end of Rindge Avenue, 

and traffic on it is terrible during rush hour.  But, you 

know, Traffic and Parking has told us many, many times that 

it's really caused by commuters passing through, and it's 

not so much an issue of the housing that's being built in 

Cambridge.  You know, you learn to live with it and to try 

to not travel at rush hour.  But I think it's a great 

project, that would it go forward.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Terrific.  I don't 

have a whole lot to add to what my colleagues have said.   

          And so, I think my sense here is that we are 

prepared to take action and probably move forward with a 

favorable recommendation to the BZA with the only comment I 

really heard was we would encourage them to look and see if 

there's more that can be done with either preserving or 

planting trees to mitigate heat island effect and provide a 

more welcoming and inviting landscape. 

          That's -- did I miss anything that Board members 

want to include in the recommendation?  Okay.  Then is there 

a motion the make such a recommendation?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So moved.  Ted Cohen, so moved.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louie Bacci, second.

                  Tom Sieniewicz  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  All 

right, Board members, we have one last agenda item, that 

hopefully is very, very fast here, before I let you go.  So 

the next item on the agenda is a request for an extension of 

time on case PB #336, 1065 Cambridge Street.  CDD staff will 

explain why this is before us.   

          Jeff, is that you, or is that Swaathi?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I was going to let Swaathi do this 

one, if she can.             

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Yes, I just can show that -- so 

I'm going to share my screen.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Can everybody see that?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Okay.  So this is Planning Board 

Case Number PB #336.  The address is 1043-1059 Cambridge

Street, and this project was a mixed-use project approved 

for ground-floor retail and 18 dwelling units and 13 off-

street parking spaces, which is about grade garage.   

          So the decision was issued on 09/11/18.  The 

applicant did have additional review with BZA approving a 

variance for side yard setback.  They also had some 

additional review with the Accessibility Board in terms of 

the units that they were proposing, to meet the 

Accessibility requirements.  They have cleared all that.   

          But with the timing and with the current 

situation, they are at a point where they are unsure about, 

you know, proceeding to the next stage, which is the -- you 

know, being able to file for the building permit in time, 

before the special permit expires. 

          Hence, they are seeking or requesting an extension 

of one year for the Planning Board's special permit.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Do Board 

members have any questions about the extension request?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right Is there a 

motion to grant the extension?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved, Steve.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I heard Steve 

move and Lou second.  Roll call vote?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Louis Bacci?
