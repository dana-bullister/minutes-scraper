To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge Municipal 
Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting a further revised Surveillance Technology Impact 
Report (STIR) to the City Council for review and discussion at the March 2, 2020 Council 
Meeting. This STIR responds to questions raised at the February 24, 2020 Council Meeting 
regarding the School Department’s use of video recording devices on school buses.   
 
I look forward to reviewing this report with you and answering any questions you may have.

Safety & Security, Transportation 

James Maloney

Bus video recorders on individual buses 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

 

•  Cameras are installed on all school buses, including buses for special education 

students, along with a posted notice that video & audio recording is taking place.  
 

•  The cameras on the school buses allow the school department to review any incidents 

that take place, after the event is over.  The cameras allow the department to 
determine the source of any behavioral issues on the bus, many of which take place 
out of the line of sight of the bus driver. 

• 

Images and audio are recorded to a box, and the images & audio are retrieved 
manually by the Transportation Director when investigating an incident.   

•  The number of incidents requiring investigation varies annually. Videos are used in 

approximately 30 to 60 investigations each year. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Supporting the safety of all students and staff on bus transportation by addressing 

disruptive behavior appropriately. 
 

•  Although some buses have adults who serve as bus monitors, not all buses have 

monitors and the monitors cannot observe every student or incident on a bus.  These 
cameras were originally deployed at the request of parents concerned about bullying 
incidents on buses.  These cameras provide footage of any behavioral issues that may 
occur on school buses.  The footage helps CPS staff and parents clarify what actually 
happened during an incident and supplements any report from a student or bus driver.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

•  All school buses have carried these on-board cameras since their original installation 

in FY13. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
•  The data from these cameras is over-recorded at monthly intervals (by actual usage).  
Without physically retrieving the imaging data from the bus, it is not accessible to 
anyone. 
 

•  For all students riding the buses their images and voices are recorded and saved to the 

device located on each bus.  

•  The recordings are secure and only accessed by the CPS Transportation Director in 
the event of an event investigation. At that time the recordings may be reviewed by 
select CPS Administrators. In some cases, parents can view the footage, but only of 
their child.  

•  Parents are notified in annual “About the Bus” notices that “Buses are equipped with 

audio and visual equipment.” Consent is not currently requested.  

 
•  All buses have a posted notice that video & audio recording is taking place. 

•  All data is overwritten every 30 days (depending on bus activity) unless it has been 

archived because of an active investigation.  Since investigated student issues may be 
considered part of the student record these videos are archived and purged according 
to student records retention requirements.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  The initial cost of the SEON camera system was $47,190 when it was installed in the 

•  There have been ongoing maintenance expenditures for moving equipment to newer 

buses and adding cameras as needed.

• 

It is not possible to determine the personnel costs of using this equipment.  The 
Transportation Director must board a bus after an incident and download the images 
in order to proceed with an investigation, but it is difficult to quantify the time 
involved. 
 

•  Both equipment and personnel were funded from the School Department General 

Fund.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
The School Department’s current contract for School Bus Transportation with Eastern Bus 
Company expires on August 31, 2020.  The Purchasing Department is putting this contract out to 
bid, and the School Department would like the Purchasing Department to award a contract to the 
successful bidder for a five (5) year term (September 1, 2020 to August 31, 2025).  Where this 
invitation for bid will follow public bidding laws, Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 30B 
requires a majority vote of the City Council authorizing the award of a contract for a duration 
longer than three (3) years. 
 
Having a five (5) year contract in place with a bus transportation company is relatively standard 
for many communities.  Additionally, a contract for this duration for this type of service allows 
for consistency in service and, in most cases, a better price. 
 
The bid specifications list audio/visual recording devices as an ordered alternate. These devices 
are subject to Council approval under the City’s surveillance ordinance. A Surveillance 
Technology Impact Report on the technology is before the Council tonight on Agenda Item 
Number 1.  Approval of the base contract without the audio/visual devices alternate may be 
made in the event the Council does not approve the use of this technology.  
 
I hereby request that the City Council authorize the Purchasing Agent to award a five (5) year 
contract to the successful bidder on the School Bus Transportation Bid.

comments though it did not take a formal vote.  
 
The Study Committee was appointed in August 2017 and met regularly through 
July 2019. The Committee’s recommendations focus on refinements to the goals 
and guidelines of the district and matters of jurisdiction. The report concludes with 
a proposed amendment to the Order establishing the district with revised goals, 
guidelines, and standards for review. The report also repeats the recommendation 
of the 2000 Committee that the Harvard Square Conservation District Goals and 
Guidelines be incorporated into the Harvard Square Overlay District.

Final Report of the 2017-19 Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee  

 

Summary 

The Cambridge Historical Commission voted in March 2017 to initiate a study of the Harvard 
Square Conservation District in response to concerns about the goals, jurisdiction, and administra-
tion of the district. During an extended series of hearings on projects at 5 Kennedy Street (the Ab-
bot Building) and 1-3 Brattle Street (&Pizza) many citizens expressed dissatisfaction with the scope 
of the District’s jurisdiction, the goals and guidelines for administration of the district (and their ap-
plication by the Commission), and stated a desire for identification of prominent or significant 
buildings in the district and stricter regulation of alterations to them. 

The City Manager appointed the Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee in August 
2017. The committee met monthly, with some interruptions, from October through June 2018 and 
from September 2018 through July 2019. Attendees, who included many interested parties and 
members of the public, discussed the events that led to the establishment of the district in 2000 and 
the district’s operations and effectiveness. Representatives of the Community Development Depart-
ment described zoning and sign regulations. Focusing on the Final Report of the Cambridge Histor-
ical Commission Regarding the Proposed Harvard Square Conservation District, the committee 
held detailed discussions about the goals, secondary goals, and guidelines of the District; the appli-
cation of those goals and guidelines to matters of demolition, new construction, and alterations. The 
evolving character of the subdistricts was also discussed. Participants discussed the relationship of 
conservation district regulations with the provisions of the zoning code and generally endorsed the 
provisions of a petition filed with the City Clerk on October 3, 2019 to amend Section 20.50 Har-
vard Square Overlay District and Harvard Square Historical Overlay District. Finally, on November 
20, 2019, the appointed members of the Study Committee voted unanimously to approve this pre-
liminary report and transmit it to the Planning board and the Historical Commission for review.  

The Study Committee’s recommendations focus on refinements to the goals and guidelines of the 
district and matters of jurisdiction. The report concludes with a proposed amendment to the Order 
establishing the Conservation District that contains revised goals, guidelines, and standards for re-
view (Appendix B, p.73). The extended discussion in the report is also meant to supplement the 
2000 Final Report as guidance for the Historical Commission in its administration of the District. 
The 2018-2019 Committee also repeats the recommendation of the 2000 Committee that the Har-
vard Square Conservation District Goals and Guidelines be incorporated into the Harvard Square 
Overlay District. 

The Cambridge Historical Commission held a public hearing to review the Preliminary Report of 
the 2017-19 Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee on December 5, 2019 and 
voted unanimously to support its recommendations. The Cambridge Planning Board reviewed the 
recommendations at its December 17, 2019 hearing.  

The Historical Commission recommends that the City Council amend the Order establishing the 
Harvard Square Conservation District and incorporate its goals and guidelines into the Harvard 
Square Overlay District.

Establishment and Operations of the Harvard Square Conservation District, 1995-2018 

On December 18, 2000, the Cambridge City Council adopted an Order establishing the Harvard 
Square Conservation District by a unanimous 9-0 vote (see Appendix A, Original Order Establish-
ing the Harvard Square Conservation District).   

The Harvard Square Conservation District contains approximately 195 buildings in an area bounded 
by Massachusetts Avenue and Mt. Auburn, Eliot, Bennett, Story, and Church streets. Within the 
district the Cambridge Historical Commission has binding review over demolition, new construc-
tion, and publicly visible exterior alterations to existing buildings, and can, in appropriate cases, im-
pose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to those required by zoning. In making its 
decisions the Commission follows guidelines intended to preserve historic resources while encour-
aging the social, economic, and architectural diversity that characterizes the Square.  

1.  Establishment of the District 

The initial impetus for the Conservation District was a July 31st, 1995 City Council directive that 
the Commission "submit a plan…for a Harvard Square Historic District which would preserve and 
protect all remaining historical buildings in Harvard Square." This Order was adopted during the 
controversy over the proposed redevelopment of the Read Block and the displacement of its retail 
and commercial tenants, including The Tasty, a popular lunch counter with a wide following. This 
was only the most recent instance of the gradual demolition of wood-frame commercial buildings in 
the Square and the perceived erosion of the square’s traditional retail and service sectors. The Read 
Block/Tasty debate was a turning point in the on-going discussion about the Square. It heightened 
awareness of the fragility of the area’s older buildings and sharpened public discussion about the 
meaning and limitations of historic preservation. 

The Read Block, 1380-1392 Massachusetts Avenue, in 1968 and as restored. 
 
A study committee appointed by the City Manager first considered the area for designation as an 
historic district under Chapter 40C of the General Laws. The Historical Commission's October 1999 
recommendation that the City Council establish a Harvard Square Historic District under M.G.L. 
Ch. 40C and adopt related amendments to the Zoning Code expired at the end of the Council term.

In June 2000 the City Council passed a new Order asking the City Manager to "direct the Historical 
Commission … to prepare an alternative version of the proposed Harvard Square Historic District 
ordinance using the neighborhood conservation district model." The same members were reap-
pointed as a new study committee in September 2000. They determined that the neighborhood

conservation district established under Ch. 2.78 of the City Code could be as effective in accom-
plishing historic preservation goals as an historic district and could be more flexible and efficient 
than an historic district in a variety of respects, including the ability to delegate certain approvals to 
the staff.1 

On October 7, 2000 the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee rec-
ommended the establishment of a conservation district under Ch. 2.78, Article III of the City Code. 
The committee also recommended amending several existing ordinances: (a) the zoning ordinance, 
to maintain the existing density allowed in the Harvard Square Overlay District; (b) Ch. 2.78, Arti-
cle III, to clarify its appeal provisions and to extend the time within which action must be taken; 
and (c) the Historical Commission ordinance (Ch. 2.78, Article I), to provide for a Harvard Square 
representative on the Commission. The District was established on December 18, 2000 and the 
amendments to the Zoning Code went into effect soon thereafter. The City Council took no action 
on the proposed amendments to Ch. 2.78.

2.  Operations 

Among the provisions of the Order was a requirement that the Historical Commission hold a public 
hearing and submit a report to the City Council on the effectiveness of the first five years of the 
District, with a recommendation as to whether the Order establishing the District should continue in 

1  Under Ch. 2.78.180, the initiation of the designation study gave the Commission interim jurisdiction over the pro-
posed district while it formulated a recommendation to the City Council.

effect, continue in effect with amendments, or be repealed. The reason for including this require-
ment in the Order was to ensure that the District continued to meet the objectives set forth in Final 
Report and to provide an opportunity for amendments to be introduced after the district had been in 
effect for a reasonable period. The City Council received the Five-Year Report in December 2005 
and placed it on file. 

The Five-Year Report considered the operations of the District between December 18, 2000 and 
October 31, 2005. During this period the Commission received 362 applications for Certificates of 
Appropriateness, Hardship or Non-Applicability for properties within the Conservation District:  

•  277 (77%) were issued a Certificate of Nonapplicability by the staff because the alterations 
proposed were exempt from Commission review. These included interior alterations, ordi-
nary maintenance and repair, alterations not visible from a public way, and storefront and 
sign alterations that met the District design guidelines.   

•  85 (23%) applications were heard by the Historical Commission, which issued Certificates 
of Appropriateness in 68 cases. Three applicants received Certificates of Hardship, two re-
ceived temporary certificates, and six applicants withdrew prior to a determination. Three 
applications were denied a Certificate of Appropriateness on the basis that the proposed al-
teration, demolition, or new construction was incongruous with the architecture of the build-
ing or incongruous with the characteristics and goals for the Harvard Square subdistrict in 
which it was located. Three cases could not be tracked. 

During subsequent years the proportion of applications requiring a public hearing increased to 
about 40%. By the end of October 2017, the Historical Commission had processed 1,409 applica-
tions for all types of work requiring a building permit in the Harvard Square Conservation District. 
Of these, 844 applications for interior work, projects not visible from a public way, or telecom gear 
were reviewed by staff. The remaining 565 applications for substantive publicly visible work were 
reviewed by the Commission during public hearings.  

3.  Exercise of Jurisdiction 

Applications requiring a public hearing before the Historical Commission generally fall into the fol-
lowing categories: signs and alterations; demolition and new construction; and additions. A brief 
review of cases from each of the design review categories follows. 

A.  Signs, Storefronts, and Alterations  

Most sign applications conform to the Zoning 
Code and are approved by the staff with a Cer-
tificate of Nonapplicability. The Commission 
has approved several non-conforming signs that 
were considered appropriate for their locations 
and supportive of the commercial vitality of the 
Square. For example, the Commission has ap-
proved a steaming bagel on J.F. Kennedy Street, 
retro neon signs at 15 Brattle Street and 52 
Church Street, and internally illuminated pro-
jecting signs at 11-21 Dunster Street and several 
other locations. Signs inside buildings but visi-
ble from the street are not considered subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction,

which is limited to “exterior architectural features” (Ch. 2.78.150.A). This is an area of ongoing 
concern that could be addressed by amendments to the zoning code. 
 
Applications to alter storefronts can be approved by staff if the original storefront surround is re-
tained or restored. Examples of storefront alterations that required no public hearing before the 
Commission include the restoration of the brownstone arches at 18, 20, and 22 J.F. Kennedy Street 
and the restoration of the original storefront at 1270 Massachusetts Avenue. At 18 JFK Street a re-
tailer initially wanted to install a new storefront, but when Commission staff explained that restora-
tion of the original brownstone arch hidden underneath layers of 20th century materials could pro-
ceed immediately under staff review the retailer agreed to proceed on that basis. Two additional 
arches (out of four in the same building) were subsequently restored by a different tenant. Similarly, 
at 1270 Massachusetts Avenue projecting window bays installed in the 1970s, prior to the designa-
tion of the District, were removed in favor of restoration of the original plate glass windows and 
masonry jambs without further review.

Initially, there was some concern that design review of al-
terations would stifle creativity and lead to monotonous, 
restoration-only designs. Several examples demonstrate 
that there is still plenty of creative thought being focused 
on commercial design in Harvard Square. Storefront ren-
ovations at 50 Church Street for Dado Tea opened up the 
concrete corner of the building to make a new entrance 
for the restaurant from the street and to make the space 
more inviting to the pedestrian. The Black Ink storefront 
at 5 Brattle Street was a significant departure from that of 
the previous tenant but was approved with staff review. 
The intensely controversial storefront alterations for 
&pizza at 1-3 Brattle Street in 2017 were approved by 
staff because they preserved the original structure of the 
building; signage conformed to zoning, and colors are ex-
empt from review.

The district Order calls out four historically significant storefronts that cannot be altered without a 
public hearing. Only one of the four has been altered since the District was established. The se-
verely deteriorated wooden storefront at 40 Bow Street was restored under a Certificate of Appro-
priateness issued in 2012.  
 
The 1956 aluminum façade of the Bank of America 
(formerly Harvard Trust Company) at 1408-1414 Mas-
sachusetts Avenue was restored in 2002. Though the 
aluminum screen covered a pre-existing Georgian Re-
vival façade that comprised about 25% of the street 
frontage, the staff considered it to be an architecturally 
significant feature and encouraged the bank to retain it. 
The aluminum grid of louvers and windows were re-
stored and a modern storefront glazing system was in-
stalled on the first floor without full Commission re-
view.  
 
After public hearings, the Commission granted Certificates of Appropriateness for three projects 
that involved complete restoration of significant buildings. The Hycinthe Purcell tenement at 40 
Bow Street (1889), a four-story wood frame building, was restored in 2012-2016. Waverly Hall

pened as a restaurant in 2017.

The burst of development that preceded the establishment of the district soon wound down with 
only a few more projects that involved demolition and new construction. Significant development 
activity did not resume until 2016, when the new owners of the Abbot Building, the former Corco-
ran’s Department Store, and 18 Brattle Street announced plans to redevelop that site.

In April 2001 the Commission denied an application by Harvard University for permission to con-
struct a new building on Mt. Auburn Street. The University had selected Hans Hollein, a Viennese 
Expressionist architect who had won the Pritzker Prize in 1985, to design a technology services 
building for the Harvard Libraries at 88-96 Mount Auburn Street.  On the site were an 1895 triple-
decker and a two-story commercial building of 1971. The site, near the center of the original village 
of Newtowne, was surrounded by low rise, residential-scale buildings that buffered the commercial 
district of Harvard Square from the River Houses; the most recent nearby new construction was the  
 

  

 

Harvard Library Services Building. Left, rejected original design (2000, Hans Hollein, architect); right, approved design 
(2002, Leers Weinzapfel, architects) 
 
modestly contextual Rosovsky Center, designed for Harvard-Radcliffe Hillel by Moshe Safdie in 
1993 (see photo, p. 41). Hollein’s proposed building was 62 feet high (not counting the inevitable 
mechanical penthouses), with a sloping, undulating wire-mesh façade overhanging a recessed first 
floor. The Commission was willing to sacrifice the three-decker but decided that Hollein’s proposal 
was inappropriately bulky and “incongruous because of its aggressive indifference to its surround-
ings.” Harvard then selected the Boston firm of Leers, Weinzapfel Associates to design a conven-
tionally-massed four-story building with a glazed façade that the Commission approved in 2003. 
The building's height was kept low by placing several floors of mechanicals and offices below 
grade. Additionally, the University kept rooftop mechanicals to a minimum by installing a geother-
mal heating and cooling system, eliminating the need for rooftop condensers. 
 

The theater/office building at Zero Arrow Street that was ap-
proved in 2002 remains the only new construction on an 
empty site since the establishment of the District. The lot was 
cleared in the 1980s for an office building but the site re-
mained empty until the Carr Foundation decided to build a 
theater and offices. The architect used traditional brick and 
cast stone cladding affixed to curtain wall framing, allowing 
generous amounts of glazing. The result was a four-story 
Post-Modern design that employed traditional forms with a 
modern sensibility. The through-block pathway created by 
this project provided pedestrian access between the Kerry 
Corner neighborhood and Massachusetts Avenue.

In 2004 the Commission approved Harvard University’s plan to demolish and rebuild part of the 
Hasty Pudding theater at 12 Holyoke Street. Harvard razed the theater, which was not accessible 
and did not meet modern code requirements, and restored the brick clubhouse on Holyoke Street. 
The public visibility of the new theater was limited, and several floors were constructed below 
grade to keep the height of the new construction to a minimum.  
 
A decade-long hiatus in significant development activity occurred after these projects were com-
pleted. In May 2008 the Commission approved a complex plan triggered by the MBTA’s sale of the 
busway and Conductor’s Building at 112 Mt. Auburn. The adjacent wood-frame Trinity Hall at 114 
Mt. Auburn Street, a deteriorated former private dormitory, was demolished so that the Conductor’s 
Building, the last surviving structure erected by the Boston Elevated Railway during the construc-
tion of the subway in 1909-12, could be restored. The Commission and the Planning Board ap-
proved an office building somewhat bulkier than zoning allowed through a transfer of development 
from the preserved building. This project was revived in 2013 and completed in 2016.

After the recession of 2008-2012 the Dow-Stearns Trust, a long-term owner of several significant 
properties, decided to begin liquidating its holdings. The Dow-Stearns holdings dated back to the 
early years of the 20th century, and by the 1990s included 1-8 and 17-41 Brattle Street, the Abbot 
Building at 1-5 Kennedy Street, the adjoining former Corcoran’s store (with frontage on Brattle 
Street), and 18 Brattle Street. By 2015 the trust had owned some of these properties for almost a 
century and had long managed them for a steady income from a carefully curated group of tenants.  
 
The sale of the Abbot Building and its two abutting properties in 2015 for the unprecedented sum of 
$85 million triggered widespread anxiety about the future of the Square. The value of these proper-
ties (and consequently their rents) had been artificially depressed for many years because they had 
been managed for steady income rather than capital gains. Although the physical character of any 
new development could be constrained by the conservation district and the zoning code, the sale 
generated widespread concern among tenants and the broader community of stakeholders. 
 
Beginning in the fall of 2016 the Historical Commission held five public hearings and heard 25 
hours of public testimony about the proposed development of the three-building site. In May 2017 
the Commission approved a Certificate of Appropriateness for a project that involved restoration of 
the Abbot Building and 18 Brattle Street and replacement of the former Corcoran’s store with a new 
structure. The Planning Board held further hearings, and in the spring of 2018 granted the project a 
Special Permit.

Abbot Building, stages of CHC design review from October 2016 (adding a glass box above Corcoran’s/Urban Outfit-
ters) to May 2017 (new construction and restoration of the Abbot Building and 18 Brattle Street). PCA Architects. 

The Abbot Building hearings raised issues of the appropriateness of the proposed demolition, the 
design of the new building, and the details of the restoration. These were fully within the scope of 
the Commission’s authority, but other matters of grave concern to the public were not. These in-
cluded protection for existing tenants; the desirability of small, locally-owned retailers over chain 
stores, large or small; and an aversion to certain types of tenants, such as banks and offices, that of-
ten occupy space designed for retail stores. In the course of these hearings the Historical Commis-
sion agreed to initiate the current study of the jurisdiction, goals, and guidelines of the District.  
 
More development projects of an unprecedented scale are in discussion or anticipated. The demoli-
tion of the Harvard Square Theater was proposed in September 2018; the replacement mixed-use 
building would incorporate an innovative façade with the potential to display moving images with 
embedded LED lights, a feature that is not clearly within the jurisdiction of the District. The Dow-
Stearns properties at 1-8 Brattle Street and 17-41 Brattle Street, comprising 55,000 square feet of 
mostly ground-floor retail space, changed hands for $105 million in December 2017. The one-story 
buildings at 17-41 have a significant volume of unused FAR, the development of which will pro-
foundly affect the future of Brattle Square. Also, Harvard University’s Church Street parking lot 
has significant development potential. See the subdistrict section below for a discussion of these 
projects. 
 

C.  Additions 

 
Significant additions have been relatively rare in the District. In 2000, during the study period, the 
Commission approved the addition of two stories to the former Quincy Square Garage at 1230 

1.4.b

Massachusetts Avenue (1907). The highly significant Cox-Hicks house at 98 Winthrop Street (ca. 
1806) had long presented a difficult challenge for preservationists because it was no longer suitable 
for residential occupancy and could not be easily adapted for other uses. In 2001 a new owner de-
veloped a plan to convert it to a restaurant and link it via a bridge to his adjacent restaurant, Char-
lie’s Kitchen at 10 Eliot Street. After lengthy negotiations, the Commission approved an adaptive 
reuse project that involved razing several additions and constructing a new dining room on a canti-
levered foundation to minimize the impact on the adjoining 18th century retaining wall. The original 
house was then restored inside and out.  

1230 Massachusetts Avenue (1907, with 2000 two-story addition; 98 Winthrop Street (1806, with 2001 addition and bridge) 

  

 

In 2012-2014 the Commission approved rooftop additions at 57 J.F. Kennedy Street and 14-16 Eliot 
Street. 57 JFK (1974) was a two-story enclosed mall and 16-18 Eliot (1993) was a two-story com-
mercial building designed as a placeholder after the former building was destroyed by a fire in 1990 
(see photo below). Preservation of the original structures not being an issue, the Commission fo-
cused in the former case on the structure’s proximity to Winthrop Park and eventually 

57 JFK Street and 16 Eliot Street additions, both approved 2014 

    

 

approved a design that stepped back from Winthrop Street to minimize shadows; this project is cur-
rently under construction. At 16-18 Eliot Street the additional height was controversial and mem-
bers of the public criticized the contemporary design of colored synthetic panels as inappropriate 
for the traditional context of its surroundings. The Commission granted the project a Certificate of 
Appropriateness in 2014, but work had not commenced as of March 2019 and the permits have now 
lapsed.

Deliberations of the 2017-19 Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee 

The Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee was appointed by the City Manager in 
August 2017 and began meeting in October. The composition of the committee was limited by ordi-
nance to five members and three alternates, all but one of whom had to be residents and/or prop-
erty owners in the district, plus one member or alternate of the Cambridge Historical Commis-
sion. City Manager Louis DePasquale was careful to appoint a diverse group of individuals who 
would bring varied points of view to the table. The strict requirements for membership prevented 
the appointment of several otherwise-qualified citizens, but all of those who expressed interest in 
appointment were invited to attend the meetings and participate in the discussions.  

All meetings were advertised in advance and all were open to the public. Attendance averaged 
about 15 participants, including appointed members of the study committee, individuals who were 
interviewed but not appointed, and interested members of the public. Everyone in attendance sat at 
the same table and participated in the discussion equally. CHC Executive Director Charles Sullivan 
moderated the meetings and Preservation Planner Sarah Burks assisted. Decisions about the direc-
tion of the study and the language of the revised guidelines were reached by consensus; no votes 
were necessary to advance the agenda of the committee 

Attendees discussed the events that led to the establishment of the district in 2000 and the record of 
its operations and effectiveness. Representatives of the Community Development Department de-
scribed zoning and sign regulations. Focusing on the Final Report of the Cambridge Historical 
Commission Regarding the Proposed Harvard Square Conservation District, the committee held 
detailed discussions about the goals, secondary goals, and guidelines of the District; the application 
of those goals and guidelines to matters of demolition, new construction, and alterations. The evolv-
ing character of the subdistricts was also discussed.  

In June 2019 participants expressed interest in discussing possible amendments to the Harvard 
Square Overlay District, and this phase of the deliberations commenced with the July meeting. In 
September CDD zoning specialists described the history and provisions of the Harvard Square 
Overlay District, and attorney and community activist Patrick Barrett described a petition to amend 
Section 20.50 of the Zoning Code pertaining to the Harvard Square Overlay District and Harvard 
Square Historical Overlay District that had been endorsed by the Harvard Square Business Associa-
tion and the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association. This petition (which was subsequently 
filed with the City Clerk on October 3, 2019) would revise the composition of the Harvard Square 
Advisory Committee and the conduct of its meetings; allow retail uses as of right in certain areas, 
subject to restrictions; delete the payment requirement for the reduction of parking when the Gross 
Floor Area is the maximum allowed; increase the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for residential uses in the 
Business B district; allow increased FAR by Planning Board special permit; allow ground floor re-
tail exemptions for 1,500 SF or less; limit the street frontage allowed for some uses; restrict formula 
businesses and cannabis outlets; and allow Fast Order Food Establishments as of right, provided 
that they are not formula businesses. Participants generally endorsed these proposals, which at the 
time of writing were still subject to hearings before the Planning Board and the City Council. 
 
A complete draft of the Preliminary Report of the 2017-19 Harvard Square Conservation District 
Study Committee was first discussed by the study committee in May 2019. On November 20, 2019 
the report was unanimously approved by the appointed members of the study committee. Staff then 
transmitted the report to the Cambridge Planning Board and the Cambridge Historical Commission.

The Cambridge Historical Commission held a public hearing on December 5, 2019 to consider the 
recommendations of the Preliminary Report and voted unanimously to support its recommenda-
tions.  

The Cambridge Planning Board reviewed the recommendations at a public hearing on December 
17, 2019. Members complimented the process; pointed out the differing standards for review of 
new construction applied by the Historical Commission and the Planning Board; and expressed in-
terest in coordinating project reviews. 

The City Council can adopt amendments to the Order establishing the district by a simple majority; 
amendments to Ch. 2.78 of the City Code will require a hearing before the Ordinance Committee 
and a two-thirds vote of the Council. Amendments to the zoning code must be reviewed by the 
Planning Board and must also receive a two-thirds vote of the Council.

III. 

Amended Statement of Goals and Secondary Goals 

The goals statement developed by the original Harvard Square Conservation District Study and in-
corporated in the 2000 Order is the foundational document of the District. The goals and the accom-
panying secondary goals are meant to inform decision-making of the Cambridge Historical Com-
mission as it administers the district and should be cited in any motion to accept or deny an applica-
tion for Certificates of Appropriateness, Non-applicability, or Hardship. (See Appendix A, Article 
III, for the complete original goals statement.) 

The amended goals statement maintains the structure of the original while clarifying some of the 
language. New language supports a) commercial urban experiences; b) creative signage, below-
grade commercial spaces, and preservation of storefronts; c) residential development; d) transporta-
tion and pedestrian safety; and e) energy conservation. One new goal refers to the regulation of ar-
chitectural lighting. No changes were made to secondary goals 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8.  

a.  Commercial urban experiences (introductory statement). The Study Committee debated the 
desirability of expressing support for locally-owned businesses, but there was no consensus 
on how or whether this could be accomplished. Some businesses are unique enterprises 
owned and operated by Cambridge residents; others may be locally-owned franchises of re-
gional or national firms. All contribute to the vibrant commercial environment of the 
Square.  

The Committee also discussed the proliferation of banks and offices in former retail spaces. 
It was recognized that this was a function of market demand, as the retail sector weakens 
relative to other sectors, and that matters of use were beyond the purview of the Conserva-
tion District. These issues could be addressed through amendments to the zoning code. 

The Study Committee also spent a significant amount of time trying to describe the charac-
teristics of Harvard Square that distinguish it from Newbury Street or many other urban 
mixed-use districts. As one participant put it, “For many, perhaps most, people, despite the 
constant changes in the businesses, the Square has a ‘je ne sais quoi’ that they can’t articu-
late … I have asked many other long-term residents for one or two words that define the 
Square for them. The most common response has been “quirky.” … “Quirky” is not a term 
that can be precisely defined, but the refinements to the District Order suggested by the 
Study Committee are made with the conscious intent of preserving the quirkiness of Har-
vard Square.  

Subsequent discussion on this topic focused on the unique qualities of Harvard Square that 
the District should support. One participant noted that the Square is a place where the “pro-
fessor, dignitary, construction worker and student mingle.” Another noted that the Square 
was a place to experience unexpected and the accidental encounters; another characterized 
the environment as “heterogenous.” These terms are difficult to translate into regulation, but 
it was generally agreed that the objective of the District should be to manage future changes 
in a way that will support the quirkiness of this particular place. 

The committee agreed that the introductory statement should be amended to read as follows: 

The Goal of the District and of this Order is to protect the Harvard Square Conser-
vation District’s distinctive physical and experiential characteristics and to enhance

the livability and vitality of the District. The Historical Commission should seek to 
enhance the unique physical environment and visual form of the District; preserve 
its architecturally and historically significant structures and their settings; encour-
age creative design that contributes to the richness of its environment; mitigate 
character-diminishing impacts of new development; and discourage homogeneity by 
encouraging diversity of development and open space patterns and building scales 
and ages. The District must remain a pedestrian-friendly, accessible, human-scale, 
quirky, mixed-use environment that supports dynamic urban experiences, comple-
ments nearby neighborhoods, and respects the history and traditions of its location. 

b.  Creative signage; below-grade commercial spaces; preservation of storefronts. (Goal #2)  

Creative signage has historically been an important component of Harvard Square’s exciting 
commercial environment. The zoning code authorizes the Historical Commission to grant 
Certificates of Appropriateness for signs that do not conform to certain aspects of the sign 
code and has done so on numerous occasions. 

Below-grade commercial spaces can accommodate intensive non-retail activities that sup-
port the commercial vitality of the commercial core in the Harvard Square and Brattle 
Square subdistricts. 

It cannot be presumed that the strong demand for storefront locations will continue. Retail 
enterprises face severe challenges nationwide, and it is possible that the retail sector in Har-
vard Square will contract. Many buildings in the District were designed for ground floor re-
tail, and for reasons of historic preservation and conservation of the resource that they repre-
sent repurposed storefronts should be altered in a way that preserves their architectural fab-
ric and that is reversible. If appropriate, disfiguring storefront additions could be removed, 
and buildings that were originally designed for non-commercial purposes could be restored 
to their original appearance. When possible, retail functions required by law to be screened 
from public view, such as marijuana dispensaries, should be located so as to preserve the 
front of the store for retail activity or other active uses. 

Secondary Goal #2 should be amended to read as follows: 

Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment. Sustain the vitality of the com-
mercial environment while preserving architecturally-significant or original build-
ing fabric at street level and above. Encourage the restoration of missing features 
where these have been documented. Except for protected storefronts, encourage cre-
ative contemporary commercial design inside the restored framework of storefront 
openings. Encourage creative signage. Support below-grade commercial spaces 
where appropriate. Regardless of use, encourage architectural solutions that pre-
serve storefront fabric, transparency, and utility. 

c.  Residential development (Goal #7) 

Harvard Square supports a number of residents in existing buildings. The vitality of the 
neighborhood would be enhanced by additional residential development in buildings that are 
appropriate in scale, density and appearance. 

Secondary Goal #7 should be amended to read as follows: 

Residential Development. Enhance the all-hours neighborhood quality of Harvard

Square by supporting existing residential uses and encouraging additional residen-
tial units in mixed-use buildings 

d.  Transportation; pedestrian safety (Goal #9) 

Increasing numbers of commuters and shoppers access Harvard Square by bicycle. Cam-
bridge zoning now requires new development to provide generous bicycle parking; the Con-
servation District should support this goal. 

Cambridge has adopted Vision Zero to eliminate transportation fatalities. Public sector im-
provements, including redesign of sidewalks, crosswalks and public plazas, should enhance 
pedestrian safety while preserving traditional urban materials and street furniture. 

The committee discussed the separation of bicycle and automobile traffic on Brattle Street 
through the introduction of a two-way curbside bicycle path and flex posts. The committee 
agreed that the Historical Commission should engage with the Traffic Department and the 
Harvard Square community to study site-specific alternatives that might provide a better so-
lution to the problem of bicycle safety, the pedestrian experience, truck deliveries, and auto-
mobile traffic. A preferred alternative might incorporate appropriate urban design features 
such as landscaping, distinctive pavement treatments, and lighting. 

Secondary Goal #9 should be amended to read as follows: 

Transportation. Encourage creative solutions to the District’s transportation issues 
by providing balanced accommodations for through and local traffic, cyclists, alter-
native transportation methods, and pedestrians. Promote smooth movement of traffic 
on through streets and seek creative design and management solutions for side 
streets where traffic volume and speeds can be regulated to give highest priority to 
pedestrians. Provide adequate bicycle parking throughout the District. Protect pe-
destrian safety and experience through careful design and placement of features 
such as loading docks, curb cuts, and receptacles for trash and recycling. Encour-
age replacement of surface parking lots with compatible new structures. Discourage 
provision of on-site parking for new construction. 

e.  Energy conservation (Goal #10).  

Conservation of energy is an important community goal. New buildings should be environ-
mentally sustainable in conformance with City goals and policies. Energy conservation up-
grades to existing buildings should be approached in a manner that respects historic archi-
tectural features. 

Secondary Goal #10 should be amended to read as follows: 

Environmental Sustainability. Encourage environmentally sustainable development 
that takes into consideration the embodied energy of the existing built environment, 
material life cycles, passive design, energy conservation, and current standards for 
best energy conservation practices. Alterations to existing buildings that seek to pro-
mote energy conservation should be accomplished in a manner that respects charac-
ter-defining materials and designs. 

f.  Architectural lighting (New Goal #11).  

Urban lighting, including architectural or building façade lighting, streetscape lighting, and

signage lighting impacts the quality of the 24-hour environment. Lighting goals are intended 
to enhance the quality of the streetscape, highlight unique architectural details, minimize 
light trespass, preserve dark skies, and conserve energy.  

Currently architectural lighting is regulated only through the appearance of the fixtures; the 
quality and intensity of the light, changing light effects over time (kinetic lighting), and the 
architectural features to be illuminated are not regulated. Architectural lighting is widely 
considered to be a positive feature of some urban structures and environments, but with cur-
rent technology can become objectionable through excessive brightness, motion, or inappro-
priate highlighting of architectural features. Standards for architectural lighting need to be 
developed, and the enabling ordinance may need to be amended to establish the District’s 
jurisdiction in this area. 

The committee also discussed the effects of lighting generated inside buildings, although the 
Commission’s jurisdiction in this area is limited by legislation limiting mandate to regula-
tion of publicly visible exterior architectural features. In new construction, light spill from 
ceiling fixtures can be controlled through conditions on a Certificate of Appropriateness, but 
this ability does not exist with interior renovations where no commission review is allowed.  

Interior illuminated signage is not subject to review by the conservation district, while inte-
rior signs more than 12” away from a display window are not subject to zoning regulation 
either. 

The proposed new Goal #11 reads as follows: 

Architectural lighting. Architectural (building façade) lighting, streetscape lighting, 
and signage lighting, when allowed by a Certificate of Appropriateness, should rein-
force definitive characteristics of historic and contemporary architecture as well as 
create high quality 24-hour streetscapes. To achieve these goals, projects should 
minimize brightness, and light trespass, monitor light color (temperature Kelvin), 
and focus lighting on significant features.   

In general, light temperature should not exceed 3000K unless special conditions justify a 
higher or lower value. 2 Minimizing brightness while highlighting unique architectural de-
tails will conserve energy, reduce trespass, and enhance dark skies. To define and enhance 
the after-dark streetscape, consideration should be given to low-brightness building façade 
lighting as an alternative to brighter street lights. Any fixtures casting light visible to public 
view must have dimming capability. Applications for a Certificates of Appropriateness are 
required to include detailed descriptions of the design of any lighting visible to the public, as 
well as equipment specifications and rendering(s) of the proposed appearance of the illumi-
nated structure and its environs.  

Potential candidates for illumination in the Conservation District include the First Parish 
Church, the Charles Sumner statue, the Harvard Lampoon, the Abbot Building, the William 
Brattle House, St. Paul Church, and 48 Brattle Street (former Design Research building).  

2 Color temperature is conventionally expressed in Kelvins, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute tempera-
ture. Color temperatures over 5000 K are called "cool colors" (bluish), while lower color temperatures (2700–3000 K) 
are called "warm colors" (yellowish). In general, light temperature should exceed 3000K only in special conditions.

If adopted, the complete amended statement of goals for the Conservation District would be as fol-
lows: 

The Goal of the District and of this Order is to protect the Harvard Square Conservation Dis-
trict’s distinctive physical and experiential characteristics and to enhance the livability and vital-
ity of the District. The Historical Commission should seek to enhance the unique physical envi-
ronment and visual form of the District; preserve its architecturally and historically significant 
structures and their settings; encourage creative design that contributes to the richness of its en-
vironment; mitigate character-diminishing impacts of new development; and discourage homo-
geneity by encouraging diversity of development and open space patterns and building scales 
and ages. The District must remain a pedestrian-friendly, accessible, human-scale, quirky, 
mixed-use environment that supports dynamic urban experiences, complements nearby neigh-
borhoods, and respects the history and traditions of its location. 
 
The following Secondary Goals for the District are intended to provide general guidance in a 
wide variety of situations, and are not intended to be applied to every project. They are state-
ments of policy, not prescriptive measures that must be applied equally in each situation. 
 

1.  Significant Buildings. Preserve historically or architecturally significant buildings 
and structures as well as those that contribute to the distinctive visual character or histor-
ical significance of the District. 
 
2.  Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment. Sustain the vitality of the com-
mercial environment while preserving architecturally-significant or original building 
fabric at street level and above. Encourage the restoration of missing features where 
these have been documented. Except for protected storefronts, encourage creative con-
temporary commercial design inside the restored framework of storefront openings. En-
courage creative signage. Support below-grade commercial spaces where appropriate. 
Regardless of use, encourage architectural solutions that preserve storefront fabric, 
transparency, and utility. 
 
3.  Contemporary Design. Where context allows, support creative, contemporary design 
for new construction that complements the context of abutting buildings and enhances 
the character of the subdistrict. Recognize and respect well-reasoned contemporary de-
sign during the review process. Support innovative approaches to enhancing the unique 
character of Harvard Square while mitigating the detrimental impacts of development on 
proximate areas. 
 
4.  Diversity of Form. Build on and sustain the diversity of existing building form, scale 
and material. Preserve and encourage appropriate green spaces, scale-appropriate open 
spaces, and new buildings that support the prevailing character of the subdistrict. Pre-
serve the remaining wood frame buildings throughout the District. Maintain a consistent 
setback or streetwall condition where that character has been set. Support small-scale 
storefronts to preserve the vitality and character of the streetscape.  
 
5.  Public Environment. Create a high-quality public environment in the District with 
compatible materials, lighting, signage, and street furniture such as bollards, benches,

moveable seating, and the like. Provide adequate facilities for trash and recycling and 
surfaces that can be cleaned and maintained. Encourage planted greenspaces and accom-
modate trees where possible. 
 
6.  Pedestrian Experience. Protect and enhance the pedestrian experience. Expand the 
network of pedestrian walkways and paths wherever they can conveniently provide al-
ternate routes through the District. Increase public access to alleys and interior spaces 
where appropriate and upgrade the paving and landscaping of such spaces. Enhance ac-
cessibility and safety for pedestrians throughout the District.  
 
7.  Residential Development. Enhance the all-hours neighborhood quality of Harvard 
Square by supporting existing residential uses and encouraging additional residential 
units in mixed-use buildings. 
 
8.  Compatible Design. Encourage compatible design that supports a wide diversity of 
uses serving the needs of surrounding neighborhoods, students, workers and visitors 
from around the world. 
 
9.  Transportation. Encourage creative solutions to the District’s transportation issues by 
providing balanced accommodations for through and local traffic, cyclists, alternative 
transportation methods, and pedestrians. Promote smooth movement of traffic on 
through streets and seek creative design and management solutions for side streets where 
traffic volume and speeds can be regulated to give highest priority to pedestrians. Pro-
vide adequate bicycle parking throughout the District. Protect pedestrian safety and ex-
perience through careful design and placement of features such as loading docks, curb 
cuts, and receptacles for trash and recycling. Encourage replacement of surface parking 
lots with compatible new structures. Discourage provision of on-site parking for new 
construction. 
 
10. Environmental Sustainability. Encourage environmentally sustainable development 
that takes into consideration the embodied energy of the existing built environment, ma-
terial life cycles, passive design, energy conservation, and current standards for best en-
ergy conservation practices. Alterations to existing buildings that seek to promote en-
ergy conservation should be accomplished in a manner that respects character-defining 
materials and designs. 
 
11. Architectural lighting. Architectural (building façade) lighting, streetscape lighting, 
and signage lighting, when allowed by a Certificate of Appropriateness, should reinforce 
definitive characteristics of historic and contemporary architecture as well as create high 
quality 24-hour streetscapes. To achieve these goals, projects should minimize bright-
ness, and light trespass, monitor light color (temperature Kelvin), and focus lighting on 
significant features.

IV.  Amended Guidelines for Demolition, Construction, and Alterations  

The Study Committee reviewed the original (2000) guidelines for demolition, construction and al-
terations for consistency with the amended goals and to reflect changes in the regulatory environ-
ment. The following narrative contains the amended guidelines; a redlined version is contained in 
Appendix D.  

A. 

Demolition 

The guidelines for demolition, construction, and alterations expand upon the language of the Ordi-
nance to provide additional guidance for administration of the Harvard Square Conservation Dis-
trict.   
 
 
 
Although the City's demolition delay ordinance does not apply in the Harvard Square Conservation 
District, demolition is similarly defined as "the act of pulling down, destroying, removing or razing 
a structure or commencing the work of total or substantial destruction with the intent of completing 
the same".3  The Cambridge Inspectional Services Commissioner requires demolition permits for 
removal of more than 25% of a structure. Work of this sort will be reviewed under the following 
demolition guidelines, while the removal of building components, including signs and storefronts, 
will be reviewed as alterations. 
 
The purpose of reviewing demolition or moving a building within the Conservation District is to 
preserve significant buildings and the diversity of building ages, styles, and forms that help to de-
fine the historical character of the Square. Other benefits include the opportunity to review the sig-
nificance of individual buildings in the context of specific development proposals, to consider crea-
tive re-use possibilities, and to encourage the care and maintenance of the building stock. 
 
The Cambridge Historical Commission will issue a Certificate of Appropriateness to an applicant 
seeking to demolish a structure in the Conservation District if the project, including both the demol-
ished and the replacement buildings, is determined to be "appropriate for or compatible with the 
preservation or protection of the . . . district."4  Approval of demolition will be dependent on a find-
ing by the Cambridge Historical Commission that a) the demolition of the structure will not ad-
versely impact the district, subdistrict, or abutting properties in the sense described in secondary 
goal #1, and b) the replacement project meets the purposes of the Conservation District with respect 
to secondary goals #2 through #10, where these are applicable. Projects that involve relocation must 
provide a location that preserves the character and context of the building. 
 
The history of Harvard Square suggests some specific criteria that may be applied to demolition 
proposals. Buildings that are over fifty years old, that are contributing structures in the Harvard 
Square National Register District, or that are part of the Square's dwindling inventory of wood-
frame structures, are generally valued for their contribution to the character of the Square, and it

City Code, section 2.78.080.F. Demolition is categorized in Chapter 40C as an "alteration;" moving 
a building categorized as "construction." 
Chapter 40C, Section 10a. This language is incorporated by reference in the Neighborhood Conser-
vation District and Landmark Ordinance, Ch. 2.78.170.

may be presumed that preservation will be strongly preferred to demolition (secondary goal #4).5  
However, all such applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and the Cambridge Histor-
ical Commission will not necessarily protect all such structures from demolition. 
 
 
 
Creative design solutions to development and renovation requirements will be encouraged to ensure 
that the unique resources and character of Harvard Square are protected.6   
 

Construction  

B. 

1. 

New Construction/Additions to Existing Buildings 

 
Harvard Square is a kaleidoscopic urban environment. The Cambridge Historical Commission will 
recognize the continuing evolution of architectural design and the necessity of keeping the Square 
fresh, vibrant, and economically viable. Contemporary design expression will be encouraged in new 
construction (secondary goal #3).7 
 
The existence of parallel reviews by the Historical Commission and the Harvard Square Advisory 
Committee is seen as a productive application of both zoning and historic preservation disciplines 
in a complex urban environment; in the event of conflict, however, conservation district protection, 
which requires Cambridge Historical Commission approval of building permits, will prevail. Be-
cause the specific circumstances of every development project cannot be predicted, it is not possible 
to specify an exact regulatory protocol governing the sharing of reviews between the Historical 
Commission and the Advisory Committee. The inherent logic of the project review process will 
guide the proponent. 
 
The Cambridge Historical Commission will begin its review of a new construction project or addi-
tion with an analysis of the historic significance and architectural value of the premises and its im-
mediate surroundings. New construction that accommodates older structures on or adjacent to the 
site will be encouraged. Construction that incorporates significant major portions of older structures 
may be acceptable; however, use of isolated historic architectural elements will be discouraged. 
Demolition involving retention of facades to allow replacement of historic structures with new con-
struction (mis-named "facadectomies") will be discouraged unless the supporting historic fabric is 
found to be unsalvageable. Unless the context dictates otherwise, new buildings should be built out 
to the front property line, respecting the vitality of the sidewalk and plaza spaces. 
 
In reviewing new construction or additions to existing buildings, the Commission "shall consider 
the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both in relation to the land area upon 

 

5  

6  
7  

"Build on and sustain the diversity of the existing building form, scale and material. Preserve and 
encourage flowers, green yards and courtyards and small, free-standing and wood-frame buildings 
where that character prevails. Encourage streetwall buildings where that character has been set." 
Secondary goals #2, #3, #6, #9, #10. 
"Support creative, contemporary design for new construction that complements and contributes to its 
immediate neighbors and the character of Harvard Square. Recognize and respect creativity of de-
sign during the review process and mitigate the functional impacts of development on adjacent ar-
eas."

which the structure is situated and to structures in the vicinity."8  Review of new buildings will be 
guided by considerations such as the appropriateness of the structure's height, scale, mass, propor-
tions, orientation, and lot coverage; the vertical and horizontal emphasis, rhythm of openings, trans-
parency, texture, and materials of the publicly-visible facades; sunlight and shadow effects; rela-
tionship to public open space; and landscaping.  
 
Review of new buildings and additions will be further guided by the subdistrict goals regarding the 
relationship of a proposed building to the site and to other buildings and structures in the vicinity. 
Future developments should incorporate the Square’s traditional storefront with varying widths and 
multiple entrances. New developments on consolidated lots should convey the outward appearance 
of individual buildings through varied massing. 
 
Under the City Code, the Historical Commission acting as a neighborhood conservation district 
commission "may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to 
those required by the applicable provision of the zoning ordinance."9  Implementing such a measure 
could result in a reduction of the Floor Area Ratio (FAR) allowed by zoning. The appropriate cir-
cumstances for imposing dimensional and set-back reductions could include a wide disparity of 
scale and density between the proposed project and its surroundings, or a situation in which the pro-
posed project would destroy or diminish the historical resources of the site. 
 

 

2. 

Alterations to Existing Buildings 

 
Alterations to exterior architectural features visible from a public way will be subject to binding re-
view by the Cambridge Historical Commission, guided by secondary goals #1, #2, #4, and 11. 
Storefronts will be treated more flexibly than building facades or upper stories. The goals of the dis-
trict favor retention and repair, rather than replacement, of original or significant exterior fabric. 
 
While irreversible changes are subject to review and approval of the Cambridge Historical Com-
mission, certain other visible exterior alterations are reviewed by the staff or exempted from review 
entirely. Chapter 2.78, Article III identifies seven other categories of construction and alterations 
that may be exempted from review.10  The following features are exempt from review and do not 
trigger an application process:  
 

•  Storm doors and storm windows (subject to specific design guidelines). 
•  Signs that conform to the Cambridge sign code as amended in the Harvard 

Square Historic Overlay District. 

 

The Historical Commission has adopted procedures delegating to staff the review and approval of 
some reversible alterations which have the potential to adversely affect historic fabric. A Certificate 
of Nonapplicability will be issued by the staff if Conservation District guidelines are followed. 
These categories include:

•  Ordinary repairs or maintenance using similar materials and construction details 

to those existing. 

 
•  Reconstruction replicating the exterior design of a building, structure, or exterior 
architectural feature damaged or destroyed by fire, storm, or other disaster, pro-
vided such reconstruction is begun within one year thereafter and carried forward 
with due diligence.11 

 

 
•  Roof repairs and HVAC equipment not visible from a public way. 
 
•  Window replacement in conformity with the Commission’s published guidelines. 

Applications for alterations outside of these categories are considered by the Commission at a pub-

 

lic hearing. 

a. 

Interior Work and Alterations Not Visible from a Public Way 

 
Interior arrangements and alterations to architectural features not visible from any public way are 
exempt from review in neighborhood conservation districts and a Certificate of Nonapplicability for 
such work will be issued by Commission staff without delay.  
 

Storefronts  

b. 
 

The Cambridge Historical Commission recognizes that storefronts have significant impact on the 
character of a given subdistrict. To that end the Commission has created guidelines to ensure that 
storefronts complement the surrounding neighborhood while still allowing business owners to ex-
press their individuality and promote their goods and services. 
 
Storefronts are a source of Harvard Square's continuing vitality, and the Cambridge Historical Com-
mission seeks to encourage creativity in this regard (secondary goal #2).12  Most storefronts are re-
garded as impermanent and the Historical Commission looks favorably on creative alterations that 
meet the particular needs of the retailer or office tenant, as long as the original structure and finishes 
are maintained or recovered (where they still exist). Alterations to upper stories are regarded as hav-
ing the potential for significant and permanent adverse effects and will be reviewed accordingly. 
Changes to storefronts that do not obscure or damage the structure or any original architectural fea-
tures will be encouraged. Opaque glass will not be allowed in display windows unless specifically 
permitted.  
 
The Cambridge Historical Commission has adopted procedures delegating review and approval of 
two categories of storefront alterations to the staff. Applications for storefront alterations that do not 
meet these criteria are considered by the Commission at a public hearing. A Certificate of 

 

11  

12  

Such replacement work will still be subject to review of the staff and issuance of a Certificate of Ap-
propriateness. 
"Help sustain the vitality of the commercial environment by supporting creative, contemporary de-
sign for storefront alterations and additions, while preserving architecturally significant or original 
building fabric and character."

Nonapplicability will be issued by the staff for: 

•  Alterations that reveal or restore, and take place entirely within, the surround of a 
storefront. The storefront surround consists of such elements as piers, columns, 
cornerboards, quoins, cornices and similar structural or decorative features. 

 
•  Alterations that do not obscure, remove, relocate, or replace historic or original ex-
terior architectural features. Exterior architectural features may include, but are not 
limited to, such features as brackets, window and door casings, fascia, hoods, 
bays, and window sash. Examples of such alterations that have been approved by 
staff include exterior lighting of signs, accessibility hardware, and fire suppression 
and safety appliances or hardware. 

 
CHC staff will encourage glazing divisions in new storefronts to be delineated by mullions that re-
flect the rhythm of openings in the upper floors. Glazing should intersect, not cover, structural ele-
ments. 
 
A few storefronts in the Square retain their original design or have a subsequent design that is sig-
nificant in terms of architectural or historical significance. The following  
storefronts and/or the buildings in which they are located are specifically designated in the Order as 
requiring Commission rather than staff approval of alterations: 
 

•  1304 Massachusetts Avenue (Felix Shoe Repair) 
•  1316 Massachusetts Avenue (Leavitt & Pierce)  
•  1320-22 Massachusetts Avenue (J. August) 
•  30-30A Plympton Street (Blue Bottle Coffee) 

 
Alterations to these storefronts, including installation or alteration of signs, requires a Certificate of 
Appropriateness from the Commission.13  Additional significant storefronts may be identified in the 
future, and the Cambridge Historical Commission may recommend to the City Council that they be 
added to the protected list. 
 
It cannot be presumed that the strong demand for storefront locations will continue. Retail enter-
prises face severe challenges nationwide, and it is possible that the retail sector in Harvard Square 
will contract. Many buildings in the District were designed or adapted for ground floor retail, and 
for reasons of historic preservation and conservation of the resource that they represent, repurposed 
storefronts should be altered in a way that preserves their transparency and architectural fabric and 
that is reversible. 
 

c. 

Windows 

 
Windows are critical to maintaining the characteristic appearance of significant buildings. Replace-
ment of wood windows with inappropriate modern units can destroy the traditional appearance of a 
building. The Commission has established design guidelines for window alterations governing

materials, muntin patterns, panning, and reflectivity.  
 
Modern replacement windows are available that match the originals in appearance while offering 
significant energy efficiency. The Commission will, in most cases, allow window replacement as 
long as design guidelines are met. Applications to replace windows that are ornamental in design or 
that contain significant original sash will require review by the Commission. 
 
Review and approval of certain window alterations may be delegated to the staff. For example, ap-
plications for window alterations that do not change the size of the opening, configuration of the 
muntins, material, or transparency will receive a Certificate of Nonapplicability in the same manner 
as the exempted storefront alterations.  

 
Harvard Square contains many outstanding examples of brick masonry construction. Because the 
appearance of masonry can be irreversibly altered by improper pointing or cleaning, Cambridge 
Historical Commission approval will be necessary for these operations. Review will include ap-
proval of specifications for cleaning, cutting joints, mortar composition, and joint profiles. Replace-
ment masonry units will be reviewed for color, size, and finish. Painting of masonry (brick, stone, 
or concrete) surfaces without a Certificate of Appropriateness will be prohibited.

Signs 

 
Signs in Harvard Square should contribute to the commercial vitality of the area. Uniformity of 
signs and conformance to conjectural "historic" designs will be discouraged. However, signs should 
not obscure any original architectural features of the structure on which they are located. Signs 
should be fastened to structures in the least destructive way possible.14  
 
 
The Cambridge Historical Commission has binding jurisdiction over size, materials, dimensions, 
illumination, and appearance of new or altered signs.15 However, signs that conform to the provi-
sions of Article 7.00 of the zoning code are exempt from review. Decorative banners and temporary 
signs are prohibited unless specifically approved "subject to such conditions as to duration of use, 
dimension, location, lighting, removal and similar matters as the commission may reasonably spec-
ify."16 
 

f. 

Architectural lighting. 

 
Urban lighting, including architectural or building façade lighting, streetscape lighting, and signage 
lighting, impacts the quality of the 24-hour environment. Lighting can be a positive feature in some 
urban environments, but with current technology can become objectionable through excessive

Sandwich board signs are subject to permitting by the Department of Public Works when placed on a 
sidewalk and will not be subject to Conservation District review. 
Content, color, and graphics used on signs - the commercial message - will be exempt from review 
in the Conservation District.

brightness, motion, or inappropriate highlighting of architectural features. 
 
Lighting goals are intended to enhance the quality of the streetscape, highlight unique architectural 
details, minimize light trespass, preserve dark skies, and conserve energy. Currently architectural 
lighting is regulated only through the appearance of the fixtures; the quality and intensity of the 
light, changing light effects over time, and the architectural features to be illuminated are not regu-
lated.  

Architectural (building façade) lighting, streetscape lighting, and signage lighting, when allowed by 
a Certificate of Appropriateness, should reinforce definitive characteristics of historic and contem-
porary architecture as well as create high-quality 24-hour streetscapes. To achieve these goals, pro-
jects should minimize brightness and light trespass, monitor color temperature, and focus lighting 
on significant features. Minimizing brightness while highlighting unique architectural details will 
conserve energy, reduce trespass, and enhance dark skies. To define and enhance the after-dark 
streetscape, consideration should be given to low-brightness building façade lighting as an alterna-
tive to brighter street lights. 

C. 

Public Spaces 

 
 
 
Municipal and utility company modifications to sidewalks, streets, and street furniture are subject to 
the jurisdiction of the Cambridge Historical Commission. Review will be undertaken with consider-
ation to the appropriateness of such materials and structures as paving and curbing, light standards, 
traffic and parking structures and signs, and utility structures visible at or above grade from any 
public way. In practice the Commission has declined to address striping and temporary barriers 
such as flex posts for bicycle paths.  
 
Proposals for permanent public art installations, whether private donations or public projects, will 
be referred to the Cambridge Public Art Commission for a recommendation in accordance with es-
tablished city policies.17  For the purposes of conservation district review, three-dimensional art-
works will be considered to be structures, and murals will be considered to be signs if they contain 
an explicit message. In general, such installations must also be found to be appropriate or not incon-
gruous for their setting and for the district as a whole. 

17 See "City of Cambridge Art Gifts and Donations Policy", adopted May 17, 1999, and Chapter 2.114 of the 
City Code, "Public Development Arts Projects."

Amended Description and Guidelines for Subdistricts 

Harvard Square/Massachusetts Avenue 
Bow Street and Arrow Street/Putnam Square 
The Gold Coast 

The 1986 Development Guidelines divided the Harvard Square Overlay District into six subdistricts 
based on architectural characteristics, historical development patterns, and modern usage trends. 
Subdistrict descriptions and goals were included in the 2000 Report as part of the guidelines for the 
Harvard Square conservation district and for continued administration of the Overlay District. The 
2019 Study Committee supported a renewed emphasis on reviewing applications for alterations, 
demolition, and new construction in the context of the following restated subdistrict goals  
 
Because Harvard Square is such a diverse environment, defining the context of subdistricts is im-
portant both in developing long-range planning goals and in making determinations of appropriate-
ness for alterations to the physical environment. This study supports a finer division of the district 
into seven subdistricts: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The subdistricts do not have precise boundaries, as the characteristics of neighboring subdistricts 
tend to overlap. In considering some sites, the guidelines for more than one subdistrict should be 
considered together and weighed according to the individual needs of the site. 
 
A description of the unique qualities of each subdistrict and specific goals for each follows. The de-
scription is organized with a historical and physical description and is followed by a focused discus-
sion on the treatment of public spaces and private sites. A site map accompanies each description. 
Specific goals for each subdistrict have been identified to help boards and applicants apply the gen-
eral goals and guidelines of the larger district to the special needs and circumstances of a particular 
site. Revisions to this document include updating the discussions of private development sites, sum-
marizing recent discussions for improvements of public spaces, expanding the discussion of site and 
architectural history, and reinforcing the recommendations for preservation of significant structures.

Harvard Square subdistrict  

 

 

 

 

  
Google Maps ©2019 

Description 

This subdistrict includes Harvard Square proper and the 
south side of Massachusetts Avenue as far as Quincy 
Square. The area marks the intersection of town and 
gown, with Harvard Yard on the north side of Massachu-
setts Avenue and mixed-use commercial, office, and resi-
dential structures on the south side. In the early years of 
settlement, the area was an open space north of the grid-
patterned town, south of the Burial Ground, and adjacent 
to Harvard Yard. In the mid-17th century civic buildings 
appeared on the Square. For over 200 years, development 
in Harvard Square proper has been characterized by 
mixed uses. Residences, college buildings, meeting-
houses, courthouses, and a market building were con-

Boundaries of the Conservation District (blue) and the 
Overlay District (red) 

structed around the Square in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Massachusetts Avenue from 
Dunster Street to Quincy Square was developed in the 19th century with mixed-use private dormito-
ries and student clubs and continues to serve students with retail stores and services. The MBTA 
subway station reflects Harvard Square's long history as a transportation hub.

Harvard Square, with the Abbot Building (1909, center) 

Three- to five-story structures built out to the sidewalk predominate on the south and west sides of 
Massachusetts Avenue at Harvard Square. These include the Cambridge Savings Bank, the Read 
Block, the Abbot Building, 1-8 Brattle Street, the Harvard Cooperative Society, College House, and 
the Harvard Square Kiosk. Of these, the Abbot Building (1909) pioneered the Georgian Revival 
Style that was recommended in 1913 by the Harvard Square Business Association as appropriate 
for a collegiate business center. Certain mid-twentieth-century structures, such as the Smith Cam-
pus Center and the Bank of America (former Harvard Trust Company) facade, have attained their 
own significance. The mixed-use dormitories and clubs further east on Massachusetts Avenue are 
of great architectural and historic significance. The smaller scale buildings on the side streets down 
to Mt. Auburn Street vary in quality and significance but provide a valuable context for the grander 
architecture on the avenue and on the Gold Coast. Retention of the small retail storefronts that add 
vitality to the streetscape should be a high priority, along with returning bank storefronts to retail 
use.

Public Spaces  
 
Public spaces in this area include the plaza around the Kiosk and the Harvard Station headhouse, 
Forbes Plaza (now designated the Moise Y Safra Plaza) at the Smith Campus Center, and sidewalks 
in various states of repair. Harvard Yard, a semi-public space, abuts the conservation district but is 
under the jurisdiction of the Old Cambridge Historic District. 
 
The 2000 Study Committee Report recommended that “all publicly-accessible open spaces on pri-
vate and public properties should be preserved. The public space in the center of Harvard Square 
should be well maintained for the general enjoyment and safety of its pedestrian users. The materi-
als and design of the public space at the center of the Square can be used as a reference when de-
signing future improvements to open spaces in the district.”  
 

Harvard Square Kiosk and Plaza 
 
The plaza around the kiosk was designed by the MBTA in 1979-80 and completed in 1984. The de-
sign vocabulary – wire cut brick sidewalks, granite feature strips and bollards, and Washington-
style light fixtures – was carried over to the west side of the Square and down Brattle and Eliot 
streets to Bennett Street. The sidewalks from Church Street to Bennett Street were rebuilt with 
wire-cut clay pavers for enhanced accessibility about 2010. Forbes Plaza was reconstructed in 
2017-18 pursuant to a Certificate of Appropriateness. The plaza around the headhouse and the kiosk 
itself are in the later stages of a redesign to provide greater public access to these public assets.

As evidenced by the Read Block development (1997) and the recently-approved redevelopment of 
the Abbot Building, substantial development potential still exists in the heart of the Square and 
along Massachusetts Avenue. Rehabilitation of existing structures should be the highest priority; 
there are no “soft” sites in the subdistrict where demolition and new construction could be consid-
ered. The possibility of rooftop additions to existing buildings seems unlikely, but any such pro-
posals should be handled with great care to preserve the massing of existing buildings. Even some 
modest buildings in the subdistrict exhibit architectural interest and should be treated with respect 
when considering alterations.

Historical photographs can often be valuable references for facade restoration or rehabilitation pro-
jects. The collections of the Historical Commission are a good starting point for research. The reha-
bilitation of the Read Block included restoration of the 1896 facade, renovation of the forward por-
tions of the original structures, and construction of a new 3-story structure behind them. The reno-
vated space accommodates both retail and office uses.

Retention of the small-scale retail environment with narrow storefronts and interesting signs should 
be encouraged in this subdistrict. Careful attention should be paid to materials, storefront design, 
and signage. The 1907 Art Nouveau storefront at 1304 Massachusetts Avenue by Coolidge & Carl-
son is an example of exceptional storefront design. The unique lines, transparency, and high-quality 
materials of this storefront can be used as an example of a creative, contemporary approach to retail 
design in the district. Not every new storefront design in the Square can or should aim to be this 
unique, but some demonstrate the timelessness of an exceptional design. Removal of incompatible 
materials and restoration of original elements, as at 1300-1310 Massachusetts Avenue, can rein-
force traditional character while supporting commercial vitality.

Bow and Arrow Streets/Putnam Square Subdistrict  

 

 

 

 

Google Maps ©2019 

 

Description 
 
This subdistrict includes properties on Bow Street and Arrow 
Street and along the converging lines of Massachusetts Ave-
nue and Mount Auburn Street from Quincy Square to Re-
mington Street and the edge of Putnam Square. Putnam 
Square proper and the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue 
and Mount Auburn Street are in the Harvard Square Overlay 
District but are not within the boundaries of the Harvard 
Square Conservation District. 
 
The subdistrict is characterized by a dizzying variety of 
building types, styles, and functions. St. Paul’s and Old 
Cambridge Baptist churches overlook apartment buildings, 
tiny residences, and a massive former manufacturing facility, 
the former Reversible Collar factory. Wood-frame homes 
abut modern office buildings. Along Massachusetts Avenue 
most buildings include retail on the ground floor, but there 
are currently no retail uses along Mt. Auburn Street.

Bow and Arrow Streets/Putnam Square Subdistrict  
 
The tallest structures in this subdistrict are the campanile of St. Paul's Catholic Church, the spire of 
the Old Cambridge Baptist Church (in the Mid Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District), 
and the residential tower at 1105 Massachusetts Avenue. The locations of these towers correspond 
with the triangular boundaries of the subdistrict. The careful siting of the Old Cambridge Baptist 
Church at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Harvard Street allows the spire to be seen 
from several viewpoints, making it a prominent landmark in historic and contemporary photo-
graphs. The transition from Putnam Square to the residential scale of the Kerry Corner/Riverside 
neighborhood is evident along Mount Auburn Street.  
 
Historically, this area included small residences, light industry, and churches. Though industries are 
no longer active, the former Reversible Collar factory at 8-20 Arrow Street and 21-27 Mount Au-
burn Street is still a dynamic structure that was adaptively re-used for retail and office space in the 
late 1960s, renovated through the federal tax act program in the mid-1980s, and restored again in 
the mid-2000s. The large mixed-use buildings in Putnam Square went up mostly in the mid-1970s, 
replacing one-story storefronts. Construction of the Sundance Residences at 1075 Massachusetts 
Avenue in 2011 (in the Overlay District, but not in the Conservation District) completed the modern 
build-out of Putnam Square.

Public Spaces 

The largest public space in this subdistrict is Quincy Square, which was redesigned and landscaped 
in 1997. The project's purpose was to enhance the area for pedestrians while maintaining vehicular 
access. This project was a particularly successful collaboration between a landscape architect (The 
Halvorson Company) and an artist (David Phillips). The ad-hoc Quincy Square Design Review 
Committee reviewed the design, in which plantings of trees, shrubs, perennials, ground covers, and 
grasses along with stone walls, boulders and sculptures replaced what had been a wide-open area of 
bare pavement. The design remains functional and attractive and constitutes a model for other pro-
jects to emulate.

Putnam Square, a very busy traffic intersection, did not contain many amenities for pedestrians until 
1998. The small, minimally-landscaped islands calm traffic and provide a pedestrian refuge but are 
not as lushly landscaped as Quincy Square. The publicly-owned gore at the corner of Arrow Street 
and Massachusetts Avenue was landscaped by the city in 1991 after an unsuccessful attempt by an 
abutting restaurant to privatize it. It receives minimal maintenance and represents an opportunity for 
enhancement. 
 
Sidewalks throughout the subdistrict are a mixture of traditional brick and concrete, with accessible 
curb cuts patched in. Future sidewalk replacements should incorporate clay pavers for accessibility.

Veritas Hotel, 1131 Massachusetts Avenue 

Private Sites 
 
The major development sites identified in the 1986 guide-
lines have since been developed. The Inn at Harvard re-
placed a former filling station in 1990 and a mixed-use 
building at Zero Arrow Street went up on an open site in 
2005. The significant 1907 concrete garage at 1230 Mas-
sachusetts Avenue was redeveloped with two new stories 
above a restored original façade in 2002. An unanticipated 
development occurred in 2007 with the construction of the 
Veritas Hotel at 1131 Massachusetts Avenue. The design 
for this project, which was substantially a replica of an 
1869 Mansard altered in 1893, conformed to few district 
guidelines, although it does support the eclectic nature of 
the subdistrict. 
 
The Old Cambridge Baptist Church spire and St. Paul's bell tower are important landmarks with 
sightlines that should be respected by any new development. The development potential at St. Paul's 
Church was largely met in the late 1980s, with the construction of the p choir school. 
 
Several clusters of low-rise frame and brick buildings represent opportunities for site accumulation 
and redevelopment that threaten the character of the subdistrict. Near the intersection of Massachu-
setts Avenue and Bow Street a group of small-scale frame and brick buildings represents a 140-year 
span of residential and commercial building construction in Harvard Square. The earliest buildings 
in the cluster, 12 Bow Street (ca. 1820) and 
1208 Massachusetts Avenue (1842), are ex-
amples of residential buildings that were 
later converted to commercial uses. Other 
clusters occur at the intersection of Arrow 
Street and Massachusetts Avenue (two 
buildings) and at 1112-1134 Massachusetts 
Avenue (six buildings). Some buildings in 
the latter group have little or no signifi-
cance, but any replacements should be care-
fully evaluated for compatibility with the 
eclectic character of the subdistrict. Here 
and elsewhere, some wood frame buildings 
have been covered with artificial siding, but 
their original character is easily recovera-
ble.

Denser development should be confined to Putnam Square. The industrial character of the Reversi-
ble Collar complex should be protected. The quiet, residential character along Mount Auburn Street 
should be maintained, and the wood-frame structures there should be preserved. Development or 
adaptive re-use proposals should be sensitive to the fact that a transition from commercial to resi-
dential uses occurs in this subdistrict.

Cambridge GIS, 2014 

Description 

The Gold Coast subdistrict includes Mount Auburn Street from Bow and DeWolfe streets west to 
Winthrop Park and the side streets north toward Massachusetts Avenue and south toward the River 
houses. This area was initially developed in the 1830s-60s as a residential neighborhood and re-
flects to a significant degree the layering of historical development trends in Harvard Square. The 
neighborhood also constitutes and important buffer between the commercial activity along Massa-
chusetts Avenue and the institutional precinct of the River Houses. 
 

 The Gold Coast designation reflects the private lux-
ury dormitories and undergraduate clubs that were 
constructed during the last quarter of the nineteenth 
century for affluent undergraduates. Most of the pri-
vate dormitories were acquired by Harvard Univer-
sity in the 1920s and incorporated into Adams 
House; others were converted to apartments. Some 
clubs were designed to accommodate commercial 
activities or were later altered for this purpose.

Before the district was established many of the Harvard clubs donated preservation easements to the 
City, granting review of alterations to the Historical Commission.18 Several former club buildings 
now belong to the university. Commercial activities are a mixture of restaurants and service estab-
lishments, but lack the intensity of Harvard or Brattle squares or JFK Street. A significant number 
of early 19th-century houses are interspersed between the dormitories, clubs, and institutional build-
ings, but almost all have been repurposed for other uses. 

Public Spaces 

The triangular David Halberstam Park at the intersection of Mt. Auburn and Bow Streets was cre-
ated in the early 2000s by enclosing a previously undifferentiated area of pavement in front of the 
Harvard Lampoon. Further alterations to the landscape and transportation plan should respect the 
historic street pattern. Street trees, which would be an important enhancement in this dense subdis-
trict, cannot be maintained in the vicinity of the Lampoon building. The adjacent open lot on Mt. 
Auburn Street in front of Lowell House owned by Harvard University provides the only expanse of 
green in the subdistrict. 

Private courtyards in the Gold Coast subdistrict, though not open to the public, provide a welcome 
relief to the otherwise dense area. Property owners should be encouraged to preserve these spaces 
and upgrade their paving and landscaping materials. Free passage into the courtyard in front of the 
Apthorp House should be maintained as feasible so that this historically-important structure remains 
visible to the public.  

18 Clubs are assessed as commercial enterprises, leading to ruinous valuations until the area was downzoned in the late 
1990s. The restrictions remain in effect. The level of regulation in these instances follows the strictest measure.

Private Sites 
 
Though buildings in the Gold Coast are predominantly of masonry construction, several significant 
examples of wood frame construction remain. Among the most vulnerable may be 20 and 22 Ho-
lyoke Street; the Greek Revival house (once a student club, now offices) at 43-45 Mount Auburn 
Street; a long-unoccupied Greek Revival at 41 Winthrop Street and an adjoining vacant lot owned 

 

by Harvard University; and 
a trio of houses at 69 and 
71-77 Dunster Street and 
17 South Street, also 
owned by the university. 
These and other wood-
frame houses contribute 
greatly to the rich character 
of the subdistrict, and their 
preservation should be 
given a high priority.

Alterations to the club buildings on 
the south side of Mount Auburn 
Street to enable commercial develop-
ment should continue to be carefully 
regulated, and when commercial uses 
are abandoned (as at 76 Mt. Auburn 
Street in 2019) the structures should 
be restored to their original appear-
ance. Restoration and renovation of 
existing storefronts along Mount Au-
burn Street are encouraged. Any new

Harvard’s lot on Mount Auburn Street at the corner of Holyoke Place, its parking lot at 19 South 
Street, and its lot at 41 Winthrop Street, as well as the privately-owned one-story commercial build-
ings at 45½-49 Mount Auburn Street are the most obvious potential development sites to monitor. 
New construction on these sites should be carefully evaluated to ensure that the projects respect 
their immediate context in terms of materials, massing, and placement. For example, Rosovsky 
Hall, the Harvard Hillel Center at 56 Mount Auburn Street, was designed by architect Moshe Safdie 
in 1993 to complement the Fly Club and the Harvard Lampoon.

The Library Services building at 90 Mt. Auburn Street was the result of a development process that 
initially disregarded the context of the site, as described above. While a vast improvement over the 
original proposal, the height, bulk, and design of the building are not consistent with the goal of 
maintaining this subdistrict as a buffer zone between the commercial district and the River Houses.

Winthrop Square/JFK Street subdistrict 

 

 

 

 

 

Cambridge GIS 2014 

Description 

John F. Kennedy Street is a primary entry to Harvard Square from Memorial Drive and Boston. The 
subdistrict includes the properties around Winthrop Square, nearby on Winthrop Street, and on JFK 
Street from Eliot Street to Harvard Square. At the center is Winthrop Square Park, an unbuilt house 
lot in the 1630 settlement of Newtowne that was a public marketplace in the eighteenth and early 
nineteenth centuries; it was enclosed as a park in 1834. Buildings in the subdistrict represent an 

1.4.b

46 

 

eclectic mix of architecture that spans 200 years of Cambridge history. Almost all, including those 
originally built as residences, now have storefronts, and the district sustains a high level of commer-
cial activity. Several buildings originated as undergraduate clubhouses, and to some extent the sub-
district shares the urban character and development goals of the Gold Coast.  
 
Two large buildings – the Galeria at 57 JFK and the Harvard Square Garage at the corner of Eliot 
Street – occupy sites that were cleared for filling stations in the 1920s and offered uncharacteristi-
cally generous lots for redevelopment later in the 20th century. The Galeria (1974) was built in the 
late International Style as a pedestrian mall, but never matched the success of The Garage (1972), 
an adaptive reuse of a former parking garage, and has been remodeled with street-facing storefronts. 
The dark, recessed storefronts of the Harvard Square Garage have been less successful than was 
hoped, while the eclectic mélange of converted three-deckers opposite has continued to thrive as 
this character has disappeared elsewhere.  
 

 

 

Winthrop Square Park, with the Harvard Square Parking Garage (1985), the Galeria (1974), the former Pi Eta Club 
(1908), the Chapman Heirs house (1868), and the Winthrop condominium (1997).  
 
The mixed-use redevelopment of the buildings facing Winthrop Square in 1995-97 was a model of 
restoration, adaptive reuse, and sensitive infill construction. The relocation of the Chapman Heirs' 
House to face Winthrop Square and the renovation of the former Pi Eta Club (Grendel's Den/Pars-
nip) at 91 Winthrop Street secured the setting of this important open space.  
 
The 18th century wall that runs behind the properties on Winthrop, Eliot, and South Streets is a criti-
cally-important artifact of early development in Harvard Square and should be protected and ex-
posed to public view in any future development.

Public Spaces 
 
Winthrop Square achieved its present 
form in 1985, when a ten-foot wide strip 
of JFK Street was returned to turf and 
grass, the pathways through the park 
were returned to an earlier configuration, 
and a new post-and-rail fence was in-
stalled along the perimeter. A public art-
work, designed by Carlos Dorrien, 
stands at the center. The park is perhaps 
the most heavily used green space in 
Cambridge and requires constant atten-
tion from adjacent property owners and 
the Department of Public Works to 
maintain the lawn and remove trash. De-
spite the heavy use, no further expansion 
of pavement should be permitted. Pro-
posals for additional features or struc-
tures that might clutter the small space or 
attract more visitors should be resisted.

Photo 2014. 

About 1990 the block of Winthrop 
Street between JFK Street and Eliot 
Square was reconstructed as a pedes-
trian precinct; passenger vehicles were 
excluded and deliveries were limited to 
morning hours. The project reduced 
traffic congestion on this narrow his-
toric street, enhancing the pedestrian 
experience and making it a safer place. 
Most of JFK and Mt. Auburn streets 
were reconstructed with new sidewalks 
in 2015-2018, with no serious deficien-
cies remaining except at the corner of 
Brattle Street, where the sidewalk will 
be reconfigured as the Abbot Building 
is redeveloped.

There are no vacant lots in the subdistrict and few if any sites with obvious development potential if 
present buildings are preserved. The important 18th and 19th century houses at 96, 98, and 106 Win-
throp Street are underdeveloped but are largely protected as individual landmarks or through preser-
vation restrictions. Further development of these sites should be sensitive to the limitations of the 
small, wood-frame houses. The three-deckers at 52-54 and 56 JFK Street could be vulnerable to re-
development, but preservation of these wood frames should be among the highest priorities of the 
District. The Fox Club at the corner of Mt. Auburn 
Street offers a calming presence and could not be ap-
propriately converted to retail use. 
 
Storefront and signage designs vary widely along JFK 
Street. While the bold two-color striped siding on the 
triple-deckers at 52-56 JFK Street is valued as a prod-
uct of its era and for its eccentricity, similar treatment 
of other wood-frame buildings in the Square should be 
carefully evaluated. 
 
Aggressive signage can be noted throughout the subdis-
trict, from the eclectic collection seen on the JFK Street 
triple-deckers to the integral signage program devel-
oped for The Garage. New proposals for signage 
should follow the general design guidelines for the dis-
trict, but it would not be out of character for signs in 
this subdistrict to be more dynamic than in the quieter 
subdistricts of the Square such as the Gold Coast.

Description 

Eliot Square (as the intersection of Mt. Auburn and Eliot streets is known) was created in 1809 
when Mt. Auburn Street was extended across the old village and the William Brattle estate toward 
Watertown. This urban fringe area on the southwest corner of the village facing the Ox Marsh con-
tained few healthful building sites. Except for a municipal office building on the corner of Mt. Au-
burn put up in 1875, it saw little development until the end of the 19th century, when the street rail-
way company began to build car barns and stables there. By 1912 the Boston Elevated Railway oc-
cupied over ten acres of land for transit purposes. 

 The development potential of the southwest sector was 
widely recognized. In 1959 a city-owned parking lot was 
developed with a motel on stilts, and in the 1960s a bitter 
dispute over the proposed John F. Kennedy Presidential Li-
brary drew national attention to the area. In 1974 the site 
was divided between a public park, the Kennedy School of 
Government, and a private development that became 
Charles Square in 1984. The adjacent University Place and 
University Green projects occupied other former industrial 
sites about the same time. 

 

Boundaries of the Conservation District (blue) and 
the Overlay District (red) 

Development pressures soon began to be felt in this some-
what neglected corner of the Square. Proposals to redevelop 
the Harvard Square Hotel and the three Robert Banker prop-
erties at 12, 14 and16 Eliot Street were scuttled by neighbor-
hood opposition, but in 1990 a fire destroyed the latter prop-
erty, a three-decker, and it was replaced by a two story “placeholder,” as the owner put it. Belmont 
Hall at 121 Mt. Auburn Street (site of the popular Blue Parrot Restaurant) fell in 1987, to be re-
placed by an office building, and Harvard allowed The Craigie (also known as Craigie Arms), an 
apartment building on the corner of University Road, to deteriorate until it was finally repurposed 
as affordable housing in the 1990s. In 2013 the Historical Commission allowed the wood frame for-
mer Trinity Hall dormitory (most recently occupied by a Chili’s Restaurant) to be demolished for 
an office building in a consolidated development site that subsidized the restoration of the 1912 
Conductor’s Building, the last remaining structure associated with the construction of the Cam-
bridge Subway. 

Public Spaces 

Public spaces in this subdistrict consist of sidewalks and the paved plazas created by reconfiguring 
streets after the construction of the Red Line Extension in 1979-83. An abandoned subway tunnel 
under Eliot Street creates some awkward grade changes masked by planters, but accessibility 
throughout most of the area is adequate. Deficient sidewalks between Bennett Street and JFK Street 
are to be rebuilt in 2019. The plaza in front of the Harvard Motor Inn offers an opportunity to im-
prove a public space currently occupied as a bus stop.

Potential development sites in this subdistrict include the remaining Banker properties at 12-14 and 
14A Eliot Street, but these are wood frame buildings dating from 1869 and 1900 which, if restored, 
would contribute greatly to the character of the subdistrict.  

The placeholder building at 16 
Eliot was approved for a three-
story rooftop addition in 2014, 
but the permits have lapsed. This 
site is flanked by the blank wall 
of the Harvard Square Garage 
and the three-story 14 Eliot 
Street and faces the Post-Modern 
style Taubman Hall, creating a 
complex context for any de-
signer.

Harvard Square Hotel (1959, H.E. Davidson & Son, architects)  

 

 

 

CHC photo, 2019 

The Harvard Square Hotel represents a complex development opportunity for the owner, Harvard 
University. The site was originally a municipal building that was demolished in the 1930s, and the 
City retains ownership of the ground-level parking lot. The open deck over the parking lot presents 
as a dark void to pedestrians, and the hotel might be considered to have limited preservation value. 
Complete redevelopment of the site might present opportunities for a major enhancement of the 
site, but the bulk, massing, and ground floor treatment should be carefully controlled so as not to 
duplicate the overbearing presence of One Brattle Square. 

Perhaps the most vulnerable site in the subdistrict is the 14,000 sq. foot. property that contains 17 
Story Street (1846) and 127-129 Mt. Auburn Street (1912). The house at 17 Story is a rare Regency 
Style house that is historically significant as the home late in life of Harriet Jacobs (1813-1897), au-
thor of the slave narrative, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861). The Jacobs house awkwardly 
shares the lot with a 1912 three-decker and suffers from years of deferred maintenance. It shares a 
C-2 residential zoning district with the west side of Story Street, which would allow much greater 
density and height than the present buildings.

Subdistrict F:  Brattle Square 

Brattle Street and Brattle Square from the south. 

Brattle Street and Brattle Square from the north 

 

 

 

 

Cambridge GIS, 2014 

Description 

This subdistrict includes buildings along Brattle Street from Harvard Square through Brattle Square 
to Hilliard Street. 
 
Brattle Street from Harvard Square to Brattle Square followed the Town Creek around the base of 
the drumlin on which Newtowne was settled and turned toward Watertown at the Town Spring. It 
was the main road west until the turnpike era, when Mount Auburn Street penetrated the village 
through the former Brattle estate. By 1840, it seemed that a neighborhood of homes would be built 
near the William Brattle mansion (42 Brattle Street), but the residential character of Brattle Square

changed when the Brattle House, a 106-room hotel, was constructed there in 1849. Brattle Square, 
Palmer Street, and Church Street became the favored locations for stables, blacksmiths, carriage 
shops, and saloons. The hotel soon failed and became the University Press printing plant. A filling 
station, a bank, and a department store occupied the site until 1990, when One Brattle Square was 
constructed. 

 
After World War I the Harvard Square shopping district ex-
panded to include Brattle Square, where a new post office 
was built in 1919 and the Sage family put up a Georgian Re-
vival-style market in 1926. George Dow assembled most of 
the remaining frontage on Brattle Street between Palmer and 
Church streets, which was occupied by a collection of store-
fronts and one substantial building at 11-25 Brattle Street. 
By 1941 the Dows had removed the upper stories of 17-25 
Brattle Street and refaced the entire row with a cast-stone 
Art Moderne facade. These and other properties owned by 
the Dow-Stearns Trust, including 1-8 Brattle Street, 14 and 
18 Brattle Street, and 5 J.F. Kennedy Street (the Abbot 

Boundaries of the Conservation District (blue) 
and the Overlay District (red) 

Building) remained under the same management until 2015, when the Trust sold the Abbot Build-
ing and its neighbors. The former Corcoran’s department store/Urban Outfitters building at 14 Brat-
tle will be razed in 2019 and replaced with a new mixed-use building. 
 

 

 

 

 

Dow-Stearns Block, 17-37 Brattle Street.  
 
In Brattle Square proper, the old Hadley building burned in 1972 and was replaced in 1974 with the 
Modernist New Hadley Building with recessed split-level storefronts, as encouraged by the zoning 
at that time. This awkward configuration would benefit from a complete re-working. Across Mt. 
Auburn Street, the Coolidge Bank Building of 1983 incorporated a recessed ground-floor arcade, 
but with city encouragement this gloomy feature was filled with storefronts in the 1990s.

New Hadley Building, 28-36 Brattle Street (1974), and the Coolidge Bank Building, 104 Mt. Auburn Street (1983), as 
remodeled with arcade enclosed. CHC photos 2009. 
 

 

One Brattle Square replaced an 
Art Deco bank and a department 
store in 1990. This building was 
bitterly opposed (and long de-
layed) by the Harvard Square De-
fense Fund but remains an object 
lesson for the limitations of de-
sign review. Although the build-
ing is lower and steps back more 
aggressively than required by the 
zoning envelope, it still over-
whelms the Square. More im-
portantly, the multiple storefront

openings required by the Planning Board under its Special Permit review have been almost com-
pletely ignored by the owners, who have preferred to rent large floor plates rather than to the small 
retailers that inhabit the Dow-Stearns stores across the Square. This issue resurfaced during the 
CHC’s review of the Read Block restoration in 2000 and again in 2016 with regard to the replace-
ment of the Corcoran’s/Urban Outfitters building. While the community expressed a strong prefer-
ence for a ground floor that could be rented to multiple small tenants, the Commission could only 
require that entrances be provided in the design.

West of Brattle Square the stabilizing 
non-profit ownership of the William 
Brattle House and the careful steward-
ship of Brattle Hall, occupied by the 
Brattle Theater and a café, preserved 
those historic properties while almost 
the entire remainder of the block began 
to be transformed in the 1960s. Prior to 
redevelopment this was an area of 
wood frame houses. Beginning with 
the construction of an office building 
on Story Street for The Architects Col-
laborative in 1966, six different archi-
tecture firms put up office buildings 
for their own use on Story Street and 
Mifflin Place. These created the spine 
of a through-block pedestrian passage-
way, the Brattle Arcade, which 
evolved without a master plan of any 
sort. The arcade was completed by the construction of a new post office in 2001 and became an im-
portant lesson for incrementalism (as opposed to massive redevelopment schemes like the Smith 
Campus Center and One Brattle Square) and enabling pedestrian connections. 
 
The subdistrict is bounded in part by the apartment buildings on the west side of Story Street, which 
are in a residential zoning district and cannot be redeveloped for offices or retail. The Brattle Street 
frontage of this block is anchored by the historic Blacksmith House of the Cambridge Center for 
Adult Education, the scene of Longfellow’s famous poem and formerly occupied by the Window 
Shop, established to support refugees from Nazi Germany.  
 
Public Spaces 
 
In 1972 Brattle Street was narrowed to form a T intersection and to create the plaza and sidewalks 
in front of the Dow-Stearns block. The historic street pattern is still discernable by the strong visual 
effect of the curve of the buildings, which should be maintained in future. The terraced public space 
created by the awkward grade differences over the abandoned subway tunnel provides a buffer for 
pedestrians, and is now a vibrant part of the Square, providing space for street performances. Else-
where in the subdistrict most sidewalks were rebuilt to ADA standards in 2010. The sidewalk at the 
Abbot Building will be upgraded when construction is completed.

Brattle Street looking west from Brattle Square 

The abrupt introduction of separated bicycle lanes on Brattle Street in 2017 was accomplished with-
out public input and no discussion of design alternatives. The flex poles and mid-street parking are 
an awkward solution to a serious transportation safety issue and should be revisited. 
 
Mifflin Place, a dead-end off 
Mt. Auburn Street, is accessed 
by several branches of the 
through-block passageways 
but as presently designed is 
not friendly to pedestrians. 
Mifflin could be reimagined 
as a shared street.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Private Sites 
 
The site in this subdistrict most likely to see additional development is the Dow-Stearns block at 
17-45½ Brattle Street, which changed hands in 2018. Preservation of the 1936-41 Moderne facades 
and the small shop fronts should be a high priority. Additional rooftop construction should be 
placed well back from the facades and should be recessive and deferential to the original design. 
Heights should not exceed that of the four-story Estes Building at 13-15 Brattle Street. A mid-block 
connection to Church Street might complement the subdistrict's public open spaces.

Cambridge GIS, 2014. 

 

The north (or west) side of Story Street contains a large stucco apartment building and several small 
houses. It is important that these buildings be preserved because the street is a transition point from 
the mixed-use character of Harvard Square to the primarily-residential nature of the Half Crown 
Neighborhood Conservation District. As noted above, the siting of 17 Story Street should be re-
spected.

Church and Palmer Streets from the north 

Church and Palmer Streets from the south 

 

 

 

 

 

Cambridge GIS, 2014 

Description 

This subdistrict includes both sides of Church and Palmer streets. Structures along the north side of 
Church Street from Massachusetts Avenue to the Church Street parking lot and the eastern half of 
Farwell Place have been protected by the Old Cambridge Historic District since 1964, but since 
2000 have been administered for all practical purposes under the guidelines of the Harvard Square 
Conservation District. The sites of the greatest historical significance in this small subdistrict are 
the First Parish Unitarian Universalist, the Burying Ground, the Torrey Hancock House/Cambridge 
School of Architecture building (53 Church Street), and the former police station at 31-33 Church 

 

Street.  
 

In the nineteenth century Palmer Street and Church Street were 
home to stables, blacksmiths, and carriage shops, and the outlet 
to Massachusetts Avenue was little more than an alley. This sec-
tion of Church Street was widened in 1926 at the expense of 
College House and 26 Church Street, which both received new 
north facades.  
 
The former industrial character of the subdistrict has been suc-
cessfully translated to other uses. The former carriage factory at 
26 Church Street (1857) serves as the home of Club Passim. The 
former police station (1864) has been occupied by a coffee shop 
and a hair salon. Another carriage factory at 23 Church Street 
was cut down to one story in 1936 and remodeled with a signifi-
cant Art Moderne façade, while a former auto garage, remodeled 
as a restaurant in 1947, was remodeled again in 2001 to expose 

Boundaries of the Conservation District 
(blue) and the Overlay District (red). Proper-
ties on the north side of Church Street and 
on Farwell Place (except Gutman Library) 
are in the Old Cambridge Historic District. 

 

the lintel of the Cambridge 1 fire company that once occupied the site. 
 
The Harvard Square Theater was built in 1925 with its lobby in a storefront in College House fac-
ing Massachusetts Avenue. The blank wall of the theater on Church Street was enlivened when the 
entrance was moved there in 1982, but activity on the street has suffered since the theater closed in 
2012.  
 
Public Spaces 
 
In the early 1960s a proposal to close Palmer Street was defeated by community opposition, and the 
street was paved with granite blocks and curbstones and brick sidewalks in 1964-67. The recessed 
storefront of the Coop Annex did little to enliven the street, and rising standards for accessibility led 
the city to rebuild it as a shared street with illuminated “Palmer Blocks” in 2005. This urban design 
improvement added interest to the narrow side street, but Palmer remains a work in progress – a 
useful pedestrian cut-through with little to interest passersby. Sidewalks on the south side of Church 
Street were widened in the early 2000s but are still quite narrow on the north side. 
 
Private Sites 
 
The Church Street parking lot is an obvious potential development site. Abutting the parking lot on 
the west is the 1827 Torrey Hancock house. The Cambridge School of Architecture and Landscape 
Architecture addition to the Hancock house is an important site in American women's history; both 
structures are historically significant and should be preserved. Any new development on the parking 
lot site should emphasize retail storefronts, and the mass should be broken up to avoid a severe 
street presence. The architecture of a new building should take cues from the scale, massing, and 
setbacks of the historic structures on either side of the lot. Special consideration should be given to 
the site’s relationship to the Old Burying Ground and the smaller-scale residences on Farwell Place.

The Church Street parking lot, the Torrey-Hancock house (1827), and the Cambridge School of Architecture (1928) 

 

In contrast to most of Harvard Square, the three commercial buildings on the north side of Church 
Street are in a BA (business) zoning district, with a 1.0 FAR and a 35’ height limit (or 1.75/85’ for 
residential use). The buildings are historically significant and unlikely to face development pressure 
due to zoning constraints. The two-story 1920s mixed-use buildings at 22-32 (Border Café) and 54-
66 (Sage Building) are in the BB district with a 4.0 FAR, and so might be seen as eligible to receive 
additional stories. The buildings themselves are of some architectural interest but also contain vi-
tally important spaces for small shops and restaurants.

A plan to replace the Harvard Square Theater with a new mixed-use building was announced in 
2018. A proposal reviewed by the Cambridge Historical Commission in September 2018 entailed a 
five-story building with a cutting-edge terra-cotta façade containing embedded LED lamps with the 
ability to display moving images. Two movie theaters would occupy the basement, with retail on 
the ground floor and offices above. The proposal was generally seen as a positive development for 
Church Street and the Square as a whole. The Commission did not object to the advanced design 
but continued the hearing until the proponent could fabricate a sample of the façade to demonstrate 
the lighting concept.  
 
The Harvard Square Theater site is also exposed to Palmer Street. While the property has a compli-
cated relationship with its abutters, it offers the opportunity to enliven its frontage there. The re-
cessed storefronts of the Coop Annex offer a greater opportunity to activate the street. The present 
arcade is dark and uninviting, and discourages window shopping. These storefronts could be built 
out to the building façade, affording the Coop more floor space and a much better exposure to pe-
destrians. Similar improvements were successfully accomplished at 9 Brattle Street (on the corner 
of Palmer) and 104 Mt. Auburn Street (see photo above).

VI.       Recommendations of the Study Committee, including Amendments to the Order Establish-

ing the District 

In general, the Study Committee supports the work of the Cambridge Historical Commission in ad-
ministering the Harvard Square Conservation District and reaffirms the purpose and utility of the 
district. Harvard Square is facing challenging circumstances in a high-value commercial real estate 
market and a changing retail sector. An effective conservation district can support and encourage 
retailers and mitigate adverse tendencies in the development industry. 

The Study Committee makes the following recommendations to the Historical Commission and the 
City Council: 

•  Update the goals and guidelines for the district through a City Council Order amending Par-
agraph III, “Statement of Goals and Guidelines and Standards for Review,” of the Order that 
established the District on December 18, 2000 (See Appendix B). 

•  Amend the Neighborhood Conservation District and Landmark Ordinance (Ch. 2.78, Art. 
III) to clarify jurisdiction over architectural lighting, broadly defined (See Appendix C). 

•  Amend the Harvard Square Overlay District so that the goals and guidelines for conserva-

tion district and zoning purposes remain identical. 

•  Amend Article 7.000 (Signs and Illumination) of the Zoning Ordinance to clarify jurisdic-

tion over interior signs meant to be visible from outside the building (7.13.1 and 7.16.22.C) 
and the application of translucent or opaque film containing graphics or corporate colors on 
display windows (7.16.12). 

The Study Committee also makes these recommendation to the Historical Commission regarding 
the administration of the District: 

•  Pay special attention to proposed alterations to significant buildings 

•  Consult subdistrict descriptions and guidelines in evaluating proposed alterations 

•  Refer to goals, secondary goals, and guidelines in making determinations, and cite them spe-

cifically in drafting motions to approve alterations. 

Other recommendations include the following: 

•  The Historical Commission should engage more frequently with other city departments, in-
cluding Community Development and the Department of Traffic, Parking & Transportation 
to advance its goals for Harvard Square.

Appendix A:   Original Order Establishing the Harvard Square Conservation District, Adopted De-

cember 18, 2000 

An Order Establishing the Harvard Square Conservation District 

 
There is hereby designated and established under the provisions of the Chapter 2.78, Article III of 
the City Code a neighborhood conservation district to be known as the Harvard Square Conserva-
tion District (the “District”), an area bounded as shown on the map entitled "Harvard Square Con-
servation District 2000," attached to this Order and incorporated into this Order in full. However, 
this Order shall not take effect until the effective time of an amendment to Section 11.50 of the 
Cambridge Zoning Code to create a Harvard Square Historic Overlay District. 
 
I. Reasons for Designation 
 
Harvard Square is Cambridge’s historic core and reflects the distinctive architectural, cultural, polit-
ical, economic, and social history of the city. Founded as Newtowne in 1630 and intended to be the 
capital of Massachusetts, Cambridge was the first planned town in English North America. Harvard 
Square still retains its 17th-century street plan, but has evolved into a distinctive mixed-use commu-
nity containing significant buildings of many periods and styles and characterized by its commer-
cial and social vitality. Pressures for change threaten the District’s diverse architectural character, 
which this measure seeks to preserve, conserve and protect from adverse environmental influences. 
The Order will accomplish this purpose by establishing a process for guiding changes to properties 
in the District while ensuring that additions and alterations to properties are compatible with the 
character of the District, by offering a forum for community dialogue about proposed changes to 
properties in the District, by providing technical assistance to District property owners on issues of 
conservation and preservation, and by fostering wider public appreciation of the District, and will 
thereby promote the public welfare by making the District a more attractive and desirable place in 
which to live, work, and visit.   
 
II. District Established 
 
As authorized in Paragraph A, Section 2.78.160 of Article III of the City Code, the neighborhood 
conservation district hereby established shall be administered by the Cambridge Historical Com-
mission. The District shall be known as the Harvard Square Conservation District.  
 
III. Statement of Goals and Standards and Guidelines for Review 
 
The goal of the District as a whole and of this order is to guide change and encourage diversity in 
order to protect the distinctive characteristics of the District’s buildings and public spaces, and to 
enhance the livability and vitality of the District for its residents and all Cambridge residents, stu-
dents, visitors, and business people. The Historical Commission should seek to preserve and en-
hance the unique functional environment and visual form of the District; preserve its architecturally 
and historically significant structures and their settings, and encourage design compatible therewith; 
mitigate any adverse impact of new development on adjacent properties and areas; and discourage 
homogeneity by maintaining the present diversity of development and open space patterns and 
building scales and ages. The District must remain a pedestrian-friendly, accessible, human-scale,

certificates of appropriateness, hardship, or nonapplicability, the Historical Commission shall be 
guided by the preceding general goal for the District as a whole and by such of the preceding sec-
ondary goals as it determines to be applicable to the project or situation before it. The Historical 
Commission shall also be guided by the standards and guidelines described in the “Final Report of 
the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee,” dated November 29, 
2000, which after public hearing the Historical Commission may adopt as regulations and thereafter 
amend from time to time. 
 
As permitted by Chapter 2.78.190.B, the Historical Commission may determine from time to time 
after public hearing that certain categories of exterior architectural features, structures, or signs may 
be altered without review by the Commission; provided, however, that every such alteration shall 
be determined by the Executive Director of the Historical Commission to conform to the regula-
tions adopted by the Commission for the administration of the District. 
 
IV. Review Procedures 
 
The authority of the Historical Commission shall extend to the review of all construction, demoli-
tion, or alteration that affects exterior architectural features, other than color, within the District, ex-
cept as otherwise provided in this Order.  The determinations of the Commission shall be binding. 
 
A. Exclusions from Review 
 
As permitted by Ch. 2.78.190.B, the authority of the Historical Commission shall not extend to the 
following categories of structures or exterior architectural features and such structures or features 
may be constructed or altered without review by the Historical Commission. 
 

  Storm doors and storm windows. 

• 
• 

Signs that conform to Section 7.000, “Signs and Illumination” of the Zoning Ordinance 
of the City of Cambridge, as the same may be amended with respect to Section 11.50, 
“Harvard Square Overlay District.” 

 
B. Certificates of Nonapplicability 
 
The following categories of alterations shall be issued a Certificate of Nonapplicability provided 
they conform to the applicable standards and guidelines of the District: 
 

• 
• 

Roof repairs and HVAC equipment not visible from a public way. 
Replacement windows pursuant to regulations that after public hearing the Historical 
Commission may adopt for this purpose. 

•      Alterations that the Executive Director of the Historical Commission determines do not 
alter, enclose, or extend further than the decorative or structural framework of the 
building or retail space originally intended to surround a storefront. The framework 
consists of such elements as piers, columns, cornerboards, quoins, cornices, and similar 
structural or decorative features. 

•      Storefront alterations that the Executive Director of the Historical Commission deter-
mines do not obscure, remove, relocate, or replace historic or original exterior

V. Protected Storefronts 
 
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Order, all alterations to storefronts at the following ad-
dresses shall require review in accordance with Ch.2.78, Article III: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
VI. Coordination with Other Agencies and Boards 
 
The Historical Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals, Inspectional Services Department, and other

VII. Public Notice 
 
In addition to the notice requirements in Ch. 2.78.230, applicants scheduled to appear before the 
Historical Commission in a public hearing shall place a public notification placard on the premises 
that are the subject of the application. Placards shall be posted not less than seven days prior to the 
meeting and shall be maintained in public view and legible condition until the Historical Commis-
sion’s determination is filed with the City Clerk.  Placards shall be obtained by the applicant from 
the Historical Commission and shall be located as indicated on a plan provided by the Historical 
Commission.  Placards shall be securely mounted on the subject premises at the street line or within 
the property, but not more than 20 feet from the street line, so as to be legible to persons passing on 
the public street without the necessity of trespassing.  Stolen, destroyed, or illegible placards shall 
be promptly replaced and placards shall be promptly removed after the filing of the Historical Com-
mission’s determination. Information to be placed by the applicant on the placard shall indicate the 
address of the property; the date, time, and place of the public hearing; the nature of the action re-
quested; and the application case number.   
 
VIII. Time Limit for Commission Action 
 
When taking action under the provisions of this Order and Sections 2.78.190, 2.78.200, 2.78.210, 
and 2.78.220 of Article III of Chapter 2.78, the Historical Commission shall make its determina-
tions within forty-five days after the filing of a complete application for a certificate of appropriate-
ness, non-applicability, or hardship, or within such further time as the applicant may in writing al-

Appendix B.   Proposed Amendment to “An Order Establishing the Harvard Square Conservation 

District,” adopted December 18, 2000 

 
Pursuant to the recommendation of the Cambridge Historical Commission under the provisions of 
Chapter 2.78, Article III of the City Code, the Order Establishing the Harvard Square Conservation 
District, adopted by the City Council on December 18, 2000 is hereby amended as follows: 
 
Article III, “Statement of Goals and Guidelines and Standards for Review,” is struck in its entirety 
and replaced by the following: 
 

III. Statement of Goals and Guidelines and Standards for Review  

The Goal of the District and of this Order is to protect the Harvard Square Conservation Dis-
trict’s distinctive physical and experiential characteristics and to enhance the livability and vital-
ity of the District. The Historical Commission should seek to enhance the unique physical envi-
ronment and visual form of the District; preserve its architecturally and historically significant 
structures and their settings; encourage creative design that contributes to the richness of its en-
vironment; mitigate character-diminishing impacts of new development; and discourage homo-
geneity by encouraging diversity of development and open space patterns and building scales 
and ages. The District must remain a pedestrian-friendly, accessible, human-scale, quirky, 
mixed-use environment that supports dynamic urban experiences, complements nearby neigh-
borhoods, and respects the history and traditions of its location. 
 
The following Secondary Goals for the District are intended to provide general guidance in a 
wide variety of situations, and are not intended to be applied to every project. They are state-
ments of policy, not prescriptive measures that must be applied equally in each situation. 
 

1.  Significant Buildings. Preserve historically or architecturally significant buildings and 
structures as well as those that contribute to the distinctive visual character or historical 
significance of the District. 
 

2.  Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment. Sustain the vitality of the commer-
cial environment while preserving architecturally-significant or original building fabric 
at street level and above. Encourage the restoration of missing features where these have 
been documented. Except for protected storefronts, encourage creative contemporary 
commercial design inside the restored framework of storefront openings. Encourage cre-
ative signage. Support below-grade commercial spaces where appropriate. Regardless of 
use, encourage architectural solutions that preserve storefront fabric, transparency, and 
utility. 

 
3.  Contemporary Design. Where context allows, support creative, contemporary design for 
new construction that complements the context of abutting buildings and enhances the 
character of the subdistrict. Recognize and respect well-reasoned contemporary design 
during the review process. Support innovative approaches to enhancing the unique char-
acter of Harvard Square while mitigating the detrimental impacts of development on 
proximate areas.

4.  Diversity of Form. Build on and sustain the diversity of existing building form, scale and 

material. Preserve and encourage appropriate green spaces, scale-appropriate open 
spaces, and new buildings that support the prevailing character of the subdistrict. Pre-
serve the remaining wood frame buildings throughout the District. Maintain a consistent 
setback or streetwall condition where that character has been set. Support small-scale 
storefronts to preserve the vitality and character of the streetscape.  

 
5.  Public Environment. Create a high-quality public environment in the District with com-
patible materials, lighting, signage, and street furniture such as bollards, benches, move-
able seating, and the like. Provide adequate facilities for trash and recycling and surfaces 
that can be cleaned and maintained. Encourage planted greenspaces and accommodate 
trees where possible. 

 
6.  Pedestrian Experience. Protect and enhance the pedestrian experience. Expand the net-
work of pedestrian walkways and paths wherever they can conveniently provide alter-
nate routes through the District. Increase public access to alleys and interior spaces 
where appropriate and upgrade the paving and landscaping of such spaces. Enhance ac-
cessibility and safety for pedestrians throughout the District.  

 
7.  Residential Development. Enhance the all-hours neighborhood quality of Harvard 

Square by supporting existing residential uses and encouraging additional residential 
units in mixed-use buildings. 

 
8.  Compatible Design. Encourage compatible design that supports a wide diversity of uses 
serving the needs of surrounding neighborhoods, students, workers and visitors from 
around the world. 

 
9.  Transportation. Encourage creative solutions to the District’s transportation issues by 

providing balanced accommodations for through and local traffic, cyclists, and pedestri-
ans. Promote smooth movement of traffic on through streets and seek creative design 
and management solutions for side streets where traffic volume and speeds can be regu-
lated to give highest priority to pedestrians. Provide adequate bicycle parking throughout 
the District. Protect pedestrian safety and experience through careful design and place-
ment of features such as loading docks, curb cuts, and receptacles for trash and recy-
cling. Encourage replacement of surface parking lots with compatible new structures. 
Discourage provision of on-site parking for new construction. 

 
10. Environmental Sustainability. Encourage environmentally sustainable development that 
takes into consideration the embodied energy of the existing built environment, material 
life cycles, passive design, energy conservation, and current standards for best energy 
conservation practices. Alterations to existing buildings that seek to promote energy 
conservation should be accomplished in a manner that respects character-defining mate-
rials and designs. 

 
11. Architectural lighting. Architectural (building façade) lighting, streetscape lighting, and 
signage lighting, when allowed by a Certificate of Appropriateness, should reinforce

definitive characteristics of historic and contemporary architecture as well as create high 
quality 24-hour streetscapes. To achieve these goals, projects should minimize bright-
ness, and light trespass, monitor light color (temperature Kelvin), and focus lighting on 
significant features. 

 
The foregoing goals also recite the standards for preservation and change within the District. In 
addition to the factors specified in Section 2.78.220, and subject to any specific provisions of 
this Order, in exercising its authority with respect to the District and in considering applications 
for certificates of appropriateness, hardship, or nonapplicability, the Historical Commission 
shall be guided by the preceding general goal for the District as a whole and by such of the pre-
ceding secondary goals as it determines to be applicable to the project or situation before it.  
 
The Historical Commission shall also be guided by the standards and guidelines described in the 
“Final Report of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee,” 
dated November 29, 2000, as amended by the “Final Report of the 2017-19 Harvard Square 
Conservation District Study Committee,” which after public hearing the Historical Commission 
may adopt as regulations and thereafter amend from time to time.  
 
In addition, the Historical Commission and project proponents shall consider the amended goals 
and guidelines specific to each of the seven subdistricts that make up the Harvard Square Con-
servation District.  The subdistrict goals and guidelines describe the physical and historical de-
velopment of each area over time, identify notable buildings and spaces, and set forth preserva-
tion priorities and recommendations for each sub-district. 
 
As permitted by Chapter 2.78.190.B, the Historical Commission may determine from time to 
time after public hearing that certain categories of exterior architectural features, structures, or 
signs may be altered without review by the Commission; provided, however, that every such 
alteration shall be determined by the Executive Director of the Historical Commission to con-
form to the regulations adopted by the Commission for the administration of the District.

Appendix E:   Excerpt from the Minutes of the Cambridge Historical Commission Meeting of 

 

March 2, 2017 

Minutes of the Cambridge Historical Commission  

March 2, 2017 - 795 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge City Hall - 6:00 P.M. 

Members present:  

William King, Chair; Bruce Irving, Vice Chair; Robert Crocker, Chandra Harrington ,  
Jo Solet, Members; Joseph Ferrara, Susannah Tobin, Alternates 

Members absent: 

William Barry, Member; Kyle Sheffield, Alternate 

Staff present: 

Charles Sullivan, Executive Director; Sarah Burks, Preservation Planner 

Harvard Square Conservation District, by petition of registered voters. Petition to initiate a 
study process to amend the terms of the Harvard Square Conservation District order.  

Mr. Sullivan reported that the petition to amend the district order had been received on Feb-

ruary 6, 2017 and verified by the Election Commission. The ordinance allows 10 registered voters 

to petition to initiate a study process for district designation, amendment, or rescission, or the Com-

mission itself could initiate such as study on its own initiative.  

Suzanne Blier of 5 Fuller Place presented on behalf of the petitioners. She indicated that af-

ter the 1-3 Brattle Street application was heard by the Commission some members of the public 

were still not satisfied that the door should be moved to face the center of the square. They decided 

there must be a better way to protect significant buildings in Harvard Square rather than petitioning 

for landmark study each time a change was proposed to a significant building. She studied other 

preservation ordinances, including that of San Francisco. The Harvard Square Conservation District 

guidelines were not restrictive enough and the protection was not as strong as in San Francisco. It 

was time to rethink the language in the district order. She said a study could consider additional ap-

plication requirements such as night-time light studies and viewshed studies. It could require court 

reporting and posting of all plans online (referencing a plan by Prellwitz Chilinski Associates that 

was never submitted to the Historical Commission for consideration in Case 3678 that the public 

wished to see). A study could reconsider the boundaries of the district and the procedures for demo-

lition of buildings in the district.  

Nancy Gold of Weston read a letter from a preservation consultant in San Francisco. She 

was astonished at the Commission’s decision not to study the Abbot building for landmark designa-

tion and its decision to allow the demolition of the Corcoran’s building.

ple. 

Abra Berkowitz of 253½ Broadway said it was worth having a study committee to have a 

full discussion of the options for the district. If the Commission would engage the petitioners, the 

petitioners could stop being so reactive and start being more proactive. She read from the historic 

preservation book Keeping Time. She called for greater transparency. Stores were closing all the 

Pebble Gifford of 15 Hilliard Street said she had participated in the original district studies 

for Harvard Square. The existing district order allowed for too much leeway, and it should be tight-

ened up to better protect and preserve buildings. She said the Commissioners were the custodians of 

the buildings in the city while the petitioners were lobbyists. She urged the Commission to focus on 

the criteria for appropriateness, not their own likes and dislikes. She cited a roof deck as an exam-

Carole Perrault of 9 Dana Street spoke in favor of having a study process. Recent efforts for 

landmark studies proved the need for such a study. She cited recent projects as reason for wanting 

change including the Smith Campus Center, Kennedy School, the Science Center Plaza, 16-18 Eliot 

Street, Wordsworth building storefronts and signs, Abbot building “facadism,” the Corcoran build-

ing demolition, and the undetermined future of the Harvard Square Theatre. She said the petitioners 

and the Commission should work together collaboratively, otherwise the petitions would keep com-

ing. The Commission could ask more from the developers. 

Abhishek Syal of Our Harvard Square said he wanted a better understanding of the frame-

work for historic preservation decisions. A study would be an opportunity to look at best practices 

used elsewhere. There was no harm to having a study and it could result in improvements.  

Marilee Meyer of 10 Dana Street pointed to the fact that storefronts could be changed as of 

right in the district as something that she would like to see changed.  

Michael Brandon of 27 Seven Pines Avenue spoke in favor of having a study. A tiered sys-

tem of significance might be a good idea. There was a lot of development pressure on Harvard 

Square. The Commission was one of the first entities to use the NCD model at the municipal level. 

The city should continue to be forward thinking and see if any changes to the district order are 

needed. He recognized that it would require a lot of staff time and recommended a budget increase 

to assist in the project. 

John DiGiovanni of Trinity Properties said he had been a member of the original study com-

mittees for Harvard Square. That process took 2½ years and 52 meetings to complete. He

referenced the five-year study report done for the district. A study shouldn’t presume that there 

must be changes, but he could support a new review of the district. It should be undertaken with the 

same amount of care and thoughtfulness as the original study. The love everyone had for the Square 

should be embraced in the study.  

Mr. King closed the public comment period.  

Mr. Sullivan noted that some of the claims made in the petition could relate to the ongoing 

litigation in Superior Court and should not be discussed by the commissioners. He disputed the alle-

gations in the appeal that the Commission had not acted appropriately or that he had sought to mis-

lead people by describing its jurisdiction. He recommended the Commission initiate on its own a 

study process to evaluate and consider amendments to the district order and possibly to the enabling 

ordinance.  

Mr. King recommended the following language for a motion,  

That, without making any findings of concurrence or agreement with any of the premises in 

the various “WHEREAS” clauses or in the substance of the proposed revisions set forth in the “Pe-

tition to Amend the Harvard Square Conservation District Guidelines” dated January 31, 2017, but 

concurring that the conservation and preservation of Harvard Square may benefit from the study 

and discussion of the existing and possible alternative and/or additional guidelines and procedures, 

the Commission accepts the petitioners’ request to initiate the process, and asks the City Manager to 

appoint a study committee, to consider possible amendments to the Order that established the Har-

vard Square Conservation District and possibly to the Neighborhood Conservation District enabling 

ordinance (Ch. 2.78, Art. III): it being understood that during the period of such study and until the 

City Council may amend such Order, the standards, criteria, and guidelines set forth in such Order 

and the current procedures of the Commission shall remain in effect with respect to the District.  

He noted that only the appointed study committee could vote on recommendations to the 

Historical Commission and the City Council, but that all meetings would be open to the public and 

participation by all was encouraged. 

Ms. Blier asked a point of fact about the procedures during the study period. She noted that 

the petition asked that during the study the Commission consider if buildings were significant or 

contributing that were before it. Mr. King explained his draft language on this point.  

Mr. Irving said he would move the motion unless other members suggested changes. None 

were made, so he made the motion.

Dr. Solet asked if the original 2000 order required a review every five years. Mr. Sullivan 

replied that it only required one review at the five year mark in 2005. Mr. King pointed out that the 

City Council had ordered that the review be updated.  

Ms. Harrington seconded the motion. With no further discussion, the motion passed 7-0.  

Mr. King asked that the minutes reflect that members of other bodies other than the Histori-

cal Commission should think about ways to address citywide issues facing the community. He 

noted that the study committee would include three members or alternates of the Historical Com-

mission and four additional appointees. He indicated that he would not take a role on the committee 

and urged his young colleagues to step forward. He then called for a recess. The meeting recon-

Re:  CPD Procedural Justice Dashboard   

Ref.:  Awaiting Report #19-157, dated November 25, 2019  
 
 
The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report #19-157, dated November 25, 2019, whereby 
the City Manager was requested to report on the status of the Cambridge Police Department’s Procedural 
Justice Dashboard. 
 
The Cambridge Police Department erected its Procedural Justice Section in June of 2018 following 
budget approval in May of 2018. One of the major functions of the Procedural Justice Section is to 
monitor data relating to police-citizen interactions for any potential indications of racial profiling or 
racially biased policing by initially focusing on vehicular stops and later analyzing pedestrian stops and 
use of force incidents. The manner used is protective of the public and fair to the men and women who 
enforce the law. Once calculated, the information is to be posted in [near] “real time” via the 
Department’s Procedural Justice Dashboard. 
 
The approval of the Procedural Justice Section created two new positions: The Deputy Superintendent of 
the Procedural Justice Section and the Procedural Justice Informatics Analyst. The Deputy Superintendent 
Position was filled near immediately while the Informatics Analyst position was filled in early 2019. 
Since its assembly and the onboarding of the Informatics Analyst, the Procedural Justice Section has 
taken many actions towards building the Department’s infrastructure to accommodate the necessary data 
collection; including but not limited to: (1) conducting a systemic review of CPD’s vehicular data 
collection methods, (2) revising the existing data collection tool, (3) reviewing CPD’s compliance with 
completion of data collection tool (4) implementing departmental mechanisms to ensure departmental 
compliance, (5) reviewing all motor vehicle offenses for internal classification purposes; reviewing all 
criminal offenses under Massachusetts’ General Laws (MGL) for internal classification purposes, (6) 
formalizing the weighted algorithm using statistical software (in-house), as well as many other actions. 
 
Over the course of developing the apparatus to conduct the complex series of simple computations in-
house [once data is collected, it would then have to be manually placed into a statistical software and the 
results manually uploaded into the Procedural Justice Dashboard] a local company, upon hearing about 
the intended purpose of the Procedural Justice Section, built a solution to automate the process.

In my opinion, where “full transparency and accuracy” is the desired aim, an automated solution is the 
best option. Whereas the initial vision was to post data in real time, the automated solution provides an 
added feature of having interactive capabilities. The advent of the automated solution has caused an 
unexpected shift away from the manual process and requires the assistance and technical support of  
the Public Safety Information Technology (PSIT) team.  
 
After a protracted series of meetings, a Computer-Aided Dispatch study, technological specifications 
checks, etc., we have identified a modern public safety software platform that best meets our needs and 
operational demands in developing a fully automated dashboard-based reporting system. 
 
The Department in conjunction with PSIT is ready to acquire the technology that provides this automated 
solution; this acquisition will replace the Departments Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) and Records 
Management systems (RMS). This is a serious undertaking and will surely take several months to 
complete (estimated 6-9 months). A corresponding appropriation request will accompany this response. 
The Department has requested that the automated process be incorporated and activated as early in the 
implementation process as feasible. It is my hope that the Procedural Justice Dashboard be fully 
implemented in the first half of 2020 and publishing data shortly thereafter.   
 
Currently the Informatics Analyst position is vacant. We have posted this position and will be looking for 
a candidate with a strong understanding of procedural justice, statistical research, and how data analysis 
methods can be used to evaluate the bias in policing. It is our intention to have this vacancy filled in the 
next couple months. 
 
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions, information needed  
or concerns regarding this matter, please let me know. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr. 
Police Commissioner

March 2, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $15,000,000 from Free Cash to the Affordable Housing Trust 
to assist in preserving affordability of units at Fresh Pond Apartments at 362 and 364 Rindge Avenue.  
Under terms of the restrictions in place here, affordability of the 504 units is set to expire on December 
31, 2020.  I am pleased to inform you that after multiple years of work, we are now entering the final 
phase of our plan to preserve the affordability of 504 units at Fresh Pond Apartments, and this special 
additional appropriation will ensure that the Trust has the funding necessary to extend affordability 
commitments here. 
 
The Affordable Housing Trust is preparing to make available up to $40 million to ensure the continued 
affordability of Fresh Pond Apartments.  This commitment will include providing financing to the owner 
to reflect the value discount needed to continue affordability, and a rent reserve which will be used to 
assist in transitioning some residents to a new affordable rent structure over the next ten years.  Details of 
the preservation plan are further described below.   
 
The City, in conjunction with the Affordable Housing Trust and Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, have been 
extremely focused on a timely solution to the preservation of affordability at Fresh Pond Apartments.  In 
addition to being a key Council goal, Fresh Pond Apartments is home to hundreds of Cambridge families, 
representing students in our schools, people who work throughout the City and individuals who otherwise 
would not be able to continue living in Cambridge, making this effort an advisable use of the City’s Free 
Cash resources. 
 
Requesting that the City Council approve a Free Cash appropriation has been part of our plan to fund this 
preservation effort.  With the approval of this request, the City will have used $74.3 million in Free Cash 
in FY20, the highest amount in the City’s history and significantly higher than the five-year average of 
$43.6 million. These Free Cash appropriations have supported City Council priorities and highlights the 
importance of having a significant Free Cash balance to address one-time City priorities. 
 
The City has appropriated $20.3 million in FY20 to the Affordable Housing Trust from all sources 
(Community Preservation Act, Building Permit Revenue and Property Taxes).  With the approval of this 
request, the total amount of City funding appropriated to the Trust will increase to more than $35.3 

1.6

 

 

Packet Pg. 133

1.6

million in FY20, more than $61.7 million over the past three years, and more than $219 million since its 
inception.  The Trust has used these funds to preserve or create more than 3,075 affordable homes in our 
community (not including Fresh Pond Apartments).  The Trust will use these funds to supplement the 
combined $25 million of Community Preservation Act, City budget, and incentive zoning funds that the 
Trust has set aside for this effort.   
 
Preserving the affordability of Fresh Pond Apartments will allow the City to achieve our expiring use 
preservation goal.  In 2009, the City identified 1,094 units at 10 privately-owned properties where 
affordability commitments were set to expire by 2021.  Affordability has been successfully preserved at 
nine of these properties, including buildings that for decades have offered affordable housing options for 
residents in Harvard Square, Inman Square, the Port, Riverside, and West Cambridge.  Reaching an 
agreement to preserve affordability of Fresh Pond Apartments caps our successful efforts to preserve 
every one of these affordable homes for current and future residents. 
 
Preservation Approach 
 
As the Fresh Pond Apartments include two types of subsidized units, the plan to preserve affordability 
involves two different strategies.  Two-thirds of the property (338 units) has been kept affordable through 
Section 8 funding received directly from HUD (“Section 8 Units”).  The remaining 166 units have been 
kept affordable according to the requirements of a now defunct HUD program called the Below Market 
Interest Rate program (“BMIR Units”).  The underlying affordability restriction, which outlines 
requirements for both types of units, is due to expire on 12/31/2020. 
 
Section 8 Units  
The HUD Section 8 rental assistance contract can be renewed directly with HUD.  Last year, the owner, 
Schochet Companies, submitted an application to HUD to enter into a new long-term rental assistance 
contract with HUD.   We are pleased to report that the new contract has been approved by HUD and will 
be finalized shortly, thereby extending affordability of all 338 Section 8 units at the property for another 
20 years.  The owner is now finalizing this renewal with HUD and will soon communicate this exciting 
news to residents.  Residents in Section 8 Units will continue to pay rent based on 30% of household 
income. 
 
BMIR Units 
The preservation of the BMIR units is more complicated as there are no similar HUD provisions for 
extending affordability of the BMIR Units.  The preservation plan for these units will require that the City 
provide the owner the difference in the value of these units if they were to be converted to market-rate 
housing and the value of the units if they were restricted as affordable housing.  After a lengthy 
negotiation, it has been agreed that the value difference for these units is $35 million, assuming 
affordability levels that are based on the income profile of existing BMIR tenants.  In exchange for this 
“value differential” funding, the owner will maintain affordability of these units for another 50 years.  
 
Residents living in BMIR Units currently pay rents set by HUD under the BMIR program. Unlike rents 
for Section 8 tenants, which are adjusted annually to equal 30% of individual household income, rents 
under the BMIR program are flat and are not tied to income. BMIR rents have been capped at low enough 
levels that most BMIR tenants are currently paying less than 30% of household income for rent.  The 
preservation of the BMIR units involves establishing a new set of affordable requirements going forward.  
The new affordability framework will be set to reflect the income profiles of existing BMIR tenants. The 
BMIR program allows tenants to avoid income recertification in exchange for paying a higher rent, so we 
may find that there are more higher income tenants at Fresh Pond than currently assumed once we begin 
the process of certifying tenant incomes.  The new affordability requirements for the BMIR Units are 
expected to be set as follows: 

Packet Pg. 134

1.6

•  84% of current BMIR units will be affordable to households earning less than 80% AMI 
•  10% of current BMIR units will be affordable to households earning between 80% and 100% AMI 
•  6% of current BMIR units will be affordable to households earning between 100% and 120% AMI 

When combined with the 338 HUD Section 8 units, the overall breakdown of affordability for all 504 
units at Fresh Pond is expected to be: 

•  95% of Fresh Pond units will be affordable to households earning less than 80% AMI 
•  3% of Fresh Pond units will be affordable to households earning between 80% and 100% AMI 
•  2% of Fresh Pond units will be affordable to households earning between 100% and 120% AMI 

 

 

 

 
 

Rents for the BMIR units will be set at target amounts in each affordability tier that are affordable to 
households in that income range. 
 
We recognize that many households currently living in BMIR Units will see rent increases when 
transitioning to the new affordability structure.  Funds being made available by the Affordable Housing 
Trust will include up to $5 million to establish a rent phase-in reserve which will allow for moderated rent 
increases for residents as they transition to the new tiered rents.  This reserve will be sized to enable the 
most gradual rent increases for eligible low-income or cost-burdened households, reasonable rent 
increases for moderate- and middle-income households, and steeper increases for higher income or over-
housed households.  Our plan is for this reserve to offer up to ten years of assistance to current residents, 
with small rent increases beginning in 2021.  We are exploring whether and how we might be able to 
bring in new housing vouchers, in partnership with the Cambridge Housing Authority, to assist lower 
income households.  Details of the rent phase-in process are still being formulated and will require that 
we get a better understanding of the income and make-up of households living in BMIR units so we can 
finalize this plan. 
 
Next Steps 
 
The next phase of our plan to preserve affordability at Fresh Pond will require participation of residents as 
we prepare for the transition from the BMIR affordability program to a new affordability program made 
possible with funding from the City.  Over the coming weeks and months, staff from CDD and the City 
Manager’s Office will be working with Mayor Siddiqui’s Office, the Housing Committee co-chairs, the 
property owner, and housing advocates to update and discuss the preservation plan with the residents at 
Fresh Pond Apartments.  We envision having resident meetings there with the owner beginning in March 
after funding commitments are in place.   
 
I would like to acknowledge the staff of the Community Development Department, especially the 
Housing Director, and the entire City Council for the continued support and commitment during this 
length process to preserve the affordability of the 504 units at Fresh Pond Apartments. 
 

 

 

Very truly yours, 

 

Louis A. DePasquale

March 2, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am pleased to inform you, the taxpayers, and all our residents that the City of Cambridge has retained its 
noteworthy distinction of being one of approximately 32 cities in the United States with three AAA 
ratings from each of the nation’s three major credit rating agencies.   Each year since 1999, the City has 
received these ratings from Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings.  
 
This achievement allows the City to finance important projects throughout Cambridge with the most 
favorable interest rate, which means property tax savings to our taxpayers. This is especially important as 
we embark on funding for our third school project (Tobin Montessori & Vassal Lane Upper Schools) with 
an estimated cost of $250 million. Overall, including the Tobin Montessori & Vassal Lane Upper Schools 
project, the City is projected to spend a total of $505 million for the three school projects. These projects 
are financed through bond proceeds and without any State reimbursement to the City. In addition, our 
bonding schedule includes significant obligations for renovations to Fire Headquarters and other stations 
and other City Buildings, sewer reconstruction, street and sidewalk reconstruction projects. 
 
The rating agencies highlighted the City’s strong financial position, including significant reserve levels; a 
large and diverse tax base; ample excess levy capacity under Proposition 2 ½; and a strong and 
experienced management team. We should expect to receive these favorable ratings in the future if we 
manage our debt issuance prudently, continue to consistently follow our management and fiscal practices 
and policies, produce positive annual balance sheets, plan to fund our long-term obligations (pensions and 
OPEB) and continue to have a vibrant local economy.  
 
Depending on the severity of potential economic impacts in the United States reflected in the recent 
volatility in the stock market, rating agencies may adjust their ratings, or put on credit watch, 
municipalities which are not in as strong of a position as a AAA community such as Cambridge.  
 
These ratings are in conjunction with the City’s sale of $53.7 million in General Obligation bonds. The 
competitive sale will take place on March 5, 2020.  
 
Capital projects funded in this bond issuance include the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School and 
Community Complex, Tobin Montessori & Vassal Lane Upper Schools design, sewer reconstruction, 

1.7

 

 

Packet Pg. 138

1.7

street and sidewalk reconstruction, and other municipal building renovations.  
 
Based on this ongoing recognition from the rating agencies, the City Council can be justly proud of its 
sound fiscal policies. Additionally, I would like to thank the City’s Finance Team and Department Heads 
and staff for their commitment to prudently managing their expenditure and revenue operating and capital 
budgets and programs. The City is fortunate to have such a strong and dedicated team. 
 
Listed below are highlights from the Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch credit reports. Attached are 
the individual rating opinions.   
 
Moody’s Investor Services 
 
Summary 
Cambridge (Aaa stable) benefits from a sizable and diverse tax base that continues to experience double 
digit  annual  growth.  The  city's  economy  is  driven  largely  by  the  presence  of  Harvard  University  (Aaa 
stable)  and  Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology  (MIT,  Aaa  stable)  and  the  impressive  research  and 
development sector. Cambridge's financial position is strong with very healthy liquidity and reserves that 
are maintained by formal policies and conservative fiscal management. Both the debt burden and long-
term liabilities for pension and OPEB are conservatively managed and will remain manageable over the 
near term. 
 
Credit strengths 
» Large and diverse tax base anchored by institutional presences and robust commercial sector 
» Healthy financial position guided by formal policies 
» Strong fiscal management 
» Ample operating flexibility with excess levy capacity under Proposition 2½ and below average 

residential and commercial tax rates 

» Expected to fully fund pension liability by 2026 
 
Credit challenges 
» High regional cost of living and cost of business 
» Taxpayer concentration in research and development 
 
Rating outlook 
The stable outlook reflects the city’s strong fiscal management that is committed to maintaining a healthy 
financial position given conservative multi-year budget forecasting and adherence to formally adopted 
fiscal policies. The outlook also incorporates the stabilizing presence of Harvard University and MIT as 
well as the long historical trend of positive valuation growth in the tax base 
 
Factors that could lead to a downgrade 
» Material growth in the debt burden or unfunded pension liability 
» Deterioration in the tax base or weakening of the local economy 
» Trend of operating deficits that lead to significant reduction in cash and reserves 
 
Environmental, Social and Governance and Management (ESG) Considerations 

•  Environmental 

The  city  is  committed  to  addressing  environmental  risk  associated  with  flooding  and  heat 
exposure. To date, the most comprehensive mitigation projects include improving natural barriers 
around  the  Alewife  neighborhood  as  well  as  heat  mitigation  efforts  through  its  urban  canopy-
public shade tree investment program. Longer term the city expects to release its Climate Change 

Packet Pg. 139

1.7

Preparedness  and  Resilience  Plan  in  2020  that  includes  net  zero  action  plan  for  government, 
residential and commercial development. 

•  Social 

Cambridge  leverages  its  strong  credit  profile  by  focusing  on  significant  community  initiatives. 
These  initiatives  currently  include  a  robust  bike  ordinance,  participatory  budgeting  that  gives 
residents a voice in capital and other spending, the city providing a proportional share of funding 
towards  the  MBTA  green  line  extension  and  offering  a  small  business  personal  property  tax 
exemption.  Additionally,  the  city  continues  to  increase  its  funding  towards  affordable  housing 
projects. 

 

 

•  Governance and Management 

The city's experienced management team is very strong, as evidenced by the maintenance of very 
healthy  liquidity  and  reserves  as  well  as  adherence  to  formal  fiscal  policies,  conservative 
multiyear budgeting and capital planning. 

 
Financial operations and reserves: very healthy financial position expected to be maintained through 
conservative fiscal management 
The city's financial position will likely remain healthy over the near term given ample liquidity and 
reserves that are maintained by conservative fiscal management. The fiscal 2019 audited financials reflect 
an operating surplus of $19 million attributable to positive variance in excise taxes, investment income 
and other revenue as well as expense savings in all major departments. 
 
 
Standard and Poor’s 
 
Outlook 
The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' opinion of Cambridge's stable and growing economic 
bases, which, along with a very strong financial management environment, has led to predictable financial 
performance. While retirement costs could rise, along with an increasing debt burden, we expect 
management will incorporate these costs into the budget with no material effect on financial results over 
the long term. The rating is further supported by the city's very strong reserves levels, excess levy 
capacity, and very strong liquidity profile. We do not expect to change the rating during the two-year 
outlook period. 
 
Downside scenario 
While unlikely, if economic growth were to stagnate, along with rising fixed costs, leading to significant 
reserve drawdowns, we could lower the rating 
 
Credit Overview 
Cambridge is an affluent suburb immediately adjacent to Boston. Home to both Harvard and the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the city is at the epicenter of biotech, pharmaceutical, and 
other knowledge-based sectors, which continue to generate growth in the tax base. The city faces 
challenges in addressing housing, transportation, and other infrastructure needs. However, it has a history 
of significant forward-looking financial planning and a track record of consistently outperforming the 
budget. We expect Cambridge to remain a desirable location to live and work, sustaining economic 
growth that will assist management in meeting future challenges. 
 
The long-term rating further reflects our view of the following factors: 

•  Very strong economy, with access to a broad and diverse metropolitan statistical area (MSA); 

Packet Pg. 140

1.7

•  Very strong management, with strong financial policies and practices under our Financial 

Management Assessment (FMA) methodology; 

•  Strong budgetary performance, with operating surpluses in the general fund and at the total 

governmental-fund level in fiscal 2019; 

•  Very strong budgetary flexibility, with available fund balance in fiscal 2019 of 53% of operating 
expenditures, coupled with the flexibility to raise additional revenue despite commonwealthwide 
tax caps; 

•  Very strong liquidity, with total government available cash at 61.0% of total governmental-fund 
expenditures and 6.8x governmental debt service, and access to external liquidity we consider 
strong; 

•  Adequate debt-and-contingent-liability position, with debt service carrying charges at 9.0% of 

expenditures and net direct debt that is 56.5% of total governmental-fund revenue, as well as low 
overall net debt at less than 3% of market value and rapid amortization, with 81.9% of debt 
scheduled to be retired within 10 years, but significant medium-term debt plans and a large 
pension and other-postemployment-benefit (OPEB) obligation; and 

•  Strong institutional framework score. 

 
Very strong economy 
We consider Cambridge's economy very strong. The city, with an estimated population of 113,682, is in 
Middlesex County, directly across the Charles River from Boston. It is in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton 
MSA,  which  we consider to  be  broad  and  diverse.  The  city  has  a projected  per  capita  effective  buying 
income  of  173%  of  the  national  level  and  per  capita  market  value  of  $483,347.  Overall,  market  value 
grew by 12.2% over the past year to $54.9 billion in 2020. The county unemployment rate was 2.7% in 
2018. 
 
Very strong management 
We view the city's management as very strong, with strong financial policies and practices under our 
FMA methodology, indicating financial practices are strong, well embedded, and likely sustainable. 
 
We believe Cambridge's greatest credit risks are threats to its vibrant and growing economy. In particular, 
rising  sea  levels  from  climate  change  could  directly affect taxable  properties.  The  city  has  a  history  of 
proactively addressing future challenges, and, to this end, management maintains a number of long-term 
plans that generate shorter term decision-making. 
 
The city is currently developing a "Climate Change Preparedness & Resilience (CCPR) Plan," described 
by  management  as  its  blueprint  for  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  addressing  flood  risk  and 
storm water management. Management expects to complete this plan in the spring of 2020. In addition, 
Cambridge conducted a "Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment" to identify its specific vulnerabilities 
and  inform  the  CCPR.  Finally,  the  city  has  also  undertaken  efforts  to  reduce  residential  trash  disposal, 
plant and maintain new trees throughout the city, and expand curbside organics collection. 
 
While these plans outline long-term roadmaps for a number of major challenges, the city's annual budget 
development process supports the overarching goals. The annually updated five-year financial plan and 
five-year  CIP  outline  immediate  fiscal  challenges  while  determining  and  prioritizing  immediate  capital 
needs. Management uses historical trend analysis to develop line-item and departmental expenditure and 
revenue assumptions.

1.7

Fitch Ratings 
  
Summary 
The city's 'AAA' general obligation bond rating and Issuer Default Rating reflect Fitch's expectation for 
Cambridge  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  financial  flexibility  through  economic  cycles,  consistent  with  a 
history of strong operating performance and budget controls. The ratings further reflect the city's wealthy 
and  growing  property  tax  base,  moderate  expenditure  growth  and  its  demonstrated  ability  to  reduce 
expenditures during economic downturns.  
 
Fitch  expects  long-term  liabilities  to  remain  low  based  on  the  city's  capital  needs,  very  rapid  pace  of 
principal  amortization,  continued  growth  in  economic  resources,  and  a  practice  of  fully  funding 
actuarially determined pension contributions. 
 
Key Rating Drivers  
 

•  Revenue Framework: 'aaa'  

Revenues are derived primarily from property taxes. Total general fund revenue growth of more 
than 5% annually over the past 10 fiscal years has exceeded both U.S. GDP and CPI for the same 
period  reflective  of  strong  growth  in  Cambridge's  economy  and  tax  base.  The  city  maintains 
significant excess levy capacity under the state's Proposition 2 1/2 law and Fitch expects revenue 
growth to remain strong. 

•  Expenditure Framework: 'aa'  

The  natural  pace  of  spending  growth  is  expected  by  Fitch  to  be  in  line  with  to  below  natural 
revenue  growth  over  time.  Carrying  costs  for  debt  and  retiree  benefits  claim  a  moderate 
proportion of governmental spending. Fitch expects carrying costs to remain moderate even with 
future debt issuances and annual increases in other-post employment benefit (OPEB) and pension 
contributions. The city maintains strong legal control over headcount and other key employment 
terms as provided by state statute. 

•  Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa'  

Cambridge's combined direct debt, net of water and sewer debt paid from user charges, and Fitch-
adjusted  net  pension  liabilities  (NPL),  are  low  at  approximately  7.5%  of  residents'  personal 
income. Fitch anticipates Cambridge's long-term liability burden will remain in line with the 'aaa' 
assessment  based  on  expected  growth in  the  city's  population  and  personal  income, future  debt 
plans, and a rapid pace of principal amortization. OPEB liabilities compared to personal income 
are somewhat high based on a conservative interest rate assumption, but management is actively 
managing these costs. 

•  Operating Performance: 'aaa'  

Careful  expenditure  management  combined  with  moderate  tax  levy  increases  and  conservative 
financial  forecasting  has  led  to  the  maintenance  of  considerable  reserves  over  the  past  decade. 
Fitch expects the city will continue to demonstrate a high level of financial resilience and gap-
closing ability throughout economic cycles. 

Rating Sensitivities 

 
•  Financial Management Practices: Fitch expects management to continue to manage growth 
in expenditures in line with future revenue growth while maintaining its financial flexibility.

Profile
Cambridge is a sizable community that neighbors the City of Boston (Aaa stable) across the Charles River. The city's population totals

approximately 110,893 and its economy and tax base are anchored by two world renowned higher education institutions,

Detailed credit considerations

Economy and tax base: strong economy and tax base anchored by world renowned institutions

Cambridge's economy will continue to benefit from the presence of Han/ard and MIT which together enroll 33,000 students and

provide employment equivalent to 21,000 full-time positions (roughly 18% of the city's workforce), in addition, the city is home to a

vibrant commercial sector including biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Together the universities and mentioned industries

comprise around 60% of the jobs provided by the top 25 employers. Given the strong demand for commercial space and access to the

highly educated workforce, the city does not offer any tax breaks. The Top 10 taxpayers are slightly concentrated, representing 22.9%

of 2020 assessed value. MIT, with its significant taxable property, is the largest taxpayer, representing 9.1% of the city's base. Overall,

commercial property pays 65.4% of the city's fiscal 2020 property tax levy,

The $49.4 billion tax base (2019-20 equalized value) is large and will likely continue to grow over the next several years given strong

housing demand and the strength of the overall economy. The 2020 assessed value growth of 12.2%, the sixth consecutive year of

double digit growth, brought the five year compound annual growth rate to 12.5% as well. The development pipeline and construction

activity remains healthy and the city projects assessed value to increase to $64,4 billion by 2024.

MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE

Resident income and wealth levels are above average relative to the commonwealth and US medians, despite a large student

population. The unemployment level remains very tow and the labor force continues to grow.

Financial operations and reserves: very healthy financial position expected to be maintained through conservative fiscal

management

The city's financial position will likely remain healthy over the near term given ample liquidity and reserves that are maintained by

conservative fiscal management. The fiscal 2019 audited financials reflect an operating surplus of $19 million attributable to positive

variance in excise taxes, investment income and other revenue as well as expense savings in all major departments. The surplus increase

the available general fund balance to $384.4 million or a very healthy 58.4% of revenue. The city's primary revenue source is property

taxes representing 63% of 2019 general fund revenue. The largest expenses are education and public safety representing 35% and 22%

of 2019 expenditures, respectively.

The fiscal 2020 budget increased 5.7% or $36.7 million over the prior year driven by salaries, health insurance and other employee

benefits. The budget is balanced with a 6.9% increase in the tax levy and $14 million of free cash to reduce the tax rate. The city

annually appropriates additional free cash toward capital and other one-time costs. The budget also includes the addition of 30 full

time positions,

The citys fiscal 2020-24 budget projections indicate balanced annual operations using conservative assumptions. The expense

projections include a 2.5% annual increase in salaries, pension contribution will increase by 5.85% in 2021 and remain flat thereafter

and education costs increase by 6.5% plus $1.4 million equal to the chapter 70 receipts under the Governor's budget recommendation.

The revenue projections include level funding of state aid in line with the current budget recommendation for next year, and an average

annual tax levy increase of 7.9%. The city also has $190 million of unused levy capacity, equal to 29% of general fund revenue. This

provides significant operating flexibility under Proposition 2 Vz that is not available to most municipalities in Massachusetts given the

need to levy to the tax levy limit each year.

LIQUIDFTY
Cash and investments at the end of fiscal 2019 totaled $422 million or a very strong 64.1% of revenue.

Debt and other long term liabilities: debt burden, pension and OPEB liabilities will remain manageable

The debt and long term liabilities will remain manageable over the near term given conservative debt management and aggressive

funding the city's unfunded pension liability. The net direct debt burden of 1.1% of equalized value and 0.7 times general fund revenue

is average and will remain manageable. The city's debt management policies include maintaining a debt to assessed value of less than

PENSIONS AND OPEB

Cambridge s pension and OPEB liabilities are Larger than its debt and, though manageable at this time, represent a potential future

credit challenge. The city participates in the City of Cambridge Retirement System, a cost sharing multiple employer defined benefit

retirement plan and makes annual required contributions based on its proportional share. The plan is likely to be fully funded by 2026.

Additionally, the city's teachers participate in the Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System in which the city receives on-behalf

payments toward the liability that is covered by the Commonwealth. The city also funds its OPEB liability on a pay-go basis and makes

modest annual deposits to an OPEB trust. The table below summarizes the city's 2019 debt, pension and OPE8 unfunded liabilities and

ESG considerations

Environmental

Social

The city is committed to addressing environmental risk associated with ftooding and heat exposure. To date, the most comprehensive

mitigation projects include improving natural barriers around the Alewife neighborhood as wetE as heat mitigation efforts through its

urban canopy-public shade tree investment program. Longer term the city expects to release its Climate Change Preparedness and

Resilience Plan in 2020 that includes net zero action plan for government, residential and commercial development.

Cambridge leverages its strong credit profile by focusing on significant community initiatives. These initiatives currently include

a robust bike ordinance, participatory budgeting that gives residents a voice in capital and other spending, the city providing a

proportional share of funding towards the MBTA green line extension, and offering a small business personal property tax exemption.

Additionally, the city continues to increase its funding towards affordable housing projects.

Governance and management

The city s experienced management team is very strong, as evidenced by the maintenance of very healthy liquidity and reserves as well

as adherence to formal fiscal policies, conservative multiyear budgeting and capital planning.

Massachusetts cities have an Institutional Framework score of "Aa," which is strong. The sector's major revenue source of property

taxes, are subject to the Proposition 2 1/2 tax levy cap which can be overridden with voter approval only. However, the cap of 2.5%

still allows for moderate revenue-raising ability. Expenditures primarily consist of personnel costs, as well as education costs for

cities that manage school operations, and are highly predictable given state-mandated school spending guidelines and employee

contracts. Unpredictable revenue fluctuations tend to be minor, or under 5% annually. Across the sector, fixed and mandated costs are

generally greater than 25% of expenditures. Fixed costs are driven mainly by debt service and pension costs. Unpredictable expenditure

fluctuations tend to be minor, under 5% annually,

Credit Profile

US$53.665 mil GO

Cambridge GO

Rationale

S&P Global Ratings assigned its 'AAA' rating to Cambridge, Mass.' series 2020 general obligation (GO)

municipal-purpose loan bonds and affirmed its 'AAA' rating on the city's existing GO debt. The outlook is stable.

Security and use of proceeds

The city's full-faith-and-credit pledge, subject to Proposition 2-1/2 limitations, secures the GO debt. Despite

commonwealth levy-limit laws, we did not make a rating distinction between Cambridge's limited-tax GO pledge and

general creditworthiness because our analysis of its financial and economic conditions already includes the tax

limitation imposed on its revenue-raising ability.

We rate Cambridge higher than the sovereign based on the application of our "Ratings Above The Sovereign:

Corporate And Government Ratings—Methodology And Assumptions" criteria (published Nov. 19, 2013, on

RatingsDirect). We believe the city can maintain better credit characteristics than the nation in a stress scenario based

on its predominantly locally derived revenue base and our view that pledged revenue supporting bond debt service is

at limited risk of negative sovereign intervention.

We understand officials intend to use series 2020 bond proceeds to fund various citywide projects, including school

renovations and sewer improvements.

Credit overview

Cambridge is an affluent suburb immediately adjacent to Boston. Home to both Harvard and the Massachusetts

Institute of Technology (MIT), the city is at the epicenter ofbiotech, pharmaceutical, and other knowledge-based

sectors, which continue to generate growth in the tax base. The city faces challenges in addressing housing,

transportation, and other infrastructure needs. However, it has a history of significant forward-looking financial

planning and a track record of consistently outperforming the budget. We expect Cambridge to remain a desirable

location to live and work, sustaining economic growth that will assist management in meeting future challenges.

The long-term rating further reflects our view of the following factors:

• Very strong economy, with access to a broad and diverse metropolitan statistical area (MSA);

Summary: Cambridge, Massachusetts; General Obligation

• Very strong management, with strong financial policies and practices under our Financial Management Assessment

• Strong budgetary performance, with operating surpluses in the general fund and at the total governmental fund level

(FMA) methodology;

in fiscal 2019;

• Very strong budgetary flexibility, with an available fund balance in fiscal 2019 of 53% of operating expenditures, and

the flexibility to raise additional revenues despite statewide tax caps;

* Very strong liquidity, with total government available cash at 61.0% of total governmental fund expenditures and

6,8x governmental debt service, and access to external liquidity we consider strong;

• Adequate debt and contingent liability position, with debt service carrying charges at 9.0% of expenditures and net

direct debt that is 56.5% of total governmental fund revenue, as well as low overall net debt at less than 3% of

market value and rapid amortization, with 81.9% of debt scheduled to be retired in 10 years, but significant

medium-term debt plans and a large pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) obligation; and

• Strong institutional framework score.

Very strong economy

We consider Cambridge's economy very strong. The city, with an estimated population of 113,682, is in Middlesex

County, directly across the Charles River from Boston. It is in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton MSA, which we consider

to be broad and diverse. The city has a projected per capita effective buying income of 173% of the national level and

per capita market value of $483,347. Overall, market value grew by 12.2% over the past year to $54.9 billion in 2020.

The county unemployment rate was 2.7% in 2018.

Directly adjacent to Boston, Cambridge is an integral part of the larger broad and diverse MSA. Two subway lines,

multiple highways, and a commuter rail connect Cambridge directly to downtown Boston. Harvard University and

MIT, its two leading employers and two of the largest taxpayers, anchor the local economy. They serve as knowledge

centers and focal points for dozens ofstart-ups, research centers, and Ufe-science and hlgh-technology companies.

Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Kayak, Pfizer, IBM, and Pegasystems have offices in the city. Behind the

growth of the economy is a talented workforce—the American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau

notes that residents are exceptionally well educated, with 77% of She 25-or-older population possessing a four-year

college degree and 49% possessing a graduate degree—and a culture that promotes innovation and development.

As the city's population continues to grow, management is working through the challenges of housing new residents

and trying to remain affordable. We understand that officials are working to increase She number of new housing starts

to support sustained population growth. Officials note that there are over 1,800 units currently under construction

throughout the city and that an additional 3,100 have been approved for development. In addition, affordable housing

remains a priority. The city recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust,

which has created over 3,000 affordable homes in the city. Further, it committed $9.7 million through the fiscal 20

capital budget to this trust to continue plans to increase affordable housing initiatives. We believe that housing, along

with transportation and infrastructure improvements, will present the largest credit challenges to the city. Recent

investments in non-vehicular transportation, including bicycle infrastructure and the rail network, are likely to add to

the desirability of the community and help generate continued tax base growth.

Summary: Cambridge, Massachusetts; General Obligation

The tax base is about 60% residential and 38% commercial and industrial. Management reports significant new

development, both residential and commercial, with several projects in various stages of development within the city's

seven economic development districts. In one district, the 45-acre North Point, renamed Cambridge Crossing, includes

expansion of a light-rail line. The city agreed to support the project by contributing $12.5 million for the relocation of

the Lechmere Station in Cambridge, adjacent to Cambridge Crossing, with DivCoWest contributing an additional $12.5

million. While the city does not offer tax abatement programs, it makes targeted investments that facilitate and entice

development, which we expect to continue.

The city's central location supports the economy, which benefits from its proximity to Boston and serves as the

region's primary economic hub. As a desirable location in New England, Cambridge is uniquely positioned to continue

drawing talent to its universities and colleges, and retaining graduates with an ever-evolving mixture of employment

opportunities. We expect that the city's economy will remain very strong.

Very strong management

We view the city's management as very strong, with strong financial policies and practices under our Financial

Management Assessment (FMA) methodology, indicating financial practices are strong, well embedded, and likely

sustainable.

decision-making.

We believe Cambridge's greatest credit risks are threats to its vibrant and growing economy. In particular, rising sea

levels from climate change could directly affect taxable properties. The city has a history ofproactively addressing

future challenges, and, to this end, management maintains a number of long-term plans that generate shorter term

The city is currently developing a "Climate Change Preparedness & Resilience (CCPR) Plan," described by

management as its blueprint for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing flood risk and storm water

management. Management expects to complete this plan in the spring of 2020. In addition, Cambridge conducted a

"Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment" to identify its specific vulnerabilities and inform the CCPR. Finally, the city

has also undertaken efforts to reduce residential trash disposal, plant and maintain new trees throughout the city, and

expand curbside organics collection.

While these plans outline long-term roadmaps for a number of major challenges, the city's annual budget development

process supports the overarching goals. The annually updated five-year financial plan and five-year CIP outline

immediate fiscal challenges while determining and prioritizing immediate capital needs. Management uses historical

trend analysis to develop line-item and departmental expenditure and revenue assumptions.

Active management of discretionary spending and ongoing monitoring of intrayear spending ensure adherence to the

adopted budget. Budget-to-actuals and investments are reported quarterly to the finance and investment committees,

respectively. Currently, the city invests in the state-run Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust (MMDT) and bank

deposits. It has formal debt management policies beyond debt limits prescribed by commonwealth statute that include

informal targets for debt service-to-budget limits and net present value savings thresholds for refunding transactions.

In terms of budgetary reserves, city policy affirms its commitment to maintaining an unassigned fund balance in excess

of 15% of the ensuing fiscal year's operating revenue and total general fund balance at least 25% of the following fiscal

Summary: Cambridge, Massachusetts; General Obligation

year's operating revenue.

Strong budgetary performance

We also note that the city has taken notable steps to mitigate exposure to cyber-reiated risks.

Cambridge's budgetary performance is strong, in our opinion. The city had operating surpluses of 2.9% of expenditures

in the general fund and 3.4% across all governmental funds in fiscal 2019.

Management fosters a culture of careful, conservative budgeting along with in-year performance monitoring, which

has led to a multiyear trend of She city outperforming the adopted budget and adding to reserves at year-end. Fiscal

2019 continued that trend, with revenues and expenditures across the board outperforming the budget, We adjusted

budgetary performance to account for recurring transfers, as well as the expenditure of capital grant revenue and bond

proceeds. Local real and property taxes accounted for about 63% of audited general fund revenues. Departmental

revenues were about 11,3% and intergovernmental revenue was 10.8%. The city accounts for its sewer use charges in

the general fund; this was the fourth-Iargest revenue source, at 8.3%. We also note that 42% of the intergovernmental

revenues, or $29.6 million of $70.8 million, was a pass-Shrough payment from the state for the teachers' retirement

system. We believe the city's operating revenue profile is inherently stable and predictable, with the majority of

revenues coming from locally derived sources.

The fiscal 2020 operating budget totals $678.4 million, a 5.7% increase from the 2019 adjusted budget. Coinciding with

potential long-term expenditure pressures identified by management, the 2020 budget includes increases for employee

salaries, health insurance, and pension costs, and continues the city's annual $2 million transfer to the OPEB trust fund.

Management reports that the use of reserves to address capital and other priorities increased in 2020, by

approximately $30 million. In recent years, the budgetary surplus created by revenues and expenditures outperforming

the budget more than covered the use of reserves. In 2020, we expect this is unlikely to happen, given management's

projections, but expect year-end operating performance to be approximately break-even, with no material change in

the year-end reserve position relative to 2019. We consequently expect budgetary performance to remain strong.

We note that the city is working to address many priority needs through the tax levy. In areas such as transportation,

housing, school infrastructure, and climate change, the annual budget includes targeted short- and long-term

investments. We believe the city's long-range capital and programming needs are being factored into current budget

decisions. We expect that as it continues to invest in critical needs areas, it is unlikely that costs associated with these

projects will significantly pressure the budget in a meaningful way, given management's forward-looking planning, the

strength of the tax base, and the city's significant budgetary flexibility.

Very strong budgetary flexibility

Cambridge's budgetary flexibility is very strong, in our view, with an available fund balance in fiscal 2019 of 53% of

operating expenditures, or $351.3 million. We expect the available fund balance to remain above 30% of expenditures

for the current and next fiscal years, which we view as a positive credit factor. Over the past three years, the total

available fund balance has remained at a consistent level overall, totaling 54% of expenditures in 2018 and 52% in

2017. In addition, the city has the flexibility to raise additional revenues despite statewide tax caps, which we view as a

positive credit factor.

Summary: Cambridge, M-assachusetts; General Obligation

We expect budgetary flexibility to remain very strong, given the city's existing reserves and significant flexibility under

the levy limit. We include the budget-stabiiization fund in our calculations, which the city accounts for in committed

general fund reserves, We do not anticipate a material change in available reserves, despite increased use of reserves

in the current fiscal year. We also believe the city has significant flexibility under the state levy cap. It currently has

$190.4 million in unused levy capacity, about 29% of the adopted 2020 operating budget.

Very strong liquidity

external liquidity if necessary.

In our opinion, Cambridge's liquidity is very strong, with total government available cash at 61.0% of total

governmental fund expenditures and 6.8x governmental debt service in 2019. In our view, the city has strong access to

We adjusted available cash to exclude cash held in the capital fund, housing trust, and certain special revenue funds,

which we believe is generally not available for liquidity purposes. Cambridge is a regular market participant that issued

GO bonds frequently, supporting what we view as strong access to external liquidity. We understand the city has not

entered into any bank loans, direct-purchase or variable-rate debt, and does not have contingent-liquidlty risks from

financial instruments with payment provisions that change on the occurrence of certain events. It has consistently had

a very strong liquidity profile, which we expect to continue.

Adequate debt and contingent liability profile

In our view, Cambridge's debt and contingent liability profile is adequate. Total governmental fund debt service is

9.0% of total governmental fund expenditures, and net direct debt is 56.5% of total governmental fund revenue.

Overall net debt is low at 0.8% of market value, and approximately 81.9% of the direct debt is scheduled to be repaid

within 10 years, which are, in our view, positive credit factors. Weakening our view of the city's debt profile are its

significant medium-term debt plans.

Cambridge has about $547 million of total direct debt outstanding. As of June 30, 2019, $120 million outstanding was

self-supporting water and sewer debt Approximately $21 million of the current issue is expected to be self-supporting

sewer debt. As the city continues investments in schools, fire stations, and other tax-backed projects, we believe it

could add debt at a rate faster than outstanding principal is paid, and we believe the amount ofnew-money debt is

likely to be significant. However, while the city's debt ratios are likely to weaken, we expect management will fully

incorporate costs into the budget and do not expect it to pressure the overall rating.

Pension and other postemployment benefits (OPEBs)

• In our opinion, Cambridge's large pension and OPEB obligation is a credit weakness, although we view the use of an

actuarially determined contribution (ADC) and OPEB prefunding as credit positive.

• While actuarially determined, we believe some of the assumptions used to build the required contribution are

permissive and could lead to fluctuating and rising costs.

• The city's GASB Statement 75 net OPEB liability totals $618.7 million, OPEB costs are paid on a pay-as-you-go

basis, but the city has set aside approximately $14.8 million in a trust, to which it expects to continue contributing

$2 million annually.

As of June 30, 2019, the city participates in the following pension plans:

Summary: Cambridge, M.assachusetts; General Obligation

• City of Cambridge Retirement System: 79.89% funded with a $240.3 million proportionate share of the net pension

liability

Cambridge's combined required pension and actual OPEB contributions totaled 7.7% of total governmental fund

expenditures in 2019. Of that amount, 4.4% represented required contributions to pension obligations, and 3.3%

represented OPEB payments. The city made 101% of its annual required pension contribution in 2019. The system

recently lowered its discount rate to 7.5% from 7.75%, which we view positively, but it remains above the 6.5%

discount rate we view as likely to mitigate contribution volatility, The system's adopted funding schedule uses a

level-percent basis through 2021, but maintains the 2021 contribution level through 2025, with a decline in the final

amortization payment in 2026. While contingent on the system meeting assumptions, no or little growth in the pension

payment is likely to translate to declining costs as a percentage of expenditures, which we would view positively. We

view the closed, seven-year amortization schedule positively. The system exceeded both our static and minimum

funding progress metrics in the most recent year, indicating it is making progress in addressing current costs and the

unfunded liability. We expect the city will continue to prefund OPEBs and while the obligations remain somewhat

large, we expect management will continue to make progress in addressing these liabilities.

Strong institutional framework

The institutional framework score for Massachusetts municipalities is strong,

Outlook

The stable outlook reflects S&P Global Ratings' opinion of Cambridge's stable and growing economic bases, which,

along with a very strong financial management environment, has led to predictable financial performance, While

retirement costs could rise, along with an increasing debt burden, we expect management will incorporate these costs

into the budget with no material effect on financial results over the long term, The rating is further supported by the

city's very strong reserves levels, excess levy capacity, and very strong liquidity profile. We do not expect to change

While unlikely, if economic growth were to stagnate, along with rising fixed costs, leading to significant reserve

expects long-term liabilities to remain low based on the city's capital needs, very rapid pace of
principal amortization, continued growth in economic resources, and a practice of fully funding
actuarially determined pension contributions.

Economic Resource Base: Cambridge is located in Middlesex County across the Charles River
from the city of Boston and has an estimated 2018 census population of 118,977, which is up
13% since 2010.

Key Rating Drivers

Revenue Framework: 'aaa': Revenues are derived primarily from property taxes. Total
general fund revenue growth of more than 5% annually over the past 10 fiscal years has
exceeded both U.S. GDP and CPI for the same period reflective of strong growth in
Cambridge s economy and tax base. The city maintains significant excess levy capacity under
the state's Proposition 2 1/2 law and Fitch expects revenue growth to remain strong.

Expenditure Framework: 'aa': The natural pace of spending growth is expected by Fitch to be
in line with to below natural revenue growth over time. Carrying costs for debt and retiree
benefits claim a moderate proportion of governmental spending. Fitch expects carrying costs
to remain moderate even with future debt issuances and annual increases in other-post

employment benefit (OPEB) and pension contributions. The city maintains strong legal control
over headcount and other key employment terms as provided by state statute.

Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aaa': Cambridge's combined direct debt, net of water and sewer
debt paid from user charges, and Fitch-adjusted net pension liabilities (NPL), are low at
approximately 7.5% of residents' personal income. Fitch anticipates Cambridge's long-term

liability burden will remain in line with the 'aaa' assessment based on expected growth in the
city's population and personal income, future debt plans, and a rapid pace of principal
amortization. OPEB liabilities compared to personal income are somewhat high based on a

conservative interest rate assumption, but management is actively managing these costs.

Operating Performance: 'aaa'; Careful expenditure management combined with moderate
tax levy increases and conservative financial forecasting has led to the maintenance of

considerable reserves over the past decade. Fitch expects the city will continue to
demonstrate a high level of financial resilience and gap-closing ability throughout economic

Credit Profile

The city is an important economic component of the Boston metropolitan area and
Massachusetts as a whole and benefits from the presence of both Harvard University and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These institutions are the city's top two employers

and other major employers include the city itself and Mt. Auburn Hospital, and a number of
biotechnology companies including Biogen, Novartis, Sanofi and Takeda Pharmaceutical.

Cambridge continues to strengthen its position as a national leader in the life sciences and
high tech sectors. Expansion in these sectors has contributed to notable tax base, employment
and resident income growth over the past several years and is projected by the city to

continue for at least the near term. Job growth significantly outpaced national levels in 2017
and 2018 but tapered down in 2019 to in line with national levels. Vacancy rates for office and
research lab space remain very low, which has had led to upward pressure on rents. While
space for new development is somewhat limited in Cambridge, new construction or

rehabilitation of existing properties is underway in various areas of the city and should provide

some support for demand. Wealth levels are above state and national averages and the
unemployment rate is consistently below them.

Cambridge also continues to attract research and development companies, ranging from
startups to international companies. Several major software and internet companies have
established research and development operations in Cambridge, including Microsoft, Google,

Amazon, Facebookand EMC/VMware.

Taxable assessed value (TAV) performance reflects this activity, as well as growth in
residential values. TAV grew another 12% in fiscal 2020 to $54.9 billion following growth of
12% in fiscal 2019. TAV per capita is very high at approximately $461,000. Economic
development districts located in the city continue to provide opportunities for current and

future economic expansion and new housing opportunities. The city is projecting moderate
increases in TAV in fiscal years 2021 through 2024, which Fitch considers conservative based

on new commercial and residential construction underway and proposed.

Revenue Framework

Property taxes make up approximately 63% of fiscal 2019 general fund revenues.
Intergovernmental revenues, primarily for education, and sewer use charges, accounted for

another 11% and 8%, respectively, of revenue. Excise taxes on hotel, meals and motor vehicles
and payment in lieu of taxes provide an additional moderate source of general fund revenues.

Fitch expects revenue growth to continue to be strong based on the city's solid underlying
economic fundamentals and expectations for future tax base growth from new commercial

and residential projects.

Pursuant to state law, Proposition 2 1/2 limits the city's ability to levy property taxes by: 1} a
'levy ceiling', an absolute cap on the level of property taxation, set at 2.5% of the overall

property tax valuation (primary limit); and 2} a levy limit, which restricts the annual growth in
taxation to 2.5% over the previous year's levy plus the value of new growth (secondary limit).
Taxation in excess of the levy limit (plus any new growth) requires voter approval.

Management has typically levied below the ceiling each year. Any excess in levy capacity is
carried forward and available for use at any time. The city's excess tax levy limit increased to
$190 million in fiscal 2020 from $189 million for fiscal 2019. This excess levy capacity totals
approximately 28% of the fiscal 2020 operating budget and provides for substantial revenue
raising flexibility if needed.

Expenditure Framework

Education is the city's largest expenditure, comprising 35% of fiscal 2019 general fund
expenses. Public safety follows at 22% of expenditures.

General fund expenditure growth has historically been in line with or below the pace of
revenue growth and the city has solid flexibility to reduce expenditures if necessary. Fitch
expects expenditure growth to be driven by an increase in population and services but remain
aligned with revenues going forward.

U.S.A

Carrying costs for debt service, pensions and OPEB contributions were a moderate 15% of
fiscal 2019 governmental spending and Fitch expects such costs to remain moderate going
forward. Employee salary and benefit costs as well as moderate annual increases in debt
service continue to drive annual expenditure increases.

Management has negotiated increases in health care contributions from certain employee
groups, which should help control growth in these costs. Debt service costs will trend upward
based on plans for additional debt to finance various schools, sewer and other city projects.
The carrying cost metric includes debt service costs for GO sewer debt for which the city

levies user charges.

Education will continue to be a driver of spending and management is planning moderate

annual increases in education spending over the next four years as part of its commitment to
the overall improvement of its school system and to accommodate projected enrollment

growth.

Approximately 80% of the city's employees belong to a union or collective bargaining group.

Management has the ability to impose employee layoffs and furloughs if necessary. Public
safety contracts are subject to arbitration, although the city council has the ability to vote
down an award. In such a case, both parties continue to bargain within the arbitration process.

Long-Term Liability Burden

Long-term liabilities for net overall debt plus the Fitch-adjusted NPL are low at 7.5% of

estimated personal income. Outstanding debt, net of self-supporting water and sewer debt,
accounts for 45% of the liability metric, with the city's NPL making up the remainder. Fitch

expects the burden to remain low as a percentage of personal income based on pension
funding practices, future debt plans and expectations for future growth in population and
residents' personal income.

Management is projecting the issuance of an additional $519 million in additiona! debt (almost
5% of current personal income) through 2024. Roughly 24% of this debt is expected to be

supported from user fees and will be partially offset by the principal repayment of bonds and
notes outstanding; approximately $290 million of outstanding principal is scheduled to mature
in the next four fiscal years (2021-2024). Principal amortization of outstanding GO debt
including sewer debt is rapid at 83% over the next ten years (fiscal years 2021-2030).

The city is one of four employers participating in the Cambridge Retirement System. The city

consistently funds its full actuarially determined contribution. The fiduciary net position to
total pension liabilities for the system was reported at 80% as of December 31,2018 based on

a 7.5% discount rate. Using Fitch's more conservative 6% investment rate of return, the
estimated funded ratio was 68%.

The city's net OPEB liability totaled $713 million as of June 30, 2019, based on GASB 75
reporting requirements, and represents 6.5% of personal income. The liability was determined

using a blended 3.67% discount rate, City management created an OPEB trust fund in
December 2009 and has made contributions totaling $17 million since that time with a current
value of $18.4 million. Management projects a $2 million annual contribution to the trust for
each of the next four fiscal years, based on the city's current financial forecast.

Operating Performance

Fitch expects the city to maintain a high level of financial resilience throughout an economic

cycle given its historically strong revenue performance, conservative budgeting practices and
superior degree of inherent budget flexibility, The city's steady growth in revenues has
supported surplus operations over the past several fiscal years and has built up its reserves to
high levels.

During times of economic weakness, management has controlled spending and staffing levels

to offset reductions in revenues. The city's strong budget monitoring practices and financial
planning bolster the city's operating environment.

The general fund had a fiscal 2019 net operating surplus after transfers of $19 million (nearly
3% of spending on aGAAPbasis) resulting from conservative budget assumptions and positive
variances achieved for both revenues and expenses. The general fund unrestricted fund
balance improved to $384 million or a very high 58% of spending.

U.S.A

The fiscal 2020 operating budget of $678 million was up 5.7% over the adjusted fiscal 2019
budget. Increases in spending were associated in part with higher salary and benefit costs and
increases in debt service. Management reports estimated expenditure savings compared to
budget for health insurance and other areas and higher than anticipated hotel, meals and
motor vehicle excise taxes and building permit fees due to conservative assumptions and
continued building activity. However, a higher amount of pay-go spending for capital projects

is planned to avoid borrowing. Fitch expects the city to continue to manage its budget in a way
that supports an exceptionally strong financial position throughout the economic cycle.

March 2, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am pleased to provide you with an update on the proposed Eversource substation on Fulkerson Street. 
Following months of discussions initiated by the City, Eversource, Boston Properties, and Alexandria 
Properties have reached a proposal that will lead to the relocation of the substation out of the East 
Cambridge neighborhood into the MXD district. I want to thank Eversource, Boston Properties (BXP), 
Alexandria Properties, and Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) for joining us in hearing the 
concerns of the community and for investing significant time and efforts to identify an alternative site that 
will meet the future electric needs of the City. I also want to thank Robert Reardon, who was working on 
behalf of the City Manager’s Office, for facilitating discussions between the private parties involved in 
this proposal. 
 
As you will see in the attached report from Mr. Reardon, “the proposed relocation site is on a portion of 
Boston Properties Blue Garage, which runs between Binney Street and Broadway, and will need to be 
completely demolished for construction of the substation and replacement parking.  This process will be 
led by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority which will ensure that it can be designed to have 
minimal impact in the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan (KSURP).  The cost of redeveloping this site 
is extremely high and will require zoning relief to offset these costs.  It is anticipated based upon the 
projected costs that two 400,000 square foot commercial buildings would need to be approved under the 
KSURP which is similar in total size to the most recent zoning change in the MXD zoning district.” 
 
Additionally, Tom Evans, Executive Director of the CRA, has expressed support for this proposal in a 
memo submitted to me on February 26, 2020.  Mr. Evans notes in this communication that “In addition to 
the state's regulatory process for the siting of the substation, the alternative CRA site would require an 
amendment to the KSURP, new MXD zoning, and revisions to the development agreement with BXP in 
order to allow for the additional development required to finance this alternative location. It is expected 
the MXD and KSURP amendments will be similar in scope to the MXD zoning amendments approved by 
the City in 2015 after a months long public process.”  
 
I want to thank the City Council for their leadership on this issue over the past months as the private 
parties involved investigated all available options to relocate the proposed substation from Fulkerson 
Street. Finally, I want to thank the residents of East Cambridge and Wellington-Harrington, especially the 
stakeholder group that I have been meeting with, for their patience, input, trust, and advocacy.

The fact that the City has been able to facilitate private parties reaching an agreement to relocate the 
substation from Fulkerson Street into the MXD district is a significant achievement. I want to express my 
sincere thanks for the patience and cooperation demonstrated by all parties involved in this process. 
Ultimately for this project to move forward, the needed zoning amendment to the MXD district will 
require City Council approval.

RE: 135 Fulkerson Street Site

Dear City Manager DePasquale/

After a long complicated process I am pleased to report that

an alternative site has been located for the relocation of the

proposed Ever source substation. This site selection is subject

to several additional regulatory and zoning approvals to be

finalized which will include public engagement. This alternative

site proposal could not have come together without a unique

public and private cooperative effort which will ultimately lessen

the impact on the residential neighborhood and the public school

students who would have abutted the original site at 135 Fulkerson

Street site.

This process which began approximately one year ago with a

series of meetings with stakeholders to determine what, if

anything, could be done to relocate the proposed substation to an

alternative site. In cooperation with the business community

numerous sites were vetted to determine if they would be feasible

for a relocation. The possibility of having two smaller sites was

also investigated and determined to be more adverse than one site.

This process was necessarily long because of the requirements that

a new potential site be feasible for construction of the

substation which has now been determined thanks to engineering

completed by Eversource Energy. This proposed substation will be

able to meet the electric infrastructure needs of the City of

Cambridge and to meet carbon reduction goals. The patience shown

by the stakeholders and the City Council has allowed this process

to proceed in a manner which offers a realistic solution. The

Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, Alexandria Properties/ Boston

Properties and Eversource Energy have all agreed to be a part of
this complicated plan which is highlighted below as well as

outlined in more detail from the participants.

• The proposed relocation site is on a portion of Boston

Properties Blue Garage/ which runs between Binney Street and

Broadway/ and will need to be completely demolished for

construction of the substation and replacement parking. This

Given the regulatory requirements^ the cost of the relocated

site must be reasonable as an alternative.

• In order to offset the additional cost to be incurred by Boston

Properties,. zoning relief to provide additional development

capacity is essential to make this project possible.

• Zoning relief will be needed to temporarily accommodate the

displaced parking from the Blue Garage which is under contract

by Boston Properties to Biogen. Alexandria has entered into a

MOA with Boston Properties to provide interim parking and other

parking related costs for the displaced vehicles from the Blue

Garage during reconstruction.

• Provided the necessary approval are granted Eversource would

sell the existing Fulkerson Street site to Alexandria

Properties with funds being used to purchase the Boston

Properties site.

• As set forth in the most recent version of their Commitment

Letter to the City Council, Alexandria Properties will convey

Dear Mr. City Manager,

The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) has begun to work with designers and engineers from
Boston Properties (BXP) and Eversource to understand alternative site options for the Eversource
substation originally planned for Fulkerson Street. The technical teams have been working diligently to
test the feasibility of an alternative site that utilizes the Blue Parking Garage parcel between Binney
Street and Broadway in the Kendali Square Urban Renewal Pian (KSURP). The CRA is supportive of
the effort to relocate the substation if, and only if it can be designed in a manner that has minimal
impact to the KSURP area and, in particular, to the iong-awaited development of previously permitted
housing in the MXD district.

In addition to the stale's regulatory process for the siting of the substation, the alternative CRA site
wouid require an amendment to the KSURP, new MXD zoning, and revisions to the development
agreement with BXP in order to allow for the additional development required to finance this alternative
location, it is expected the MXD and KSURP amendments will be similar in scope to the MXD zoning
amendments approved by the City in 2015 after a months long public process.

in connection with this proposal, the CRA will evaluate opportunities to further improve and enliven the
northern block of the MXD district, and enhance other elements of the public realm in the KSURP. We
will undertake a collaborative planning and urban design process with City departments as has been
conducted recently through the Infill Development Concept Plan approvals. The CRA looks forward to
engaging with the community to discuss the proposed redesign of the northern MXD block, and will
begin planning a series of public meetings in the immediate future.

Dear City Manager DePasquale:

As you are aware, there is an urgent need for additional electric infrastructure to maintain the reliable

and safe delivery of electricity to the City of Cambridge's residents, businesses and institutions and to

enable the City to meet its aggressive carbon reduction goals in the future. Eversource has been

exploring various solutions to meet this demand and, En 2016, secured a parcel of land at 135

Fulkerson Street in Cambridge as a potential site for a new substation. Based on feedback from the

city and the community, approximately eight months ago, Eversource began to engage property

owners to determine if there was a more desirable site to locate the substation.

After a series of discussions and meetings with multiple parties, including your office, Cambridge City

Councilors, the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, and community stakeholders, we have

preliminarily identified a parcel of land, currently owned by Boston Properties within the Kendall

Square MXD District, on which the proposed Eversource substation could potentially be located. The

parcel is currently the site of a structured parking facility between Broadway and Binney Street known

as the "Blue Garage." We can also report that thus far, while our joint feasibility analysis is ongoing,

preliminary engineering efforts have identified no terminal impediments to the potential relocation.

From an Eversource perspective, we can't stress enough that while the site has potential, the

Company will require certain assurances to make this a reality, including the following:

• Boston Properties provides adequate space within the parcel to, not only install ail the

electrical substation infrastructure and associated the power line duct banks, but to ensure the

ongoing safe operation and maintenance of such equipment;

• the City works collaboratively and expeditiously with Eversource to identify and provide

adequate space beneath existing city streets to install and maintain 8-10 high-voitage

transmission lines that connect the new substation to the electric grid at existing substations in
Cambridge and other nearby municipalities including the potential relocation of City utilities;

• the City works collaboratively and expeditiousiy with Eversource to provide adequate space for

as many as 50 lower voltage distribution lines that distribute the electricity to residences and

businesses in East Cambridge;

• the City supports and facilitates the location and the design of the proposed substation and the

power lines in all permitting proceedings including in local and state forums;

• the City recognizes the potential need for an interim measure to maintain reliable service in

Cambridge prior to energizing the substation and lines and agrees to similarly work

coflaborativefy and expeditiousiy to permit an additional transformer and distribution lines; and

• Eversource does not incur significant additional costs as a result of the reiocation.

Although the concept is still in its preliminary stages, we are pleased that we have been able to work

together to identify a potential alternative location for the Eversource substation currently planned to be

located at Fulkerson Street. Eversource has agreed to pause engineering work on the Fulkerson

Street location and will continue to do so provided that there is community support for the alternative

Blue Garage !ocation. We look forward to working expeditiously with afl stakeholders to address the

logistical, technical, functional, and permitting needs to advance this concept toward a viable project.

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager
City of Cambridge
795 Massachusetts Avenue
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139

Dear City Manager DePasquale:

This letter is to confirm in response to a request from your office that Boston Properties
has been working with Eversource over the past eight months to identify a parcel of land within
the MXD District to which the proposed Eversource substation could potentially be relocated
from the 135 Fulkerson Street site in Cambridge. The parcel is currently the site of a structured
parking facility between Broadway and Binney Street known as the "Blue Garage," and has

already been slated for redevelopment as part of a master planning process that has taken place
over the past several years through approvals issued by the Planning Board and the Cambridge
Redevelopment Authority (CRA)

In order for the site to be developed for the proposed substation, Boston Properties would

have to demolish the approximately 1000-space Blue Garage in its entirety and replicate this
parking underground, at significant cost to the company. Additional construction work will also
be necessary to prepare the site to accommodate the substation.

In addition to the aforementioned construction activity, it will also be necessary for the

existing zoning for the MXD District to be amended in order to allow for more modifications to
the Special Permit PB#315 issued by the Planning Board in 2017 approving an Infill
Development Concept Plan for this parcel. Similarly, approvals from the CRA will be required to
modify portions of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan and the existing Development
Agreement between the CRA and Boston Properties.

The design, engineering and construction costs associated with this relocation effort are

considerable. In order to make this project economically feasible, we have engaged in
preliminary discussions with the CRA about the filing of a zoning petition to increase the
existing GFA thresholds in the MXD District similar to the petition filed by them in 2015 that
created the Infill Development Concept Plan. The intent of the zoning petition would allow for

the future construction of two commercial buildings of approximately 400,000 square feet each

project.

transaction.

We should also acknowledge the efforts and commitments of the team at Alexandria Real

Estate Equities to arrange for temporary parking for our tenants following the demolition of the
Blue Garage and during the construction period of the relocated substation, and for their
commitment to purchase the Eversource Fulkerson Street parcel to facilitate the relocation

Although this project is still in its preliminary stages, we are pleased to have been able to
offer our site as a proposed alternative to Fulkerson Street and we look forward to working with
all of the stakeholders to continue to advance this plan.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Technology:

1. Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data. 

(cid:120) Cameras are installed on all school buses, including buses for special education 

students, along with a posted notice that video recording is taking place. 

(cid:120) The cameras on the school buses allow usthe school department to review any 

incidents that take place, after the event is over.  The cameras allow usthe department
to determine the source of any behavioral outburstsissues on the bus, many of which 
take place out of the line of sight of the bus driver.

(cid:120)

Images and audio are recorded to a box, and the images & audio are retrieved 
manually by the Transportation Director when investigating an incident.  

2. What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology?

(cid:120) Supporting the safety of all students and staff on bus transportation by addressing 

disruptive behavior appropriately.

(cid:120) These cameras provide footage of any behavioral issues that may occur on school 

buses.  The footage helps CPS staff and parents clarify what actually happened during 
an incident and supplements any report from a student or bus driver. 

3. Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

(cid:120) All school buses have carried these on board cameras since their original installation 

in FY13.

4. What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

(cid:120) The data from these cameras is not maintained, but is over-recorded at monthly 

intervals.  Without physically retrieving the imaginingimaging data from the bus, it is 
not accessible to anyone.

(cid:120) For all students riding the busses their images and voices are recorded and saved to 

the device located on each bus. 

(cid:120) The recordings are secure and only accessed by the CPS Transportation Director in 
the event of an event investigation. At that time the recordings may be reviewed by 
select CPS Administrators. In some cases, parents can view the footage, but only of 
their child. All other students are blurred. 

(cid:120) All data, unless otherwise archived, is overwritten every 30 days. 

5. What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

(cid:120) The initial cost of the SEON camera system was $47,190 when it was installed in the 

spring of 2013.

(cid:120) There have been ongoing maintenance expenditures for moving equipment to newer 

buses, and adding cameras as needed. 

o FY14 $4,955
o FY16 $12,500

(cid:120)

It is not possible to determine the personnel costs of using this equipment.  The 
Transportation Director must board a bus after an incident and download the images 
in order to proceed with an investigation, but it is difficult to quantify the time 
involved.

(cid:120) Both equipment and personnel were funded from the School Department General 

Fund.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

20.51   

HARVARD SQUARE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND HARVARD SQUARE HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT 
Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Harvard Square Overlay District, 
the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District, and Harvard Square Conservation District Goals 
and Guidelines which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this 
Section 20.50. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to an area 
described generally as the Harvard Square business district and certain abutting portions of 
the neighborhoods around it. 

20.51.1   The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on the Zoning 

Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square Historic Overlay 
District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay district that is encompassed 
by any historic district duly established by the City Council under the authority granted 
by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts or any Neighborhood Conservation District established by the City 
Council under the provisions of chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. All 
provisions of the Harvard Square Overlay District and all references to it in this 
Ordinance shall apply equally to the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District except as 
set forth below.  

General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning 
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to the 
Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more careful 
public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban form of the 
Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the extreme development 
pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique functional environment and 
visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the functional impacts of new development 
on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to maintain the present diversity of development 
and open space patterns and building scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory 
flexibility to advance the general purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility 
granted to development within the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to 
facilitate the protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of 
Harvard Square while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate 
contemporary changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. 
General Provisions.  

The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special planning 
concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, Development 
Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development Consultation Procedure 
specified in Article 19.40 except that any Large Project Review (new buildings of 2,000 

20.52   

20.53   

20.53.1  

Packet Pg. 184

square feet or more) shall be conducted by the Harvard Square Advisory Committee 
using procedures specified in Subsection 20.54.1 of this Section 20.50.  
20.53.2  Criteria for Development Consultation Review and Review of Applications for Special 

2.4

20.53.3  National Register and Contributing Buildings. For the purposes of this Section 20.50 the 

Permits and Variances. In reviewing applications for variances, special permits or 
development consultation reviews the permit or special permit granting authority or the 
Harvard Square Advisory Committee shall be guided by the objectives and criteria 
contained in the publication Harvard Square Development Guidelines [Document 
complied from the Guidelines for Development and Historic Preservation as contained 
in the Final Report of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study 
Committee, dated November 29, 2000 and the Harvard Square Development 
Guidelines, 1986], in addition to the requirements of Sections 10.30 (Variances) and 
10.40 (Special Permits) and this Section 20.50. These guidelines are also intended to 
assist in shaping any contemplated physical change within the Harvard Square Overlay 
District  

following definitions shall apply:  
1.  National Register Building shall be a building individually listed or determined eligible 

for the National Register of Historic Places as determined by the Secretary of the 
Department of the Interior.  

2.  A contributing building shall be:  

a.  Identified as a contributing building in a listed or eligible National Register 
District as determined by the Secretary of the Department of Interior; or  

b.  A building located outside a National Register District but identified as a 
contributing building in the Harvard Square Development Guidelines, 
Community Development Department, July 1, 1986.  

However, a building shall no longer be considered a contributing building as defined in 
this Subsection 20.53.3(b) for the purposes of this Section 20.50 if, upon application for 
a demolition permit, the Cambridge Historical Commission shall determine the building 
not to be a preferably preserved significant building as defined in the City of Cambridge 
Demolition Ordinance. 

Advisory Committee, with members appointed by the City Manager, which shall have the 
following duties, responsibilities, and membership.  
1.  Purpose. It is the intent of this Subsection 20.54.1 that the Committee shall in its 

official actions fulfill the following purposes.  
a.  To establish a formal, ongoing body that will review all major development 

actions in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  

b.  To provide a forum within which a wide range of perspectives on development 

actions can be heard.  

c.   To support local businesses and uses that enhance the vibrancy and historical 
nature of Harvard Square with the aspirational goal of maintaining a seventy 
percent local and non-formula retail experience throughout the district, at the 
ground floor level. 

d.   To establish a citizen/professional body which can advise both public agencies 
and private interests as to the development and urban design issues raised by a 
development or planning proposal and suggest avenues of research which 
might be pursued to resolve identified conflicts or make the project better 
fulfill both public and private objectives for the Harvard Square Overlay 

20.54    

Detailed Provisions .  

20.54.1  Harvard Square Advisory Committee. There shall be established a Harvard Square

District.  

2.  Responsibilities. The Committee shall undertake all Large Project Reviews and shall 

receive all applications for variances and special permits for activities within the 
Harvard Square Overlay District for review and comment. In addition, the 
Committee may comment on any preliminary proposal for which any public agency 
or private interest has planned for the Overlay. The Committee shall meet on an 
approximately monthly basis or with as much frequency as is needed to address 
pertinent issues in the Harvard Square Overlay District, with the schedule to be 
determined at the discretion of the Chair. 

3.  Procedures.  

a.  Within six (6) months preceding any application for (1) a building permit for 

any project subject to Large Project Development Consultation Review or (2) 
a special permit or variance for any project within the Harvard Square 
Overlay District, the graphic and other material required in Section 19.43.2 - 
Application for a Large Project Review shall be submitted to the Harvard 
Square Advisory Committee for their review and comment.  

b.  Within thirty (30) days of that submittal, [or within up to sixty (60) days with 
the written consent of the applicant] the Committee shall prepare a written 
report of findings and recommendations with respect to the applicant's 
proposed project.  

c.  The Committee's written report shall outline the urban design and development 
issues raised by the proposal. It shall suggest those areas within which 
additional exploration of alternatives might be sought or factual information 
gathered which might help to resolve potential conflicts between the public 
and private objectives or which help to shape the project to better serve these 
objectives.  

d.  The report shall be forwarded to the applicant and shall be included in any 

application for a building permit, special permit or variance.  

e.  It is expected that, in making decisions regarding special permits and variances 
within the Overlay District, the Planning Board and/or Zoning Board of 
Appeal will give due consideration to the report and recommendations of the 
Advisory Committee. Where the Committee makes recommendations with 
respect to the granting of special permits and/or variances, and the Planning 
Board and/or Zoning Board of Appeal does not follow said 
recommendations, then the Board(s) shall make written reply to the 
Committee, detailing why the Board(s)'s decisions were different from the 
Committee recommendations.

members shall have terms of three years each. On an annual basis at the first 
meeting in September the Harvard Square Advisory Committee will elect a 
Chair who may serve no more than two (2) years as chair within a three (3) 
year period. 

20.54.2   Building Height Limitations. The maximum height of buildings in the Harvard Square 

Overlay District shall be governed by the requirements of this Section 20.54.2; however, 
at locations where the base zoning district establishes a more restrictive height 
limitation, the more restrictive shall apply.  
1.  As of Right Height Limitations. The maximum height of any building shall be sixty 

20.54.3  Retail, Business, and Consumer Service Establishments (Section 4.35) in Office and 

(60) feet.  

2.  Special Permit for Additional Height. The maximum allowable height in the Harvard 
Square Overlay District may be increased up to eighty (80) feet upon issuance of a 
Special Permit by the Planning Board. If a Special Permit is issued portions of the 
building may extend to eighty (80) feet in height provided that those portions in 
excess of sixty (60) feet are set back from the street line at least ten (10) feet, and 
that those portions are also set back from one or more forty-five (45) degree sky 
exposure planes, unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Board. A forty-five 
(45) degree sky exposure plane shall be an imaginary inclined plane beginning fifty-
five (55) feet above any streetline in the districts and rising over one or more lots at 
a forty-five (45 ) degree angle.  
Allowed Special Permit exceptions to upper floor setbacks must successfully reduce 
the overall negative effect of multiple floor setbacks and enhance both the proposed 
building silhouette and townscape of the block. Such architectural elements as 
pergolas, and occupiable corner pavilions, occupiable pavilion directly above the 
main building entry, and special features that animate the public domain experience. 
All such exceptions are to be limited in scope and work cohesively. 
All approved facade setbacks are to provide accessible, useable balconies for 
tenants. 

Residential Districts.  
1.  Any retail use (4.35) allowed in the Business B zoning districts, as of right, within the 
Overlay may also be allowed as of right in any office or residential zone within the 
Overlay provided the structure that contains the use has a main entrance on 
Massachusetts Avenue, Mt. Auburn Street, Arrow Street or Bow Street. For all other 
lots, the Planning Board may allow by special permit the retail use of a lot or 
structure all or partially within the Harvard Square Overlay District and in a base 
residential or office district where retail uses are not permitted under the provisions 
of Section 4.30 - Table of Use Regulations; provided, however, that the following 
conditions are met:  
a.  The general purposes of this Section 20.50 are met.  
b.  The use will be located in a structure in existence as of June 1, 1985.  
c.  The addition of such use(s) will assist in the preservation, rehabilitation and/or 
restoration of a National Register or contributing building or important open 
space by increasing the economic feasibility of maintaining such features.  

d.  The preservation of the buildings and open space identified in (c) above is 

assured through an approved mechanism for the full period that the special 
permit is in force and effect.  

e.  The proposed use will preserve, rehabilitate or restore the outward appearance 

Packet Pg. 187

2.4

f.  In its operation the use will not, in impact, be significantly different from the 

of the structure or open space.  

uses permitted in the base district.  

g.  The use is completely contained within the structure.  
h.  The use will be patronized substantially by pedestrians and will, if required by 
the Planning Board, function adequately without additional off street parking 
or loading facilities and will in any case not generate vehicular traffic in 
quantity and type substantially different from that generated by permitted 
uses.  

i.  The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.  
j.  The use is not a formula business. 
k.   The following uses listed in Section 4.35 are however specifically prohibited:  

4.35j  (Mortuary, undertaking or funeral establishment);  
4.35l  (Veterinary establishment, kennel, pet shop);  
4.35m  (Sales place for new and used cars);  
4.35p  (Massage establishment); 
4.35s   (Cannabis Retail Store). 

2.  In the Office 2 base district the provisions of Section 4.40 - Footnotes to the Table of 
Use Regulations, footnote 12, shall not apply in the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

20.54.4  Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Harvard Square Overlay District which 

meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and loading 
requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and Loading 
Requirements.  
1.  The use is contained within a structure or portion of a structure in existence on or 
before June 1, 1940 or if constructed later is identified as a National Register or 
contributing building; or  

2.  The use is contained in a new structure or new addition to a structure identified in 
(1.) above, after the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board provided:  
a.  The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a development 

pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the retention of existing 
structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a specific finding shall be 
made that this objective has been met).  

b.  The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from parking and 

loading requirements will result in a building design that is more appropriate 
to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and that it is in 
conformance with the objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square 
Development Guidelines.  

c.  No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing 
building; and  

d.  No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or altered 
so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) years 
preceding the application. 

20.54.5  Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's positive diversity 

of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards and courtyards is 
encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to permit design flexibility 
to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the character of the area within 
which it is located. To this end any building in the Harvard Square Overlay District shall 

Packet Pg. 188

2.4

be exempt from the yard requirements as specified in Section 5.30, (except where such 
yard abuts a lot, but not a public way, outside the Overlay District) if the following 
conditions are met:  
1.  The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been issued by 

that date, or  

2.  For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning district, for 
which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the Planning Board 
issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard requirements provided:  
a.  The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the objectives 
and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development Guidelines.  

b.  No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing 
building; and  

c.  No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the site in 

the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to terminate or 
preclude its designation or demolished prior to the application. 

3. 

For any new building in a Business B district seeking a Special Permit a rear yard 
setback of twenty (20) feet shall be provided with upper floor ten (10) foot 
setbacks beginning at forty-five (45) feet above grade. The resulting yard shall 
create a landscaped open space. 

 

20.54.6  Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area (FAR) in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay 
District. Notwithstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 5.000 or elsewhere in this 
Ordinance, the maximum FAR applicable in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District 
shall be as follows: Business B district: 4.0 for all Non-Residential Uses and 4.0 for all 
Residential Uses (4.31 a-h; Office 3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Office 2 district: 2.0 for all 
uses; Residence C-3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Residence C-2B district: 1.75 for all uses; 
Residence C-1 district: 0.75 for all uses; Business A district: 1.0 for all uses except 
dwellings, 1.75 for dwellings.  

20.54.7  Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit granting 

authority (Planning Board) may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot 
in the Business B district located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for any 
residential use in section 4.31 (a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or 4.35 
provided the Planning Board finds that the use and design complies with the goals and 
design guidelines set forth in the Harvard Square Conservation District and provides 
additional public benefits commensurate with the additional development, such as the 
following: 
1. 

Ground floors that are devoted to retail and similar uses that activate the 
square and serve the needs of the surrounding community and visitors; 
Commitments to recruit and retain small, local, and independent businesses, in 
part through maintaining 50 percent of first floor public frontage as commercial 
rental space of approximately 1,500 sq. ft.in size; 
Creation of mixed-income housing;  
Commitments to sustainable design that minimize greenhouse gas emissions 
and increases vegetation, and; 
Investments into creating or improving public space. 

2. 

3. 
4. 

5. 

20.54.8  FAR Exemption for Ground Floor Retail. Retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or less shall be 

excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio. 

20.54.9  Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as identified 

Packet Pg. 189

2.4

in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of the ground-floor 
level frontage of a building facing a street, measured horizontally parallel to that street. 
In addition, such uses shall not occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s 
total horizontal ground-floor building frontage aggregated over one or more streets. 
The Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a minor increase in the 
permitted frontage upon finding that such increase would create a result that is more 
compatible with the unique conditions of a particular building or site and that the 
criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above are met. 

20.54.10   Fast Order Food Establishments (as identified in Section 4.35o) are allowed by right 

within the Harvard Square Overlay District and are further not subject to the provisions 
of Article 11.30 of this Ordinance provided the Fast Order Food Establishment is not a 
Formula Business. 

20.55  Sign Regulations in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District.  

20.55.1  All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic District, except as 
modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow greater flexibility in the 
size, location and illumination of signs in order to encourage more thoughtful design of 
individual signs, to encourage greater respect for the building and visual context within 
which new signs are erected, and thereby add interest and character to the shopping 
environment in Harvard Square.  
1.  In Section 7.16.22 - Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts, Paragraphs A, 

B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts. However, no sign on 
the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet above grade.  
2.  In Section 7.16.3 - Application of the Sign Frontage Formula shall not apply.  
3.  In the Residence C-2B base district the provisions of Section 7.16.22 shall apply to 

permitted or legally established nonconforming office and retail uses.

All changes are highlighted.  Additions are underlined and deletions are striked though 

 

20.50 

20.51  

20.52  

HARVARD SQUARE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND HARVARD SQUARE 
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT 

  Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Harvard Square Overlay 
District and, the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District, and Harvard Square 
Conservation District Goals and Guidelines which shall be governed by the 
regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.50. It is the intent of this 
section that these regulations will apply to an area described generally as the Harvard 
Square business district and certain abutting portions of the neighborhoods around it. 

20.51.1  

 The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on 
the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square 
Historic Overlay District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay 
district that is encompassed by any historic district duly established by the City 
Council under the authority granted by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of 
the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any Neighborhood 
Conservation District established by the City Council under the provisions of 
chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. All provisions of the Harvard 
Square Overlay District and all references to it in this Ordinance shall apply 
equally to the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District except as set forth below.  

  General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning 
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to 
the Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more 
careful public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban 
form of the Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the 
extreme development pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique 
functional environment and visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the 
functional impacts of new development on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to 
maintain the present diversity of development and open space patterns and building 
scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory flexibility to advance the general 
purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility granted to development 
within the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to facilitate the 
protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of Harvard Square 
while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary 
changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. 

20.53  

  General Provisions.  

20.53.1   The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special 

planning concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, 
Development Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development

a.   To establish a formal, ongoing body that will review all major 
development actions in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  
b.   To provide a forum within which a wide range of perspectives on 

development actions can be heard.  

c.   To support local businesses and uses that enhance the vibrancy and 
historical nature of Harvard Square with the aspirational goal of 
maintaining a seventy percent local and non-formula retail experience 
throughout the district, at the ground floor level. 

cd.   To establish a citizen/professional body which can advise both public 
agencies and private interests as to the development and urban design 
issues raised by a development or planning proposal and suggest 
avenues of research which might be pursued to resolve identified 
conflicts or make the project better fulfill both public and private 
objectives for the Harvard Square Overlay District.  

2.   Responsibilities. The Committee shall undertake all Large Project Reviews 
and shall receive all applications for variances and special permits for 
activities within the Harvard Square Overlay District for review and 
comment. In addition, the Committee may comment on any preliminary 
proposal for which any public agency or private interest may wish to receive 
advice and recommendations has planned for the Overlay. The Committee 
shall meet on an approximately monthly basis or with as much frequency as 
is deemed required needed to address pertinent issues in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District, with the schedule to be determined at the discretion of the 
Chair. 
3.   Procedures.  

a.   Within six (6) months preceding any application for (1) a building 
permit for any project subject to Large Project Development 
Consultation Review or (2) a special permit or variance for any project 
within the Harvard Square Overlay District, the graphic and other 
material required in Section 19.43.2 - Application for a Large Project 
Review shall be submitted to the Harvard Square Advisory Committee 
for their review and comment.  

b.   Within thirty (30) days of that submittal, [or within up to sixty (60) 
days with the written consent of the applicant] the Committee shall 
prepare a written report of findings and recommendations with respect 
to the applicant's proposed project.  

c.   The Committee's written report shall outline the urban design and 

development issues raised by the proposal. It shall suggest those areas 
within which additional exploration of alternatives might be sought or 
factual information gathered which might help to resolve potential 
conflicts between the public and private objectives or which help to 
shape the project to better serve these objectives.  

d.   The report shall be forwarded to the applicant and shall be included in 
any application for a building permit, special permit or variance.  
It is expected that, in making decisions regarding special permits and 
variances within the Overlay District, the Planning Board and/or

1.   As of Right Height Limitations. The maximum height of any building shall 

be sixty (60) feet.  

2.   Special Permit for Additional Height. The maximum allowable height in the 
Harvard Square Overlay District may be increased up to eighty (80) feet 
upon issuance of a Special Permit by the Planning Board. If a Special Permit 
is issued portions of the building may extend to eighty (80) feet in height 
provided that those portions in excess of sixty (60) feet are set back from the 
street line at least ten (10) feet, and that those portions are also set back from 
one or more forty-five (45) degree sky exposure planes, unless otherwise 
permitted by the Planning Board. A forty-five (45) degree sky exposure plane 
shall be an imaginary inclined plane beginning fifty-five (55) feet above any 
streetline in the districts and rising over one or more lots at a forty-five (45 ) 
degree angle.  

3.   Deleted. 

20.54.3   Retail, Business, and Consumer Service Establishments (Section 4.35) in Office 

and Residential Districts.  
1.   Any retail use (4.35) allowed in the Business B zoning districts within the 

Overlay may also be allowed as of right in any office or residential zone 
within the Overlay provided the structure that contains the use has a main 
entrance on Massachusetts Avenue, Mt. Auburn Street, Harvard Street Arrow 
Street or Bow Street. For all other lots, the Planning Board may allow by 
special permit the retail use of a lot or structure all or partially within the 
Harvard Square Overlay District and in a base residential or office district 
where retail uses are not permitted under the provisions of Section 4.30 - 
Table of Use Regulations; provided, however, that the following conditions 
are met or findings made:  
a.   The general purposes of this Section 20.50 are met.  
b.   The use will be located in a structure in existence as of June 1, 1985 

and will not involve significant new construction.  

c.   The addition of such use(s) will assist in the preservation, rehabilitation 
and/or restoration of a National Register or contributing building or 
important open space by increasing the economic feasibility of 
maintaining such features.  

d.   The preservation of the buildings and open space identified in (c) above 
is assured through an approved mechanism for the full period that the 
special permit is in force and effect.  

e.   The proposed use will preserve, rehabilitate or restore the outward 

f.  

appearance of the structure or open space.  
In its operation the use will not, in impact, be significantly different 
from the uses permitted in the base district.  

g.   The use is completely contained within the structure.  
h.   The use will be patronized substantially by pedestrians and will, if 

required by the Planning Board, function adequately without additional 
off street parking or loading facilities and will in any case not generate 
vehicular traffic in quantity and type substantially different from that 
generated by permitted uses.

i.   The applicant can demonstrate a need for the use(s) as a service to 

adjacent residential communities or to the academic community and 
can demonstrate that for economic or other reasons the use cannot 
easily be located in existing business or office districts where the use is 
permitted. In addition the applicant must demonstrate that either the use 
has been displaced as result of redevelopment elsewhere in the Harvard 
Square Overlay District, or that the use is important in its contribution 
to the variety, continuity, or uniqueness of the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

ji.   The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.  
kj.   The use is not a formula business. 
lk.   The proposed use is not located in a base Residence C-2B or Office 2 

District. The following uses listed in Section 4.35 are however 
specifically prohibited:  
4.35e  (Lunchroom, restaurant, cafeteria);  
4.35f  (Establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold and 

consumed and where no dancing or entertainment is provided);  
4.35g  (Bar or other establishment where alcoholic beverages are sold 

and where dancing is provided);

Table of Use Regulations, footnote 12, shall not apply in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District.  

3.   The conditions and required findings mentioned in this Section 20.54.3 are 
not severable, and if a court declares any such condition or required finding 
invalid, then this Section 20.54.3 shall cease to operate in its entirety, and no 
additional special permits shall be issued under its authority. 

20.54.4   Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Harvard Square Overlay District 

which meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and 
loading requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and 
Loading Requirements.  

1.   The use is contained within a structure or portion of a structure in existence 

on or before June 1, 1940 or if constructed later is identified as a National

made to the Harvard Square Improvement Fund to be established by the 
City of Cambridge in an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the cost 
of construction of the spaces not provided, said contribution to be used 
by the City of Cambridge for one or more of the following capital 
improvements in the Harvard Square Overlay District:  

(1)   Provision of public parking, preferably for short term users;  

(2)  

Improvements to public parks, or restoration of historic 
structures, monuments and other features owned by the City of 
Cambridge or other public agency or a nonprofit organization;  

(3)   Extension throughout the Harvard Square Overlay District of the 
surface improvements installed by the MBTA as part of the Red 
Line subway extension(brick sidewalks, light post, street 
furniture, etc.)  

The Harvard Square Advisory Committee shall receive and make 
comments on any proposal for the expenditure of such cash 
contributions. To the extent practicable the provision of public parking 
facilities shall be the first priority of any expenditure. The funds shall 
not be used for ordinary maintenance activities normally undertaken by 
the City of Cambridge.  

The value of the cash contribution shall be determined by the 
Community Development Department assuming equivalent structured 
parking spaces and using generally accepted cost estimation methods 
customarily used by architects and engineers or using actual 
construction costs for comparable contemporary parking construction in 
Cambridge.  

ab.   The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a 

development pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the 
retention of existing structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a 
specific finding shall be made that this objective has been met).  

bc.   The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from 

parking and loading requirements will result in a building design that is 
more appropriate to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and 
that it is in conformance with the objectives and criteria contained in 
Harvard Square Development Guidelines.  

cd.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and

de.   No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or 
altered so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) 
years preceding the application. 

20.54.5   Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's 

positive diversity of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards 
and courtyards is encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to 
permit design flexibility to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the 
character of the area within which it is located. To this end any building in the 
Harvard Square Overlay District shall be exempt from the yard requirements as 
specified in Section 5.30, (except where such yard abuts a lot, but not a public 
way, outside the Overlay District) if the following conditions are met:  

1.   The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been 

issued by that date, or  

2.   For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning 

district, for which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the 
Planning Board issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard 
requirements provided:  

a.   The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the 
objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development 
Guidelines.  

b.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and  

c.   No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the 

site in the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation or demolished prior to the 
application.  

20.54.6   Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area (FAR) in the Harvard Square 

Historic Overlay District. Notwithstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 
5.000 or elsewhere in this Ordinance, the maximum FAR applicable in the 
Harvard Square Historic Overlay District shall be as follows: Business B district: 
4.0 for all Non-Residential Uses and 4.0 for all Residential Uses (4.31 a-h) uses 
except dwellings, 3.0 for dwellings; Office 3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Office 2 
district: 2.0 for all uses; Residence C-3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Residence C-2B 
district: 1.75 for all uses; Residence C-1 district: 0.75 for all uses; Business A 
district: 1.0 for all uses except dwellings, 1.75 for dwellings.  

20.54.7   Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit 

granting authority may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot 
in the Business B district located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for 
any residential use in section 4.31 (a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or

4.35 provided the use and design complies with the goals and design guidelines 
set forth in the Harvard Square Conservation District. 

20.54.8   FAR Exemption for Ground Floor Retail. Retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or 

less shall be excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio. 

20.54.9   Restricted Uses. No bank or financial institution (Section 4.34e) or Cannabis 

Retail Store (Section 11.803.1), shall occupy more than twenty (20’) feet of 
building frontage within the Harvard Square Overlay, and no more than thirty 
percent (30%) of a lot’s aggregate ground-floor building frontage facing one or 
more public streets may be occupied by such uses.  

Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as 
identified in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of 
the ground-floor level frontage of a building facing a street, measured 
horizontally parallel to that street. In addition, such uses shall not occupy more 
than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s total horizontal ground-floor building 
frontage aggregated over one or more streets. The Planning Board may grant a 
special permit to allow a minor increase in the permitted frontage upon finding 
that such increase would create a result that is more compatible with the unique 
conditions of a particular building or site and that the criteria set forth in Section 
20.53.2 above are met. 

20.54.10   Fast Order Food Establishments (as identified in Section 4.35o) are allowed by 
right within the Harvard Square Overlay District and are further not subject to 
the provisions of Article 11.30 of this Ordinance provided the Fast Order Food 
Establishment is not a Formula Business. 

20.55   Sign Regulations in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District.  

20.55.1   All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic 

District, except as modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow 
greater flexibility in the size, location and illumination of signs in order to 
encourage more thoughtful design of individual signs, to encourage greater 
respect for the building and visual context within which new signs are erected, 
and thereby add interest and character to the shopping environment in Harvard 
Square.  

1.  

In Section 7.16.22 - Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts, 
Paragraphs A, B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts. 
However, no sign on the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet 
above grade.  

2.  

In Section 7.16.3 - Application of the Sign Frontage Formula shall not apply.  

3.  

In the Residence C-2B base district the provisions of Section 7.16.22 shall 
apply to permitted or legally established nonconforming office and retail 
uses.

2. 
To see if the City Council will vote to amend Article 20 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of 
Cambridge by adding the following text at the end of Article 20 as presently ordained: 
20.1000  
20.1001  
There is hereby established the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District, which is governed by the 
regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.1000.  It is the intent of this Section that these 
regulations will apply to land within the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District, which is comprised of 
Grand Junction Land and Development Land, as defined below. 
20.1002  
It is the purpose of the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District to augment base zoning and promote the 

Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District 
Establishment and Scope.   

Purpose.   

Packet Pg. 223

2.5

development of a public pathway along the Grand Junction railroad right-of-way in connection with high 
quality development consistent with development along the Binney Street corridor.   
The October 2001 East Cambridge Planning Study identified the Grand Junction corridor as a means to 
provide a significant transportation and recreational resource and enhance non-auto mobility in the City.  
The October 2006 Grand Junction Rail-with-Trail Feasibility Study highlighted the public benefits of the 
pathway, including recreation and open space, but noted that acquiring rights in the land to develop the 
pathway was a key limiting issue.  The August 2017 Final Report of the Kendall Square Mobility Task 
Force underscored the importance of enhancing non-auto mobility in the City and the Grand Junction 
Pathway in meeting that goal. 
The Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District will facilitate the City’s efforts to secure long term public 
access to certain land in the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District by incenting development 
consistent with development along the Binney Street corridor.  A project meeting the requirements of this 
Section will provide open space, recreational opportunities, a corridor for non-auto traffic in the City, as 
well as high quality development, and promote the goals of public health, safety, welfare and economic 
development. 
20.1003  
Development in the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District shall be controlled by the regulations 
governing the Industry A-1 District, except as modified by the requirements of this Section 20.1000, 
which shall apply in lieu of the regulations of the Industry A-1 District.  Where the regulations applicable 
to the Industry A-1 District differ from the requirements of this Section 20.1000, the provisions of this 
Section shall apply.  The Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District shall be established on the Zoning 
Map of the City of Cambridge pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.20. 

Applicability.

In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty 

 
 
That the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge be amended on a petition by Joseph T. Maguire on 
behalf of the Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., to amend the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge as 
follows: 
 
By creating a new overlay zoning district entitled Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District in the area of 
the existing Grand Junction Railroad Right of Way between Cambridge Street and Binney Street, and to 
amend Article 20.000 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge by creating a Section 20.1000 
Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District. 
 
The stated purpose of the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District would be to promote the 
development of a public pathway along the Grand Junction railroad right-of-way in connection with high 
quality development consistent with development along the Binney Street corridor. 
 
The provisions of Section 20.1000, which would be subject to special permit approval by the Planning 
Board, would require the conveyance to the City by fee or easement of a strip of land along the Grand 
Junction rail corridor to be used for a public pathway, and would allow development on other identified 
parcels of land referred to as 303 and 345 Binney Street for uses otherwise allowed in the base Industry 
A-1 district, with a maximum building height of 105 feet along Binney Street and 60 feet in the 
Transition Zone, a maximum floor area ratio of 2.5 multiplied by the area of the industrially zoned 
portion of the development parcel and 1.25 multiplied by the area of the balance of the development 
parcel, and provisions related to gross floor area exemptions, setbacks, parking, and other matters. 
 
 
 

                                         meeting held on February 10, 2020 and on or after 

Passed to a second reading at the City Council 

February 24, 2020 the question comes on passage to be 
ordained. 
 
Attest:- Anthony I. Wilson 
 
 
 
 

     City Clerk 

 
 
NOTE:  Pursuant to the provisions of General Laws, Chapter 40, Section 32A, Tercentenary Edition, the 
ordinance as aforesaid which exceeds in length eight octavo pages of ordinary book print may be 
summarized for publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city with the further provision 
that said Ordinance may be examined and obtained at the City Clerk’s Office during office hours and 
that any objection to its invalidity by reason of any defect in the procedure of adoption may only be 
made within ninety days after the posting or the second publication.

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours,

Alexandria’s Commitments 

2. 

3. 

The Grand Junction Land shall be conveyed to the City per Section 20.1005 of the Grand 
Junction Zoning no later than ninety (90) days after the Special Permits and approvals 
required under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance are granted allowing Alexandria to 
build the Project, and appeal periods for such Special Permits and approvals shall have 
expired without any appeal having been made, or in the event that any appeal does occur, 
the outcome of said appeal shall not result in a change in the validity, or reduction in the 
development rights set forth in the Special Permits and approvals (“Special Permit 
Condition”), subject to the City completing its land acceptance process (“City Land 
Acceptance Condition”), and Alexandria completing any work required such that the 
environmental condition of the Grand Junction Land poses No Significant Risk, as 
defined in 310 CMR 40.0006, to future users of the land given its intended use as a public 
pathway, per Section 20.1006 of the Grand Junction Zoning (“Cleanup Condition”).  For 
the avoidance of doubt, the Special Permit Condition shall not include a building permit. 

Alexandria will contribute up to $11,250,000 to the City to enable the City to design and 
construct improvements for the Grand Junction bike path on the Grand Junction Land, 
such contribution to be made on the following schedule:  (a) $1,000,000 no later than 
ninety (90) days after the Special Permit Condition is satisfied; and (b) $10,250,000 no 
later than ninety (90) days after the issuance of a Permanent Certificate of Occupancy for 
the Project and no challenge to the validity of the same shall have been made (or in the 
event of any challenge, such challenge shall have been finally resolved in favor of such 
validity).  The use of such funds will be restricted to the purpose for which they are 
contributed. 

NStar Electric Company d/b/a Eversource Energy (“Eversource”) is the owner of Tax Lot 
32-52 (“Eversource Land”), which abuts the Development Land.  For a period of three 
years after the adoption of the Grand Junction Zoning and no challenge to the validity of 
the same having been made (or in the event of any challenge, such challenge having been 
finally resolved in favor of such validity), Alexandria shall use commercially reasonable 
efforts to purchase the Eversource Land (for the conveyance to the City for public use), 
subject to and conditioned on the following:  (i) Eversource is willing to sell the 
Eversource Land to Alexandria; (ii) the results of Alexandria’s due diligence 
investigations (including without limitation title, survey and the environmental status of 
the Eversource Land) are satisfactory to Alexandria in Alexandria’s sole discretion; and 
(iii) Alexandria’s total cost to purchase the Eversource Land shall not exceed 
$12,929,000.  (For the purposes of this Paragraph 3, Alexandria may include an affiliate 
nominee of Alexandria.)  If, despite its exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, 
Alexandria has not acquired the Eversource Land within such three year period, then 
Alexandria will contribute $12,292,000 to a designee identified by the City to [insert 
purpose/funding recipient] and this Paragraph 3 shall be of no further force or effect.

4. 

Alexandria, by and through its affiliate, ARE-MA Region No. 58, LLC, the owner of the 
land and building known as the Kendall Square Garage (Tax Lot 39-174) (“Garage 
Parcel”), hereby agrees that any new building constructed on and as part of a

February __, 2020 
Page 3 
 
 

redevelopment of the Garage Parcel shall not exceed the total height (including any 
penthouse or rooftop mechanicals) and massing of the existing One Kendall Square 
Garage. Any construction or redevelopment on the Garage Parcel will follow the current 
height of the parking garage that has a maximum total height along Binney Street and is 
reduced in tiers north towards Linden Park. Any future construction or redevelopment of 
the Garage Parcel will have the same set back from Linden Park as the current Kendall 
Square Garage.  Said restrictions shall be effective on the issuance of a Permanent 
Certificate of Occupancy for the Project adoption of the Grand Junction Zoning and no 
challenge to the validity of the same shall have been made (or in the event of any 
challenge, such challenge shall have been finally resolved in favor of such validity) and 
shall remain in force for 50 years from the date of enactment adoption of the Grand 
Junction Zoning. 

B. 

Additional Conditions to Alexandria’s Commitments 

For purposes of clarification, Alexandria’s commitments set forth above are offered if the 
following additional conditions are met: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The amendments to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance set forth in Attachment A are duly 
adopted in the form attached hereto as Attachment A, and no challenge to the validity of 
the same shall have been made (or in the event of any challenge, such challenge shall 
have been finally resolved in favor of such validity.) 

All time periods specified in this Letter of Commitment shall be tolled during the 
resolution of any appeal pertaining to the Grand Junction Zoning or the Project.  The time 
period specified in Section A(1) also shall be tolled during the satisfaction of the City 
Land Acceptance Condition and/or the Cleanup Condition. 

So long as Alexandria, its successors and assigns, is proceeding with development and 
until the Project is completed, the City shall not have initiated or supported any rezoning 
or other ordinance changes that would have the effect of adversely affecting any of the 
uses or development authorized by the Grand Junction Zoning. 

C. 

Conclusion 

Alexandria is making these payments and providing the other mitigation referenced above in 
order to provide resources to mitigate any impacts which might result from the Project as a result 
of the rezoning and any Special Permits granted therefore. 

As Alexandria’s duly authorized representative, I am pleased to commit to this significant 
mitigation on Alexandria’s behalf. 

Sincerely, 

ARE-MA Region No. 61, LLC

Alexandria’s Commitments 

2. 

3. 

The Grand Junction Land shall be conveyed to the City per Section 20.1005 of the Grand 
Junction Zoning no later than ninety (90) days after the Special Permits and approvals 
required under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance are granted allowing Alexandria to 
build the Project, and appeal periods for such Special Permits and approvals shall have 
expired without any appeal having been made, or in the event that any appeal does occur, 
the outcome of said appeal shall not result in a change in the validity, or reduction in the 
development rights set forth in the Special Permits and approvals (“Special Permit 
Condition”), subject to the City completing its land acceptance process (“City Land 
Acceptance Condition”), and Alexandria completing any work required such that the 
environmental condition of the Grand Junction Land poses No Significant Risk, as 
defined in 310 CMR 40.0006, to future users of the land given its intended use as a public 
pathway, per Section 20.1006 of the Grand Junction Zoning (“Cleanup Condition”).  For 
the avoidance of doubt, the Special Permit Condition shall not include a building permit. 

Alexandria will contribute up to $11,250,000 to the City to enable the City to design and 
construct improvements for the Grand Junction bike path on the Grand Junction Land, 
such contribution to be made on the following schedule:  (a) $1,000,000 no later than 
ninety (90) days after the Special Permit Condition is satisfied; and (b) $10,250,000 no 
later than ninety (90) days after the issuance of a Permanent Certificate of Occupancy for 
the Project and no challenge to the validity of the same shall have been made (or in the 
event of any challenge, such challenge shall have been finally resolved in favor of such 
validity).  The use of such funds will be restricted to the purpose for which they are 
contributed. 

NStar Electric Company d/b/a Eversource Energy (“Eversource”) is the owner of Tax Lot 
32-52 (“Eversource Land”), which abuts the Development Land.  For a period of three 
years after the adoption of the Grand Junction Zoning and no challenge to the validity of 
the same having been made (or in the event of any challenge, such challenge having been 
finally resolved in favor of such validity), Alexandria shall use commercially reasonable 
efforts to purchase the Eversource Land (for the conveyance to the City for public use), 
subject to and conditioned on the following:  (i) Eversource is willing to sell the 
Eversource Land to Alexandria; (ii) the results of Alexandria’s due diligence 
investigations (including without limitation title, survey and the environmental status of 
the Eversource Land) are satisfactory to Alexandria in Alexandria’s sole discretion; and 
(iii) Alexandria’s total cost to purchase the Eversource Land shall not exceed 
$12,929,000.  (For the purposes of this Paragraph 3, Alexandria may include an affiliate 
nominee of Alexandria.)  If, despite its exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, 
Alexandria has not acquired the Eversource Land within such three year period, then 
Alexandria will contribute $12,292,000 to a designee identified by the City and this 
Paragraph 3 shall be of no further force or effect.

resolution of any appeal pertaining to the Grand Junction Zoning or the Project.  The time 
period specified in Section A(1) also shall be tolled during the satisfaction of the City 
Land Acceptance Condition and/or the Cleanup Condition. 

So long as Alexandria, its successors and assigns, is proceeding with development and 
until the Project is completed, the City shall not have initiated or supported any rezoning 
or other ordinance changes that would have the effect of adversely affecting any of the 
uses or development authorized by the Grand Junction Zoning. 

C. 

Conclusion 

Alexandria is making these payments and providing the other mitigation referenced above in 
order to provide resources to mitigate any impacts which might result from the Project as a result 
of the rezoning and any Special Permits granted therefore. 

As Alexandria’s duly authorized representative, I am pleased to commit to this significant 
mitigation on Alexandria’s behalf. 

Sincerely, 

ARE-MA Region No. 61, LLC

ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

At the Economic Development and University Relations Committee Hearing that was 
held on April 30, 2019, the Committee discussed strategies to address vacant 
storefronts; and 
 
The City Council later adopted a Policy Order on June 24, 2019 asking the City 
Manager to work with the Community Development Department, the Assessor’s 
Office, and the City Solicitor’s Office to develop a Vacant Storefront Registration 
Policy; and 
 
The City has a vested interest in mitigating the effects of long-term storefront 
vacancies by creating a Vacant Storefront Registration Policy, as vacant storefronts are 
harmful to the vitality of our local Squares and business districts, and can hurt other 
small retailers and restaurants, while negatively impacting customer experience; and 
 
According to the Retail Strategy of the City of Cambridge, published in August 2017, 
the retail vacancy rate is expected to increase in the coming years, so it is crucial that 
the City Council begins to address this issue before the situation becomes dire for our 
local business community; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with the Economic 
Development Division of the Community Development Department to prepare a report 
on any steps it has taken to work towards developing a Vacant Storefront Registration 
Policy; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back during the Economic 
Development and University Relations Committee on the matters above by its’ next 
hearing to be scheduled this spring.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City Council recognizes that Cambridge is a city of great diversity with a rich 
cultural heritage; and 
 
The City Council recognizes the history of racism in our country which has led to 
ongoing disparities in education, job attainment, housing, public health, and many 
quality of life indicators for people of color; and 
 
The City Council recognizes that racial inequities have long been ingrained and 
institutionalized in the policies and practices of many agencies, governmental and 
otherwise; and 
 
The City Council recognizes that census and neighborhood profile data from the city 
shows that the black population of the Port has declined by 7.4% since 2013; and 
 
The City Council recognizes that racial disparities persist in the educational outcomes 
of children attending Cambridge Public Schools, as measured by MCAS results, 
including a 2019 grade 3 literacy rate of 44% for black students and 80% for white 
students; and 
 
The City Council recognizes that the most recent data available from the Cambridge 
Health Alliance shows significant racial disparities in health outcomes for black men in 
the city, specifically a higher overall death rate, a higher death rate due to cancer, a 
higher hospitalization rate due to diabetes, and a higher HIV infection rate; and 
 
The City Council recognizes that there is only one black-owned liquor license in the 
entire city, and that black and brown-owned businesses are an unacceptably low 
percentage of total businesses in the city, representing at most 33 out of 136, or less 
than 25% of the businesses in the self-reported diversity directory; and 
 
The City Council recognizes that issues of racial equity must be addressed proactively 
and deliberately in the course of decision-making, and past City Councils have actually 
discussed the need for the City to proactively view all decision-making through the 
lens of asking how each decision might impact the City’s minority communities; and 
 
The City Council recognizes the need to unpack seemingly neutral policies and 
practices to determine whether they are contributing to racial inequity or improving 
racial equity; and

ORDERED: 

 
The City Council is interested in exploring and instituting methods that have worked in 
cities around the country to update, eliminate, or create government policies, practices, 
and programs specifically to dismantle existing racial disparities; and 
 
The City Council acknowledges that it might not always be clear what the potential 
impacts of their decisions will be on racial equity, but is committed to applying a racial 
equity lens in a systematic way in its decision-making processes with the goal of 
continuing to build a more inclusive, equitable, vibrant, and healthy community for all 
Cambridge residents; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record committing itself to systematically and deliberately 
applying a racial equity lens in its decision-making henceforth; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct staff to begin including a 
“Racial Equity Impact Statement” on all relevant agenda items including, but not 
limited to, appointments, appropriations, ordinances, legal opinions, policies, 
procedures and regulations, beginning on March 9, 2020.

The creation and preservation of affordable housing continues to be a top priority of

The City Council has increased funding for the Affordable Housing Trust in recent 
years to provide the Trust needed resources to carry out its mission of creating and

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR 

Sumbul Siddiqui 
Mayor 

 
To: 

 

Cambridge City Council 

From:   

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor 

Date: 

 

February 27, 2020 

 

Council: 

Subject: 

Preserving affordability at Fresh Pond Apartments to the Honorable, the City  

It is exciting to be moving forward with the vital preservation work to retain the affordability of Fresh 
Pond Apartments, located at 362-364 Rindge Avenue through the appropriation of $15,000,000 from 
Free Cash to the Affordable Housing Trust. The 504 apartments, known to those living there (and those 
who grew up there such as myself) as “Rindge Towers”, are home to individuals and families who 
represent an important part of the community and culture of North Cambridge and the city at large.  

This preservation effort brings great relief to hundreds of families with whom I have been in constant 
contact through community meetings and office hours, as they waited to hear if they would be faced 
with the impossible task of leaving their homes, and ultimately, their schools, healthcare resources,  
places of worship, and workplaces. 

I am pleased with the progress the City has made on preserving the affordability of Fresh Pond 
Apartments and I will continue my commitment to keeping our residents informed as we enter the final 
phases of the process. Attached is a one-page summary prepared by my office last term that will be 
updated to reflect this exciting news. 

I look forward to working with everyone as we embark on the final phase of preserving the affordability 
at Fresh Pond Apartments. 

Sincerely, 

Mayor Siddiqui

EXPLAINING EXPIRING USE:
Expiring Use properties in Massachusetts are properties that were developed by private owners with HUD-subsidized 
resources in the 1960’s through the 1980’s. In exchange for interest subsidies, rent subsidies, or both, these private owners 
agreed to affordability restrictions on the properties which kept rents affordable, lasting between 20 and 40 years. 
Expiring Use properties can be converted to market rents when the subsidy contract expires.

 

Fresh Pond Apartments are currently subject to an expiring use restriction that has kept the rent affordable in these 
privately owned buildings. This restriction is set to expire on December 31, 2020.

TWO KINDS OF SUBSIDIES:
Fresh Pond Apartments currently has 2 kinds of subsidized units: Project-Based Section 8 (PBS8) units and Below 
Market Interest Rate (BMIR) units. 

5
PBS8 units have rents subsidized by HUD with tenants paying 30% of their household income (and the subsidy 
1
#
paying the difference up to the total rent amount). BMIR units have a pre-determined contract rent that is paid by the 
0
2
household (who are subject to certain income limits). In both models households are required to provide documentation 
0
2
and meet income and other eligibility requirements, however, BMIR unit households may be paying less or more than 
F
O
30% of their household income (depending on the rate their rent was set at).
C

 

 

WHAT IS HAPPENING TO PRESERVE AFFORDABILITY AT FRESH POND APARTMENTS?
The City monitors the status of housing subject to expiring use restrictions, and works with tenants, owners, non-profit 
2
_
housing partners, advocates, the Cambridge Housing Authority, and other public lenders to create preservation plans to 
t
e
ensure continued affordability of expiring use properties in Cambridge. The City is currently working with the owner 
e
h
S
of Fresh Pond Apartments to preserve affordability in all 504 units. We are exploring preservation options and intend 
o
f
to have a plan in place before the current agreement expires. Through preservation, tenants will be able to stay in their 
n
homes and extend affordability protections for another 50 years.

WILL RENTS CHANGE AFTER PRESERVATION?
Households in PBS8 units will not see a change in their rent as a result of preservation. PBS8 tenants will continue to 
pay rents calculated at 30% of household income. Households in BMIR units may see a change in the amount of rent 
they pay, depending on the subsidy model after preservation. Some households will be subject to the voucher model 
of rent determination (30% of income), and some will pay a newly-determined “flat” rent ( a set rent, not based on a 
percentage of househoold income). As a result, BMIR tenants might experience an increase OR decrease in rent after 
preservation.
