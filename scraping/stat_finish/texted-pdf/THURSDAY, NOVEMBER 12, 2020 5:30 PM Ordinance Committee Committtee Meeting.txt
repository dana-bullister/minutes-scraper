Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, explained that the Planning Board 
held a hearing in September on the last version of the petition.  She stated that BioMed made changes 
based on the planning board's discussion at that time.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, explained that the proposal really affects two sites, 
this constellation site and then the what's been called the Gas Transfer site, parcel C. In 1999 or 2000, the 
development plan for this site is for a large complex of buildings.  
 
Councillor Carlone opened the floor to public comment. 
 
Christopher  Hope, 872 Massachusetts Ave., unit 1-5,  Director of the loop lab. He stated that the 
petitioner has offered a free space for the organization in Kendall Square to reenergize the area as a 
destination location for the arts. He stated that some residents coming from Afro-Latino communities, the 
Latino communities, but also Afro-Caribbean communities feel that there is a major disconnect between 
them and the opportunities that are available. There is potential for the intersection of the arts and the 
local community to finally be connected. He supports the petition. 
 
Maure Aronson, 720 Massachusetts Avenue, Executive Director of Global Arts Live.  He stated that the 
petitioners have the support of Global Arts Live. This project is visionary in its architectural approach, it 
is also visionary in its approach to make a Culture Center to the identity of Kendall Square. The year-
round indoor space that biomed has proposed is unlike anything else in Cambridge or the region.  
 
Nagesh Mahanthappa, 7 Old Dee Rd., Cambridge, MA.  He supports this project. He is chair of the Board 
of global Arts Live. The project will not only bring a world class theater space, but community space.  . 
 
Dan Marshall, 500 Kendall Street, Executive Artistic Director, Brookline/Cambridge Community Center 
for the Arts, Inc. Spoke in support of the proposal. This is a visionary and amazing mixed-use design.   
 
Brian Amador, 199 Pemberton Street, spoke in support of the project. The city is in dire need of 
performance spaces that are medium sized and small, and this project would provide both of those smaller 
informal spaces on the ground floor and a medium sized, beautiful theatre on the third floor.  
 
Ken Field, 108 Pleasant Street, spoke in support of the project. At this time, performing performers and 
audiences are experiencing an ongoing loss of Performing Arts venues due in large part to the economic 
realities of the pandemic. But the dearth of medium sized public performing venues in the city was a 
problem before the pandemic hit. In addition to the closing of music venues, the city has lost dance 
studios, visual art studio space and other performance venues. He strongly encouraged the developers and 
the committee to think carefully about the details of the operating model for the arts and cultural 
component of the proposal to ensure its longevity.  
 
Brian Lim, Cambridge Community Center for the Arts, 500 Kendall Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, Co-
founder and Operations Director of the nonprofit organization called The Flavor Continues. BioMed has 
been a good partner or providing dancing space.  He fully supports the project. 
 
Carl Nagy-Koechlin, Executive Director at Just-A-Start, 1035 Cambridge Street. He spoke in favor of the 
project. Kendall Square is really at the center of that quest to get low- and moderate-income people, in 
Cambridge, plugged into the economy and moving forward with living wage jobs that have a future. He is 
impressed with BioMed Realty’s commitment to making that connection and helping to link people that 
Just-A-Start trains to jobs in that building with their eventual tenants.
