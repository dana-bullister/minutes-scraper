Ref.:  Awaiting Report #19-143, dated October 21, 2019  
 

Re:  Pilot Program w/CHA – Security Officers to work collaboratively with and 
exclusively within CHA premises in and near Central Square and The Port.  

 

 
The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report #19-143, dated October 21, 2019, whereby 
the City Manager was requested to report on the feasibility of piloting a program of assigning additional 
security officers to work collaboratively with and exclusively within the Cambridge Housing Authority 
(CHA) premises in and near Central Square and The Port. 
 
In effort to ensure the highest quality police service to the residents of public housing in Cambridge,  
the Cambridge Police Department hosts a regular meeting with Cambridge Housing Authority area 
managers and property managers. This is a long-standing meeting that is held approximately once a 
month at the Cambridge Police Department (CPD).  
 
The CPD/CHA Property Managers Meeting is coordinated by the head of security at CHA, David 
Degou and Lieutenant Fred Cabral from the CPD Family & Social Justice Section (FSJS). The meeting 
is regularly attended by multiple property managers from the CHA, and supervisors and members of the 
FSJS, the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), and the Criminal Investigations Section (CIS). The purpose 
of this meeting is to keep communications open between property managers and members of the CPD.  
Some of the issues involve criminal behavior at some properties, but the meeting also serves as a 
platform to connect residents to appropriate services. 
 
Last summer, the Command Staff met with Dave Degou and Newtowne Court and Washington Elms 
tenants to discuss safety and security issues as part of the department’s focus on building stronger 
community relationships. In September, the Command Staff attended a follow-up meeting to continue  
to address these concerns and to discuss security issues at the Manning Apartments. 
 
At the September meeting, the police department recommended that CHA hire a private security 
company to perform unarmed security services at CHA properties only. These functions would include 
patrolling, access security, and monitoring electronic alarm and surveillance equipment, to deter and 
discourage attempts at crime and to detect and stop crimes from occurring.

Most recently, at the December meeting, Dave Degou informed CPD that CHA had retained the 
services of MDS Security of Waltham to monitor the Manning Apartments located at 237 Franklin 
Street. One unarmed security guard will be staffed nightly for an overnight shift, providing coverage 
between 9:00PM until 5:00AM.   
 
Dave Degou indicated that CHA is planning to implement private security at other properties too, once 
CHA is able to secure additional funding. 
 
CPD is committed to supporting this cooperative private-public effort by providing an added presence 
to include, but not limited to the following: 
 

  Directing officers assigned to The Port neighborhood to maintain a greater presence in the 
Washington Elms/Newtowne Court apartment complex, and the streets surrounding those 
communities. (These walking officers will remain in these assignments through the winter 
months). 
 
Increasing patrols in sector and route cars.  

 

  Directing bike patrol to focus their patrol activities during the day shifts and first half evening 

 

shifts. (Excluding winter months). 
 

  Directing detectives working in the Criminal Investigations and Special Investigations to focus 
plain clothes patrols in unmarked police vehicles during first half evening shifts and early 
morning hours to support this effort. 
 

  The Crime Analysis Unit will monitor the number of assignments and conduct regular  

analysis for patterns of crime, predictive policing as well as seasonal trends, and based on  
the information reviewed at our bi-weekly crime trends meeting, the department will deploy 
additional assignments as needed. 

 
I can assure you that the police department is working on a variety of fronts to identify and resolve 
issues that affect specific housing developments, neighborhoods, business districts, and the City as a 
whole. 
 
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions, information needed 
or concerns regarding this matter, please let me know. 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or additional concerns. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr. 
Police Commissioner

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $500,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account for continued design of improvements 
to the DPW complex.    
 
As part of FY20 funding for the Municipal Facility Improvement Plan, a Feasibility Study is 
currently underway to develop a design that will address significant building and site space, 
safety, and deferred maintenance issues.  
 
A key focus area of this effort will be the Ryan Building which houses a maintenance garage, 
plant storage, labor force bathroom facilities, and offices associated with the Solid Waste 
Division. The project will also look to maximize renewable energy opportunities with the 
utilization of high efficiency HVAC equipment.  
 
The diversity and complexity of operations, some requiring public access, in conjunction with 
existing site conditions, will require the development of a temporary facility in order to maintain 
operations during the completion of this project.  
 
It is anticipated that an appropriation for the estimated construction costs for this project will be 
contained in the FY21 Capital Budget.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-128, regarding ways the City is combating the city-wide 
rodent issues, please be advised of the following: 
 
Due to an increase in notifications from residents that they’ve seen rodent activity, the City has 
committed to confronting this problem in a variety of ways - by addressing rodent issues on 
public property, working to control rodents during construction projects, enforcing sanitary 
codes and ordinances, and educating the public.  
 
The City Manager’s Office, Public Health, Inspectional Services (ISD), and Public Works 
(DPW) Departments now hold monthly internal Rodent Taskforce meetings with additional 
stakeholders from Cambridge Public Schools and Cambridge Housing Authority to discuss better 
coordination efforts to address rodents and will continue to enforce ordinances related to 
dumpsters, curbside trash, and private property cleanliness issues. The taskforce has plans to 
invite additional representatives from large property management companies, businesses 
associations, and others to future meetings. 
 
When we were first alerted of the increase in rodent activity, the City Manager’s Office, Public 
Health, Inspectional Services, and Public Works departments identified hotspots of reporting 
activity and held well-attended community meetings in both East Cambridge and Cambridgeport 
to hear from residents and share information in December 2019. 
 
From those meetings, a new Rodent website was created at www.cambridgema.gov/rodents 
<http://www.cambridgema.gov/rodents> and physical information was developed and updated in 
January 2020 to provide residents with information on how to prevent and spot rodent activity 
around their property.  In February 2020, this information was mailed to all property owners in 
Cambridge.

Working with the Geographic Information System (GIS) Department, a new mapping and 
reporting tool was developed to help the Inspectional Services staff as they review properties 
throughout the city. This tool was deployed in February 2020 and inspectors have begun going 
street-by-street to inspect properties and record on iPads whether rodent activity is found on 
private or public property, the type of activity observed, what interactions staff have with 
residents about issues seen, if staff are leaving door hangers or other information behind when a 
resident can’t be reached, whether there are problems with curbside setouts, if issues are present 
with public trash/recycling receptacles, etc. This has resulted in fruitful face-to-face discussions 
with residents about things they can to do properly maintain their property to guard against 
rodent activity. 
 
In the coming weeks and months, ISD plans to continue these street-by-street investigations to 
gather data about properties being affected by rodent activity across the city.  Once gathered, this 
data will be used by Inspectional Services and Public Works to work with property owners who 
have issues to try to get them in compliance. This will be done through things like cleanups on 
the property, extra pickups of debris, etc. and may result in the City’s contractor providing 
baiting on the property, or adjacent properties that are being adversely affected, if deemed 
necessary once other requirements are met. 
 
ISD will also be contacting all building, food, and dumpster permit holders in the coming weeks 
with information about their code requirements related to cleanliness and maintenance of their 
dumpsters and/or sites. These direct communications also include best practices to prevent 
rodent activity. 
 
ISD will receive an additional $50,000 in their FY21 budget for rodent outreach, enforcement, 
and baiting as well as a new Housing/Sanitary position that will be partially focused on rodents. 
 
The City is taking an aggressive approach to collect the data necessary to determine what our 
next steps are in working with residents and property owners to tackle rodent control issues 
together.

Re:  Awaiting Report 20-2, dated January 27, 2020 regarding the department’s maintenance 
plan for public area bins on Cambridge Street with an emphasis on cleaning open-trash 
receptacles more frequently. 
 

 

 

 

 
 

In response to the above referenced awaiting report  please be advised that Public Works 
services approximately 85 open top public area bins on Cambridge street from Inman Square to 
First street. Over this 20-block area most of these bins are for trash only with limited recycling 
receptacles every few blocks.  The trash receptacles are emptied by Public Works employees 
twice a day seven days a week.  Recycling bins are serviced by a contractor and are emptied two 
to three times per week. With regard to cleaning, each bin is power washed at a minimum of 
twice per year or on an as needed/requested basis.   
 
The majority of the bins have been in place since the last time Cambridge Street was 
reconstructed. Public Works have made repairs or replaced some over the years but have had 
issues with many leading us to explore more universal replacement of all the bins.  We have 
recently met with The Big Belly corporation to evaluate this stretch of Cambridge street and 
determine what it would take to replace the current open top bins with new solar powered 
compacting bins. These compacting bins can hold up to five times the trash that typical open top 
bins hold and are fully contained which helps to keep in litter and deter rodents.  Additionally, 
we would look to add a recycling container at each trash location to further promote citywide 
recycling.  We have estimated that with 40 locations along Cambridge street we can provide the 
same level of service for trash and and expanded options for recycling and will provide for a 
more efficient emptying operation. 
 
As part of the ongoing deployment of Big Belly infrastructure in the city, DPW is presently 
putting together a plan to further this deployment in 2020 and 2021 on Cambridge Street and in 
other locations throughout the City. The department is working with the managers office to 
incorporate this appropriation within the FY21 budget with the hope of beginning full 
replacement this fall.

February 24, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-14, requesting an update on the Lechmere 
Station closure, the replacement bus service, and the community outreach that is planned, 
Director of Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Joseph Barr, Assistant City Manager for 
Community Development Iram Farooq, and Commissioner of Public Works Owen O’Riordan 
report the following. 
 
Background 
 
The City has been involved in the planning, design, and implementation of the Green Line 
Extension (GLX) for many years, including the current version of the project that is under 
construction and is expected to be complete by the end of 2021. General information about the 
GLX project is available through the project website: <https://www.mass.gov/green-line-
extension-project-glx>. 
 
Currently, the City is involved in a number of coordination efforts with the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the GLX project team, including monthly Community 
Working Group meetings, ongoing design reviews and construction permitting, and informal 
staff discussions. In addition, the City has agreed to make a $25 million contribution to the state, 
divided into $5 million annual payments, to help pay for the costs of the project, which is then 
allocated to construction in Cambridge. To date, the City has paid the first two installments, 
totaling $10 million, and the state has begun to use these funds for the construction of the 
structures for the new Lechmere Station. 
 
Lechmere Station Shutdown 
 
Construction of the GLX is well underway in Cambridge in the area near Lechmere Station and 
Cambridge Crossing. As part of the project, the new Lechmere Station is being constructed on 
the north side of Monsignor O’Brien Highway, which will then allow for service to be extended 

1.11

 

 

Packet Pg. 40

1.11

north and west to Somerville and Medford. At the same time, the GLX project will replace the 
existing steel viaduct that carries Green Line trains to today’s Lechmere Station. Cumulatively, 
this construction requires that the Green Line temporarily end train service at North Station. The 
Science Park/West End Station will be closed during this time, and the new Lechmere Station 
will be constructed. This temporary closure is for an 11-month period beginning in May 2020. 
During the closure, the following construction activities will occur: 
 

•  Removal of the existing viaduct crossing Monsignor O’Brien Highway into the current 
Lechmere Station, requiring a full closure of the road.  MassDOT and the GLX project 
team are currently discussing a series of weekend closures to complete this work, 
including five weekend closures for demolition (Friday evening to Monday morning, 24 
hours per day).   

•  Replacement of the steel viaduct that carries the Green Line between the Gilmore Bridge 
and Lechmere Station. Similarly, several full weekend closures of Monsignor O’Brien 
Highway (also Friday evening to Monday morning, 24 hours per day) are being planned 
in July/August for pier cap construction and in August/September for structural steel 
placement.  

•  Construction of the new Lechmere Station. 
•  Rehabilitation work on the concrete viaduct that carries the Green Line in front of the 

Museum of Science (note that this is a separate project being completed simultaneously 
by the MBTA Capital Delivery group). 

•  Testing of the new tracks, signals, and other systems that support the operation of Green 

Line service. 

•  The demolition of the existing Lechmere Station is not included in the GLX Project 

contract. When the new Lechmere Station is open to the public, the old station and the 
property it sits on will be transferred from the MBTA to DivcoWest. At that point, 
DivcoWest will demolish the old station and yard and build the remaining roadway 
improvements on North First Street and O’Brien Highway. 

 
The opening of the new Lechmere Station, expected by May 2021, will also mark the opening of 
the first of two branches of the Green Line Extension. This first branch will include service to 
Union Square Station in Somerville. 
 
Replacement Bus Service 
 
During this one-year shutdown, the MBTA will operate a “bus bridge” service replacing the 
Green Line between Lechmere Station and North Station. This bus bridge will begin at the 
existing Lechmere Station Cambridge Street bus loop, travel via a short section of Cambridge 
Street, O’Brien Highway and Charles River Dam Road towards Boston with a stop along the 
way near the Museum of Science, then let passengers off near the rear entrance to North Station 
on Nashua Street. There are several points worth highlighting about this replacement bus service: 
 

•  Because O’Brien Highway and Charles River Dam Road both experience significant 

traffic congestion during the rush hours, and intermittently at other times, the MBTA is 
proposing to install bus lanes on these roads for the duration of the bus bridge to provide 
these buses with priority travel across the bridge. The MBTA and the Massachusetts 

Packet Pg. 41

1.11

Department of Transportation are currently completing an analysis of the traffic impacts 
of these bus lanes, including the potential benefits for bus passengers and the negative 
impacts that would be associated with not providing buses with priority travel across the 
bridge. The City will be closely following the results of this analysis to understand the 
most beneficial approach that will most efficiently move people traveling in this corridor. 

•  The buses that currently travel to Lechmere Station from Cambridge and Somerville 

(routes 69, 80, 87, and 88) will continue to terminate at Lechmere Station and will not 
run through to North Station. Passengers connecting to the Green Line will need to 
transfer to the replacement bus service to travel to North Station. While a number of 
groups have suggested that these bus routes should continue to a North Station terminal 
during the Green Line closure, the MBTA has ultimately decided that this option is not 
feasible. 

•  The separated bicycle lanes that were recently installed on Charles River Dam Road will 
remain in place, which will allow travelers to use cycling, including the use of Bluebikes, 
as an alternative transit option. 

•  The location of the North Station stop of the replacement bus service includes a 1,500-
foot walk to connect with the Green Line and Orange Line platforms. This walk should 
take 5 to 7 minutes at average walking speed. The MBTA and GLX team plan to direct 
connecting passengers to walk through covered and underground walkways and interior 
passageways of the commuter rail station. These walkways and passageways are 
currently accessible to people with disabilities. 

•  During the second half of the Green Line shutdown, the GLX team will conduct 

operational and safety tests of the new viaduct and associated systems. These tests may 
take up to six months. As a result, constituents will begin to see Green Line trains on the 
viaduct and extension even though the opening of the new Lechmere Station and the 
Union Square Branch will not take place for several months. 

 
Community Outreach 
 
To share information with the Cambridge community prior to this shutdown occurring, the GLX 
project team is holding a project-wide public meeting at the Multicultural Arts Center (41 
Second Street) in East Cambridge, on Tuesday, March 10, 2020 from 6:00pm-7:30pm. In 
addition, in the near future they will be implementing a public communications strategy to alert 
the traveling public to this year long closure and allow public transportation users to consider 
if/how they may need to adjust their time, location, and mode of travel.

The proposed amendments to Article 22 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to 
increase green building requirements for newly constructed buildings over 25,000 
square feet and to remove barriers to retrofitting existing buildings with exterior 
insulation were passed by the City Council on December 9, 2019, and take effect on 
March 9, 2020. 
 

Action 5.2: Develop Ongoing Capacity to Manage Getting to Net Zero Project 

The first comprehensive program-wide review of the Net Zero Action Plan 
commenced in December, 2019 with the Cambridge Climate Protection Action 
Committee. An updated Net Zero Task Force will be appointed soon. The Task Force 
will meet monthly through summer 2020 to inform the review of and recommend 
updates to the Net Zero Action Plan for consideration by City Council.

City of Cambridge 

 

 

CLIMATE PROTECTION ACTION COMMITTEE 

 

 
November 14, 2019 
 
Dear Mr. DePasquale, 
 
The City of Cambridge’s Climate Protection Action Committee (CPAC) is tasked with overseeing 
the City’s Net Zero Action Plan (Plan) and assessing its progress on an annual basis. This letter 
serves as the fourth annual progress assessment (Assessment), which includes comments and 
recommendations regarding both the content of the Plan, as well as the implementation of the 
Plan by the Community Development Department (CDD) and other City officials. The 
Assessment is based upon the annual City of Cambridge Getting to Net Zero Action Plan – Fiscal 
Year 2019 Progress Report (Progress Report) drafted by CDD (attached), as well as the 
deliberations of CPAC. 
 
Since the Net Zero Action Plan was finalized and adopted by the City in 2015, the science 
surrounding climate change, the impacts of climate change and social awareness of climate 
change have all advanced and become more compelling. Meanwhile, the implementation of 
some of the key actions within the Net Zero Action Plan have fallen behind schedule. As noted 
in more detail below, CPAC recommends increased resources, legislative action and sense of 
urgency to facilitate the achievement of the Plan’s carbon neutrality goals. 
 
The following are specific comments and recommendations aimed at getting the Plan “back-on-
track” and in a position to meet Plan milestones: 
 

1.  Legislative Actions – CPAC strongly supports all six of the legislative recommendations 
outlined in the Progress Report, but particularly the two described below. As stated in 
the Progress Report: As the Plan moves from an emphasis on feasibility and design to 
the implementation of recommendations, there is an increased need for legislative 
action by the Cambridge City Council and related stakeholders…Legislative actions may 
include amendments to existing Zoning or City Ordinances or the creation of new 
regulations. Two policy adoptions that are core to the Plan and require action according 
to the following schedule are: 
 

a.  Fall 2019: Amend Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance to Increase Green Building 
Requirements [from LEED Silver to Gold] (Plan Action 2.3), and Remove Barriers 
to Increased Insulation (Plan Action 2.5).  
These proposed Ordinance changes have undergone thorough stakeholder 
vetting and after significant delay are poised to be adopted by the City Council. 
In order to keep on pace with the Net Zero Action Plan schedule and have a

meaningful impact, the next round of green building requirements is due for 
adoption in FY21. CPAC recommends that the City Manager and staff maintain 
the commitment to this schedule of phased increases in green building 
stringency and promptly move forward with this next set of requirements. 
 

b.  Fall/Winter 2019: Submit Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) 
amendments to introduce performance requirements. (Plan Action 1.1.2)  
As noted in CPAC’s 2018 Assessment, BEUDO is moving from data 
gathering/measurement to managing/reducing emissions which requires energy 
performance requirements for existing buildings. The BEUDO performance 
requirements were due to be adopted in FY19 and are now behind schedule. 
CDD has proposed the performance requirement that all BEUDO buildings 
improve their GHG emissions by 20% every 5-years. CPAC supports this effort to 
advance performance requirements and strengthen the impact of BEUDO for 
existing buildings to reduce their GHG emissions, and encourages the City and 
BEUDO stakeholders to pursue a stringent approach to these requirements. 
Expeditious adoption of these amendments is needed to meet the City’s GHG 
reduction commitments.   
 

2.  Collaboration and Alignment of City Climate Initiatives 

a.  CDD should monitor the various climate resiliency and energy efficiency 

initiatives occurring in the City and integrate them, where appropriate, into the 
Net Zero Action Plan to strengthen support for Plan goals and policies and to 
avoid redundancy. Energy efficiency investments and retrofits are easier to 
monetize than resiliency investments, and energy efficiency and resilience 
investments can be mutually reinforcing. As such, CDD should provide incentives 
and technical support for both of these investments to be done simultaneously 
whenever possible. 
 
Such initiatives include: Envision Cambridge (in particular the recommendations 
of the Climate and Environment Working Group), the Climate Resilience Zoning 
Task Force (recommendations expected in early 2020), and the Urban Forest 
Master Plan. The findings and recommendations of these initiatives should be 
studied and integrated as part of the 5-year Comprehensive Review required 
under the Plan, which will occur in FY20. (The City’s participation in various 
regional Climate initiatives, such as the Zero Cities Initiative and Metro Mayors 
Coalition, should also be monitored and integrated into the Plan as relevant.) 
 

b.  CDD should also monitor and support ongoing Council ordinance proposals that 
align with the goals of the Plan and integrate them into the Plan as appropriate. 
One such recent ordinance proposal from Council aims to ban natural gas hook-
ups in new construction and force new buildings to be all-electric, in anticipation 
of increased grid supplied renewable energy.

3.  Budgeting  

The Plan released in 2015 was adopted with a 5-year budget that expires in FY20. CDD 
needs to propose, and the City Manager and Council approve, a reasonable Plan 
implementation budget to bridge the gap between the expiration of the original Plan 
budget and the development and approval of a new 5-year Plan budget as part of the 5-
year Comprehensive Review occurring in 2020. Examples of near-term funding needs 
include increased staff and tools to manage BEUDO data analysis and implementation of 
the proposed performance requirements, and funding for implementation of the 
recommendations of the Low Carbon Energy Supply Strategy. 
  

4.  As previously noted, the 2015 Plan required a Comprehensive Review in 2020, its 5-year 
anniversary. The Plan review committee should re-assess Plan policies and timing within 
the context of experience and rates of progress to date and updated scientific and 
technological knowledge. In order to achieve the City’s commitment to 100% carbon 
neutrality by 2050, it is likely that the policies under the Plan will need to become more 
aggressive, implemented sooner and require substantial additional funding. CDD should 
commence the 5-year Comprehensive Review as soon as possible and aim to have it 
completed prior to the FY22 budgeting cycle. 
 

CPAC commends the City for its efforts to date developing and implementing the Plan, which is 
necessarily multi-pronged and evolving. In order to attain the goals of the Plan, the City must 
implement Plan findings and recommendations in a timely manner. CPAC urges the City 
Manager and City Council to fully support the implementation of the Net Zero Action Plan, 
including the recommendations outlined above combined with those described in CDD’s Fiscal 
Year 2019 Progress Report. Time is of the essence. 
 
Respectfully,

INTRODUCTION 
Background 

The City of Cambridge shares increasing global concerns about the crisis of climate change and 
the many challenges it presents. This crisis threatens the ability of the planet to support secure, 
healthy, productive, and enriching lives for current and future generations. The City of 
Cambridge has long been steadfast in addressing climate change. In 2002, the City adopted the 
Climate Protection Action Plan, our first attempt at proposing emissions reduction targets and 
recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since then, the City has 
committed to a range of initiatives to support sustainable lifestyles and move the community 
toward greater resilience to climate change. In 2016, the City made a commitment through the 
Metro Mayors Coalition1 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In Cambridge, buildings are both 
the problem and the solution for addressing climate change: more than 80% of our greenhouse 
gas emissions result from building operations and, as a sign of our thriving economy, new 
building development steadily continues. If the city can get to net zero emissions in the building 
sector, we will have made major progress towards achieving the U.N.’s goal of carbon neutrality 
in our cities. 

In 2013, in response to community concern that continued construction activity would make the 
goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions harder, the City convened the Getting to Net Zero 
Task Force to foster a deep conversation among stakeholders to advance the goal of setting 
Cambridge on a trajectory to becoming a “net zero community,” with a focus on carbon 
emissions from building operations. For Cambridge, ‘net zero’ refers to a building or a 
community of buildings for which, on an annual basis, all greenhouse gas emissions 
resulting from building operations are offset by carbon-free energy production. Achieving 
the net zero objective relies on a combination of energy efficiency improvements, renewable 
energy production and, where necessary, purchase of carbon offsets or, potentially, credits (that 
meet specific criteria). After fifteen months of intensive discussions, outside expert analysis, and 
consultation across sectors including the general public, the Task Force delivered a 25-year 
framework for setting Cambridge on the trajectory to becoming a net zero community.2

Annual Report Purpose and Structure 

In accordance with the recommendations of the Net Zero Action Plan (see Action 5.2), the 
Cambridge Community Development Department (CDD) has committed to conduct ongoing 
monitoring and reporting of progress towards the Net Zero Action Plan goals. In collaboration 
with the Climate Protection Action Committee (CPAC) which has agreed to provide oversight of 
the Plan, CDD committed to providing an annual report to CPAC and the public to summarize 
progress towards each action slated for the previous fiscal year.3 This is the fourth such report. 

Net Zero Action Plan annual reports are intended to provide an overview of each action planned 
for that year, including the action items, progress made, and next steps to reach the annual goals. 
The annual report will also provide quantitative outputs as appropriate for each action, for 
example the number of green buildings permitted during the past year, as well as broader 
outcomes such as changes in community-wide GHG emissions. The first citywide 
comprehensive GHG Community Inventory was completed in early 2017 and serves as a 
baseline indicator for the Net Zero Action Plan. Because GHG emissions are measured at the 
community scale in Cambridge, however, attributing changes in GHG emissions to individual 
Net Zero actions will likely be challenging. Therefore, annual building performance measured 
through the Building Energy Use Disclosure ordinance and individual action outputs and their 
alignment with the assumptions of the Net Zero GHG Model4 will serve as an indicator of the 
direction and magnitude of potential GHG reductions that can be attributed to the Plan.  

 

 

Action status (on track, in 
progress, behind, or parked) 

This report is structured to parallel the Net Zero 
Action Plan, with actions falling into five 
categories. In addition to detailed information, a 
summary box such as the one to the right is 
provided for each action. The green, yellow, or 
red light indicates the overall status of the action 
and whether it is on track, making progress but 
delayed, or behind, respectively. The parking 
symbol was introduced in FY18 to represent 
actions that are “parked” because they are 
completed or not being pursued at this time. 
They will remain parked in future reports unless 
it is determined that they should be reinvestigated. Note that the progress status is based on what 
was accomplished towards the FY19 action items through fall 2019. The mountain symbol 
represents key challenges to successful implementation of the action including regulatory, 
institutional, and resource barriers. The footprints represent next steps for the action.

FISCAL YEAR 2019 ACTION PROGRESS UPDATES 
Fiscal Year 2019 is the fourth year of Net Zero Action Plan implementation. Initial pilot 
activities are beginning to be reviewed and policy designs are ready for implementation. FY19 
included actions in all five categories: Action 1 – Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings, 
Action 2 – Net Zero New Construction, Action 3 – Energy Supply, Action 4 – Local Carbon 
Fund, and Action 5 – Engagement and Capacity Building. 

Legislative Action 

As the Net Zero Action Plan moves from an emphasis on feasibility and design to the 
implementation of recommendations, there is an increased need for action by the 
Cambridge City Council and related stakeholders in order to advance implementation of the 
actions. Legislative actions may include amendments to existing Zoning or City Ordinances 
or the creation of new regulations. To identify the need for such measures, Legislative 
Action has been flagged within each individual action as appropriate. Below is a summary 
of these actions in approximate chronological order of potential adoption: 

• Fall 2019: Amend Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance to Increase Green Building 

Requirements (Action 2.3) and Remove Barriers to Increased Insulation (Action 2.5) 

• Fall/Winter 2019: Submit Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance amendments 

to introduce performance requirements for BEUDO buildings (Action 1.1.2) 
• Winter 2020: Adopt Net Zero Requirement for New Construction of Municipal 

Buildings (Action 2.4.1) 

• Winter 2020: Propose recommendations for a Height and FAR Bonus through 

zoning for buildings that achieve net zero emissions ahead of the required schedule   
(Action 2.2.2) 

• Winter 2020: Propose a Rooftop Solar Installation Requirement for new buildings       

•

(Action 3.2) 
2020: If feasible, propose policy recommendations for Upgrades at Time of 
Renovation or Sale (Action 1.1.3)

Action 1 – Energy Efficiency in Existing Buildings 

The intent of this action is to ensure that all buildings are operating optimally and, where 
necessary, are retrofitted to maximize efficiency. In FY19, there was continued pilot 
implementation of the Custom Retrofit Program for multi-family buildings and stakeholder 
engagement around voluntary retrofit program design for larger residential and commercial 
buildings (Action 1.1.1) to complement additional Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance 
requirements (Action 1.1.2). Further research was conducted to consider policy options for 
required Upgrades at Time of Renovation or Sale (Action 1.1.3). 

Action 1.1.1: Custom Retrofit Program 

Introduction 

 

 

 

 

Multi-Family Energy Pilot in 
implementation. Custom Retrofit 
Program for BEUDO buildings 
ready for implementation. 
 
Ongoing program tracking and 
evaluation. 

With the Multi-Family Energy Pilot custom 
retrofit program in place for its third year, FY19 
was determined to be an appropriate time to 
begin the design of an energy retrofit program 
for other building sectors in Cambridge, one year 
ahead of the original Net Zero Action Plan 
schedule. With a focus on those buildings subject 
to the Building Energy Use Disclosure 
Ordinance (BEUDO), the expanded custom 
retrofit program is intended to provide buildings with a voluntary, cost-effective pathway to help 
achieve the energy savings and GHG emission reductions that will be required by upcoming 
BEUDO amendments (see Action 1.1.2).  Lessons from the Multi-Family Pilot design and 
implementation were used as a starting point for an expanded program design, including (1) 
build trust between building occupants/owners and the utilities/energy efficiency providers by 
adopting a performance-based approach to building upgrades and payments; (2) ease 
administration of the assessment and retrofit process by assigning each building owner a single 
owner’s agent to manage all aspects of the process; (3) connect building owners to accessible 
financing options, including existing state and utility incentives; (4) integrate renewable energy 
solutions such as solar PV into the energy efficiency retrofit process to streamline the renovation 
process; and (5) conduct a targeted marketing process to efficiently identify and enroll 
prospective building owners. 

Pilot program evaluation and 
Custom Retrofit Program launch 

 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Review the results of the Multi-Family Energy Pilot. Design an expanded custom retrofit 
program for other building types, including those subject to the Building Energy Use Disclosure 
Ordinance requirements.  

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

The Cambridge Multi-Family Energy Pilot continued to be offered in FY19 in coordination with 
Eversource and their multi-family contractor, CLEAResult. The pilot program is meant to 
provide multi-familiy buildings with 5-49 units comprehensive energy assessment and retrofit

services with a single point of contact. Building owners and tenants can enroll in the program 
directly with Eversource/CLEAResult or through the Cambridge Energy Alliance. 5 Cambridge 
has retained the services of a green building nonprofit, New Ecology Inc, to serve as a Retrofit 
Advisor and provide additional support to buildings that are seeking to implement energy-saving 
measures. In addition, the City has hired Zapotec Energy as the program’s Solar Advisor to help 
provide solar assessments and guidance to buildings interested in installing solar.  

Starting in the summer of 2019, Cambridge streamlined the Pilot to provide a more 
comprehensive, easy-to-access program for multifamily owners and tenants. The Retrofit 
Advisor works with multifamily buildings from the beginning, helping them determine which 
type of energy assessment and which services will best meet their needs. Once building owners 
have a better understanding of the retrofit opportunities, the Retrofit Advisor helps them identify 
qualified vendors, compare bids, review project financials, and connect with financing 
opportunities. Marketing initiatives for the Pilot include online media, street signs, BlueBikes 
station posters, flyers, and postcards, as well as canvassing through the Cambridge summer high 
school internship program. As of September 2019, approximately 50 properties, 
encompassing 1450 units, have enrolled in the program. Nearly all enrolled buildings have 
taken advantage of the opportunity to get a solar assessment through the pilot, collectively 
identifying a total of 1.2 MW of solar potential. Projects that the Retrofit Advisor has helped 
owners pursue include insulation, air sealing, high-efficiency heating and cooling, and 
investigating conversion to heat pump systems. The uptake of more in-depth measures and solar 
installation has proven challenging, as the upfront costs, decision-making processes in 
condominium associations, and limited bandwidth for self-managed buildings can present 
significant challenges. 

Beginning in November 2018, the City, supported by Cadmus consultants, facilitated a series of 
four stakeholder workshops and three focus groups to inform the design of an expanded custom 
retrofit program to serve buildings subject to the Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance. By 
examining the needs, barriers, and opportunities for achieving comprehensive energy savings in 
large buildings in Cambridge, the stakeholder process led to a detailed proposal for a custom 
retrofit program for BEUDO buildings implemented collaboratively by CDD, Eversource, and 
the building stakeholders.6 The centerpiece of the program is a “concierge” service provided by 
Eversource to connect buildings to customized MassSave resources to help achieve their energy 
efficiency goals, supported by an energy efficiency “hub” resource website. 

Next Steps 

The Multi-Family Pilot is continuing to be offered through FY20 with support from a state grant 
that will enable the City to make changes to the Pilot based on evaluation results; goals for the 
coming year include expanding participation through targeted outreach and working with 
interested buildings to implement comprehensive, multi-measure retrofits. Since the completion

of the BEUDO custom retrofit program design, CDD has continued to collaborate closely with 
Eversource to plan program rollout and implementation, and the program officially launched on 
October 25, 2019.7 The program plan includes ongoing tracking and oversight by a steering 
committee with representatives from the City, Eversource, and BEUDO stakeholders.   

Action 1.1.2: Additional BEUDO Requirements 

Introduction 

 

 

Amendment proposal is ready to 
move forward but behind original 
schedule 
 
Determining policy details and 
implementation logistics  

The Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure 
Ordinance (BEUDO), enacted in 2014, requires 
parcels with non-residential buildings totaling 
25,000 square feet or greater as well as parcels 
with residential buildings totaling 50 or more 
units to annually report and disclose their energy 
and water use.8 BEUDO did not initially include 
any required actions beyond the annual 
reporting because the Net Zero Action Plan was 
in development. This action aims to determine 
potential requirements to help BEUDO 
buildings reduce energy and water consumption. Actions initially contemplated by the Net Zero 
Action Plan include audits, retro-commissioning, and operations and energy management plans 
to be completed on a regular basis. 

Begin regulatory process 
Legislative action: Submit 
BEUDO amendments in 
fall/winter 2019 

 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Complete the design of additional BEUDO requirements and amend the ordinance to begin 
implementation. Engage BEUDO stakeholders in the requirement design, including 
consideration of schedule, compliance pathways, and exemptions for participating buildings. 

Progress Towards FY18 Action Items 

FY19 BEUDO requirement design built off of “phase 1” and “phase 2” studies completed in 
FY17 and FY18, respectively. Phase 1 included research into the structure of requirements in

and existing buildings, and begin development of a comprehensive retrofit program design and 
structure to enable all buildings subject to BEUDO reporting to achieve the requirements 
established for the ordinance as well as voluntary energy and GHG savings.10 This scope of work 
combines elements from Action 1.1.2 (Additional BEUDO Requirements), 1.1.1 (Custom 
Retrofit Program), and 1.1.4 (O&M Plan Requirement) of the Net Zero Action Plan. It makes 
sense to take a coordinated approach to these actions because they will affect an overlapping set 
of buildings, can share resources, and through parallel implementation can provide building 
owners with a full set of options to maximize their energy savings in as streamlined and cost-
effective a manner as possible.  

While FY19 stakeholder engagement focused on the voluntary comprehensive retrofit program 
design, concurrent with this process staff continued to research and refine the BEUDO 
requirement straw proposal developed with stakeholders in 2018 based on further stakeholder 
feedback. A concerted effort was made to develop compliance pathways specific to campuses 
and laboratories in collaboration with stakehoders from each of those sectors, the latter of which 
was led by the Compact for a Sustainable Future’s Net Zero Laboratory Working Group (See 
Action 5.3). Staff also observed the adoption of building emissions performance standards in 
New York City, Washington DC, and Washington state and considered lessons that could be 
applied in the Cambridge context. In May 2019, an updated performance requirement straw 
proposal based on a GHG savings framework was presented to stakeholders, and two additional 
BEUDO stakeholder meetings were held over the summer to gain feedback on the updated 
proposal and inform BEUDO amendment language to be presented to City Council in fall 2019. 

Next Steps 

Staff are working to complete draft amendments to the BEUDO language incorporating 
stakeholder and legal feedback to submit to City Council for consideration. The additional time 
to detail the amendment proposal has pushed the BEUDO amendments about one year beyond 
the original Net Zero Action Plan schedule. 

Legislative Action 

The proposed BEUDO amendment framework will be submitted to City Council for 
consideration in fall 2019. Depending on when the amendment is advanced, the 
performance compliance period could begin in 2021.

Action 1.1.3: Upgrades at Time of Renovation or Sale 

Introduction 

 

 

Time of Renovation or Sale 
requirement feasibility assessment 
ongoing through Zero Cities project 
 
Assess equity impacts to avoid 
unintended consequences  

Building renovations or sales can be valuable 
opportunities to increase the energy 
performance of the building in coordination 
with upgrades that are being undertaken. 
Typically, any requirements at time of 
renovation or sale are modest and target poor 
performers within a building class, though such 
transaction points may also represent 
opportunities for deeper energy retrofits. In the 
analysis of potential policies, careful 
consideration will be given to ensure that any 
proposed program or regulation will not result in adverse unintended consequences, such as 
decreases in housing affordability or further disinvestment in poorly maintained buildings 

Complete stakeholder engagement to 
inform policy recommendations 
Legislative Action: If feasible, 
propose policy recommendations in 
2020 

 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Complete a study to explore a requirement for energy upgrades at the time of renovation or, if 
appropriate, sale of a property. To assess the feasibility of such requirements, a market analysis 
should be undertaken to determine an appropriate scope of renovation to regulate, which building 
types would be included in the requirement, what measures are appropriate to require and over 
what time period, and whether the retrofit would be the responsibility of the buyer or seller when 
properties are sold. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

Through the Urban Sustainability Directors Network Zero Cities project, CDD has continued 
work with Architecture 2030 and the Rocky Mountain Institute to a) assess current building 
transaction and renovation activity, b) develop projections for future building transactions and 
renovations, c) assess potential energy savings and emission reductions from existing buildings 
to meet potential energy upgrade requirements, and d) assess potential economic impacts of 
requirements for upgrades at time of renovation or sale. Initial findings show that nearly all 
buildings in Cambridge will be sold or renovated multiple times between today and 2050, 
providing opportunities for energy upgrades, with smaller buildings undergoing more frequent 
sales and larger buildings more frequent renovations. Building off of these quantitative findings, 
Resource Media, a communications research organization, is in the process of conducting 
stakeholder engagement to more fully understand the roles of building owners, occupants, energy 
efficiency providers, and financiers in upgrades at time of sale or renovation to inform policy 
recommendations.

Action 1.1.4: Operations and Maintenance Plan Requirement 

Introduction 

This action recommends that the City require, as 
a condition of building occupancy, that 
applicants submit energy management plans 
detailing how the building will be operated to 
meet the intent of the energy efficient design. 
While the requirement would apply to new 
construction, its objective is to ensure future 
existing buildings are operated to their maximum 
potential.  

 

 

 

BEUDO process included the 
creation of O&M plan template 
O&M plans are implemented on a 
case-by-case basis after 
occupancy  

O&M planning is captured 
through Green Building 
Requirements; no need for further 
action  

 

 

 

Since operations and maintenance planning is 
captured through Green Building Requirements, there is no need for further action.

Action 2 – Net Zero New Construction 

While newly constructed buildings contribute a small portion of Cambridge’s total GHG 
emissions, targeting net zero for new buildings is a bold step that will stimulate investments in 
net zero innovation that can benefit both new and existing buildings. The process and 
governance framework for new requirements is to ensure that meaningful financial analysis can 
take place and industry capacity is commensurate with the requirements. It is important to note 
that the recommended net zero target years will be evaluated at regular intervals and regulatory 
changes will be proposed at least 24 months prior to final enactment. 

 

The following set of actions are designed to support and incentivize achievement of net zero 
GHG emissions performance in newly constructed buildings in Cambridge. 

Action 2.2.1: Market Based Incentive Program 

Introduction 

 

Completed feasibility study of market 
incentives for new buildings 

In order to achieve net zero buildings in 
advance of the proposed requirements, 
Cambridge should explore the use of 
financial mechanisms to motivate the 
market and accelerate innovation. MIT 
and Harvard have agreed to collaborate 
with the City on this investigation in order 
to determine the most effective incentives 
for the Cambridge context. These could include tools such as green building bonds, “green 
banks”, and adjusting pricing of permit fees (or rebates) based on performance.  

Prioritize height and FAR bonus for 
new buildings and consider market 
mechanisms for existing buildings  

Policy constraints of revenue 
neutrality and no additional penalties

Action 2.2.2: Height and FAR Bonus 

Introduction 

 

 

 

Delayed by Envision Cambridge but 
now moving forward independently 

Needs to be prioritized in context of 
other density-related policies 

To generate early action, the City should 
explore the potential impact of offering 
additional floor area allowance (FAR) and 
extra height to projects that achieve net zero 
emissions. Projects will need to demonstrate 
and commit to net zero emissions through 
their design in order to meet eligibility 
requirements for additional FAR award. 
Projects should also have to agree to share 
lessons on how net zero was achieved in their 
projects. FAR incentives have proven effective in other dense jurisdictions where building space 
is at a premium. For example, in Arlington County, Virginia, nearly all new “site plan” (similar 
to Cambridge Special Permit) projects have voluntarily pursued LEED certification since 
additional FAR was offered as an incentive beginning in 2008.11 However, density bonuses are 
limited in nature and run the risk of being over-utilized by competing program priorities so much 
be deployed strategically. The incentive would phase out as the net zero requirements are 
adopted or transition to encourage other environmental benefits. 

Propose policy based on technical 
recommendations 
Legislative Action: Pursue 
recommended density bonus in FY20 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Complete a feasibility study and establish criteria for offering height and/or FAR bonuses to new 
Cambridge buildings that commit to pursuing net zero emissions. Begin program 
implementation. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

In FY18, the Envision Cambridge planning project studied the potential amount of FAR needed 
to incentivize net zero buildings and included an “environmental performance” FAR bonus in a 
list of potential development scenarios. It was decided not to advance these incentives through 
the Envision Cambridge process, but to instead pursue a separate FAR bonus for net zero 
buildings as a zoning amendment. In FY19, with support of consultants from the Zero Cities 
project, CDD completed a technical study of potential criteria to define net zero emissions for 
new construction to be elegible for a density bonus. Criteria elements include standards for 
energy efficiency, on and off-site renewable energy, and the avoidance of fossil fuel 
consumption. In June 2019, a stakeholder meeting was held to provide initial feedback on the 
technical recommendations.

Next Steps 

In FY20, staff are working to use the technical recommendations as the basis for a density bonus 
policy proposal. This proposal will be developed with additional input from those stakeholder 
who might take advantage of the policy, including consideration of the amount of FAR incentive 
needed to support net zero new construction. If the policy is determined to be viable, it will be 
submitted to City Council for consideration. 

Legislative Action 

The technical study and stakeholder feedback will lead to a recommended FAR bonus 
policy which can be considered and advanced by City Council in FY20, potentially in 
coordination with the Rooftop Solar Installation Requirement (see Action 3.2, below).

Action 2.3: Increase Green Building Requirements in Cambridge Zoning Ordinance 

Introduction 

 

 

Previously delayed requirements are 
ready for implementation following 
legislative process 

Article 22 of the Cambridge Zoning 
Ordinance, Sustainable Design and 
Development, promotes environmentally 
sustainable and energy-efficient design and 
development practices in new construction 
and renovation of buildings in the city.12 
Article 22 currently requires that new 
buildings 25,000-50,000GFA (gross floor 
area) meet the requirements of the 
Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design (LEED) Green Building Rating 
 
System at the level ‘Certified’ or better, and that new buildings 50,000GFA or greater meet the 
requirements of LEED ‘Silver’ or better. Increasing the Green Building Requirements in the 
Cambridge Zoning Ordinance was identified by the Net Zero Task Force as a measure with 
significant potential impact on future GHG emissions.  

Begin study of next round of  green 
building requirements 
Legislative Action: Zoning 
amendment package submitted to City 
Council September FY20 

 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Implement the Cambridge Green Building Requirement that all new construction and major 
renovation projects over 25,000GFA to meet LEED criteria at the ‘Gold’ level or better. Projects 
should also achieve a minimum of 6 points under LEED’s Optimize Energy Performance credit 
and the requirements of the Enhanced Commissioning credit to ensure superior energy efficient 
design and operation.  

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

Staff have completed drafting a revised Article 22, which was submitted to City Council as a 
zoning amendment on September 23, 2019. It was determined that the state building stretch 
energy code, which came into effect on January 1, 2017, meets the 6-point improvement targeted 
by the Net Zero Action Plan. However, some new buildings in Cambridge that are subject to 
Special Permit requirements are smaller than the thresholds that trigger the amended Stretch 
Code; these are being strongly encouraged to meet the same energy performance voluntarily 
through the design review process. In fall 2016, Cambridge adopted the latest version of LEED 
(Version 4) under the current Article 22 permitting requirements, increasing the stringency of 
building energy performance. New buildings are also being asked to present a decarbonization 
pathway plan along with their application, which acknowledges that while the buildings may not

achieve net zero emissions today, developers should plan for a technically achievable pathway to 
do so within the life of the building.13 

In FY19, 16 projects were permitted following Green Building Review.14 Eleven of the 
sixteen are certifiable at the level of LEED Gold, and five at the level of LEED Silver. Six are 
solar-ready and two installed solar panels. In aggregate, the projects represent almost 3.5 million 
square feet of development, 2 million of which is residential with over 1,300 units. 

In FY19, staff completed refinement of the proposed Article 22 revisions to incorporate Passive 
House and Enterprise Green Communities as optional standards and to improve the efficiency 
and quality of the Green Building Review process,15 including mechanisms to give input earlier 
in the design process and options for cost-effective third-party review of energy models. The 
draft language was informed by stakeholder and legal review, and was submitted to City Council 
for consideration on September 23, 2019. 

Next Steps 

In anticipation of the next round of green building requirements due in FY21, staff are 
researching options for performance-based building requirements that would not conflict with 
the state building code. The Zero Cities Project (see Action 1.1.3 for details) will devote 
additional resources to developing performance-based models for cities. Staff are also engaging 
in activity at the state level that could provide alternative pathways, such as a voluntary net zero 
stretch code. In May 2019, the City Manager of Cambridge along with the Mayors of Boston and 
Somerville submitted a letter to the state Board of Building Regulations and Standards in support 
of development of a net zero stretch energy code.16 

Legislative Action 

The zoning amendment package for LEED Gold, enhanced commissioning, and eliminating 
barriers to increased insulation was brought to City Council for potential adoption on 
September 23, 2019.

Action 2.4.1: Net Zero Requirement for New Construction of Municipal Buildings 

Introduction 

New municipal buildings being 
constructed to achieve net zero-ready 

 

 

 

Detailing net zero definitions in 
anticipation of requirements 

To demonstrate leadership it is important 
that the City establish policies to pursue net 
zero emissions in municipal buildings. 
Specifically, new construction should target 
net zero or be ‘net zero ready’ in the near 
term. Net zero ready buildings ared 
designed to achieve maximum energy 
savings (e.g. >80% more efficient than 
code requirement) and accommodate 100% 
of annual energy consumption by on or off-
site renewable sources through zero on-site combustion, recognizing that constraints such as site 
area or location may preclude access to sufficient onsite renewable energy to meet 100% of 
energy demand.17 This policy would also be applicable to “gut renovations” where a building is 
being completely renovated with new electrical, mechanical, interior, and envelope systems. 

Complete definitions for net zero 
standard for 2020 
Legislative Action: Adopt muni net 
zero new construction standard in FY20 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Implement the established policy that new construction of municipal buildings should target net 
zero readiness. Plan for adoption of a net zero emissions building standard in 2020. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

The Net Zero Action Plan adopted by City Council in 2015 serves as the policy guiding new 
municipal building construction. Staff have defined net zero-ready construction as highly 
efficient buildings that are fossil fuel-free to enable the consumption of renewable electricity. 
Current municipal construction projects are pursuing net zero readiness: the King Open School 
was completed in fall 2019 and is fossil fuel free, and 859 Mass Ave was completed in 
September 2018 and includes a variable refrigerant flow system along with solar hot water and 
PV panels. Staff have continued to meet regularly to define criteria for the net zero emissions 
standard that will take effect for new municipal buildings beginning in 2020. 

Staff will complete the definition of the net zero emissions standard for new municipal buildings 
including criteria for energy efficiency and reneable energy, incorporating findings from the Net 
Zero Density Bonus design (Action 2.2.2) and Local Carbon Fund feasibility study (Action 4). 

Net Zero Requirements for new municipal buildings should be adopted in FY20 for 
buildings permitted beginning in calendar year 2020. 

17 As defined on page 16 of the Net Zero Action Plan Summary of Proposed Actions:

Action 2.4.2: Renewal of Municipal Buildings 

Introduction  

Cambridge also seeks to set an example by 
showing leadership in the energy efficient 
renewal of existing municipal buildings. The 
Task Force recommends introducing 
greenhouse gas reductions as a key 
component throughout the municipal 
facilities improvement strategy and 
integrating it with other priorities, such as life 
safety, and accessibility. 

FY19 Action Items 

Continued implementation of 
Municipal Facilities 
Improvement Plan 

 

 

Resource limits to achieve 
multiple institutional goals  

Continue implementation and 
tracking of results 

 

 

 

Continue design and begin implementation of a phased municipal building improvement strategy 
where (1) greenhouse gas reduction is a priority when constructing facility improvement projects 
and (2) operational improvements are implemented to achieve targets established and tracked by 
the Cambridge Department of Public Works. The strategy will involve continuous self-
evaluation requiring increased performance levels as technology and local capacity is improved. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

In FY17, the initial Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan (MFIP) was completed to (1) assist 
the City in developing performance metrics and goals for its building portfolio in key facility 
disciplines; (2) perform and document a needs and condition assessment of 41 municipal 
facilities; (3) develop and document a phased Capital Improvement Plan of identified facilities; 
and (4) develop a GHG emissions reduction plan for municipal facilities. The City has 
committed $5 million per year for 5 years to implement the plan recommendations. 
Implementation of improvements to municipal buildings is in progress: 12 energy efficiency 
were upgrades completed in FY19 and another 13 projects are underway. These include 
installation of HVAC upgrades, LED lighting retrofits, and buildings controls and 
retrocommissioning resulting in annual savings of over 1,400 MWh, 34,000 therms, and 
$268,000 in energy costs to the City.  

Next Steps 

Implementation of MFIP improvements will continue throughout FY20. The nature and impact 
of these renovations on energy use will be tracked and reported.

Action 2.5: Removal of Barriers to Increased Insulation 

Introduction 

 

 

Previously delayed requirements 
are ready for implementation 
following stakeholder engagement 
 
Potential opposition to reducing 
setback limitations 

One strategy to improve building efficiency is to 
increase the amount of insulation on the exterior 
of buildings. Because the addition of insulation 
effectively increases the footprint of a building 
and may incur into side yard set-back 
requirements, the Zoning Ordinance can 
introduce regulatory barriers to this retrofit. 
Currently, Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance 
allows Yard Exceptions for existing buildings to 
install exterior insulation as long as it does not 
increase the thickness of the exterior wall by more than 4 inches or result in the wall being less 
than 7 feet, 2 inches from the nearest property line.18 This action calls for development of an 
approach to remove barriers in the Zoning Ordinance to enable the addition of exterior insulation 
with the purpose of improving the energy efficiency of residential buildings. 

Legislative Action: Zoning 
amendment package submitted to 
City Council September FY20 

 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Implement a potential new policy through amendments to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to 
remove barriers to increased exterior insulation during residential building renovations. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

In FY17, staff completed a study of the technical options for exterior insulation, the 
compatibility of potential insulation approaches with the current Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, 
and the feasibility and impacts of potential revisions to the Zoning Ordinance to allow for 
additional exterior insulation.19 It was found that many buildings are out of conformance with 
yard setbacks and therefore additional changes to the Zoning Ordinance would be needed to 
allow additional exterior insulation. Potential language that would allow for this flexibility has 
been drafted as part of the Article 22 amendment package. In FY19, this package completed 
stakeholder and legal review, and it was submitted to City Council for consideration on 
September 23, 2019. 

Next Steps 

Legislative Action 

 

The zoning amendment package for LEED Gold, enhanced commissioning, and eliminating 
barriers to increased insulation was brought to City Council for potential adoption on 
September 23, 2019.

Action 3 – Energy Supply 

While maximizing building efficiency is the first priority of the Net Zero Action Plan and will 
lead to the most GHG savings, to achieve net zero and improve community resiliency will also 
require a significant shift in the supply of the remaining energy needs of Cambridge buildings 
away from fossil fuel-based sources and toward low- or zero-carbon sources. This will include 
realizing a significant portion of the city’s solar potential (both PV and thermal), taking 
advantage of all opportunities to harvest waste heat, and expanding and developing additional 
district energy capacity. As part of a regional grid served by a regional utility, it is also important 
for Cambridge to engage with this utility in order to secure its cooperation and support to help 
Cambridge achieve its Net Zero goals. 

Action 3.1: Low Carbon Energy Supply Strategy 

Introduction 

The Low Carbon Energy Supply Strategy 
enables the City to understand the 
opportunities and pathways to achieve a 
transformation of its energy supply system.  

Key conclusions of the Low Carbon 
Energy Supply Strategy study include: 20 

•  Limited renewable energy 
supply resources within 
Cambridge requires the import 
of clean energy resources from 
outside the city 

 

Implementation of multiple 
study recommendations in 
progress 

 

 

 

 

Transition away from fossil fuel 
energy supply system 

Complete and implement 
recommendations of Resilient 
and Renewable Thermal 
Analysis 

•  Electrification of buildings with grid-supplied renewable electricity is a key means of 

enabling this transfer of clean energy 

•  Use of district energy systems in high energy demand areas increases system 
efficiency, resilience, and flexibility of energy sources, while lowering 
implementation expenses 

•  Regional collaboration is essential to achieve the clean energy supply transition  

FY19 Action Items 

Continue implementation of Low Carbon Energy Supply Strategy study recommendations. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

In FY19, staff have taken a number of actions to advance the key findings listed above:

•  District energy 

o  To set the regulatory groundwork for district energy systems, Cambridge, Boston, 
and Somerville applied for and were selected to receive a District Local Technical 
Assistance award to study state and local governance frameworks for water-based 
district energy systems. The study included an international literature review, 
expert interviews, and a half-day stakeholder workshop. The final report was 
completed in 2019 and concluded that while predictable regulation can help 
advance district energy system development, local and state government can also 
play essential roles by providing technical support and convene potential district 
energy stakeholders. 

o  The high-level district energy system design schematic for the Alewife 
neighborhood completed previously was used as the basis for engaging 
landowners in the neighborhood to consider opportunities to pursue a shared 
district energy system, supported by additional technical and economic analysis. 
The City and stakeholders are considering the value of seeking partnership with a 
district energy developer to advance these activities. 

•  The Cambridge Community Electricity municipal aggregation program was redesigned in 

fall 2018 in order to directly support the development of new solar projects within 
Cambridge,21 while installation of solar on residential and commercial buildings in 
Cambridge continued to be supported by existing City programs such as the Multi-Family 
Energy Efficiency Pilot22 and Sunny Cambridge.23 

• 

In spring 2019, CDD kicked off a Resilient and Renewable Thermal Analysis to develop 
a roadmap for resilient and equitable electrification of the Cambridge building stock. The 
analysis includes identification of typical building typologies and the technical and 
economic pathways to electrifying these buildings; assessment of the resilience and 
equitability implications of these pathways; and development of program strategy and 
policy recommendations. The Analysis is being informed by a steering committee of 
building owners and experts in the field, and will inform the City’s ongoing strategy to 
achieve a transition to renewable building thermal systems. 

Next Steps 

In FY20, staff are continuing to implement the regional collaboration, electrification and 
renewable energy supply, and district energy initiatives described above. The Resilient and 
Renewable Thermal Analysis will be completed in early 2020 and lead to additional policy and 
program recommendations. Staff are also continuing to pursue options for 100% renewable 
municipal electricity supply which can inform strategies to procure additional reneable energy 
for the community as a whole.

Action 3.2: Rooftop Solar Ready Requirement 

Introduction 

 

 

The Rooftop Solar Requirement is intended to 
help meet the Net Zero goal by encouraging 
additional onsite renewable energy generation, 
with a focus on solar. The Action should begin 
with the exploration of a requirement that all 
roofs on new construction projects must be solar 
ready. “Solar ready” means that buildings are 
designed to accommodate the future installation 
of roof-mounted solar panels including either 
photovoltaic or solar thermal. In the future, the 
City will consider options to require onsite solar 
installations for new buildings and major roof replacements. 

 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Solar installation requirement 
technical analysis completed 

Accomodating solar on different 
building types 

Develop policy proposals for 
City Council consideration 
Legislative Action: Pursue 
recommended solar installation 
requirements in FY20 

Study the feasibility of a potential rooftop solar installation requirement. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

In spring 2019, as an extension of the Zero Cities project, CDD worked with consultants to 
conduct an analysis of technical options for a solar installation requirement. The analysis 
included review of policy precedents in other jurisdictions and building code proposals, solar 
cost data review, and a comparison of the installation impact of three sample policy pathways. 
Stakeholders provided feedback on the analysis results during a meeting in June 2019, and 
reached consensus that the amount of solar required to be installed should be based on meeting a 
certain percentage of projected building energy demand and should include both on-site and off-
site compliance pathways. 

Next Steps 

Staff are working in fall 2019 to develop potential policy proposals based on the technical 
analysis to be refined with further stakeholder input and then brought to City Council for 
consideration in 2020. 

Legislative Action 

The technical study and stakeholder feedback will lead to a recommended solar installation 
requirement policy which can be considered and advanced by City Council in early 2020, 
potentially in coordination with the Height and FAR bonus (see Action 2.2.2, above).

Action 3.3: Develop a Memorandum of Understanding with Local Utilities 

Introduction 

Cities can collaborate with utilities on projects 
of mutual interest to result in energy use and 
emissions reductions. City-utility data sharing 
is particularly essential to understanding where 
and how energy is used in the city and what 
opportunities exist to decrease and green this 
energy use. The declaration and definition of 
this collaboration can impact its effectiveness, 
so a formal agreement on how the City of 
Cambridge, Eversource and Veolia can work 
together on the following areas is recommended: 

 

 

 

 

Pursue project-specific 
collaboration in place of 
overarching MOU 

Privacy concerns around data 
sharing 

Leverage Energy Allies 
collaboration with utilities 

 

 

 

Investigating and piloting smart grid projects  
Investing in incentive programs  

• 
• 
•  Data sharing  
• 
• 
•  Using solar PV to strategically address distribution congestion  
•  Work to increase resiliency of the electric, gas, and steam systems 

Investigation, development and expansion of district energy systems  
Interconnection issues that limit deployment of solar PV and co-generation  

FY18 Action Items 

Continue implementation of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Eversource and 
Veolia based on areas of mutual interest and have senior officials meet regularly to monitor and 
manage progress. Explore if there is benefit to including the state government and regional 
partners to this collaboration. 

Progress Towards FY18 Action Items 

Given ongoing challenges to secure an overaching MOU with local utilities, in FY18 staff 
determined that a more effective approach is to collaborate with the utilities on a project-by-
project basis. For example, the Cambridge Energy Alliance continued to work closely with 
Eversource on implementation of the Multi-Family Pilot Program (see Action 1.1.1), despite 
some barriers around privacy which limits data sharing. Both Eversource and Veolia participated 
in the Low Carbon Energy Supply Strategy (LCESS) Advisory Committee along with 
Eversource (see Action 3.1) and through this forum participated in regular conversations about 
the future of energy planning in Cambridge.  

New in FY19 is Cambridge’s participation in the Energy Allies exchange program which aims to 
foster collaboration between government and civil society organizations such as utilities in the

clean energy transition through a series of international peer-learning workshops.24 Cambridge 
chose Eversource as one of its partners in this exchange program, and through the workshop 
process the City and utility are identifying areas of targeted collaboration. Potential focus areas 
would align with the newly adopted state 3-year energy efficiency plan,25 including strategic 
electrification. Cambridge and Eversource will meet to flesh out collaborative actions and report 
back to the Energy Allies organizers on their progress.  

Eversource is also an active partner in the design of comprehensive retrofit program pathways 
for BEUDO buildings (see Action 1.1.2, above).

Action 4 – Local Carbon Fund 

For Cambridge to become a net zero community, it will require an annual energy balance across 
the entirety of the city’s building stock. Where it is not possible or is exceptionally challenging 
for individual projects to achieve net zero emissions through the combination of efficiency and 
renewable energy generation, an alternative approach is to introduce a locally managed carbon 
fund that provides an option to purchase carbon offsets on a voluntary basis. The money 
collected would go into a local carbon fund, the proceeds of which will support Cambridge-
based greenhouse gas reduction initiatives and renewable or low-carbon energy projects. Ideally, 
a locally based carbon fund would be developed and operated independently or at arm’s length 
of the City. 

Action 4: Investigate Local Carbon Fund 

Introduction 

 

 

A Local Carbon Fund would serve as a vehicle 
that is easy to use as an alternative method to 
achieve net zero emissions over the short and 
medium term. The preliminary analysis should 
explore issues such as the development of a 
methodology for determining validity of offset 
projects. The offsets need not be “gold level” 
certified, but the accreditation methodology 
should be robust. In contrast to traditional 
offset frameworks, which typically are limited to supporting large-scale projects, a local carbon 
fund should be structured such that it can support a range of Cambridge-based emission 
reduction projects regardless of the scale of the project.

FY19 Action Items 

Build off of the Local Carbon Fund feasibility assessment with a virtual pilot to test out policy 
components and demand for carbon offsets. Prepare for potential FY20 implementation. 

Progress Towards FY18 Action Items 

Building off of the Local Carbon Fund feasibility assessment completed in FY18, in FY19 staff 
worked with consultants from the Cadmus Group to run a “virtual pilot” of the Local Carbon 
Fund concept with Cambridge building stakeholders. The virtual pilot entailed constructing a 
basic building energy/cost model in Excel to model potential pathways to achieve net zero 
emissions in Cambridge buildings. The model selected the combined use of energy efficiency, 
renewable energy, and carbon offsets that would minimize upfront and operational costs for 
building owners. Stakeholders provided feedback on the model construction and data from actual 
building projects to help test out the model and its conclusions in a hypothetical setting.  

The goal of the model was to further investigate the utility of a Local Carbon Fund while 
gathering data to answer key questions about offset cost, purchase timing, and differentiation of

separate offset types. While modeling and data limitations precluded detailed conclusions for all 
of these questions, it remains clear based on the results and stakeholder feedback that a local 
carbon offset option can be an important pathway for net zero emissions standard compliance. 

Next Steps 

Based on the conclusions of the virtual pilot, in FY20 the City and stakeholders should continue 
to determine options for Local Carbon Fund establishment and implementation. The Fund could 
also serve as a pathway for achieving compliance with proposed BEUDO performance 
requirement compliance beginning in 2021 (see Action 1.1.2) and small residential net zero 
emissions compliance beginning in 2022 (see Action 2.1).

Action 5 – Engagement and Capacity Building 

The strength of the Net Zero Action Plan is built on the comprehensive stakeholder engagement 
which led to its formation. Therefore, continued engagement of stakeholders throughout 
Cambridge and related interest groups is crucial to the successful implementation of the plan. 
The Task Force recommended that the City continue to invest staff time and resources into 
identifying tools, innovative ideas, training opportunities, grants and other resources to support 
residents and commercial property owners in working toward the aggressive goals of the Plan. 

Action 5.1: Communication Strategy 

Introduction 

Implementation of multi-faceted 
communication strategy ongoing 

 

 

 
Broaden community awareness 
of Net Zero Action Plan 

To maintain a high level of stakeholder 
engagement around the Net Zero Action 
Plan, the City should develop a 
comprehensive long-term communications 
strategy around the Cambridge Net Zero 
objective. The strategy will ensure that key 
stakeholders including City officials, the 
building industry, and Cambridge 
 
residents remain aware of the progress 
toward net zero and engaged with the initiative as needed or desired. The strategy will also 
enable the Net Zero Action Plan to serve as a touchpoint for broader energy and climate 
education in Cambridge, encouraging residents to take personal responsibility for helping 
Cambridge to meet its ambitious climate change mitigation and adaptation goals.  

Action-specific and integrated 
stakeholder engagement activity 

 

 

FY19 Action Items 

Continue implementation of a comprehensive communications strategy around the Net Zero 
Action Plan objectives and components. Integrate stakeholder engagement and public 
communications into each Action as appropriate. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

Regular communication and outreach around the Net Zero Action Plan continued in FY19. 
Ongoing interest in net zero planning amoung communities across the greater Boston region led 
to multiple requests for presentations and consultation to support planning processes. Particular 
promising are collaborative efforts to enable net zero-related initiatives as the regional and state 
level, such as by advocating for a net zero state stretch energy code.26

The Net Zero Newsletter was sent to over 800 stakeholders and community members in July, 
2019.27 

Extensive stakeholder engagement was undertaken to support the development of the BEUDO 
performance requirements (Action 1.1.2) and Custom Retrofit Program (Action 1.1.1). Staff have 
been collaborating with the CDD Communications Director and Eversource marketing team to 
prepare for the public launch of the Program, which will include press engagement, targeted 
stakeholder communications, and a launch event hosted by a stakeholder institution. The 
program will be supported by a new “resource hub” website to help BEUDO building owners 
and operators understand the resources and opportunities to help them lower energy use and 
GHG emissions. 

Next Steps 

In FY20, staff will continue to implement outreach and communication for the Net Zero Action 
Plan. Action-specific stakeholder engagement will continue, as well as additional efforts to help 
stakeholders understand and provide feedback on overlap between the multiple net zero actions 
moving forward in parallel.

Action 5.2: Develop Ongoing Capacity to Manage Getting to Net Zero Project 

Introduction 

While the Cambridge Net Zero Action Plan 
was completed by the Getting to Net Zero Task 
Force in early 2015, in the years that follow the 
initiative will be led by the City of Cambridge 
along with partners and community 
stakeholders. As such, it is essential that the 
initiative be resourced accordingly so that its 
objectives will be met over the duration of the 
project. 

FY19 Action Items 

On track with implementation of 
NZAP management and reporting 
structure 

 

 

Ensure continued coordination 
among partner institutions 

Complete annual report review and 
begin the Program Wide Review 

 

 

 

Continue monitoring roles and responsibilities for implementing the Cambridge Net Zero 
initiative over the long term. This includes assigning project leads for each of the actions, 
identifying research and implementation partners, and maintaining a reporting structure and a 
governance structure to ensure that the project remains on track and consistent. Prepare for 5-
year Program Wide Review. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 

In FY18, the Cambridge Climate Protection Action Committee (CPAC) continued to serve as the 
governing body responsible for ongoing oversight of the Plan. Staff provide NZAP updates at 
monthly CPAC meetings. CPAC also received and reviewed the FY18 annual report outlining 
progress towards actions for the previous year and results of these actions on clean energy 
measures and GHG emissions in Cambridge. As laid out in the Plan, Program Wide Reviews are 
scheduled for every five years to involve a wide range of stakeholders in a comprehensive 
review of progress along the Plan and necessary adjustments moving forward based on changes 
in technology, policy, and other influential factors. The first of these reviews is due to occur in 
FY20 and in FY19 staff began working with CPAC to draft the scope for the review process. 

The Cambridge Net Zero Energy Planner continued to oversee daily implementation of the Plan, 
including scoping projects, hiring consultants, and managing projects throughout their timelines. 
Research and implementation partners were engaged as appropriate, for example the Cambridge 
Compact for a Sustainable Future Net Zero Laboratory working group to investigate laboratory-
specific BEUDO requirements (Action 5.3).  

This report was reviewed by CPAC, including any feedback on program management and 
communications. In FY20, the first comprehensive Program Wide Review will be undertaken to 
evaluate progress to date and make necessary adjustments to the Plan trajectory based on a 
stakeholder-driven process. Individual actions will be monitored and managed on an ongoing 
basis to provide opportunities for CPAC and outside stakeholder feedback and guidance, 
including periodic engagement of the Net Zero Task Force.

Action 5.3: Net Zero Lab Standards 

Introduction 

Commercial and academic laboratories are 
responsible for approximately one third of 
the current energy demand in Cambridge. 
Given this large impact, the challenges for 
laboratories to significantly reduce their 
energy use while meeting operational, 
health, and regulatory standards, and the 
lack of net zero lab examples, the Net Zero 
Action Plan includes a stakeholder-based 
process to research and develop new 
standards for lab operations that support 
lower energy use.  

FY19 Action Items 

In progress through Compact for 
a Sustainable Future workplan  

Diversity of laboratory uses and 
energy needs 

Derive conclusions and 
recommendations from 
additional benchmarking 

 

 

 

 

 

Continue work by a coalition of industry stakeholders, research institutions and industrial 
hygienists to collaborate on new standards for reducing energy use that can be trialed without 
compromising safety or research integrity. Develop initial standards to be piloted in future years. 

Progress Towards FY19 Action Items 
The Cambridge Compact for a Sustainable Future28 continued a productive working group to 
consider the feasibility of potential standards for reducing energy use in Cambridge laboratories, 
with support from City staff. The working group met regularly to discuss a variety of related 
topics and began a second data-collection exercise to more fully benchmark and derive 
conclusions from current laboratory energy use patterns. 

Following the Additional BEUDO Requirement stakeholder workshops in summer 2018 (Action 
1.1.2), it was determined that separate requirements should be established for laboratories given 
their unique operational constraints. Over the course of fall 2018, the laboratory working group 
collaborated to generate feedback regarding a compliance track for labs including laboratory 
definitions, tenant engagement, performance requirements, and monitoring and compliance.  

Next Steps 

In FY20, the laboratory working group will complete a second round of energy benchmarking 
study that will create a richer dataset to inform future performance standards and pilot program 
opportunities.

FISCAL YEAR 2019 QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS 
While the bulk of this first-year report has focused on the progress toward each of the Net Zero 
Plan Actions, data from the 2012 Community GHG Inventory and the 201729 Building Energy 
Use Disclosure Ordinance reports serve as initial quantitative indicators of building energy use 
and emissions in Cambridge. These indicators serve as a helpful baseline for measuring progress 
towards Cambridge becoming a net zero community and evaluating the effect of the Net Zero 
Action Plan in future years.  

Community Greenhouse Gas Inventory 

In FY17, the City of Cambridge completed a community-wide GHG inventory to meet its 
commitment as a participant in the Compact of Mayors30 to mitigate climate change. A 
comprehensive GHG inventory helps the City better understand where GHG emissions are 
generated and then develop strategies for reducing these GHG emissions. The inventory was 
completed for 2012 because of data availability and alignment with the municipal inventory. 
External limits to data prevent annual updates to the Inventory, so this analysis has not changed 
from the FY16 Annual Report. The 2020 5-Year Program Wide Review will include the 
evaluation of the plan’s impact to date and establish quantitative indicators moving forward. It 
will also provide an update to the community-wide GHG inventory for buildings.  

As seen in the summary graph below, the majority of GHG emissions generated in Cambridge 
are related to building energy use, including residential buildings, commercial and institutional 
buildings, manufacturing industries and construction, and energy industries such as combined 
heat and power plants that provide energy to buidlings in Cambridge, for a total of 82%. This 
emphasizes the importance of the Net Zero Action Plan’s goal of eliminating GHG emissions 
from building operations in Cambridge. Total stationary 2012 GHG emissions are 1,202,956 MT 
CO2e. 

 

29 Due to data quality issues in the 2018 BEUDO reports, the data analysis was not available in time for the writing 
of this report. The full set of BEUDO data will be included in the Net Zero Action Plan 5-Year Review evaluation 
process.

2012 Cambridge Community GHG Inventory  

A deeper dive into the emissions data related to building operations shows that natural gas and 
electricity are each responsible for a little under than half of building energy emissions, and fuel 
oil for less than 1%. Natural gas consumed on-site currently has a lower emissions factor than 
electricity generated off-site,31 but does not have the long-term potential to eliminate these GHG 
emissions. Therefore, transitioning to cleaner electricity sources, as is being explored in the Low 
Carbon Energy Supply Study (Action 3.1), is crucial both to reducing GHG emissions from the 
current electricity demand and providing a carbon-neutral energy supply option to replace natural 
gas in the long term.  

 

31 There are concerns about GHG emissions from fugitive methane emissions due to leaks in the natural gas 
production process and transmission infrastructure, for example: http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/62820.pdf

Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance 

The Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance (BEUDO) requires parcels with non-
residential buildings of a total of 25,000 square feet or greater as well as parcels with residential 
buildings totaling 50 or more units to annually report and disclose their energy and water use.32 
By requiring the largest buildings to report their energy use, Cambridge can gain important 
information about the majority of the energy consumption  and GHG emissions in the City while 
streamlining the data collection process to the largest energy consumers, as illustrated by the 
graph below.33

housing and office buildings. However, energy use for laboratories, even though they consist of 
only 8% of the reported building area, is 22% of the total energy use, illustrating the much higher 
energy intensity of laboratories.

Greenhouse gas emissions are tied not only to total energy usage, but also to the mix of fuel 
types used at each property type. The pie chart below shows the share of total emissions 
contributed by each property type. Emissions are a product of energy use and the GHG intensity 
of each fuel. Electricity currently has a higher GHG emissions factor than natural gas, as seen in 
the first bar graph. A comparison of fuel mix across property types is located in the second bar 
graph.

The energy use intensity, or EUI, of buildings is a helpful metric to normalize energy use across 
buildings of different sizes, much like an MPG sticker on a car. As illustrated in the graph below, 
most buildings reporting to BEUDO have an EUI below 100 kBtu/ft2, with a handful of buildings 
consuming much more energy (i.e. energy dense buildings like laboratories).

Site EUI (kBtu/sqft.)

 

In order to contextualize the results of the Cambridge analysis, median energy use intensities for 
various property types included in the Cambridge data are compared to the national median 
energy use. The national median EUI data primarily comes from the Commercial Building 
Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS). Differences in median EUI may be due to more 
intensive activities, different climate and weather patterns, or differences in energy performance. 
Overall, BEUDO reporter site EUIs are quite close to the national medians.

Cambridge Median

National Median EUI

*National Median data from 
CBECS, Labs21, and Fannie Mae

 

An additional comparison mechanism is the 1 – 100 ENERGY STAR score screening tool that 
helps property owners and managers assess how a building is performing. A score of 50 is the 
median; a score of 75 or higher means the buildings performs in the top quartile and may be 
eligible for ENERGY STAR certification.36 

Out of the 668 reports included in the 2017 BEUDO data set, a subset of building categories are 
eligible for an ENERGY STAR score. The graph below shows the distribution of ENERGY 
STAR scores for these 305 properties. Across all eligible properties, Cambridge buildings tend to 
perform better than their peers, with an average score of 64 and a median score of 75. The graph 
also shows a significant amount of properties with an ENERGY STAR score of zero, which may 
be due to incomplete information or a mixed use (such as a laboratory in an office building). The 
second graph shows the ENERGY STAR score by property type. 

36 Note that Energy Star changed the baseline for Energy Start scores in 2018, which will lead to lower scores for 
most building types in their 2018 reports.

Based on the data in the BEUDO reports, many large building types in Cambridge are already on 
the way to efficient energy use, while others have a ways to go. Laboratories are clearly a key 
challenge based on their high EUI and significant proportion of total GHG emissions. It should

be noted that the unique uses of laboratories along with health and safety requirements has much 
to do with their high emissions, and not necessarily the construction of the buildings themselves. 
Hotels, while having a lower ENERGY STAR score, only contribute a small proportion of 
Cambridge’s GHG emissions, so may be less of a priority. The higher GHG emission factor of 
electricity from the grid illustrates the important of decarbonizing the electricity sector in the 
short term, which will enable additional emissions reductions by fuel switching from natural gas 
to electricity in the medium to long term.  

Annual BEUDO reports will serve as a key resource to tracking energy and GHG emission 
trends from large buildings in Cambridge and hopefully demonstrating the progress of the Net 
Zero Action Plan. Now that four years of BEUDO data have been reported, initial trends in the 
data over time can be observed in the graph below. Data from BEUDO properties reporting data 
in at least 3 years is included.37 Most property types see a modest decrease in energy use 
intensity over the four years, with an average reduction of 1.1% per year.  

The evaluation of additional requirements for BEUDO buildings (Action 1.1.2) will consider 
whether this rate of improvement is sufficient or if greater savings should be required, and how 
those saving might be achieved and measured.

37 If a property has fewer than 4 years of reported data, the fourth year value is interpolated by assuming a 
constant rate of change. Note that only 473 of the properties have 3 or more years of data, limiting the ability to 
accurately compare performance of all BEUDO properties over time.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 

 

February 24, 2020 

 

Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge 

Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting to the City Council for review and 
discussion at the February 24, 2020 Council Meeting forty-two revised Surveillance 
Technology Impact Reports (“STIRs”), describing Surveillance Technologies which are 
subject to the Ordinance. These STIRS require City Council approval. Thirty-eight of the revised 
STIRs concern Surveillance Technology for which earlier STIRs were submitted at the 
December 9, 2019 Council meeting and four of the revised STIRs concern Surveillance 
Technology for which earlier STIRs were submitted at the January 22, 2020 Public Safety 
Committee meeting.  Following the January 22, 2020 Public Safety Committee meeting and in 
response to concerns raised by members of the Public Safety Committee, several STIRs were 
combined in order to streamline the review process, and thus, there are now a total of only forty-
two revised STIRS for consideration by the Council.   
 
 
In addition to the above-referenced revised STIRs, please note that three new STIRs 
concerning Surveillance Technologies which also require City Council approval were previously 
posted on Friday February 14, 2020 for this Council Meeting:  1) Digital Evidence Management 
System; 2) ATLAS RMV Portal; and 3) Internet Protocol (“IP”) Address Collection Platforms. 
 
 
City Council meeting and to answering any questions you may have.   
 
 

I look forward to reviewing these documents in detail with you at the February 24, 2020 

 

Very truly yours, 

 

Louis A. DePasquale  
City Manager

LexisNexis 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  LexisNexis is a search engine.  Users pay a fee to searchpublic records and other 

information compiled by the provider.  
 

•  Assessing – Assesing is seeking to use LexisNexis to review information submitted 

by taxpayers seeking residential exemptions and personal exemptions. 
 

•  CPD – CPD uses LexisNexis as a research tool to locate people, companies, 

businesses, phone numbers, properties and fragments of information; this information 
helps to create a more complete picture of what CPD is investigating (e.g., the 
Department enters the name and phone number of an individual who had been the 
victim of a scam, this search leads us to where the “scammer” found the victim’s 
information, potentially creating a solid investigative lead).  

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Assessing: Preventing waste, fraud, and abuse of City resources.  This data will allow 
the Assessing department to vet information received from taxpayers in order to 
prevent fraud.   
 

•  CPD – Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing 

injury to persons or significant damage to property. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

•  Assessing – Will be used in the Assessing Department.  Anticipated start date spring 

2020. 
 

•  CPD – Crime Analysis and Criminal Investigations Division.  Currently in use. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact since it is composed of public records.  
Anyone can access LexisNexis.  The search engine offers various levels of 
information depending on subscription cost. 
 

•  Assessing will limit access to LexisNexis to two staff members.  These are staff who 
are currently part of the review process of the exemptions and access to this program 
should make their jobs easier.  Additionally, the use of the software by the Assessing 
department is reviewed by LexisNexis to ensure that it is used only for department 
business.  LexisNexis can audit the Assessing department to ensure that the data is 
being used only for business purposes.   
 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  Assessing - Assessing department budget will cover the costs for two licenses at 

$120.00 each, equaling $240.00 per year. 

•  CPD – Part of Accurint cost.

(Revising STIR No. 2 Submitted December 9, 2019) 
 

Emergency Communications Department 
Emergency Communications Center 

Christina Giacobbe 
2/24/20 
RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System 

Department: 
Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System (RapidSOS) is a web platform that 
provides life-saving data directly to 911 and first responders in an emergency, 
providing faster, more effective responses. Callers who contact 911 do so voluntarily 
seeking emergency services.  RapidSOS integrates data from: personal devices such 
as smartphones and smartwatches, motor vehicles’ GPS and crash-detection systems, 
and home security systems, to provide real-time emergency data that supplements 
information provided during an individual 911 call. 
 

•  RapidSOS is deployed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ State 911 

• 

Department, which manages and oversees the Next Generation 911 system.  This 
state system delivers 911 calls to the appropriate jurisdiction and RapidSOS 
technology functions as a clearinghouse to present the call to the Public Safety 
Answering Point (PSAP), or call center, for emergency response.  ECC serves as a 
PSAP and is therefore required to access RapidSOS through the State 911 system. 
 
In Cambridge, when callers contact 911 their call is directed to Emergency 
Communications on the state’s Next Generation 911 platform and RapidSOS 
provides secondary, data-based location information to ECC through the RapidSOS 
clearinghouse The data that is collected at the time of the call is the caller location 
and phone number.  All 911 calls and caller information are required to be recorded.  
These records are kept according to record retention policies through the 
administrative portal of the Next General 911 System.   

•  The State 911 Department is required by law to review and assess all technological 

and operational capability of wireless 911 calls being routed and handled directly by

the PSAP in which the caller is located.  The State 911 Department is responsible for 
ensuring such capability exists and they establish the standards, by which our PSAP 
receives wireless calls.  

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of this technology is to provide ECC Call Takers and Dispatchers with 
an accurate phone number and location information of wireless callers who contact 
911 in our jurisdiction.  This is necessary to provide aid to the caller, dispatch 
emergency personnel and provide emergency services.   This information also allows 
Call Takers and Dispatchers to contact the caller if the call gets disconnected or for 
additional follow up.  

 
•  This technology supports our ability to maintain the safety and security of City 

employees, students, and residents when experiencing an emergency situation.  In 
addition, this technology allows us to communicate life saving information to first 
reponsders.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The RapidSOS technology is deployed by the State 911 Department to all PSAPs in 
the Commonwealth as part of the Next Generation 911 System.  The RapidSOS 
technology is housed on the State 911 system located in Middleboro and a local 
server for our PSAP is located at 125 Sixth Street. 

 
•  This technology was implemented in 2018. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The privacy impact of this technology is consistent with federal, state and local 

government policies for the purposes of law enforcement and public safety efforts.  
Records of 911 calls received through traditional call processing have previously 
included location and phone information provided by cellular carriers, and RapidSOS 
provides the same information.  However, with the rapid advancement of location-
based technology, our reliance on cellular carriers’ location information has 
decreased.  The RapidSOS technology provides more accurate location information.  
The Next Generation 911 System administered by the State provides also provides 
subscriber information, i.e., the name of the person to whom the phone is registered, 
as well as the phone address and number.  Currently, all callers that contact 911 are 
informed that the call is being recorded as required by law.

•  The State 911 Department provides role-based access to the data to ensure protection 
of caller information.  In ECC/our PSAP, Call Takers and Dispatchers have access to 
caller information during the call and for thirty minutes after the call has been 
disconnected. Authorized users will have access for performing their duties in 
accordance with their role during call processing, quality assurance and investigative 
matters.  

 
•  Because this technology provides an opportunity for citizens and business to access 
emergency services, there may be a greater impact on privacy of the individuals or 
businesses who voluntarily provide information to law enforcement officials during 
emergencies.  The Emergency Communications Department will address these 
privacy impacts by limiting access to the information to assigned investigators and/or 
authorized users, similarly to current department policy.   

 
•  All access to the RapidSOS administrative portal is limited to managers of the ECD 

and is password protected.    

•  The State 911 Department reviews and assesses new communications technologies 
that may serve as Next Generation 911 technology platforms, consistent with FCC 
decisions and federal law.  RapidSOS technology has been thoroughly vetted by the 
State to provide life-saving information during emergencies. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  There are no associated costs with RapidSOS technology as it is deployed by the 

State 911 Department as part of the State Next Generation 911 system.

Trespass Tracking database 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

• 

 
• 

In Massachusetts, trespassing is a crime. G.L. c266, §120 provides private entities 
and departments within the City of Cambridge to obtain a no trespass order against 
individuals after providing appropriate posted notice on the property or providing 
notice to the person directly by the Cambridge Police Department. 

Information about no trespassing notices/letters provided to individuals through this 
process are recorded in the Trespass Tracking database during a call for service.  The 
Trespass Tracking database is part of CPD & ECC’s Computer Aided Dispatch 
(CAD) database.  (The CAD is itself a component of CPD’s complete QED/Records 
Management System.)   

•  The information recorded is the trespasser’s name, location of the trespass, and other 
identification information if known such as address, who served the order, driver’s 
license number and date of the notice’s issue and expiration.  The Police Department 
is required to maintain these notices.  All notices and the information in the notice are 
recorded in our Trespass Tracking database so that the information can be made 
readily available to first responders during calls for service. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of the database is to have a centralized record of all active trespass 

notices.  The recording of this information is to ensure public safety, in particular the 
safety of those impacted by the notice as well as officer safety.  In addition, the 
Trespass Tracking database allows us to maintain an electronic record of all active 
trespass notices in the City in one database in CAD.

•  This technology supports our ability to maintain the safety and security of City 

employees, students, and residents in Cambridge.  In addition, this technology allows 
us to communicate life saving information to first reponders.  With this vital 
information, police officers are able to identify and prevent threats to persons and 
property and prevent injury to persons or significant damage to property.  

 
•  The Police Department is able to identify, apprehend, and prosecute criminal 
offenders and gather evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and 
administrative actions.  Providing information to emergency personnel and enforcing 
obligations to the City is required to ensure a safe community.  Therefore, this 
information must be accessed with ease during emergency responses. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The technology is deployed in the data center at 125 6th Street so that it can connect 

to the existing CAD/RMS systems that support the Police Department and 
Emergency Communications.  The information is maintained in the CAD/QED 
system that is deployed in the Emergency Communications Center, Police, and Fire 
Departments.   

•  The department has been utilizing this database for the past ten years. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The individuals who are recorded in the Trespass Tracking database are notified 
verbally and in writing of the notice to not trespass at the said location, and that 
notice contains all information stored in the Trespass Tracking database.  Therefore, 
there is no additional privacy impact through the utilization of this technology as it is 
an electronic database of trespass notices that have already been served.   
 

•  The records are available electronically through the CAD/QED system to authorized 
personnel performing law enforcement duties. However, there are restictions and 
access to this database is managed by ECC.  There is no public access to this database 
and only authorized employees can review on a secure connection.   
 

•  This technology stores copies of existing protected Criminal Justice Information 

Services (CJIS) information and complies with mandatory CJIS security requirements 
for federal, state and local governments.  The privacy impact of this technology is 
consistent with federal, state and local government policies for the purposes of law 
enforcement and public safety efforts.

SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IMPACT REPORT

Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

Acting Chief Gerard E. Mahoney, Acting Chief 
1/222/24/2020 
Verathon Corporation's Glidescope Go video laryngoscope. 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

 

•  Cambridge FireFire proposes to use the Verathon Corporation's Glidescope Go video 

laryngoscope. This is a medical device that facilitates critical medical care by 
capturing video of the back of the throat of an unconscious person in order to place 
an endotracheal tube (breathing tube).  

 

 

•  A laryngoscope is a medical device, essentially a curved tongue depressor with a 

light at the end, that lifts the tongue out of the way and allows a paramedic to look 
through the patient's mouth and see the patient's tracheal opening in order to place a 
breathing tube in the trachea (also known as intubation).  

•  Patients who require breathing tubes are the most critical patients we see, and 
usually are not breathing at all. In order to facilitate faster and more accurate 
breathing tube placement and improve outcomes, video laryngoscopy has been 
developed, which places a camera at the end of the device and a small video screen 
attached so the paramedic can see the tracheal opening better.  

• 

  Glidescope GO records video only.on a mini SD card. There is no audio or data 
recording. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Documenting and improving performance of City employees.

•  The purpose of the technology is to improveImproving critical health care processes 
and outcomes in order to provide the best available medical care to the residents and 
visitors of the City of Cambridge. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  This technology will be on the CFD's Paramedic units, and will also be used in 
training with manikins. The video laryngoscopes will be acquired before June 
30,2020 and deployed in or around May 2020as soon as is practicable. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The privacy impact will be zero. There are no patient identifiers associated with 

thedevice is a simple video in the camera that stores the video on a removable mini 
SD card. The instrument. itself does not have the capacity to capture or store any 
images or data. If the device is used, the SD card will be secured until the video is 
uploaded into a HIPAA- compliant server, then the file on the SD card will be 
deleted.  

•  There is a slight chance that the camera could catch a very quick, low resolution 

image (~1.25 ip/mm according to the engineers) of part of the patient’s face while 
being inserted or removed. The operator will be moving fast because the patient is 
not breathing and the paramedic will be focused on placing the endotracheal tube 
quickly. Therefore, the probability of capturing a stable image of the full face is 
slim.  

•  When the video is uploaded into a patient’s chart or other data storage, itany image 
of the face will be considered protected health information and access will be 
severely limitedProtected Health Information (PHI) in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Access to PHI is password 
protected with several levels of access, and each user has only the access they 
absolutely need (quality improvement, billing, etc.). 

• 

If the video is used in case review or training, there will be no patient identifiers 
associated with it., and only the relevant part of the video, the back of the airway and 
vocal cords, will be used. Any capture of the patient’s face will be obscured at the 
least, and most likely trimmed off the beginning/end of the video.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

•  The initialInitial costs: $24,784. Initial funding will be $24,784.00, which will be 

fundedprovided by a federal grant. This 

•  Ongoing maintenance: The initial purchase includes 120 disposable blades. Once the 
initial supply of blades is exhausted, replacement blades will be purchased by CFD 
at a cost of $40-$52 each, depending on the style of blade. Training and Quality 
Improvement costs are impossible to determine, because they will be embedded 
within our standard training and quality processes. Ongoing costs will be funded 
through federal grants if available at the time, or through the CFD budget.

Tweetdeck – Social media monitoring software through Twitter  

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  TweetDeck is a social media dashboard application for management of Twitter 

accounts. Originally an independent app, TweetDeck was subsequently acquired by 
Twitter Inc. and integrated into Twitter's interface. 
 

•  Tweetdeck allows users to organize and search Tweets in various ways.  From 

Twitter1: 

 

o  Collections – With collections, you can organize Tweets according to topics, 

events, interests, conversations, and more, all in real-time. Add your 
collections as columns and Tweet the URL to share it with others. 

o  Search Typeahead – When you begin to type characters into the search box, 
TweetDeck will run a real-time search that attempts to autocomplete your 
search term, surfacing potentially relevant search topics and accounts. 
Different search topics will be shown on the top half of the drop-down menu, 
whereas user accounts will be shown on the bottom half.  If you select one of 
the suggested search terms, you will be given the option to browse users 
related to that search topic or Tweets related to that search term.  

o  Sentiment – It’s easy to uncover sentiment surrounding a topic; simply search 
for a topic followed by a happy or sad emoticon. For example, you can create 
a search column with the keyword "San Francisco :)" to see Tweets regarding 
San Francisco in a positive manner.

o  Column filters – TweetDeck’s column filters are a powerful way to 

customize searches by keyword, date and time, and to stay on top of new 
Tweets as columns quickly update. 

▪  Content: Tweets matching keywords, media type, dates and time, 

language, or including or excluding Retweets 

▪  Location: Tweets geotagged in a specified locations 
▪  Users: Tweets from a specific account, members of a List, or verified 

accounts 

replies 

▪  Engagement: Tweets with a minimum number of Retweets, likes, or 

▪  Alerts: Tweet alerts through sound or desktop notifications 
o  List management – TweetDeck allows you to manage your Lists easily in 

one centralized place for all your accounts. You can create Lists in 
TweetDeck filtered by your interests or by particular accounts. Any List that 
you have set up or subscribed to previously can also be added as separate 
columns in TweetDeck. 

o  Tweets from a specific account – You can designate a column to display a 
specific account’s Tweets. Just add a Tweet column and search for the 
account you would like featured in the search box. 
 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  CPD 

o  Providing information to emergency personnel 
o  Analyzing and managing service delivery 
o  Documenting and improving performance of City employees 
o  Surveying and gathering feedback from constituents 

•  Mayor’s Office & Council Office – Surveying and gathering feedback from 
constituents. More frequently, people are using Twitter to communicate their 
constituent concerns or issues with City services much in the same way that they 
would send an email. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Through City-issued computers and laptops, the technology is available continuously.  
•  CPD – Public Information Office  
•  Mayor’s Office & Council Office – While not in use at this time, the Mayor’s Office 

and City Council Office anticipate that staff could use this technology in the future, as 
former Mayors’ staff has done.

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact as the software merely aggregates publicly 

available Twitter posts and mentions. 
 

•  Tweets complied by Tweetdeck potentially collect all Tweets responding to 

designated search criteria that are Public (see definition below) and Protected Tweets 
if a City account follows that person. In each case, staff would only be able to see 
information that a person has chosen to release publicly on their Twitter account, in 
accordance with Twitter’s Terms and Conditions. Obviously, the search also only 
applies to people who use Twitter, and only those who include identifiable 
information on their account (some accounts, for example, are anonymous, use a nom 
de plume or, perhaps more appropriately, nom de guerre). 
 
Impacts to privacy would likely not be felt by any individual, as a simple search of 
one’s Twitter profile shows all Tweets, likes, retweets, and other activity from a user 
over the course of that profile’s existence, and Tweetdeck would not provide any 
additional information than could be found during such a search. 
 

•  Additional information from Twitter: 
 

o  What is the difference between public and protected Tweets? 

▪  When you sign up for Twitter, your Tweets are public by default; 

▪ 

anyone can view and interact with your Tweets. Should you choose to 
protect your Tweets, you can do so through your account settings.  
If you protect your Tweets, you’ll receive a request when new people 
want to follow you, which you can approve or deny. Accounts that 
began following you before you protected your Tweets will still be 
able to view and interact with your protected Tweets unless you block 
them.  
o  Who can see my Tweets? 

▪  Public Tweets (the default setting): Are visible to anyone, whether or 

not they have a Twitter account.

BRIC Omega Dashboard 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  BRIC Omega Dashboard is the Intel portal for Boston Regional Intelligence Center 

(BRIC). The BRIC works at the forefront of intelligence collection and analysis. The 
BRIC allows for a regional approach to analyze whether crimes are interconnected by 
geography, type, or method.  The BRIC covers the Metro Boston Homeland Security 
Region (MBHSR), consisting of: Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, 
Quincy, Revere, Somerville, Winthrop, The Greater Boston Police Council (Boston 
Area Police Emergency Radio Network—BAPERN), Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), and 
Metro Fire Association.  
 
In order to have the most complete accounting of what crimes and trends are 
impacting the region, it is necessary for all cities and towns, including Cambridge to 
contribute intelligence information. As such, the Cambridge Police Department 
contributes the following information: Approved arrest reports and Field Interview 
and Observation (FIO) reports for certain cases (Confidential items, i.e., specifically 
marked domestic, juvenile, and sexual assault reports are excluded).

Intelligence information is fundamental to the prevention of crime and violence. The 
use of regional intelligence enables CPD to make better informed decisions to combat 
crime and terrorism committed by individuals and organizations. Intelligence also 
helps with decisions pertaining to the deployment of resources throughout the City 
and region. 

•  The BRIC frequently produces Officer Safety and Public Safety bulletins. Crime is 
not an isolated phenomena and Cambridge does not exist in a vaccuum; therefore, it 
is necessary for Cambridge to understand crime as it occurs throughout the region, as 
any crime committed in the region has the potential to impact crime and safety in 
Cambridge.   

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Crime Analysis Unit and Criminal Investigation Division: The BRIC Omega 

Dashboard’s usage and access is limited to members of the Procedural Justice Section 
(Crime Analysis) and the Criminal Investigation Divisions; as the Department 
analyzes and investigates criminal activity.  
 

•  Access to the BRIC Omega Dashboard (by personnel outside of the CPD) is 

determined by the BRIC. 
 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
•  Anytime that large amounts of intelligence information are gathered, significant 

privacy implications exist. The BRIC maintains a strict policy designed to “protect 
individual privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and other protected interests”.2 

o  The 43-page policy states [in part]: The BRIC will not seek or retain and 

originating agencies will agree to not submit information about individuals or 
organizations solely on the basis of their religious, political, or social views or 
activities; their participation in a particular noncriminal organization or lawful 
event; or their races, ethnicities, citizenship, places of origin, ages, disabilities, 
genders, or sexual orientation. 
 

•  The Cambridge Police are committed to responsibly accessing regional systems in 
manners that are consistent with Cambridge values and in compliance with its 
ordinances and practices. Based on its current usage and the significant safeguards in

Coplink 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Nespin portal for exchange of criminal justice incident reports. 
•  COPLINK is one of the “solutions and services” provided through NESPIN (New 

England State Police Information Network®). COPLINK is a data sharing and crime 
analytics platform.  
 

•  NESPIN is the local arm of a national project known as the RISS Program (Regional 
Information Sharing Systems). The goal of RISS is to assist local, state, federal and 
tribal Criminal Justice partners by providing adaptive solutions and services that 
facilitate information sharing, support criminal investigations, and promote officer 
safety.3 NESPIN is one of only six RISS centers operating nationwide.  
 
In order to have the most complete accounting of what crimes and trends are 
impacting the region (statewide), it is necessary for all cities and towns, including 
Cambridge to contribute intelligence information. As such, the Cambridge Police 
Department contributes the following information: Approved arrest reports and Field 
Interview and Observation (FIO) reports for certain cases (Confidential items, i.e., 
specifically marked domestic, juvenile, and sexual assault reports are excluded).  

• 

•  Currently there are 280 cities and towns of the Commonwealth that contribute and 

utilize COPLINK.

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

•  As noted on its website, COPLINK is utilized by CPD personnel to improve officer 
and community safety, identify high concentration of crime in order to reduce crime 
and prioritize resource reallocation, identify crime trends as they occur in real-time, 
and develop data-driven tools to improve crime analysis and operational 
effectiveness. COPLINK has also proven useful in fulfilling requirements related to 
the issuance of License to Carry Firearms and background checks for Public Safety.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Crime Analysis and Criminal Investigation Division. 
•  Crime Analysis Unit and Criminal Investigation Division: typically access to 

COPLINK (via NESPIN) is reserved to those members of the department assigned to 
Crime Analysis and Criminal Investigations; however, there are times when other 
members may be granted access. Because COPLINK contains Criminal Offender 
Record Information (CORI), only authorized persons in the performance of their 
official duties may access, use or disseminate this information for official and lawful 
criminal justice purposes.  
 

•  Access to the COPLINK (by personnel outside of the CPD) is determined by the 

NESPIN/RISS.  

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  Anytime that large amounts of intelligence information are gathered, significant 
privacy implications exist. The NESPIN/RISS Centers operate their intelligence 
system under the Criminal Intelligence Systems Operating Policies (28 Code of 
Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 23). All RISS member agencies have agreed to 
comply with the requirements of 28 CFR Part 23 with respect to any criminal 
information they submit into an applicable RISS Criminal Intelligence Database 
(RISS/Intel). RISS has adopted a comprehensive privacy policy to protect individual 
privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and other protected interests.4

QED Records Management System 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  QED currently functions as CPD’s Record Management System (RMS). A records 

management system (RMS) is “an agency-wide system that provides for the storage, 
retrieval, retention, manipulation, archiving, and viewing of information, records, 
documents, or files pertaining to law enforcement operations. In this context, records 
are limited to documents or electronic files directly related to law enforcement 
operations such as incident and accident reports, arrests, citations, warrants, case 
management, field contacts, etc.”5 
 

•  Nearly all information that comes to the Department interacts with its RMS and it has 
implications for data collection for most all systems and processes, including but not 
limited to: Calls for service (Computer Aided Dispatch CAD), Incident Reporting, 
Investigative Case Management, Traffic Accident Reporting, Citations, Field 
Contacts, Pawns, Civil processes, Protective/Restraint Orders, Permits and Licences, 
etc.  
 

•  The Cambridge RMS satisfies the specifications required by the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (BJA).  According to the, “Standard Functional Specifications for Law 
Enforcement Records Management Systems (RMS)”6, published by the Bureau of 
Justice Assistance (BJA), a Law Enforcement RMS must: Allow for Single entry (i.e., 
no duplicate data entry), should automatically submit data to external sources as 
defined by the agency, enable the ability to enter and query narrative(s)/text fields, 
provide capability to access multiple systems from a single RMS workstation, create

logical edits, edit checks for all fields).  

o  Additionally, according to the BJA standards, an RMS should provide the 
capabilities for users to generate inquiries to internal and external data 
sources—such as state Department of Motor Vehicles and criminal history 
files, as well as the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)—from within 
each module where such inquiries make sense.  

o  It must also provide the user with the ability to reuse and/or import data 

returned from external sources to eliminate redundant data entry. 

 

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  A records management system (RMS) is an agency-wide system that provides for the 
storage, retrieval, retention, manipulation, archiving, and viewing of information, 
records, documents, or files pertaining to law enforcement operations. In this context, 
records are limited to documents or electronic files directly related to law 
enforcement operations such as incident and accident reports, arrests, citations, 
warrants, case management, field contacts, etc. 
 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  QED is utilized by the entire Department. QED gathers information from several 

areas throughout the department and Public Safety Systems.  

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  Anytime that large amounts of intelligence information are gathered, significant 
privacy implications exist. QED serves as the central report writing and incident 
documentation system for the Department. The Department is required by state and 
federal law, as well as court procedural rules to document a variety of police 
encounters, whether for criminal, civil or administrative matters.  

•  The Cambridge Police Department is committed to responsibly maintaining systems 
in manners that are consistent with Cambridge values and in compliance with its 
ordinances and practices. Only CJIS Compliant Certified Public Safety Employees in 
the performance of their official duties may access, use or disseminate information 
contained in QED for official and lawful criminal justice purposes. Based on its 
current usage and the significant safeguards in place, this technology has a minimal 
privacy impact on Cantabrigians and surrounding communities.

Management System Data.  The database is used to “clean up” or to keep a more 
accurate record of the data that comes into the Records Management System (RMS) 
(i.e., initially an entry may be coded as a Larceny Motor Vehicle (L-MV) but through 
investigation it is determined to be a House Break where a L-MV also occurred—this 
database accurately reflects the appropriate Uniform Crime Reporting/National 
Incident-Based Reporting System code). 
•  Access database of corrected RMS Data 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

•  This database is a condensed and corrected accounting of QED incidents for purposes 

of crime incident statistical reporting. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Access to this database is limited to members of Crime Analysis Unit. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  CLEAR® is a Public Records search engine. For a fee, CLEAR’s database provides 
access to thousands of data sets including, address, phone numbers, billing (utilities, 
etc.) and credit-related information through public records and publically available 
sources. According to its website:  

o  “Thomson Reuters CLEAR® is powered by billions of data points and 

leverages cutting-edge public records technology to bring all key content 
together in a customizable dashboard. Locate hard-to-find information and 
quickly identify potential concerns associated with people and businesses to 
determine if further analysis is needed. The user-friendly platform was

•  Typically, this technology is reserved for members assigned to the Criminal 

Investigations Section.  

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  Anytime large quantities of data and information are accessed, even when those 
data/information are publicly available, significant privacy implications exist. 
Thomson Reuters’ CLEAR boast providing access to “billions of data points and 
thousands of datasets”. Thompson Reuters is a private, for-profit company that 
provides its service for a fee. The Cambridge Police Department is committed to 
responsibly accessing this service in a manner that is consistent with Cambridge’s 
values. The likelihood of disparately impacting a particular population via using this 
technology is small, as it has broad uses, aimed at providing information to assist the 
Department in providing services for those who have been harmed and locating those 
who have caused the harm.  
 

•  CLEAR is subscription-based and access to certain levels of information is governed 
by the user’s level of subscription. In addition to accessing these public records to 
gather information on criminal suspects, the Department utilizes CLEAR to locate 
victims, witnesses and to verify background information on applicants (Public Safety 
Employment or License to Carry Firearms (LTC)). Through the Department’s Legal 
Advisor, it has been confirmed that CPD does not have subscription access to 
advance features such as CLEAR LPR which contains information obtained via 
License Plate Recognition Technology.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

 

•  CPD currently has access to 5 licenses furnished to the Department by the Urban 

Area Security Initiative (UASI) at no cost to the agency. Information as to actual cost 
was not furnished by UASI.

Focused Deterrence Database 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Algorithm to analyze RMS data   
•  The Focused Deterrence Database uses an algorithm to analyze Records Management 
System (RMS) data based on past arrest and incident reports. The database algorithm 
identifies individuals who most recently have caused or been the subject of (i.e., 
victim/survivor) the greatest social harm and could currently benefit from social 
services and a case manager (offender or victim/survivor).  CPD reaches out to 
individuals identified through the Database to offer them the option of joining the 
Focused Deterrence Program.  
 

•  “Focused Deterrence” in terms of policing is a strategy that aims to deter specific 
criminal behavior through fear of specific sanctions, as well as anticipation of 
benefits for not engaging in crime. In its initial iteration here in Cambridge, Focused 
Deterrence closely resembled this. There have always been “variants” of the Focused 
Deterrence program in practice; here in Cambridge, Focused Deterrence has morphed 
into an altogether different program.  

•  Focused Deterrence in Cambridge does not utilize a predictive policing program, 

through the Focused Deterrence Database or otherwise. The department does not have 
a “gang database” (or any semblance thereof) and instead pulls information directly 
from the CPD RMS.  

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Assisting those who have most recently been the subject of the greatest amount of 

social harm and who could currently benefit from social services.

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Crime Analysis Unit and Focussed Deterrence Unit 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact as it analyzes existing incident reports from the 
Department’s Records Management System.RMS. The Department is required by 
state and federal law, as well as court procedural rules to document a variety of police 
encounters, whether for criminal, civil or administrative matters. The algorithm 
utilizes factors such as “role” played and “when” the incident occurred (allowing for 
a decaying weighted analysis). Additionally, crimes are weighted in strict accordance 
with Massachusetts Sentencing Guidelines.  
 

•  The Department is committed to responsibly utilizing data in a way that is protective 
of privacy, civil rights and civil liberties. The potential for a widespread or disparate 
impact is limited; currently 6 individuals are in the Focused Deterrence program. As a 
point of reference, the Focused Deterrence database was not utilized for the 
2019/2020 Focused Deterrence firearms violence program. Involved parties were 
identified through RMS arrest and firearms incident reports from the previous three 
years.  
 

5. What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 
ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  There is no cost associated with this technology; two CPD Detectives are assigned to 

this program in addition to their other duties/responsibilities.   

•  None.

•  This technology has a minimal impact as the Department only has access to 

information about those individuals who are Cambridge residents that are on federal 
probation. The information is accessed via restricted web site for official use only and 
provided through federally managed application/portal. Only CJIS Compliant 
Certified Public Safety Employees in the performance of their official duties may 
access, use or disseminate information contained in LENS for official and lawful 
criminal justice purposes. The LENS web site informs users that “…Unauthorized use 
is subject to prosecution under Title 18 of the U.S. Code”, and that “…all activities 
and access attempts are logged”.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  There are no costs to CPD, the program is federally managed and funded. None.

GPS Tracking Devices (2) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Location tracking through satellite triangulation 
• 

  Global Positioning System (GPS) is a technology that makes possible exact 
location tracking through satellite trilateration (sometimes mistakenly refered to as 
triangulation) using a network of satellites orbiting the Earth. The satellites are able to 
communicate with specialized receivers on the ground, providing the exact location 
of the receiver.  
 

•  The CPD possess and utilizes two of these receivers to assist in certain criminal 
investigations (thefts of bicycles and pacakages).  A GPS device is attached to a 
bicycle or package that might be stolen and, if a theft occurs, CPD tracks the item. 

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

•  While the privacy implications for tracking individuals and items using GPS are 
wide-ranging; the technology as currently employed by the Cambridge Police 
Department should have no privacy impact because it is only utilized to track 
property (bikes/packages) stolen from the Cambridge Police Department. 

•  This technology should have no privacy impact since it is utilized to track property 

(bikes/packages) stolen from the Cambridge Police Department. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  The initial purchase price of this equipment was not available.

Shotspotter 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Gun shot detection system 
•  Shotspotter is a gun shot detection system.  Gun shot detection systems are designed 
to be an ever-vigilant reporting ear. In many neighborhoods across the country, 
residents have become so immune to the sound of gunshots that many incidents go 
unreported—many criminals count on this indifference and become emboldened in 
such environments. Gunshot detection systems provide a perpetual reporting ear and 
alert law enforcement of these incidents.  
 

•  Here is a diagram of how the location of gunfire is obtained using an acoustic 

triangulation system [this is meant to serve as an overview, not to provide highly 
detailed knowledge]: 

o  Because the speed of sound in air is a known entity—340.29 meters per 

second [.21 miles per second] at sea level—the difference in the time it takes 
for the sound/shockwave of a gunshot to reach three different sensors can 
determine the location of that gunshot. Using a built-in GPS system as an 
accurate time source, three sensors work together to triangulate the location 
from which a shot was fired (illustration below).  

Example: 

o  A shot is fired somewhere in the city. Sensor 1 picks up the sound of the shot. 
Since each acoustic sensor has a range of about 2 miles, we know that the shot 
was fired within a 2-mile radius of Sensor 1.

o  One second later, Sensor 2 picks up the sound waves of a gunshot. Based on 
the known speed of sound, we know that the shot was fired approximately 
one-fifth of a mile farther away from Sensor 2 than Sensor 1. We can draw a 
circle representing the perception radius of Sensor 2 overlapping the 
perception radius of Sensor1—since both sensors picked up the sound waves, 
the shot must have been fired within the overlapping coverage areas. Where 
the two circles intersect, we have two possible locations for our gunshot.  

o  To figure out which of these two points is the location from which the shot 

was fired, we need to find a third sensor that picked up the sound of the shot. 
A third sensor, located to the south of Sensors 1 and 2, picked up the sound 
waves a half-second after Sensor 2 detected them. This would put the origin of 
the sound about one-tenth of a mile farther from Sensor 3 than from Sensor 2.  

o  We now have our gunshot location [indicated in the above illustration as the 
point where all three circles intersect] at least in terms of distance from the 
sensors. The systems then use built-in GPS receivers to convert that known 
point into latitude and longitude coordinates, where it is converted into a

enforcement with the “exact” location.7 

•  CPD has no listening capabilities; sensors are analyzed at Shotspotter HQ in 

California.  Only incidents identified by Shotspotter’s proprietary algorithm as “in the 
class of gunshots” generate a numerical address sent to the Department via the 
application. No other audio is sent to or sought by CPD.   

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Deployed across the City with 12 sensors and a 1.1 square mile coverage area 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has minimal impact as it captures the sound of gunshots. CPD has no 
listening capabilities; sensors are analyzed at Shotspotter HQ in CA, only.  Only 
incidents identified by Shotspotter’s proprietary algorithm as “in the class of 
gunshots” aregenerate a numerical address sent to the Department via the application. 
No other audio is sent to or sought by CPD. The placement of microphones has not 
changed since the implementation of the technology; initial placement was based on 
prevelanceprevalence of gunfire or gunshot victims. CPD has the ability tocan request 
movement but the high concentration (relative to Cambridge) has persisted in the 
same area. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  The technology has a cost of approx. $50K /yr., which is funded by the Urban Area 
Security Initiative (UASI); the City would be responsible for continuing cost should 
the funding cease.

•  This technology has minimal impact as it is typically used for brief periods in public 

spaces that do not implicate constitutional protections.  

 

•  This technology is only used in constitutionally protected spaces with consent, a 

search warrant or exigent circumstances.  

o  Note: This technology has been/is used in protected spaces during 

investigations with third-party consent: (e.g., complainant thought that the 
presence of dead animals on multiple occasions may have been some type of 
threat; permission was given for CPD to place covert camera in protected 
space to capture image of culprit; it was determined that the dead animals 
were being placed by another animal).  
 

•  Equipment/software does not possess a “search” function and cannot record license 

plates or other personally identifying information other than images of the individuals 
themselves. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  unavailable.We have not been able to determine the cost of this technology.

MAVEN (Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  "MAVEN" is the Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network - a PHIN (Public 
Health Information Network) compliant, secure web-based surveillance and case 
management system for infectious diseases that enables rapid, efficient 
communication among local and state health departments and laboratories. MAVEN 
is an easy way to conduct case investigations and management while also decreasing 
paperwork. The system was purchased and developed in 2005 by MDPH and local 
health partners. The data in MAVEN goes back until approximately 1989 for the 
general epidemiology and vaccine preventable disease events. For tuberculosis, the 
data goes back to approximately 1993. 
 
Infectious disease surveillance is the routine collection, analysis, interpretation, and 
distribution of data in order to reduce morbidity and mortality through the 
control and/or prevention of disease. 
 

• 

•  M.G.L. c.111, §§ 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 94C, 109, 110, 110B, 111 and 112 define the 

responsibilities of the local boards of health and the Department of Public Health with 
respect to the reporting and control of diseases dangerous to the public health. M.G.L. 
c.111D, § 6, references the obligation of clinical laboratories to report infectious 
diseases to the Department.   
 

•  By state law, when a MA resident is diagnosed or has a suspected diagnosis of a 

reportable condition, their medical providers are required to report information about

the patient (when available, full demographic, clinical and epidemiologic information, 
as defined by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health) to the health 
department. At this point in time, most of these reports are automatically sent by 
laboratories and providers electronically to the state health department through 
MAVEN; they can also report information via fax or phone to either the state health 
department or their local health department, where staff then enter this information 
into MAVEN by hand. Reporting is mandated by the state for certain conditions. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  "MAVEN" is the Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network - a PHIN (Public 
Health Information Network) compliant, secure web-based surveillance and case 
management system for infectious diseases that enables rapid, efficient 
communication among local and state health departments and laboratories. MAVEN 
is an easy way to conduct case investigations and management while also decreasing 
paperwork. The system was purchased and developed in 2005 by MDPH and local 
health partners. The data in MAVEN goes back until approximately 1989 for the 
general epidemiology and vaccine preventable disease events. For tuberculosis, the 
data goes back to approximately 1993. 
 
Infectious disease surveillance is the routine collection, analysis, interpretation, and 
distribution of data in order to reduce morbidity and mortality through the 
control and/or prevention of disease. 
 

•  Surveillance data is used to: 

o  Monitor disease trends over time 
o  Rapidly detect increases in disease occurrence 
o  Implement control measures 
o  Identify high-risk groups 
o  Allocate resources & guide public health policy and action 

•  There are approximately 90 notifiable infectious diseases that have a required 

 

response.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The Cambridge Public Health Department has been using MAVEN since its inception 
in 2005. Access is limited by a user's roles and groups, so, by default, CPHD users 
can see only Cambridge residents’ information. Within CPHD, only those staff who

are required to use MAVEN to conduct infectious disease surveillance work have 
access to the system. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The information collected in MAVEN is considered protected health information 

(PHI) under HIPAA. HIPAA specifically allows public health reporting and access to 
PHI for public health activities without requiring an individual's authorization.  

•  Access to MAVEN is limited by a user's roles and groups, so, by default, CPHD users 
can see only Cambridge residents’ information. Within CPHD, only those staff who 
are required to use MAVEN to conduct infectious disease surveillance work have 
access to the system. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  MAVEN is managed and maintained by the Office of Integrated Surveillance and 

Informatics Services at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which funds 
MAVEN. CPHD staff use MAVEN to do state-mandated infectious disease 
investigations, but are not involved in the initial or ongoing maintenance of the 
system.

Technology: 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

 

•  Cameras are installed on all school buses, including buses for special education 

students, along with a posted notice that video recording is taking place.  
 

•  The cameras on the school buses allow usthe school department to review any 

incidents that take place, after the event is over.  The cameras allow usthe department 
to determine the source of any behavioral outburstsissues on the bus, many of which 
take place out of the line of sight of the bus driver. 

• 

Images and audio are recorded to a box, and the images & audio are retrieved 
manually by the Transportation Director when investigating an incident.   

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Supporting the safety of all students and staff on bus transportation by addressing 

disruptive behavior appropriately. 
 

•  These cameras provide footage of any behavioral issues that may occur on school 

buses.  The footage helps CPS staff and parents clarify what actually happened during 
an incident and supplements any report from a student or bus driver.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  All school buses have carried these on board cameras since their original installation 

in FY13.

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
•  The data from these cameras is not maintained, but is over-recorded at monthly 

intervals.  Without physically retrieving the imaginingimaging data from the bus, it is 
not accessible to anyone. 
 

•  For all students riding the busses their images and voices are recorded and saved to 

the device located on each bus.  

•  The recordings are secure and only accessed by the CPS Transportation Director in 
the event of an event investigation. At that time the recordings may be reviewed by 
select CPS Administrators. In some cases, parents can view the footage, but only of 
their child. All other students are blurred.  

•  All data, unless otherwise archived, is overwritten every 30 days.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  The initial cost of the SEON camera system was $47,190 when it was installed in the 

•  There have been ongoing maintenance expenditures for moving equipment to newer 

buses, and adding cameras as needed.  

spring of 2013. 
 

o  FY14 $4,955 
o  FY16 $12,500 

 

• 

It is not possible to determine the personnel costs of using this equipment.  The 
Transportation Director must board a bus after an incident and download the images 
in order to proceed with an investigation, but it is difficult to quantify the time 
involved. 
 

•  Both equipment and personnel were funded from the School Department General 

Fund.

Securly for Chromebooks Web Filter 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

 

•  Securly for Chromebooks is employed as a web filter only on all CPS Chromebooks. 
The filter is a Chrome plugin that is managed and deployed at the Google Domain 
level to all CPS owned Chromebooks. One this is setup it requires no other 
maintenance. The web filter will block sites that are considered potentially unsafe or 
harmful to students.  

•  Securly blocks the following categories of content; Pornography, Drugs, Gambling, 
Other Adult Content, Social Media, Anonymous Proxies, Chat Messaging, Hate, 
Social Networking, Streaming Media and Games. There is also a Keyword blocking 
as well. These are “Generic” filter settings established by Securly.  

•  CRLS Adminstrators, faculty and students are currently having productive 

• 

discussions around the acceptable level of filtering in CRLS. Any recommendations 
of the web filter settings made by CRLS Administration will be implemented.  
 Securly and logs browser activity whether in school or off campus. The web browser 
log collects web site addresses that were allowed and those that were blocked by each 
Chromebook, along with the student, or staff, ID of the individualthat is using the 
Chromebook.  

•  The filter is a Chrome plugin that is managed and deployed at the Google Domain 
level to all CPS owned Chromebooks. Once this is setup it requires no other 
maintenance by CPS. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Maintaining the safety and security of City employees, students, customers, and City-

owned or controlled buildings 
•  Enforcing obligations to the City

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Securly was implemented Fall 2017 
•  On all CPS owned Chromebooks. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The web filter on the school school-issued Chromebooks is the same whether used in 
school or not. The filter logs the user of the Chromebooks as well as web sites that are 
allowed or blocked. The logs of this activity are only accessible by CPS Senior IT.  

•  Securly is bound via a Student Data Privacy Agreement to NOT reuse any student 
level data for any other purpose other than the Filtering Service for which CPS 
engaged Securly.  

 
•  All vendor provided provided-applications employed by the school department that 
may, or do, collect student student-level data are protected against inappropriate use 
of student data by the vendor via a valid executedthrough Student Data Privacy 
Agreements (DPA). These agreements ensure that any and all student- level data 
collected is only used for the purpose of providing the service the vendor was 
engaged for, and nothing else. All school department DPAs are available hereavailable 
on the CPS website.1  . The DPAs employed by CPS are both a MA State and 
National Model DPA developed by the Student Data Privacy ConsortiumStudent Data 
Privacy Consortium2 and leveraged throughout the K12 Educational Technology 
Marketplace to protect student data from inappropriate uses.  

 
•  All students and parents are advised through Chromebook user agreements that the 

Securly web filter will be employed both in school and off campus.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  CPS employs the free version of Securly, which is onlyonly includes the filter 

functions. There are other value addAdditional functionality is available for a cost. 
Once the Securly Chrome add on is configured at the domain level there is no 
additional ongoing maintenance required.

Traffic Signal Detection Cameras 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The traffic detection units each consist of a video camera device which is mounted 
approximately 10 feet above one of the traffic signal mast arms at an intersection.  
There are two types of cameras: 

o  MioVision SmartLink 360 cameras 
o  Iteris directional detection cameras 

 

•  The MioVision units are mounted in a location that allows visibility towards all 

approaches to the intersection and provide detection of users in all directions from a 
single device. The Iteris units are mounted for each approach where intersection 
detection is required and provide for detection of users from one roadway approach. 
 

•  The camera communicatesBoth types of cameras communicate a video feed via the 

hardwire signal conduit to the signal control cabinet at the intersection, where a video 
processing unit is installed. The video processing unit analyzes the video feed on-site 
in order to count and classify roadway users approaching the intersection by their 
transportation mode type and direction of travel.  

•  The MioVision Cameras and supporting software and hardware originally included 

the ability to collect video by plugging a laptop into the processing unit located in the 
traffic control cabinet at the intersection or to stream video upon demand to the cloud 
for access through an online portal. Use of captured video is needed from time to time 
to ensure proper functionality of the system to recognize and count vehicles, cyclists 
and pedestrians.

•  At our request, MioVision has changed the default settings so that the City cannot 

collect video at the control cabinet or stream video to the cloud. Only the Vendor will 
be able to collect video in the field or stream data to the cloud. The vendor has agreed 
in writing that they will do so only under specific circumstances and will notify the 
City in advance of streaming or collecting any data. They have also agreed to delete 
all captured video within 30 days. The circumstances agreed upon include: capture 
video for training purposes, capture video for intersection detection accuracy 
validation, capture video specifically to validate a solution to a problem at the 
intersection, and capture video to analyze and detect/root-cause a problem at the 
intersection.  
 

•  The Iteris cameras do not have the ability to stream or record video as configured. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of this technology is to analyze and manage service delivery, in this case 
operation of traffic signals and counting vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. The 
technology provides detection of roadway users, to classify their mode of 
transportation, and to quantify their movements at signalized intersections in the City 
of Cambridge. The aggregated data collected will beis analyzed and used to improve 
the efficiency and safety of operations for all roadway users. The technology will also 
provideprovides City staff with continuous roadway user counts to allow for 
evaluation of seasonal and annual traffic volume variations to assist in future design 
and planning projects.  
 

•  The processed data collected will beis used for two purposes: 

o  Traffic detection – this process provides a notification to the traffic signal 
controller requesting to call or extend a signal phase to allow for dynamic 
signal phasing that adapts to changes in the number of roadway users present. 

o  Traffic counts – providing continuous counts of roadway users traveling 

through the intersection. Counts are broken out by movement (i.e., direction 
of approach and turn or straight movement through the intersection) and by 
transportation mode type (i.e., truck, bus, vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian)). 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  MioVison Intersection Cameras were deployed in the field in the Fall of 2019 at 

multiple signalized intersections across the City.

•  MioVision Cameras will be installed at additional locations as funding becomes 

available.  
Iteris cameras have been installed at isolated locations over the past three years. 

• 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
•  We expectTPT expects that the impact on privacy will be minimal, for the following 

reasons: 

o  The cameras do not have sufficient resolution to provide personally 
identifiable details in the video such as faces or license plates. 

o  While video streaming and collection is used in an extremely limited and 
controlled manner as indicated abovebelow, the core functionality of the 
technology operates through real-time processing of lower resolution video 
data, resulting in non-identifiable discrete data on number of users and 
deletion of video in real time on-site.  

The impacts of recording the location of individuals, even at lower 
resolutions, will be primarily mitigated by tight controls over when video is 
recorded or streamed.   
 

•  The MioVision Cameras and supporting software and hardware originally included 
the ability for the City to collect video by plugging a laptop into the processing unit 
located in the traffic control cabinet at the intersection or to stream video upon 
demand to the cloud for access through an online portal. Use of captured video is 
needed from time to time to ensure proper functionality of the system to recognize 
and count vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians.  
 

•  At our request, MioVision has changed the default settings so that the City cannot 
collect video at the control cabinet or stream video to the cloud. Only the vendor, 
MioVision, will be able to collect video in the field or stream data to the cloud.  The 
City will have no access to the video. The vendor has agreed in writing that they will 
do so only under specific circumstances and will request permission from the City in 
advance of streaming or collecting any data. They have also agreed to delete all 
captured video within 30 days. The circumstances agreed upon include: capture video 
for training purposes, capture video for intersection detection accuracy validation, 
capture video specifically to validate a solution to a problem at the intersection, and 
capture video to analyze and detect/root-cause a problem at the intersection.  
 

•  The Iteris cameras do not have the ability to stream or record video as configured.

MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  
 
•  MioVision Scout is a portable, battery operated, traffic video collection unit.  It is a 
standalone unit that is deployed in the field for unattended traffic video collection,. 
Video is collected over a series of days and stored in the Scout unit on a digital 
storage card.  At the end of the data collection period, the unit is removed and data is 
taken from the storage card and processed for traffic data. Additionally, Scout units 
have the capability of detecting and recording MAC addresses from devices searching 
for wireless networks within their range.  MAC addresses and timestamps are then 
transmitted to a central system. The central system then looks to see if the same MAC 
address has been recorded previously by other units and uses any matches to establish 
travel times. During deployment, the units also communicate wirelessly for 
monitoring purposes, but do not stream data. 
 

•  Additionally, there is an optional “Connect” component that can be added to Scout 

units that allows the unit to communicate wirelessly for monitoring purposes (but not 
to stream data) and has the capability of detecting MAC addresses from devices 
searching for wireless networks within their range. With the added ‘Connect” 
functionality, the Scout Unit can detect devices within an 80-100 foot radius of the 
unit.  The Scout Unit uses MD5 hash function to produce a 128 bit hash value for 
each MAC address, pseudonymizing the MAC addresses. This process is 
unidirectional and cannot be reversed, but the MAC addresses remain unique and 
matchable. These hashed addresses and timestamps are stored in the unit during the 
data collection period then transmitted to a central system operated by the vendor, 
MioVision. The central system then looks to see if the same hashed MAC address has 
been recorded previously by other scout units in the vicinity and in the same time 
frame and uses any matches to establish travel times.

•  The City of Cambridge does not own or plan to purchase Scout Units.  However, the 
units are used regularly by traffic engineering and transportation planning consultants 
in order to collect traffic data in Cambridge to complete Traffic Impact Studies and 
other transportation related studies. In the future, the City of Cambridge may contract 
with consulting or data collection firms to collect data, and in turn those firms may 
use Scout units to collect data on behalf of the City.  

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of this technology is to analyze and manage service delivery, in this case 
collecting traffic video and data that is later processed to provide a variety of traffic 
related data such as turning movement counts, intersection counts and classifications, 
road volume counts, and travel times.   

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

 
•  These units are deployed in the field, at various locations on a temporary basis. The 
units are typically attached to a signal, utility, or streetlight pole within the right of 
way. TheyThe boxes are locked and inaccessible during deployment.  

•  Deployment is based on the need for transportation data for use in a transportation 

study, traffic impact study, or other transportation related data analysis.   

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  MioVision Scout units records Videorecord video at 720 x 480 resolution. This 

standard resolution video offers limited personal information and does not include 
license plate reading ability, limiting privacy impacts. In addition, all video 
recordings will be done within the public right of way.   

•  While data collection is used across the City, it is possible that data collection, and 
thus video recording, will occur most frequently in areas with significant new 
development, thus possibly impacting these areas more than parts of the City with 
less development.   

•  The impacts of the collection of MAC addresses are mitigated to a great extent by the 
use of the MD5 pseudonymization process. There is no personally identifiable data 
remaining in the hashed MAC address, and the process is not reversible.  However, 
because the hashing process will always return the same hashed value for any given 
MAC address- as required to ensure the data remains unique and matchable- some

risk remains. If someone knew the exact time a wireless device was at a specific 
location and accessed the hashed data, they could identify the hash value and then 
find other instances where the Scout unit has recorded that same hashed MAC 
address.  We can further mitigate this risk by requiring that all hashed MAC 
addresses collected within in Cambridge be destroyed once the data has been used to 
establish travel times. We can do this through the proposed permitting process 
mentioned below.  

• 

In the past, consultants have deployed Scout units in Cambridge without approval 
from the City.  Moving forward, the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department 
will implement a permitting system that will require pre-approval for all deployments.  
The permit will require that all deployments meet certain data security and data 
retention requirements.   

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  All costs associated with the use of MioVision Scout Units are paid by private 

 

consultants and/or developers.

Automated Meter Reading System (AMR) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The Water Department’s AMR system is a radio-based system which transmits on a 
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) licensed/reserved frequency.  Meter 
Transmitter Units (MTUs) are attached to every water meter throughout the city. The 
MTU transmits water meter reads in a propriety format.  These reads are transmitted 
every 4 hours on a floating schedule.  For example, an MTU will transmit a read 
today at 6:00AM, and then transmit a read tomorrow at 6:03AM.  The reads are 
received by the Data Collection Units (DCUs) located within the city. The DCUs 
transmit the meter readings, using a cell phone network, to a communications 
computer located at the Water Department.  The communications computer then 
transfers the data to a database computer which translates the data in order for the city 
to view the water meter reads.  This allows the Water Department to provide actual 
reads for billing and allows us to alert customers for potential leaks at their property.    
Below is an example of our STAR AMR software and the data collected:

•  The AMR System allows the Water department to provide actual reads for billing and 

allows us to alert customers of potential leaks in their property. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Meter Transmitter Units (MTUs) are attached to every water meter/building 

throughout the city and the deployment started in 2004.  Several Data Collection 
Units (DCUs) located within the city were installed in 2004. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  None, there has been no impact.   
•  Every property that has a water service has a water meter regardless of any other 

criteria, and the AMR system only gathers information regarding water usage. This 
allows CWD to provide actual reads for billing and to alert all customers of any 
potential leaks in their property. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  Initial costs – The original implementation cost onin 2004 was approximately 

$4,000,000.  

o  We are nearing completion of an upgrade of the AMR system to replace all 
the MTUs because the batteries reached their life expectancy.  The MTU 
replacement cost was $1,545,600 and the full value of the installation contract 
is $1,102,500.   

o  We also have a contract to upgrade the DCUs and software for $48,380. 

 

•  Ongoing maintenance – The Water Department has an annual maintenance 

agreement for approximately $15,000.   

•  Personnel costs – personnel costs related to reading water meters have gone down 

related towith the implementation of the AMR. 

•  Source of funds – Capital Water Funds for upgrade, Operating Water FunsFunds for 

the annual maintenance agreement.

•  Using water meter data from the Department’s AMR system, water customers will be 
able to view their own daily water usage on-line to promote conservation and detect 
water leaks.  The data will be stored on a remote server, hosted by our vendor.  The 
individual data will be accessible through the City’s web page and access will be 
protected by individual account log-in security which will be approved by our IT 
Department.  

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Water customers will be able to view their daily water usage on-line to promote 

conservation and detect increased usage and/or water leaks. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Through the City’s web page.   

•  The go live date is contingent on the city and vendor signing a contract.  The 
implementation is projected to take 4 months from the kick off meeting. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  None.  
•  Every property that has a water service has a water meter regardless of any other

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the

Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER

The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on

quality development consistent with development along the Binney Street corridor. 
 
The provisions of Section 20.1000, which would be subject to special permit approval by the Planning 
Board, would require the conveyance to the City by fee or easement of a strip of land along the Grand 
Junction rail corridor to be used for a public pathway, and would allow development on other identified 
parcels of land referred to as 303 and 345 Binney Street for uses otherwise allowed in the base Industry 
A-1 district, with a maximum building height of 105 feet along Binney Street and 60 feet in the 
Transition Zone, a maximum floor area ratio of 2.5 multiplied by the area of the industrially zoned 
portion of the development parcel and 1.25 multiplied by the area of the balance of the development 
parcel, and provisions related to gross floor area exemptions, setbacks, parking, and other matters.

APP-4 
IN CITY COUNCIL 
February 24, 2020 

20.50 
20.51   

HARVARD SQUARE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND HARVARD SQUARE HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT 
Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Harvard Square Overlay District, 
the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District, and Harvard Square Conservation District Goals 
and Guidelines which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this 
Section 20.50. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to an area 
described generally as the Harvard Square business district and certain abutting portions of 
the neighborhoods around it. 

20.51.1   The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on the Zoning 

Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square Historic Overlay 
District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay district that is encompassed 
by any historic district duly established by the City Council under the authority granted 
by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts or any Neighborhood Conservation District established by the City 
Council under the provisions of chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. All 
provisions of the Harvard Square Overlay District and all references to it in this 
Ordinance shall apply equally to the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District except as 
set forth below.  

General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning 
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to the 
Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more careful 
public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban form of the 
Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the extreme development 
pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique functional environment and 
visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the functional impacts of new development 
on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to maintain the present diversity of development 
and open space patterns and building scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory 
flexibility to advance the general purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility 
granted to development within the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to 
facilitate the protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of 
Harvard Square while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate 
contemporary changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. 
General Provisions.  

The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special planning 
concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, Development 
Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development Consultation Procedure 
specified in Article 19.40 except that any Large Project Review (new buildings of 2,000 
square feet or more) shall be conducted by the Harvard Square Advisory Committee 
using procedures specified in Subsection 20.54.1 of this Section 20.50.

complied from the Guidelines for Development and Historic Preservation as contained 
in the Final Report of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study 
Committee, dated November 29, 2000 and the Harvard Square Development 
Guidelines, 1986], in addition to the requirements of Sections 10.30 (Variances) and 
10.40 (Special Permits) and this Section 20.50. These guidelines are also intended to 
assist in shaping any contemplated physical change within the Harvard Square Overlay 
District  

following definitions shall apply:

for the National Register of Historic Places as determined by the Secretary of the 
Department of the Interior.

District as determined by the Secretary of the Department of Interior; or  

b.  A building located outside a National Register District but identified as a 
contributing building in the Harvard Square Development Guidelines, 
Community Development Department, July 1, 1986.  

However, a building shall no longer be considered a contributing building as defined in 
this Subsection 20.53.3(b) for the purposes of this Section 20.50 if, upon application for 
a demolition permit, the Cambridge Historical Commission shall determine the building 
not to be a preferably preserved significant building as defined in the City of Cambridge 
Demolition Ordinance. 

Advisory Committee, with members appointed by the City Manager, which shall have the 
following duties, responsibilities, and membership.

official actions fulfill the following purposes.  
a.  To establish a formal, ongoing body that will review all major development 

actions in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  

b.  To provide a forum within which a wide range of perspectives on development 

actions can be heard.  

c.   To support local businesses and uses that enhance the vibrancy and historical 
nature of Harvard Square with the aspirational goal of maintaining a seventy 
percent local and non-formula retail experience throughout the district, at the 
ground floor level. 

d.   To establish a citizen/professional body which can advise both public agencies 
and private interests as to the development and urban design issues raised by a 
development or planning proposal and suggest avenues of research which 
might be pursued to resolve identified conflicts or make the project better 
fulfill both public and private objectives for the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

2.  Responsibilities. The Committee shall undertake all Large Project Reviews and shall 

receive all applications for variances and special permits for activities within the

Committee may comment on any preliminary proposal for which any public agency 
or private interest has planned for the Overlay. The Committee shall meet on an 
approximately monthly basis or with as much frequency as is needed to address 
pertinent issues in the Harvard Square Overlay District, with the schedule to be 
determined at the discretion of the Chair. 

3.  Procedures.  

a.  Within six (6) months preceding any application for (1) a building permit for 

any project subject to Large Project Development Consultation Review or (2) 
a special permit or variance for any project within the Harvard Square 
Overlay District, the graphic and other material required in Section 19.43.2 - 
Application for a Large Project Review shall be submitted to the Harvard 
Square Advisory Committee for their review and comment.  

b.  Within thirty (30) days of that submittal, [or within up to sixty (60) days with 
the written consent of the applicant] the Committee shall prepare a written 
report of findings and recommendations with respect to the applicant's 
proposed project.  

c.  The Committee's written report shall outline the urban design and development 
issues raised by the proposal. It shall suggest those areas within which 
additional exploration of alternatives might be sought or factual information 
gathered which might help to resolve potential conflicts between the public 
and private objectives or which help to shape the project to better serve these 
objectives.  

d.  The report shall be forwarded to the applicant and shall be included in any 

application for a building permit, special permit or variance.  

e.  It is expected that, in making decisions regarding special permits and variances 
within the Overlay District, the Planning Board and/or Zoning Board of 
Appeal will give due consideration to the report and recommendations of the 
Advisory Committee. Where the Committee makes recommendations with 
respect to the granting of special permits and/or variances, and the Planning 
Board and/or Zoning Board of Appeal does not follow said 
recommendations, then the Board(s) shall make written reply to the 
Committee, detailing why the Board(s)'s decisions were different from the 
Committee recommendations.

year period. 

20.54.2   Building Height Limitations. The maximum height of buildings in the Harvard Square 

Overlay District shall be governed by the requirements of this Section 20.54.2; however,

Allowed Special Permit exceptions to upper floor setbacks must successfully reduce 
the overall negative effect of multiple floor setbacks and enhance both the proposed 
building silhouette and townscape of the block. Such architectural elements as 
pergolas, and occupiable corner pavilions, raised pediment above the main building 
entry, and special features that animate the public domain experience. All such 
exceptions are to be limited in scope. 
All approved facade setbacks are to provide accessible, useable balconies for 
tenants. 

Residential Districts.  
1.  Any retail use (4.35) allowed in the Business B zoning districts, as of right, within the 
Overlay may also be allowed as of right in any office or residential zone within the 
Overlay provided the structure that contains the use has a main entrance on 
Massachusetts Avenue, Mt. Auburn Street, Arrow Street or Bow Street. For all other 
lots, the Planning Board may allow by special permit the retail use of a lot or 
structure all or partially within the Harvard Square Overlay District and in a base 
residential or office district where retail uses are not permitted under the provisions 
of Section 4.30 - Table of Use Regulations; provided, however, that the following 
conditions are met:  
a.  The general purposes of this Section 20.50 are met.  
b.  The use will be located in a structure in existence as of June 1, 1985.  
c.  The addition of such use(s) will assist in the preservation, rehabilitation and/or 
restoration of a National Register or contributing building or important open 
space by increasing the economic feasibility of maintaining such features.  

d.  The preservation of the buildings and open space identified in (c) above is 

assured through an approved mechanism for the full period that the special 
permit is in force and effect.  

e.  The proposed use will preserve, rehabilitate or restore the outward appearance 

f.  In its operation the use will not, in impact, be significantly different from the 

of the structure or open space.  

uses permitted in the base district.  

Packet Pg. 222

2.4

g.  The use is completely contained within the structure.  
h.  The use will be patronized substantially by pedestrians and will, if required by 
the Planning Board, function adequately without additional off street parking 
or loading facilities and will in any case not generate vehicular traffic in 
quantity and type substantially different from that generated by permitted 
uses.  

i.  The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.  
j.  The use is not a formula business. 
k.   The following uses listed in Section 4.35 are however specifically prohibited:  

4.35j  (Mortuary, undertaking or funeral establishment);  
4.35l  (Veterinary establishment, kennel, pet shop);  
4.35m  (Sales place for new and used cars);  
4.35o  (Fast Order Food Establishment);  
4.35p  (Massage establishment); 
4.35s   (Cannabis Retail Store). 

2.  In the Office 2 base district the provisions of Section 4.40 - Footnotes to the Table of 
Use Regulations, footnote 12, shall not apply in the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

20.54.4  Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Harvard Square Overlay District which 

meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and loading 
requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and Loading 
Requirements.  
1.  The use is contained within a structure or portion of a structure in existence on or 
before June 1, 1940 or if constructed later is identified as a National Register or 
contributing building; or  

2.  The use is contained in a new structure or new addition to a structure identified in 
(1.) above, after the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board provided:  
a.  The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a development 

pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the retention of existing 
structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a specific finding shall be 
made that this objective has been met).  

b.  The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from parking and 

loading requirements will result in a building design that is more appropriate 
to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and that it is in 
conformance with the objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square 
Development Guidelines.  

c.  No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing 
building; and  

d.  No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or altered 
so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) years 
preceding the application. 

20.54.5  Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's positive diversity 

of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards and courtyards is 
encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to permit design flexibility 
to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the character of the area within 
which it is located. To this end any building in the Harvard Square Overlay District shall 
be exempt from the yard requirements as specified in Section 5.30, (except where such 
yard abuts a lot, but not a public way, outside the Overlay District) if the following 

Packet Pg. 223

2.4

conditions are met:  
1.  The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been issued by 

that date, or  

2.  For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning district, for 
which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the Planning Board 
issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard requirements provided:  
a.  The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the objectives 
and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development Guidelines.  

b.  No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing 
building; and  

c.  No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the site in 

the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to terminate or 
preclude its designation or demolished prior to the application. 

3. 

For any new building in a Business B district seeking a Special Permit a rear yard 
setback of twenty (20) feet shall be provided with upper floor ten (10) foot 
setbacks beginning at forty-five (45) feet above grade. The resulting yard shall 
create a landscaped open space. 

 

20.54.6  Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area (FAR) in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay 
District. Notwithstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 5.000 or elsewhere in this 
Ordinance, the maximum FAR applicable in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District 
shall be as follows: Business B district: 4.0 for all Non-Residential Uses and 4.0 for all 
Residential Uses (4.31 a-h; Office 3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Office 2 district: 2.0 for all 
uses; Residence C-3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Residence C-2B district: 1.75 for all uses; 
Residence C-1 district: 0.75 for all uses; Business A district: 1.0 for all uses except 
dwellings, 1.75 for dwellings.  

20.54.7  Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit granting 

authority (Planning Board) may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot 
in the Business B district located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for any 
residential use in section 4.31 (a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or 4.35 
provided the Planning Board finds that the use and design complies with the goals and 
design guidelines set forth in the Harvard Square Conservation District and provides 
additional public benefits commensurate with the additional development, such as the 
following: 
1. 

Ground floors that are devoted to retail and similar uses that activate the 
square and serve the needs of the surrounding community and visitors; 
Commitments to recruit and retain small, local, and independent businesses, in 
part through maintaining 50 percent of first floor public frontage as commercial 
rental space of approximately 1,500 sq. ft.in size; 
Creation of mixed-income housing;  
Commitments to sustainable design that minimize greenhouse gas emissions 
and increases vegetation, and; 
Investments into creating or improving public space. 

2. 

3. 
4. 

5. 

20.54.8  FAR Exemption for Ground Floor Retail. Retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or less shall be 

excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio. 

20.54.9  Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as identified 

in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of the ground-floor 
level frontage of a building facing a street, measured horizontally parallel to that street. 

Packet Pg. 224

2.4

In addition, such uses shall not occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s 
total horizontal ground-floor building frontage aggregated over one or more streets. 
The Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a minor increase in the 
permitted frontage upon finding that such increase would create a result that is more 
compatible with the unique conditions of a particular building or site and that the 
criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above are met. 

20.54.10   Fast Order Food Establishments (as identified in Section 4.35o) are allowed by right 

within the Harvard Square Overlay District and are further not subject to the provisions 
of Article 11.30 of this Ordinance provided the Fast Order Food Establishment is not a 
Formula Business. 

20.55  Sign Regulations in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District.  

20.55.1  All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic District, except as 
modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow greater flexibility in the 
size, location and illumination of signs in order to encourage more thoughtful design of 
individual signs, to encourage greater respect for the building and visual context within 
which new signs are erected, and thereby add interest and character to the shopping 
environment in Harvard Square.  
1.  In Section 7.16.22 - Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts, Paragraphs A, 

B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts. However, no sign on 
the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet above grade.  
2.  In Section 7.16.3 - Application of the Sign Frontage Formula shall not apply.  
3.  In the Residence C-2B base district the provisions of Section 7.16.22 shall apply to 

permitted or legally established nonconforming office and retail uses.

20.52  

HARVARD SQUARE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND HARVARD SQUARE 
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT 

  Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Harvard Square Overlay 
District and, the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District, and Harvard Square 
Conservation District Goals and Guidelines which shall be governed by the 
regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.50. It is the intent of this 
section that these regulations will apply to an area described generally as the Harvard 
Square business district and certain abutting portions of the neighborhoods around it. 

20.51.1  

 The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on 
the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square 
Historic Overlay District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay 
district that is encompassed by any historic district duly established by the City 
Council under the authority granted by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of 
the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any Neighborhood 
Conservation District established by the City Council under the provisions of 
chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. All provisions of the Harvard 
Square Overlay District and all references to it in this Ordinance shall apply 
equally to the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District except as set forth below.  

  General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning 
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to 
the Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more 
careful public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban 
form of the Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the 
extreme development pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique 
functional environment and visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the 
functional impacts of new development on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to 
maintain the present diversity of development and open space patterns and building 
scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory flexibility to advance the general 
purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility granted to development 
within the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to facilitate the 
protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of Harvard Square 
while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary 
changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. 

20.53  

  General Provisions.  

20.53.1   The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special 

planning concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, 
Development Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development

c.   The Committee's written report shall outline the urban design and 

development issues raised by the proposal. It shall suggest those areas 
within which additional exploration of alternatives might be sought or 
factual information gathered which might help to resolve potential 
conflicts between the public and private objectives or which help to 
shape the project to better serve these objectives.  

d.   The report shall be forwarded to the applicant and shall be included in 
any application for a building permit, special permit or variance.

made to the Harvard Square Improvement Fund to be established by the 
City of Cambridge in an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the cost 
of construction of the spaces not provided, said contribution to be used 
by the City of Cambridge for one or more of the following capital 
improvements in the Harvard Square Overlay District:  

(1)   Provision of public parking, preferably for short term users;  

(2)  

Improvements to public parks, or restoration of historic 
structures, monuments and other features owned by the City of 
Cambridge or other public agency or a nonprofit organization;  

(3)   Extension throughout the Harvard Square Overlay District of the 
surface improvements installed by the MBTA as part of the Red 
Line subway extension(brick sidewalks, light post, street 
furniture, etc.)  

The Harvard Square Advisory Committee shall receive and make 
comments on any proposal for the expenditure of such cash 
contributions. To the extent practicable the provision of public parking 
facilities shall be the first priority of any expenditure. The funds shall 
not be used for ordinary maintenance activities normally undertaken by 
the City of Cambridge.  

The value of the cash contribution shall be determined by the 
Community Development Department assuming equivalent structured 
parking spaces and using generally accepted cost estimation methods 
customarily used by architects and engineers or using actual 
construction costs for comparable contemporary parking construction in 
Cambridge.  

ab.   The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a 

development pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the 
retention of existing structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a 
specific finding shall be made that this objective has been met).  

bc.   The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from 

parking and loading requirements will result in a building design that is 
more appropriate to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and 
that it is in conformance with the objectives and criteria contained in 
Harvard Square Development Guidelines.  

cd.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and

de.   No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or 
altered so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) 
years preceding the application. 

20.54.5   Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's 

positive diversity of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards 
and courtyards is encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to 
permit design flexibility to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the 
character of the area within which it is located. To this end any building in the 
Harvard Square Overlay District shall be exempt from the yard requirements as 
specified in Section 5.30, (except where such yard abuts a lot, but not a public 
way, outside the Overlay District) if the following conditions are met:  

1.   The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been 

issued by that date, or  

2.   For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning 

district, for which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the 
Planning Board issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard 
requirements provided:  

a.   The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the 
objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development 
Guidelines.  

b.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and  

c.   No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the 

site in the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation or demolished prior to the 
application.  

20.54.6   Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area (FAR) in the Harvard Square 

Historic Overlay District. Notwithstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 
5.000 or elsewhere in this Ordinance, the maximum FAR applicable in the 
Harvard Square Historic Overlay District shall be as follows: Business B district: 
4.0 for all Non-Residential Uses and 4.0 for all Residential Uses (4.31 a-h) uses 
except dwellings, 3.0 for dwellings; Office 3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Office 2 
district: 2.0 for all uses; Residence C-3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Residence C-2B 
district: 1.75 for all uses; Residence C-1 district: 0.75 for all uses; Business A 
district: 1.0 for all uses except dwellings, 1.75 for dwellings.  

20.54.7   Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit 

granting authority may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot 
in the Business B district located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for 
any residential use in section 4.31 (a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or

4.35 provided the use and design complies with the goals and design guidelines 
set forth in the Harvard Square Conservation District. 

20.54.8   FAR Exemption for Ground Floor Retail. Retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or 

less shall be excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio. 

20.54.9   Restricted Uses. No bank or financial institution (Section 4.34e) or Cannabis 

Retail Store (Section 11.803.1), shall occupy more than twenty (20’) feet of 
building frontage within the Harvard Square Overlay, and no more than thirty 
percent (30%) of a lot’s aggregate ground-floor building frontage facing one or 
more public streets may be occupied by such uses.  

Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as 
identified in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of 
the ground-floor level frontage of a building facing a street, measured 
horizontally parallel to that street. In addition, such uses shall not occupy more 
than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s total horizontal ground-floor building 
frontage aggregated over one or more streets. The Planning Board may grant a 
special permit to allow a minor increase in the permitted frontage upon finding 
that such increase would create a result that is more compatible with the unique 
conditions of a particular building or site and that the criteria set forth in Section 
20.53.2 above are met. 

20.54.10   Fast Order Food Establishments (as identified in Section 4.35o) are allowed by 
right within the Harvard Square Overlay District and are further not subject to 
the provisions of Article 11.30 of this Ordinance provided the Fast Order Food 
Establishment is not a Formula Business. 

20.55   Sign Regulations in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District.  

20.55.1   All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic 

District, except as modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow 
greater flexibility in the size, location and illumination of signs in order to 
encourage more thoughtful design of individual signs, to encourage greater 
respect for the building and visual context within which new signs are erected, 
and thereby add interest and character to the shopping environment in Harvard 
Square.  

1.  

In Section 7.16.22 - Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts, 
Paragraphs A, B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts. 
However, no sign on the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet 
above grade.  

2.  

In Section 7.16.3 - Application of the Sign Frontage Formula shall not apply.  

3.  

In the Residence C-2B base district the provisions of Section 7.16.22 shall 
apply to permitted or legally established nonconforming office and retail 
uses.

PLease upload a wet/signed letter from the building owner approving the sign to be added to the building.

Lori Perez January 2nd 2020, 12:59:51 pm 
The City Clerks Application and Abutters forms need to be completed. Once completed, all documents will have to be uploaded to 
the attachment section of the application. 
Christopher Vuk January 13th 2020, 11:31:04 pm 
Hi Lori, Thank you. To clarify, I need to complete page 2 of the application with the building owner signature. How do I handle the 
Abutters form? Do I need to get a certain amount of neighbors to sign that? Thank you. 
Lori Perez January 21st 2020, 9:32:23 am 
The Abutters are located on either side of the business or front and back depended on the location.  This means only 2 are 
necessary.  The Assessor's office will have the Abutters information.   
Lori Perez January 21st 2020, 1:01:35 pm 
The deadline for the City Council Agenda is 3:00pm on the Thursday prior to the Monday City Council Meeting.  If you have any 
documents that need to be uploaded please do so before this time.  The application will need the City Clerks Application and 
Abutters forms will have to be submitted before it will be presented to the Council.

General Provisions 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

(a) 

For the purposes of this Section, the phrase “District Development Standards” shall refer 
to the development standards of the base zoning district as they may be modified by the 
development standards of all overlay districts (with the exception of this Affordable 
Housing Overlay) that are applicable to a lot.  

District Dimensional Standards shall include the most permissive standards allowable on 
a lot, whether such standards are permitted as-of-right or allowable by special permit. A 
District Dimensional Standard that is allowable by special permit shall include any non-
discretionary requirements or limitations that would otherwise apply. 

An AHO Project that conforms to the following development standards shall not be 
subject to other limitations that may be set forth in Article 5.000 or other Sections of this 
Zoning Ordinance, except as otherwise stated in this Section. 

11.207.5.2 

Dimensional Standards for AHO Projects 

11.207.5.2.1  Building Height and Stories Above Grade. For an AHO Project, the standards set 
forth below shall apply in place of any building height limitations set forth in the 
District Development Standards.  

Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth a maximum residential building 
height of forty (40) feet or less, an AHO Project shall contain no more than four (4) 
Stories Above Grade and shall have a maximum height of forty-five (45) feet, as 
measured from existing Grade. For AHO Projects containing active non-residential uses 
on the ground floor, the maximum height may be increased to fifty (50) feet but the 
number of Stories Above Grade shall not exceed four (4) stories. 

(b)  Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth a maximum residential building 

height of more than forty (40) feet but not more than fifty (50) feet, an AHO Project shall 
contain no more than six (6) Stories Above Grade and shall have a maximum height of 
sixty-five (65) feet, as measured from existing Grade, except as further limited below. 
For AHO Projects containing active non-residential uses on the ground floor, the 
maximum height may be increased to seventy (70) feet but the number of Stories Above 
Grade shall not exceed six (6) stories. 

(i) 

Except where the AHO Project abuts a non-residential use, portions of an AHO 
Project that are within thirty-five (35) feet of a district whose District 
Dimensional Standards allow a maximum residential building height of forty (40) 
feet or less shall be limited by the provisions of Paragraph (a) above, except that 
if the AHO project parcel extends into that District, then the height limitation 
shall only extend thirty five (35) feet from the property line.  

(c) 

Where the District Dimensional Standards set forth a maximum residential building 
height of more than fifty (50) feet, an AHO Project shall contain no more than seven (7)

requiring a special permit, provided that no more than two cars may be parked within any 
tandem parking space. 

Notwithstanding Section 6.43.6, owners of adjacent properties may establish common 
driveways under mutual easements without requiring a special permit. 

Notwithstanding Paragraph 6.44.1(a), on-grade open parking spaces may be located 
within ten (10) feet but not less than five (5) feet from the Ground Story of a building on 
the same lot or seven and one-half (7.5) feet from the Ground Story of a building on an 
adjacent lot without requiring a special permit, provided that such parking spaces are 
screened from buildings on abutting lots by a fence or other dense year-round visual 
screen. 

Notwithstanding Paragraph 6.44.1(b), on-grade open parking spaces and driveways may 
be located within five (5) feet of a side or rear property line without requiring a special 
permit, provided that screening is provided in the form of a fence or other dense year-
round visual screen at the property line, unless such screening is waived by mutual 
written agreement of the owner of the lot and the owner of the abutting lot. 

11.207.6.4 

Modifications to Bicycle Parking Standards 

Notwithstanding Section 6.104, long-term or short-term bicycle parking spaces may be 
located anywhere on the lot for an AHO Project or on an adjacent lot in common

the owner of the land on which the station is located as approved by the Community 
Development Department. If additional Public Bicycle Sharing Station docks are 
provided, the number of required bicycle parking spaces may be further reduced at a rate 
of 0.5 bicycle parking space per additional Public Bicycle Sharing Station dock, up to a 
maximum reduction of half of the required number of spaces.  

For AHO Dwelling Units created within an existing building, bicycle parking spaces 
meeting the standards of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be required but are encouraged 
to be provided to the extent practical given the limitations of the existing structure. 
Bicycle parking spaces shall be provided, as required by this Zoning Ordinance, for 
dwelling units in an AHO Project that are constructed fully outside the envelope of the 
existing structure. 

11.207.6.5 

Transportation Demand Management 

An AHO Project not providing off-street parking at a ratio of 0.4 space per dwelling unit or more 
shall provide, in writing, to the Community Development Department a Transportation Demand 
Management program containing the following measures, at a minimum: 

Offering either a free annual membership in a Public Bicycle Sharing Service, at the 
highest available tier where applicable, or a 50% discounted MBTA combined subway 
and bus pass for six months or pass of equivalent value, to up to two individuals in each 
household upon initial occupancy of a unit.  

Providing transit information in the form of transit maps and schedules to each household 
upon initial occupancy of a unit, or providing information and a real-time transit service 
screen in a convenient common area of the building such as an entryway or lobby.

19.000 of this Zoning Ordinance and any design standards set forth in Section 19.50 or 
elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance shall be superseded by the following standards for an 
AHO Project. 

The following design standards shall apply to new construction and to additions to 
existing structures. Except as otherwise provided, an existing building that is altered or 
moved to accommodate an AHO Project shall not be subject to the following standards, 
provided that such alterations do not create a condition that is in greater nonconformance 
with such standards than the existing condition. 

11.207.7.2 

Site Design and Arrangement 

The area directly between the front lot line and the principal wall plane of the building 
nearest to the front lot line shall consist of any combination of landscaped area,

(a) 

Pedestrian entrances to buildings shall be visible from the street, except where the 
building itself is not visible from the street due to its location. All pedestrian entrances 
shall be accessible by way of access routes that are separated from motor vehicle access 
drives. 

A building footprint exceeding two hundred and fifty (250) feet in length, measured 
parallel to the street, contains a massing recess extending back at least fifteen (15) feet in 
depth measured from and perpendicular to the front lot line and at least fifteen (15) feet in 
width measured parallel to the front lot line so that the maximum length of unbroken 
façade is one hundred fifty (150) feet. 

11.207.7.3 

Building Façades 

At least twenty percent (20%) of the area of building façades facing a public street or 
public open space shall consist of clear glass windows. For buildings located in a 
Business A (BA), Business A-2 (BA-2), Business B (BB) or Business C (BC) zoning 
district, this figure shall be increased to thirty percent (30%) for non-residential portions 
of the building, if any. 

Building façades shall incorporate architectural elements that project or recess by at least 
two feet from the adjacent section of the façade. Such projecting or recessed elements 
shall occur on an average interval of 40 linear horizontal feet or less for portions of the 
façade directly facing a public street, and on an average interval of 80 linear horizontal 
feet or less for other portions of the façade. Such projecting or recessed elements shall not 
be required on the lowest Story Above Grade or on the highest Story Above Grade, and 
shall not be required on the highest two Stories Above Grade of a building containing at 
least six Stories Above Grade. The intent is to incorporate elements such as bays, 
balconies, cornices, shading devices, or similar architectural elements that promote visual 
interest and residential character, and to allow variation at the ground floor and on upper 
floors where a different architectural treatment may be preferable. 

11.207.7.4 

Ground Stories and Stories Below Grade 

The elevation at floor level of the Ground Story shall be at the mean Grade of the 
abutting public sidewalk, or above such mean Grade by not more than four feet. Active 
non-residential uses at the Ground Story shall be accessible directly from the sidewalk 
without requiring use of stairs or a lift. The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply 
if it is determined by the City Engineer that a higher Ground Story elevation is necessary 
for the purpose of flood protection. 

(b)  Where structured parking is provided within the Ground Story of a building, the portion 
of the building immediately behind the front wall plane shall consist of residential units, 
common areas, or other populated portions of the building in order to screen the provided 
parking over at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the length of the façade measured 
parallel to the street and excluding portions of the façade used for driveway access. On a 
corner lot, the requirements of this Paragraph shall only apply along one street. 

(c) 

The façade of a Ground Story facing a public street shall consist of expanses no longer 
than twenty-five (25) feet in length, measured parallel to the street, which contain no 
transparent windows or pedestrian entryways.

If the Ground Story is designed to accommodate active non-residential uses, the 
following additional standards shall apply: 

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

the height of the Ground Story for that portion of the building containing active 
non-residential uses shall be at least fifteen (15) feet; 

the depth of the space designed for active non-residential uses shall be at least 
thirty-five (35) feet on average measured from the portion of the façade that is 
nearest to the front lot line in a direction perpendicular to the street, and 
measured to at least one street in instances where the space abuts two or more 
streets; and 

that portion of the Ground Story façade containing active non-residential uses 
shall consist of at least thirty percent (30%) transparent glass windows or, if the 
use is a retail or consumer service establishment, at least thirty percent (30%) 
transparent glass windows, across the combined façade on both streets in the 
case of a corner lot. 

Ground Stories on sites that are located in a Business base zoning district may include 
retail or consumer establishments as well as social service facilities supporting the 
mission of the owner of the AHO Project.  

Private living spaces within dwelling units, including bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms, 
may only be contained within Stories Above Grade. Stories Below Grade may only 
contain portions of dwelling units providing entries, exits, or mechanical equipment, or 
common facilities for residents of the building, such as lobbies, recreation rooms, 
laundry, storage, parking, bicycle parking, or mechanical equipment. 

(e) 

(f) 

11.207.7.5 

Mechanical Equipment, Refuse Storage, and Loading Areas 

All mechanical equipment, refuse storage, or loading areas serving the building or its occupants 
that are (1) carried above the roof, (2) located at the exterior building wall or (3) located outside 
the building, shall meet the requirements listed below. Mechanical equipment includes, but is not 
limited to, ventilation equipment including exhaust fans and ducts, air conditioning equipment, 
elevator bulkheads, heat exchangers, transformers and any other equipment that, when in 
operation, potentially creates a noise detectable off the lot. The equipment and other facilities: 

(a) 

Shall not be located within any required setback.  This Paragraph (a) shall not apply to 
electrical equipment whose location is mandated by a recognized public utility, provided 
that project plans submitted for review by the City identify a preferred location for such 
equipment. 

(b)  When on the ground, shall be permanently screened from view from adjacent public 

streets that are within 100 feet of the building, or from the view from abutting property in 
separate ownership at the property line.  The screening shall consist of a dense year-
round screen equal or greater in height at the time of installation than the equipment or 
facilities to be screened, or a fence of equal or greater height that is comparable in quality 
to the materials used on the principal facades of the building, with no more than twenty-
five (25) percent of the face of the fence open with adjacent planting.

This Section shall not waive the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 
of this Zoning Ordinance that may otherwise apply to an AHO Project. 

(b)  Where the provisions of the Flood Plain Overlay District apply to an AHO Project, the 
performance standards set forth in Section 20.70 of this Zoning Ordinance shall apply; 
however, a special permit shall not be required. 

An AHO Project shall be subject to other applicable laws, regulations, codes, and 
ordinances pertaining to environmental standards.  

New outdoor light fixtures installed in an AHO Project shall be fully shielded and 
directed to prevent light trespass onto adjacent residential lots.

Advisory Design Consultation Procedure 

Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO Project shall comply with the 
following procedure, which is intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and 
staff input into the design of the project. 

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance the City’s desired outcomes 
for the form and character of AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable housing units, AHO Projects are permitted to have a greater height, scale, and 
density than other developments permitted by the zoning for a given district. This 
procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that are compatible with the existing 
neighborhood context or with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 

The City’s Design Guidelines for 100% Affordable Housing Overlay, along with other 
design objectives and guidelines established for the part of the city in which the AHO 
Project is located, are intended to inform the design of AHO Projects and to guide the 
Planning Board’s consultation and report as set forth below. It is intended that designers 
of AHO Projects, City staff, the Planning Board, and the general public will be open to 
creative variations from any detailed provisions set forth in such objectives and 
guidelines as long as the core values expressed are being served.

City of Cambridge 

O-2 
IN CITY COUNCIL 
February 24, 2020 

VICE MAYOR MALLON 
 
WHEREAS: 

The City Noise Ordinance prohibits construction before 7 a.m. (9 a.m. on Saturdays 
and holidays) and after 6 p.m., and construction is never permitted on Sundays; and 
 
By prohibiting Sunday construction, and limiting the number of hours construction can 
occur on Saturdays and holidays, the City has demonstrated a value for minimizing 
noise pollution during times when many residents are more likely to be at home; and 
 
As the number of Saturdays and holidays any one developer can be permitted for 
construction is not limited, the excess noise can be disruptive, unwelcome, and 
burdensome for those residing nearby; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  While new construction, especially new residential units, should be made available for 

use as soon as reasonably possible, it cannot be at the expense of the health and well-
being of residents in surrounding areas; now therefore be it

WHEREAS: 

Cambridge Public Libraries serve as a vital resource for our residents, particularly for 
vulnerable communities; and 
 
In 2019, 5,748 Cambridge library patrons were blocked from accessing certain library 
services, such as checking out, checking in, and renewing materials, because they had 
accumulated over $10 in library late fees; and 
 
24% (1367 of 5748) of blocked Cambridge library patrons (account charges > $10) are 
under the age of 18, suggesting that a substantial number of youth are not able to 
access certain library services due to the burden of library fines, despite the Libraries’ 
policy of not charging late fees on children’s and young adult’s materials; and 
 
In Cambridge Public Libraries, adult items currently incur a ten cent fine for each day 
an item is returned or renewed past its due date; and 
 
Commonwealth Catalog and Interlibrary loan adult items currently incur a $2.00 fine 
for each day an item is returned or renewed past its due date; and 
 
Imposing late fines does not hold a significant monetary benefit, as Cambridge Public 
Libraries charged $77,870 in library fines in FY19, less than .07% of the total library 
budget of $12.5 million a year; and 
 
Costs associated with administering library fines, including the costs of staff time, 
mailings, and more, also reduce the revenue accrued from imposed library fines; and 
 

experimented with eliminating late fees for all or some patrons in their own public 
libraries; and 
 
These municipalities have had a lot of success with eliminating late fees, experiencing 
increased rates of material returns, increased library patronage, and increased library 
access for low-income residents, who may have difficulty paying late fines, and 
 
Other municipalities have experimented with eliminating late fines only for certain 
groups, such as youth, seniors, or those with ADA accommodations, capping library 
fines at a low amount, creating “amnesty days” where late items can be returned 
without the charge of late fees, or asking for volunteer time or food donations in the 
place of money with success; now therefore be it

COUNCILLOR NOLAN 
 
WHEREAS: 

In May 2018, after two years of sustained community outreach and public engagement, 
the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) published the 
Mount Auburn Street Corridor Study, a comprehensive report on planned roadway 
improvements to the intersection of Mt. Auburn Street, Fresh Pond Parkway, and 
Gerrys Landing Road; and 
 
Among the list of shared objectives established by the study’s stakeholders were goals 
to “calm traffic, provide clarity, and reduce crashes and severity of crashes,” to 
“improve connectivity and air quality, and expand mobility choices,” and to improve 
“safety, access, parking, and comfort for bicycles”; and 
 
A critical piece of DCR’s planned short-term safety improvements at this intersection 
was a “road diet” of curb extensions and traffic flow readjustments; and 
 
This plan also included a two-way protected bicycle lane that would have extended to 
the Charles River along Gerrys Landing Road, providing safe bicycle and pedestrian 
connectivity to the Eliot Bridge and Dudley White Bike Path along the river; and 
 
In a public plan update meeting on February 4, 2020, DCR announced its intention to 
postpone the consensus road diet and bike lane portions of its short-term plan in favor 
of a road layout that preserves the current, dangerous traffic patterns; and 
 
A two-way protected bike lane along Gerrys Landing Road would constitute a vital 
segment of connectivity as envisioned in the 2015 Cambridge Bicycle Plan; and 
 
Pedestrian and bicyclist safety should be a major priority at this intersection to best 
protect youth at nearby schools, elderly residents at the adjacent Cambridge Homes 
assisted living facility, and those seeking services at Mt. Auburn Hospital; and 
 
The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) has recorded 29 crashes 
at the intersection in question since 2017, one resulting in injury to a pedestrian and 
one in injury to a bicyclist; now therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record asking the Massachusetts Department 
of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) to reconsider its decision for these streets under 
the department’s control in Cambridge; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

Public transit is an important transportation option for Cambridge residents, with 
nearly one-third of residents commuting via public transit and lower-income 
commuters being disproportionately likely to depend on bus service; and 

 
Traffic in the Boston Metropolitan Area, including Cambridge, has gotten worse in the 
preceding years and has had serious negative effects on Cambridge residents and 
contributed adversely to climate change; and 
 
One study in Cambridge has demonstrated that nearly 60% of commuters are travelling 
by bus on some stretches of streets while more than 97% of the vehicle traffic on those 
same streets are cars and only 3% are buses; and 
 
Cambridge streets including Massachusetts Avenue between Western Avenue and 
Memorial Drive have been identified as having both high bus ridership and significant 
delays in bus service; and 
 
Bus lanes have been shown to be effective in improving bus service, shortening 
commute times, and reducing overall traffic in the areas they have been implemented; 
and 
 
Bus lanes need to be implemented concurrently with fully separate protected bicycle 
lanes in order to achieve safety, access and equity for all users; and 
 

dedicated bus lanes, protected bicycle lanes, and sidewalks that are fully separated 
from each other and from other motor vehicle traffic, provided that space is allocated 
more equitably; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with relevant City 
departments and the MBTA on the feasibility of implementing additional dedicated 
bus lanes, as well as fully separate protected bicycle lanes, on Massachusetts Avenue 
and other street corridors with high bus ridership; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council in 
a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City Council has passed three orders requesting the City Manager allocate funds 
for a comprehensive feasibility study of municipal broadband; and 
 
Internet access is indispensable in the 21st century, and while Cambridge is seen as a 
technology and innovation hub, the City suffers from a lack of internet provider 
competition, and has unusually low speeds and service, prompting over 1,300 residents 
to sign a petition calling for the City to take action; and 
 

Between 50 and 60 percent of low-income households in Cambridge do not have 
access to broadband, creating a significant disadvantage for seeking employment, 
educational opportunities, and when looking to access timely information in regard to 
City services; and 
 
The cost of broadband has a significant impact on the operations cost for local 
businesses and startups, creating an additional hurdle for their ability to survive in 
Cambridge; and 
 
The City Council has included “Equitable” and “Innovative” in its goals and guiding 
principles, striving to provide equal opportunity to all residents and supporting the 
people and institutions that are inventing new ways to make life better; and  
 
Over 50 cities and towns across the country, including seven in Massachusetts, have 
already implemented a city-wide municipal broadband network; and  
 
The majority of these municipal networks have surpassed their signup goals since 
implementation, including Longmont, Colorado (pop. 95,000), where an attempt to 
reach 37 percent of the market within five years has resulted in 54 percent of the 
market utilizing the municipal network in less than that time; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Municipal broadband is unlike other services that cities provide free of charge, because 
while residents will save up to 50% on their internet costs and receive faster and more 
reliable service, the City’s investment in broadband will also pay for itself overtime; 
and

The City Manager appointed a Broadband Task Force in 2014, which spent over two 
years evaluating the options the City had at its disposal, and recommended a feasibility 
study to understand the costs of such a program since no meaningful estimate exists at 
this time; and  
 
The Digital Equity working group will provide valuable findings regarding the digital 
divide in Cambridge, but that work must not delay understanding the cost and 
feasibility of establishing municipal broadband; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to produce a Request For Proposal 
for the municipal broadband feasibility study that was called for by the City's 
Broadband Task Force back in August 2016, and to report back on this matter to the 
City Council no later than May 1.

The Public Safety Committee will meet  to discuss Annual Surveillance Report submitted by the 
City Manager to the City Council on December 9, 2019. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  06:12 
Welcome everyone. We're going get started in less than a moment.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  06:30 
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  06:38 
Alright, so for committee members, we have some printouts of the full report. There is a smaller 
version for the public, but it's also available online for anyone who wants it. Councillor Nolan, did 
you need a copy of the report? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  07:08 
Great. Thanks. Alright, so, again, welcome. My name is Quinton Zondervan. I'm the chair of the 
Public Safety Committee, joined by my colleagues, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor 
Nolan and Vice Mayor Mallon and we are here to discuss the... I believe the first ever 
surveillance, annual surveillance report from the city. It is quite hefty. So, we'll try to get through 
this as expediently as we can. Our goal today is to move the surveillance technology impact 
reports which are forward looking to the full Council for their consideration so that the 
departments can continue to do that work. And certainly, of my colleagues have concerns about 
any specific ones that warrant keeping them in committee, then that would be in order. But 
again, our goal is to send them forward unless we have really significant concerns, requiring 
them to stay in committee. And then we will, I will schedule a follow up meetings to go through 
the annual report, which is looking back at 2019 as well as the surveillance policy, which we 
don't need to decide on right away. And then, I've been told we will have another annual report 
in March. So that will be another opportunity for us to review the annual report as well as the 
surveillance technology reports. So, with that, I've asked the staff to prepare a presentation on 
the surveillance ordinance itself because it is quite complex, and we could all use a refresher. 
So, with that, I'll hand it over to the law department. Thank you. City Manager office excuse me.

Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  09:16 
Thank you, Mr. Chair and through you to the rest of the committee. We really do appreciate the 
opportunity to present this information to the committee. We understand it's a very dense 
number of reports that are before you as well as the content of them. So, we thought it would be 
helpful to go through, at kind of a higher level, the ordinance itself and how it applies, a little bit 
of background and then discuss kind of the compliance process we've gone through today and 
how we anticipate this will work moving forward. I want to... 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  09:45 
Sorry just one second.  Just wanted to recognize Councillor McGovern and also if somebody 
could pass me a copy of the presentation so I don't have to crane my neck. Thank you. 
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  10:09 
Thank you. So, we do want to thank you again for the opportunity to discuss this. We want to 
thank the ACLU for their continued work on this. I know, just on behalf of the city manager's 
office, we are truly committed to not just complying with the ordinance, but to continuing to 
refine our practices, continuing to make sure the reports are as robust and detailed as the 
committee and the council expect them to be and just working to further hone this process as 
we all go through it. It's been a really big learning experience for everyone. But we are very 
committed to not just the letter but also the spirit of this ordinance and what it is representing for 
the city. So, before we get into the specifics, the city solicitor is going to go through a little bit of 
the background of how the ordinance was adopted and the goals that it is fulfilling, and then a 
little bit more of what it covers. What it doesn't cover and how the compliance processes 
anticipated to go moving forward, as well as what we've done to date, and then some of the 
next steps that we anticipate both on the city level and then as you said, process wise for the 
committee what our recommendations would be. So, with that, I will turn it over to Nancy Glowa 
the city solicitor. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  11:23 
Point of information. Before, sorry to interrupt you Ms. Glowa. I'm wondering if we could go 
around the table and introduce who's... I mean I'm sure some of the folks that are attending here 
at the table, and I'm wondering if you could do some intro, if we could just introduce ourselves 
and what department you are from and if I know Kade Crockford is here from the ACLU but 
people might not know who's at the table.

Thank you. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  12:31 
Thank you, Mr. Chairs through you, as Jennifer mentioned, I'm going to go over some of the 
background and goals of the ordinance, and then go through a little bit more detail of what we're 
doing here today, process wise. So, just wanted to remind people as you can see on the slide 
presentation, the ordinance was adopted just over a year ago on December 10, 2018. After 
extensive work between the council, the ACLU, Cambridge residents and staff. It went into 
effect by its terms on September 10, 2019, nine months after its ordination. And essentially it 
regulates surveillance technology and surveillance data throughout the city and the city's 
operations. So, the primary goals include the balancing the right to privacy with public safety 
and security, increasing transparency of city government, informing the public discussion on 
surveillance technology so that people are aware of what we're doing with surveillance in the 
city and analyzing potential disproportionate impact on marginalized groups or individuals within 
the city. So within the ordinance, some of the key terms that have been defined are surveillance 
technology, which is defined as any electronic surveillance device hardware or software capable 
of collecting capturing, recording, retaining, processing, intercepting, analyzing, monitoring, or 
sharing audio, visual, digital location, thermal, biometric or similar information specifically 
associated with or capable of being associated with any identifiable individual or group. So, as 
you can see from that description, it's fairly broad in terms of what it encompasses.  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  14:26 
Surveillance data is defined as any electronic data collected, captured, recorded, retained, 
processed, intercepted or analyzed by surveillance technology acquired by the city or operated 
at the direction of the city. And individual... identifiable individuals are defined as an individual 
whose identity can be revealed by data, including surveillance data, or revealed by data when it 
is analyzed and or combined with any record. So the key terms and concepts that are set forth 
in the ordinance are that it sort of clarifies that surveillance technology generates and or utilizes 
surveillance data, which can be linked to identified individuals and when that occurs, that is 
covered within the scope of the ordinance as something that we in the City of Cambridge want 
to regulate. So, all surveillance technologies going that are in use by or intending intended to be 
used by the city must first be approved by the City Council. With a few limited exceptions. One 
is if it is acquired or used by the police department, in exigent circumstances. reporting on 
surveillance technology acquired in exigent circumstances, is required within 90 days following 
the end of the exigent circumstance unless, if the police commissioner were to come to the city 
council and asked for an extension, the council could grant an extension otherwise it has to be 
reported on within 90 days after its use. In addition, all surveillance technology is reported to the 
council in a yearly in an annual surveillance report. And the ordinance required the first such

annual report to be submitted to the council by December 10... 9of 2019, which is one of the 
documents that you have in front of you that we submitted. And as the chair noted, the first sort 
of full year's annual report will be due in March of 2020. So it may not be quite as detailed or 
robust, because we'll have already well, we have already submitted this report in December, but 
it certainly gives us an opportunity to follow up on additional details that the council may request 
and to make sure that that report in March is up to date. So, in terms of what technologies are 
covered under this surveillance ordinance, the as I noted in some of the earlier terms that were 
defined. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  17:05 
The ordinance applies very broadly and covers more than what might think of as traditional 
surveillance methods. So, it could be a physical device or piece of hardware. Some of the more 
obvious examples, I think our cameras, gunshot detection, and long-range wireless scanners. 
But it could also be a software program that analyzes surveillance data generated by the city or 
by a different entity, a third party which shares that data with the city. And examples of that 
might be public health or epidemiological databases, FBI and state fingerprinting databases and 
things like that, that the city gains access to. So, the key question for us in analyzing whether 
something is covered by the ordinance is whether a technology in any way uses surveillance 
data that can either on its own or combined with any other records be associated with 
identifiable individuals. So, there are a number of exemptions set forth in the ordinance. And the 
exemption categories include surveillance technology that uses only surveillance data that 
somebody knowingly and voluntarily submits to the city, that only uses surveillance data that 
someone had a clear opportunity to opt out of providing, traffic violation cameras installed on a 
vehicle or public road pursuant to state law, cameras on city property installed exclusively for 
security purposes, cameras monitoring city cash handling operations, and surveillance 
technology that only monitors city employees in response to complaints of wrongdoing or to 
prevent fraud, waste or abuse.  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  18:48 
The review of whether an exemption applies requires a fairly detailed legal analysis and that is 
conducted by the law department in conjunction with the departments who would submit that 
information to the law department. And we go through a pretty rigorous analysis with the 
ordinance to determine whether something is subject to the ordinance and requires a 
surveillance impact report or not. So, the, the requirements on reports included in the ordinance 
include the surveillance technology impact reports, which relate to specific surveillance 
technologies and their use of surveillance data. And part of the purpose there is to inform 
council review and public discussion about all of these types of technologies and their use of 
data. And those, all of these technology impact reports must be submitted to and approved by 
the City Council before that technology is acquired or used by the city. And because there may 
be acquisitions of new technologies along the way that can be done on a rolling basis, or if it's 
not urgent, perhaps it can be done in the annual report, but it cannot be used until it has been 
submitted to and approved by the Council. So, in the annual report, which is a little bit different 
than this specific technology impact reports that are submitted for each technology, we have a 
master report which is broken up by department. It describes each departments use of 
surveillance technology and surveillance data over the previous year, discloses any complaints 
or disproportionate impacts of a surveillance technology, requires an ongoing cost benefit 
analysis and is submitted to the council for review and approval each year. I would note that 
some of these items may not be covered in this report that we just submitted because, for 
example, we don't have a lot of examples of use during the prior year, although we tried to 
come up with as much information as the department's had available to that issue.

Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  21:00 
It also requires the city to develop the city manager to develop a surveillance use policy. And 
that is intended to be a citywide policy that is applicable to every city department with 
surveillance technology that is used now or in the future. And key areas that are covered within 
the policy, the draft policy that is in front of the committee now, include what are the permissible 
purposes and authorized uses of surveillance technology and surveillance data? What is the 
oversight by department heads and compliance officers? One of the things that the city 
manager has established, I think through the, the policy that's been drafted is to appoint a 
compliance officer for each department in the city, so that there's a point of contact within each 
department to be monitoring how the ordinance is being overseen and it covers data collection, 
protection, access and retention, and finally training to all of the people in the various 
departments who will be needing to be governed by the requirements of this ordinance. In 
addition, there are, the ordinance calls for technology specific surveillance use policies, when 
there is a new technology that's been proposed, that has not previously been the subject of one 
of the surveillance technology use reports. So that is something that can be developed as 
needed as a new technology is introduced. And when a department wishes to introduce that to 
the city council for consideration. It’s designed to address new or unanticipated technologies 
that aren't already sufficiently addressed by the surveillance use policy. So, it's not our intention 
to, just because there's a new technology the city's going to acquire, if it's something that's 
already covered, generally within the existing surveillance use policy, it might not work. require a 
technology specific use policy. But where there's something very new or cutting edge, then then 
we would file, prepare that kind of policy. So, the ordinance requires submission of a technology 
specific surveillance use policy with the surveillance technology impact report, when needed, 
but not otherwise. So, at this point, I am going to turn it back over to Jennifer Matthews from the 
city manager's office to talk about the compliance process. 
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  23:33 
So, we thought it'd be helpful to summarize a little bit about this kind of initial compliance round 
because it has been very unique, and it will be different than how compliance is conducted 
ongoingly. But just to give you some background, so the city manager and law department 
began holding information sessions and meetings for all departments in the fall and had these 
conversations to talk about and answer general questions on how the audience applied and 
what might come under it and what departments need to be thinking about and kind of 
inventorying internally. Departments then submitted their information on existing technologies, 
and any known future technologies that they would want to acquire in kind of the next few 
months, so that it was all part of one reporting process. And they submitted that to the law 
department for review, again, that legal analysis was conducted and technologies that fell under 
the surveillance ordinance and were considered surveillance technology were then, 
departments were notified of those technologies. They prepared surveillance technology impact 
reports related to each individual piece of technology in their department, and they prepared an 
annual surveillance report regarding all the technologies used by their department with the look 
back of that first year back to the December 10 2018 enactment date of the ordinance, and then 
through until the submission for the December 9 2019 council meeting. So those were the two 
big batches of reports that were prepared initially. We don't anticipate that everything would be 
coming at once again, but because it was that massive undertaking for the departments and I 
do want to recognize what an exceptional amount of work it was for the departments, that was 
all done at once. Moving... So, for all the existing technology that departments used, the 
technology impact reports, and the annual surveillance reports were submitted. For the few 
technologies that have been identified as one’s departments might want to acquire or use in the 
near future. Only the surveillance technology impact reports were submitted because they 
require the advance approval of the council and there was no annual look back period for them

to work with. So that is what happened with the initial reporting cycle, and everything was 
submitted to the council in advance of the December 9, 2019 meeting.  
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  25:55 
What we anticipate the process will look like moving forward and Nancy talked through this a bit 
with just the requirements of the ordinance, as the technologies that are currently in use by the 
city are reviewed and hopefully approved by the Council, then moving forward departments will 
be submitting information about proposed new technologies, or changes in use of any existing 
surveillance technology. So just one thing to mention recognizes the ordinance requires new 
technologies be approved. But if you're going to be using an existing surveillance technology in 
a different way that also has to be reviewed and approved by the Council. Maybe it's a different 
location that wasn't contemplated, maybe you're gathering additional data that hasn't been 
reflected. So those will be things that we work on moving forward to make sure continued 
compliance is handled. So, as those changes are made, departments will report, the law 
department will review and determine if a new technology is surveillance technology, or if a new 
use requires an amended reporting to the Council and if that happens, then a new surveillance 
technology impact report will be submitted to the council for review. Or if it's an existing 
technology used in a new way; a revised impact report will be submitted to the council. So those 
again, those surveillance technology impact reports are submitted as soon as possible or 
practical, practicable for the council to review. And then the annual reports will be submitted 
during the March deadline so that you get that look back period of the previous year and how 
the technologies that were previously approved, have actually been used. It's that continuing 
compliance and cost benefit analysis mechanism for the council to review what's in use, is it 
working the way that the departments want it to be, is it meeting the goals of the Council and the 
ordinance and everything like that. So that's what we anticipate the process will look more like 
moving forward. But again, we had kind of a unique initial compliance round that we just wanted 
to recognize.  
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  27:56 
A few other things that we wanted to highlight because we are committed to continuing the 
compliance. And we know that that will be, you know, a big step for departments and for the city 
manager's office to oversee. We just wanted to flag some of the ways in which we think we can, 
we can really keep doing this. There are, as Nancy mentioned, identify compliance officers for 
all the departments that currently use surveillance technology. And they'll be responsible for 
assisting their department heads with oversight and reporting. As new technologies come up or 
changes are made internally. There will also be additional information sessions and trainings for 
department heads and compliance officers and staff who use the technologies. The city 
manager's office will be setting that up. We know that this is a very complex ordinance and that 
there are going to be things that people have additional questions on, there's going to be things 
that come up with this initial round that people realize we need to submit reports on that, we 
need to have that reviewed and we're committed to working with everybody to continue doing 
that. Again, it's something that we realized we'll keep refining this process as we go through it. 
So that's another way we'll do that. Another thing that's been raised that the police department 
had mentioned is the possibility of reviewing some internal policy changes that relate to specific 
surveillance technologies used by the police department. Understandably, they use most of the 
surveillance technology in the city. So, there could be some instances where changes and 
protocols internally could then be incorporated by reference and future reports. It might not be 
something that rises to the level of a full surveillance use policy change or something that large 
scale, but it is something that we've discussed, and I think the commissioner has said is 
something they'll take a look at moving forward. And then additionally, just for increased 
transparency, and making sure all these submissions are housed in one place. We'll be working

on a web page to upload all surveillance related materials, submission so that everything's in 
one place and both city staff and the public and stakeholders can review that. So, we thought it 
would be helpful. Before we get into the details about all the submissions in front of the 
committee. We're happy to answer any questions you might have on general process or 
background, and then we can happily get into the details of the materials in front of you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  30:19 
Great, thanks so much, Jennifer. So, do we have any clarifying questions on the surveillance 
ordinance? That was just presented. All right, seeing none will continue. 
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  30:37 
So hopefully this will help clarify that of the content of the materials in front of you. So, there are 
58 separate surveillance technology impact reports. Fifty-four of those were submitted prior to 
the December 9, 2019 council meeting, and there are 13 supplemental reports related to 13 of 
those original fifty- four submissions that the police department submitted, and we submitted to 
the committee yesterday. There are redlined changes just showing that additional information 
that was provided. And they reference the original surveillance technology impact report 
numbers from that original December submission. So hopefully it's not too difficult to cross 
reference. But again, we can go through those. We just wanted to make you aware of that. 
Then, in addition to those 54 original reports, there were four new surveillance technology 
impact reports submitted on Friday, so submitted to the committee prior to this committee 
meeting. And to be perfectly transparent, what's happened there is, as things have come up 
through either their procurement process or you know, again that flagging for additional 
reporting since the initial submissions in December, we've been tracking those and prepared 
surveillance technology impact reports for the ones that again, require that review and approval 
before we can move forward with any sort of procurement or, or use of the technology. So those 
are four new ones that were submitted. In addition, there is the annual surveillance report, 
grouped by departments. And that report relates to all the existing surveillance technology that 
was referenced in the December 9th submission. So, it's tied to those 54 original submissions. 
So, it covers the existing technologies there, but not the future proposed technologies. And I 
know that sounds confusing, but there were just a couple that weren't going to have an annual 
report with them. And then in addition to these reports, there's the draft surveillance use policy 
and that was submitted, just to clarify kind of on the requirements for the policy. That is not in 
fact, due under the ordinance until March 9 of this year, but it was submitted in, you know, part 
and parcel with the reports, because it made sense. The reports referenced it and we wanted to 
give us full picture as possible, so it was submitted prior to that December 9 meeting as well. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  33:03 
Mr. Chair, if I could just add, I wanted to recognize that the nine months kind of flies by and city 
staff throughout many, many departments have been working on May 1, we were preparing the 
draft policy, the forms to be used by departments and submitting information for review, and 
then putting together this whole package that was submitted to the council in December. So, I 
wanted to acknowledge the great interest and assistance of Kade Crockford from the ACLU. 
And also note that she and others may have questions or comments or suggestions for 
additional information that can be provided. And we're well aware that we may not have 
addressed everything at this time, but that this was sort of our effort to meet these deadlines 
and to get as much information as we could before the council, but we welcome questions and 
comments and suggestions for going forward. Thank you.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  34:07 
Yeah, just one second. So, there's your presentation complete? Great. So, we'll have some 
clarifying questions. I'll  hear from committee members and no committee members have 
questions. I'll recognize the representative from the ACLU. No questions, so, Kade. 
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  34:31 
Thanks. And through you Mr. Chair. Where are the four new impact reports that were submitted 
on Friday? I don't see them in the agenda for this meeting. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  34:46 
If I may answer they did not make the agenda. 
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  34:49 
Okay. Got it. Okay.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  34:51 
I believe they're in the in this larger print out.  I have an extra copy which you can review. 
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  34:58 
Thank you so much. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  35:05 
Mr. Chair, they were, I believe the city clerk did post them on the city's website, but it was too 
late to be on the agenda, but they are there and certainly copies can be made available. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  35:17 
Okay, so just to review a little bit where we are. So, the goal for tonight is the process that first 
set of 58 surveillance technology impact reports. And then at future meetings, we will review the 
annual surveillance report and the surveillance use policy. So, if committee members, the 
council, the ACLU have any specific questions about any of those 50 reports, we can get into 
that a little bit. We do want to keep track of time because we don't want to go forever. And we 
also want to hear from the public. But you know if there's any questions, this is the time. Vice 
Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  36:13 
Thank you, Mr. Chair through you. I just have a question around. It seems like people are using 
different... like, number one, number two different buckets and categories for different, 
different... Sorry, I'm not organized. My thoughts right now. Okay. Different departments are 
using different categories around describing that surveillance technology. So, describe the how 
the surveillance technology will work, what is the purpose and even within the police department 
the categories are different. So, I'm just curious if, if Ms. Matthews can tell us how these work, 
how these were came up with. How these different things were come up with and why it's 
different across departments and what is the reasoning behind it? If that makes any sense at 
all? 
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  37:07 
I will happily answer it for you, Mr. Cherish to the best of my ability on that. So, I think one of the 
things we found in the initial kind of compliance round is that understandably, different 
departments thought about and phrase to their descriptions of the surveillance technologies 
different. It’s just, just human nature, people describe things differently. And there admittedly 
was not, you know, a large backstop, through the city manager's office through me to make

everything uniform. We wanted departments to be as detailed as they could and to provide the 
information about the technologies they were using, since they are the most knowledgeable. So 
that I think is a little bit of why some of the descriptions are just different depending on who 
completed the forms from the departments. For the purposes of the technology, those purposes, 
for the most part are linked with the permissible purposes in the surveillance use policy draft 
that's before the committee. So it was, again, just that attempt to say, these are the reasons that 
technologies can be used. And we wanted departments to be thinking about that and making 
sure that their uses were lining up appropriately. And that is what they considered and then 
reported based on whatever the individual technology was used for. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  38:25 
Thank you, through you. I understand that different departments use technology differently and 
have different uses then their descriptions might vary. It just makes it really difficult to be reading 
this in total. And even within the police department there are, it seems to be different 
descriptions based on what the technology is. So, I don't know if, if anyone else found that really 
difficult when they were kind of going through and trying to look, you're going back and forth 
between human resources, the water department and then police and fire. So that's one thing I 
had questions about. About whether or not that could be better streamlined, even within the 
departments. So, and then my second question is in terms of, not to pick on the police 
department, but it's under the what is the purpose of the surveillance technology? If things could 
be a little bit more described and detailed on what exactly the purpose is. It does seem like 
there's kind of bullet points and buckets that get used over and over and over. And I think just 
when you're reviewing these reports, if you were reviewing them again and total at it, it would be 
easier to go through for us to figure out what exactly the purpose of the surveillance technology 
is not that they fit within these three bullet points and items. So those were the questions and 
concerns I had around the, this first round of surveillance reporting and how we could move 
forward in the future to make them more streamlined, and easier to read. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  40:00 
Thank you, Vice Mayor, I fully share those concerns as well. And I also noted that question 
number eight on these reports, which is about disproportionate impacts was often not really 
answered. And that's one of the most important aspects of this ordinance and this process. So, 
you know, the one example that really stood out to me was number 20, on the school bus 
cameras, where it basically says that the cameras impact all the students on the bus equally 
and how do we know that? So, I think it's really important that we go back and really begin to 
analyze the use of these technologies and make sure that, as we try to answer that question, it's 
backed by data. And if we don't know, then we can say, well, we don't know, if there's a 
disproportionate impact, which again, would flag for us to maybe ask for more scrutiny or data 
on that particular technology use, but to simply state that it impacts everyone equally did feel a 
little, you know, incorrect to me, because we don't really know that that's true. Any other 
questions or concerns? Kade. 
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  41:41 
Through you, Mr. Chair. First of all, I want to say that I submitted some comments in writing to 
the, for the record for this meeting. And I want to apologize because those comments, say that 
there's nothing in these reports about surveillance in the school system and I see that the 
amended report actually does include some technology impact reports from the Cambridge 
public schools, so please disregard, disregard that part of my letter. That said, I share the 
concern of yours, Mr. Chair, that the information in the, specifically in the police technology 
impact reports about disparate impact seems to you know, it may be that, it may be that we are 
we sort of have a different understanding of what that means. For example, you know, one of

the technologies that the police reported on is a live scan booking system that fingerprints, all 
arrestees. And if I remember correctly, the report said something like, you know, there's no 
disparate impact here, because everyone who's arrested is subjected to this process. Well, so 
that's one way of looking at it. Another way of looking at it is that there may be racial disparities 
in the arrests, and so if that's the case, then in fact, there would be a desperate impact in terms 
of who's getting fingerprinted, because maybe a certain population is, is getting arrested more. 
So that's, you know, food for thought. I don't want to take up too much time. I want to say at the 
outset, I appreciate what Nancy said, you know, this has been a long process. I know, it's been 
a lot of work for the city. I don't know if any of you paid any attention to the Senate trial today in 
DC. But I think that folks in Cambridge should be really proud of your local government because 
it is not dysfunctional, like our federal government. It is actually quite functional. And I 
appreciate that it takes a lot of work and commitment to, you know, actually breathe life into a 
local democracy.  
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  43:42 
So, I just want to say at the outset that the ACLU is aware of that and appreciative of how much 
work it takes, and we think it's really important, this is not just for checking boxes. It's important 
that people in their community know what their government is doing, especially with sensitive 
information about them. So, I just wanted to say that at the outset, having said that we have a 
significant number of concerns with some of the reports submitted by the police department. I 
have a list of them in this letter that again, I would encourage you to ignore the second 
paragraph of please, that I'm happy to pass out of, you know, if you're interested in seeing a 
copy of it. I can, I'm not going to read the list of the specific ones that were concerned about. I'll 
get into a couple of examples briefly, because I think that might help. You know, explain some 
of our concerns. So, a couple of I highlighted three specific technologies in this letter that we're 
very concerned about. And generally, our concern is that there's not enough information in 
these reports. That there's insufficient information, the council is not going to be able to 
adequately evaluate whether or not these technologies are right for Cambridge without more 
information. So, the first that I detail in this letter is Coplink. The report, on Coplink is very 
vague, doesn't really contain any information about what types of records, the Cambridge Police 
Department contributes to the Coplink system, what types of information other departments 
contribute to that system? What information is available to Cambridge Police Department 
officials through the Coplink database? And this is particularly concerning to us at the ACLU 
because through other work, through public records requests that we've done with other 
departments throughout the state, we've pieced together more, much more comprehensive 
picture of what Coplink actually looks like then what the technology impact report has offered 
the council and it's a lot of information. It's a significant amount of information about lots of 
people. It's not just that there's a lot of information in that database. There's a there's a facial 
recognition feature that's available through Coplink. And I think that's really salient information 
for the council to know given what happened in the past couple of weeks when the council voted 
to prohibit city employees from using facial recognition, so that tool is called face match. And it, 
it allows users of the database to upload images of unknown persons, and then try to identify 
them based on 4 million mug shots that are contained in that system. 
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  46:21 
Another concern that we have is that the public records work that we did provided some 
documents to us that indicated that we think ICE has access. Some employees of immigration 
have access to the Coplink database that I believe is maintained by the state government here 
in Massachusetts. So, it's that kind of information that I think, you know, is really necessary for 
the city to provide so that folks on the council can properly evaluate what's really going on. 
Another example of that is the clear database. The clear database is described as merely a you

know, a set of public records you know, it's not a big deal. The work that we've done again 
elsewhere, and other public records work has indicated that clear is actually a very, very 
invasive database that there are huge quantities of sometimes not public information about, 
again, millions or hundreds of millions of people in this system. So, to kind of just say, well, you 
know, there's nothing to worry about, because these are all public records. First of all, even if it 
were the case that they were all public records, data brokers that amass these massive troves 
of information about people are aware that that is very sensitive information. So, it's not 
accurate to say that merely because something only holds public records that it's not sensitive. 
This is not information, for example, that anybody who does not have a clear license to use this 
database would be able to obtain just on the public Internet. Second, clear's own website, which 
clear is a database system that's maintained by a company called Thomson Reuters. If you go 
to that website, you'll see that they, they are very public about the fact that there is nonpublic 
information in this database, including a trove of 7 billion license plate reader records showing 
where hundreds of millions of people in the country have been driving, you know, even though 
they're not suspected of a crime.  
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  48:16 
So that's one example of information that may be accessible to Cambridge Police Department 
officials through the system. And that's not reflected in the technology impact report. So, you 
know, just generally looking for a lot more detail about what these systems are, what kinds of 
data are inside of them, you know, who contributes that information? Who on the Cambridge 
Police Department has access to those database systems and under what circumstances they 
can access that data? And those concerns apply to a lot of the database systems in here, 
including the brick omega dashboard, including others that you know, I'm not going to get into in 
detail. And then finally, the third that I want to flag is this focus to turns database. It seems to 
me, given the various, you know, short description of the system in the technology impact report 
that what's being described as some sort of predictive policing system. Again, that's not really 
clear, because there's not a whole lot of information there. Predictive policing, for those of you 
don't know, is a very controversial law enforcement tool. Depending on how it's used, it can 
potentially reproduce some historical bias. And you know, you're nodding I know, I know that 
you know, this Commissioner.  
 
Kade Crockford of the ACLU  49:28 
And so it would be really helpful I think, for the for the council to have more information about 
how the system is being used by the Cambridge police department, what types of data are 
informing the system, for example, you know, this system will have very different outputs if you 
train it or give it you know, feed it information based on violent crime as opposed to information 
for example, about drug crimes or trespassing or disorderly conduct, you know, more quality of 
life type crimes that often have much higher rates of racial disparity, then something like you 
know, murder or something like that. Crimes that the police can't ignore, and that people 
generally call 911 to report. On the other hand, these other crimes are typically crimes that that 
reflect higher levels of police bias, or at least disproportionate policing, because there are 
crimes that police can ignore, right? I mean, we see, for example, in New York City, smoking 
marijuana is illegal. 95% of the people arrested for it are black and Latino, I can tell you as 
someone who smoked weed in New York City, it's not because white people don't smoke 
marijuana in New York City. So anyway, you know, using those kinds of data to inform a system 
like that can really have significant racial bias outcome. So, in other words, the public, you 
know, and the council in this case, in order to be able to make an informed decision about 
whether a technology like that is appropriate for Cambridge needs more information. And then 
you know, I just conclude by saying that there are two minor issues I think generally when any 
city department is reporting to the council about technology that conducts video surveillance.

Providing information about whether that system is also capable of recording or transmitting 
audio is critical just for, you know, compliance with the wiretap law and for, you know, for the 
council's information, to know, you know, to be able to make an informed decision about 
whether or not the technology is appropriate for Cambridge. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  51:27 
Thank you. So, I would like if we could address those two specific ones because we might be 
able to provide that information on the spot. So, the first one was regarding the school bus 
cameras, and whether or not those record audio. 
 
James Maloney, Chief Operating Officer, Cambridge Public Schools  51:58 
Yes, sir, they do. There are signs on the bus that say, entering that video and audio recording is 
in place. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  52:07 
Great. So, I don't know if it's possible to update the technology back report immediately or 
whether we have to wait, if you can submit another one to us to indicate that information. Is 
there an amendment process that that we should follow? 
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  52:32 
Through you, Mr. Chair, one of the things we had discussed as a possibility procedure wise 
after this meeting is there are likely going to be surveillance technology impact reports that the 
committee and presumably the council will want that additional detail on. Any surveillance 
technology impact report to go before the council has to be posted seven days in advance and 
again requires full council approval. So our plan would be to take into consideration every, all 
the feedback that's receives night and make changes to the technology impact reports currently 
before the committee before they are submitted to the council for that review and approval, and 
we can flag them to show specifically what changes have been made in the way that we did with 
the supplemental police reports. So that it's very clear, but I think that would be potentially... not 
yet. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  53:25 
Mr. Chair, if I could, I just wanted to add that we have compiled a list of things that had top 
priority in terms of timing. And one of those items actually is the school bus cameras which Mr. 
Maloney could probably provide more detail on but because of the way the state procurement 
process works, all of the municipalities put out a particular IFB, information for bids, at around 
this time of the year. And then once the prices come in from the school bus companies, the 
city's put out an RFP and then will award a bid and then they need to have the contract in place 
and the buses on the road by August for the school year. So I don't know, Jimmy, if you wanted 
to add anything to that, but so it's very important for these 11 items which we could provide a list 
of to the committee of highest priority in terms of timing, that we do get questions about any 
additional information the committee wants with respect to those. So that hopefully we can 
answer all your questions and move on. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  54:27 
Thank you. I appreciate that. And I think it's sufficient for us to know on the floor that in fact, they 
record audio for us to forward them back to the council and then if you can update them in the 
meantime so that when we're considering them as a, as a full body, we have that in front of us 
that would be great. And so, the next one was the mile vision traffic counting cameras, does not 
indicate what happens to the MAC address data. Who hold those records or whether they are 
deleted or used for a purpose beyond traffic planning?

Joseph Barr, Director of Traffic, Parking & Transportation  55:10 
just for the record Joe Barr, Director of Traffic, Parking and Transportation. So the, the 
permanently installed ones that we have do not do any of that but the ones that are installed on 
a, I think the second of the two camera related impact reports, they do have the capability of 
recording MAC addresses for the purposes of providing travel time information. And we don't 
personally install those on our, for our purposes are used by traffic consultants for generally for 
developer traffic studies, but for a range of traffic studies. So, we don't retain the data ourselves. 
It's retained by the actually by mile vision itself and analyze that way. I think and I'll let the city 
solicitor add any thought she had. I think we, in general, we need to develop a more organized 
permitting process for those because we've typically they've been installed on our infrastructure. 
And they, you know, which has not resulted in any physical problems leaving aside the sort of 
privacy issues, but we need both for physical and privacy reasons to make sure that we have 
better control over those types of installations, which is something that very few communities 
do. But as part of that, we would want to implement procedures that would ensure that going 
forward, the either there don't have that capability or that there, that capability is activated, or 
that there's some sort of process put in place where those MAC addresses are anonymized, 
which would still allow for, you know, the travel time information to be recorded but would not 
allow you to sort of reverse that and figure out you know, the actual MAC address that was 
present at a given time. So, I think, you know, in the interim prior to us having those 
requirements in place, I think we would tell the, the traffic consultants that they need to come up 
with an alternative solution for data collection. And, you know, we would hope to get that 
procedure in place quickly, because that will be an impact for those consultants who want to try 
to resolve that, but obviously, the you know, City Council's policies and the ordinances would be 
more important than their convenience. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  57:31 
Thanks. So, if that could also be updated in the surveillance technology impact report, that will 
be helpful. Okay, thank you. So those were the only two that specifically that the, in the ACLU 
letter, are there other specific reports? Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  57:55 
I had a question about one of the ones in the supplemental report. It's the brick omega 
dashboard. So, a question specifically about this technology, but then sort of ties into a larger 
question about brick, and that we know the Boston regional Intelligence Center and sort of 
operates differently than the Cambridge police force. And that correct me if I'm wrong I don't 
think the Cambridge police force shares data with ICE, but the last thing regional Intelligence 
Center does, and in particular, looking at an article from just earlier this month at the Boston 
Public Schools, got... gave a hundred incident reports to brick and that  those were accessible 
by ICE. So just trying to understand with brick omega dashboard, if it's something just as part of 
this regional intelligence partnership, if it's... Do Cambridge purchasing this entirely, or if it's sort 
of a shared expense with the other municipalities in the region, and then the larger question is, 
what kind of information is being shared with brick? Whether it's aggregate versus personalized, 
um, you know, what we might know about what could be accessed by ICE. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  58:58 
So just for clarification. This is surveillance technology impact report number 12. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  59:04 
Yes, exactly. Thanks.

Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  59:09 
Through you, Mr. Chair. Yeah. So the things that we contribute to the brick... well, let me back 
up for a minute and address something that the ACLU, we are working with the ACLU on 
providing more information, the three technologies that Ms. Crockford mentioned, up until right 
before the meeting, we were gathering more information to make sure that the information that 
we provide you and the public is more robust so that you can make a better informed decision 
with... that's why you see supplementals being submitted because we're, you know, working 
back and forth with the ACLU to provide more information. As far as the brick goes, obviously, 
its regional honor that allows us to participate and be good regional partners, but the information 
that we provide are arrest reports that have been approved, incident and filled interview 
observation reports for only certain cases, anything that's confidential where it involves a 
domestic or juvenile or sexual assault, those are excluded from being reported. And we don't 
determine access to the brick. The brick actually determines who can access and they obviously 
grant us access to the brick. So, it's only arrest reports after they've been reviewed and 
approved, certain field interrogation observation reports and specifically as they pertain to 
crimes and crime patterns, and ongoing investigations, and other things are excluded like 
domestic, anything that involves a juvenile or sexual assault. 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  60:48 
And, costs there, there's no cost associated to the municipalities that participate. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  60:57 
Thank you.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  61:01 
Any further questions? All right, why don't we go to public comment? And then we can come 
back and have further discussion. So, I'll open public comment. Please give your name and 
address. And I'll give no more than five minutes, please. 
 
Alex Matthews  61:23 
Hi, my name is Alex Matthews. I am the chairman of digital fourth, which is a volunteer based 
civil liberties organization that meets here in Cambridge every week. And we have done since 
2012. We've been involved with the development of this ordinance, and we are keenly involved, 
keenly interested in the reports that result. And I apologize for any disturbance from Little 
Tommy during these comments. I echo the concerns that several of the counselors and the was 
Crockford have raised here. The intent and spirit of developing surveillance, impact reports was 
not for three lines to be provided on why we should not we need to worry about the privacy 
impacts of a given technology. Why they are minimal because they apply to everyone that 
doesn't make the minimal. Why? A good a good example, I'm going to illustrate our concerns 
with the newly submitted surveillance reports relating to the securely web monitoring system in 
the Cambridge public schools. Here, the privacy impacts that surveillance technology has, it 
says minimal privacy impact.  
 
Alex Matthews  62:52 
The web filter on the school issued Chromebook is the same whether used in school or not. All 
students and parents are advised through Chromebook User agreements that the web filter will 
be employed both in school and off campus. So, to summarize, the school district has partnered 
with a third-party vendor to monitor all browsing that is conducted on school issued 
Chromebooks, whether it's school or at home. And because people are advised of that in a click 
wrap contract, and because it happens both on and off campus, apparently the privacy impacts 
are minimal. This is ridiculous. Frankly, nobody with any consciousness of the privacy concerns

here should have written that the privacy impacts were minimal. We need to carefully consider 
whether we want as part of city policy for the web browsing on mandatorily School issued 
computers to be tracked and sent to a third-party vendor who associate them with an individual 
student ID. And then as far as I'm aware, sell and package that to other third parties to whatever 
extent they want to do. None of that is covered in this single page report. What are the fiscal 
costs of security, including initial costs, ongoing maintenance and personal costs and source of 
funds? N/A, it says, well, this must be magical software. Not only is it free, but security isn't 
benefiting in any way from it. And it doesn't cost anything to maintain. It doesn't cost any 
personnel costs of these public-school systems to deal with anything to do with school security 
and never will. This is not credible. And this is typical of the problems that are with the 
surveillance impact. reports that are submitted another example, the report on ShotSpotter, 
which was so inadequate to begin with, that, further details have had to be submitted. The point 
that you were making Councillor Zondervan about disparate impact applies quite significantly 
here. ShotSpotter sensors, according to the updated report, cover 1.1 square mile of the city, 
which 1.1 square miles. We don't know. You don't know. This report might tell you and without 
knowing which parts of the city it covers, how can we possibly assess whether discrete 
minorities within the city are disproportionately affected? We can't. 
 
Alex Matthews  65:51 
I'm not saying that we need to know exactly what brick the sense sensor lies by, but you as 
counselors need to have enough information to determine whether there are adverse impacts 
that are related to where people live, and work. So, I encourage these reports to be looked at 
again, they are not inherently going to be one-page things. I appreciate that the city has been 
doing a lot of work and has had relatively little time. But frankly, that's because of the huge 
variety and number of surveillance technologies that turn out to be used by the city. And in order 
for city councilors to make a meaningful judgment as to, as to whether they should be approved 
for continued use. The city departments that use these technologies need to make a good faith 
effort to confront the genuine privacy issues involved. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  66:51 
Thank you. Anyone else? Seeing none, I will entertain a motion to close public comment. All in 
favor? Any opposed? The motion carries public comment is now closed. We can have general 
discussion. Again, we're focusing on the surveillance technology impact reports before us. Vice 
Mayor. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  67:27 
So, thank you. This isn't necessarily a question about the surveillance impact technology 
reports. Although I, I do have more to say I'll let other people speak to which reports we're going 
to accept and which ones we're not going to tonight, but I did have a question about how 
technology that we are purchasing is being communicated to us that will fall under their 
surveillance technology ordinance. For example, Monday night, we all approved the fire 
departments use of purchasing laryngoscopes. And I think we were all surprised when I pulled it 
that it would, that this technology would fall under the surveillance technology ordinance. It was 
not communicated in the city managers report. And I'm wondering going forward is, is there a 
way that that can be communicated to us better? So that we understand that we when we are 
procuring things, even though I know that we're going to have to be getting these reports, I think 
it's important for us to understand when we are approving an allocation, what is or is not 
surveillance technology, I would never in a million years have... I had other questions about that 
particular technology and what it was used for and where it was going to be deployed. But I 
never in a million years thought it was going to be a computer that was going to you know, be 
taking video not only of the inside of somebody's throat, but in and out and somebody's full face,

and that that was going to be stored somewhere, perhaps shared by a third party. So, I'm just 
wondering if you know, if the City Manager's office and the law department can speak to how 
that will be communicated, going forward that we will know that without randomly pulling 
something, because we would not have known had I not pulled it? 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  69:14 
Through you Mr. Chair. I mean, one thing I would say is that, I believe the council wanted to 
approve it provisionally contingent upon this process. So that would not have come to the 
council for full approval unless it had gone through this process, if it was subject to the 
surveillance ordinance. So, every technology that might be is reviewed by the law department 
and we make a determination as to whether it is or isn't. And we're trying to put in place 
procedures both in the purchasing department and in all purchasing processes for departments 
that are trying to procure new technologies or whatever, all sorts of things to make sure that we 
have that review before it goes forward so that it comes to the council first. And then we would 
go through the subsequent process with a few of these things like the laryngoscope, which I 
don't know if the fire department wanted to speak to that, but it's something that they believe is 
critical for life safety reasons, wanted to get it before the council as soon as possible, even 
though it was going to be dependent upon the further review by this committee and the full 
Council, under the surveillance ordinance. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  70:27 
Thank you. And I understand that. I just think even though it was a personal thing, there is a 
way to communicate to the council at that time of the vote, that it may be subject to the 
surveillance ordinance, and it will need to go through this process. And I think having a better 
understanding at that time of why rather than the blurb that was given to us was just that we're 
going to buy these, this piece of equipment and no explanation of whether or not it was going to 
have a computer or even might be subject to the surveillance ordinance. So just some way of 
we know when putting together that city managers agenda and putting together those items, I 
think just saying something that would telegraph to us that. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  71:11 
Yeah, if I might just interject it. First of all, I completely agree. And I would suggest that going 
forward as much as possible when there is a procurement, and there's an anticipated impact, 
that the procurement comes with a surveillance technology impact report, even if it's quite 
minimal, just so that that flags to us that this is subject to the ordinance, and then it allows us to 
ask questions and get more clarifying information. 
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  71:43 
Through you, Mr. Chair, that's absolutely the process that we anticipate using moving forward, I 
think to the vice marriage point, you were not the only person who did not initially think that a 
laryngoscope was going to be a surveillance technology and that goes back to the, the 
continuing education and discussion process that the city manager's office will lead. As soon as 
it was recognized that this is something that's going to require the surveillance review. That was 
the information that we put before the council. So, the appropriation was approved. But this 
surveillance technology impact report that was submitted as the supplement is because we 
would not move forward in any other way without the council's review and approval of that 
technology, once it was discovered that it's subject to the ordinance.  We're working with... We 
will be working with budget and finance, the E-Gov process, purchasing department, all the 
inroads that we've been able to identify as we've actually gone through this review and approval 
process on the ground. We will be working with them to continue this refinement and make sure 
that when any initial information about a technology procurement or appropriation to procure the

technology is coming to the council. It's accompanied by that technology impact report that is 
absolutely the process that we want to have in place. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  73:00 
Just to add to that, since the fire department is here, I had specific questions that I would like to 
see on the on the impact report. Right? How much of somebody's face will you see going in and 
out? Will they be used to communicate via, you know, their, to their doctors? How much of that 
will be kept on an SD card versus in the cloud? I think what I'm what I'm trying to get at night 
what I think what you're hearing from a lot of us is that some of this information is very light on 
details. And I think it's really important as many details and many of those questions that you 
can think about and ask yourselves should be on this report. We shouldn't necessarily need to 
ask further questions. So if it's, if it's a question you've asked yourself,  it should be written and 
telegraphed and communicated through these impact reports so that we know exactly if you're 
using those for example in a training video or going over specific incident, Is there a way that 
technology can put a black box over somebody who's faced to anonymize it? I would like to see 
that on all of these. And I think that's where I was speaking earlier around some of these police 
reports, I would like to see that greater level of detail on all of the, all of the surveillance 
technology that is, is here that is used by the police department, because I think that's where I 
think a lot of us feel like the surveillance feels like we need to know a lot more to make informed 
decisions. So, I don't know how we move forward from here and sending certain reports back 
for more information, but I would say that the police department reports for me feel a lot lighter 
on details than some of the other ones and where I feel like we need to know the most detail. 
So, I'm going to yield the floor at this time for my colleagues’ comments. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  74:55 
Thank you, vice mayor and just to answer your question, again, the goal of tonight's meeting is 
to forward all of these back to the full council unless we have real significant concerns that any 
of them need to be held back. As part of that process, there will be opportunities to further 
update them. The full Council has to vote before they are approved. So keeping them in 
committee doesn't necessarily change anything again, unless we feel that it's really so 
insufficient, that it's not ready for the council to, to look at so that's, you know, ultimately up to all 
of us to decide if we want to hold any of them back or, or not, but when our questions should be 
answered either way. And I do want to add, you know, as a computer practitioner myself, I think 
pretty much any technology that we are using is going to be subject to this, to this ordinance. So 
that would be the default assumption, you know if this laryngoscope. So, I don't know exactly 
how to pronounce it either comes with a computer, it's probably going to be subject to the 
ordinance. So, I think we really need to operate with that as the default assumption and then, 
you know, obviously, if there's valid exemptions, then maybe not. Any other questions or 
comments? And I did have a few specific questions. Again, you know, I've mentioned this 
before, but question number eight, really wasn't answered on many of these and a number four, 
which is the Atlas RMV system. Again, we don't know if there are disproportionate impacts or 
not. I suspect that there are. I did question a little bit whether our city firewall is really 
surveillance I mean, it's unless we're collecting IP addresses that we could trace back to PII. I'm 
not sure why we would consider that surveillance. 
 
Jennifer Matthews, Assistant to the City Manager  77:13 
Through you, Mr. Chair, I just wanted to clarify, as we go through the specific reports, the 
reports that have the questions one through eight that are very detailed are in fact the annual 
surveillance reports. So those I believe, is still your plan to keep before the committee and we 
can answer any questions, but they would stay before the committee for further review, and we 
can supplement those. But then for the surveillance technology impact reports, if those moved

on to the full Council, again, the supplement, I just wanted to make sure that as departments are 
answering the questions, they're looking at the right, the right reports for you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  77:48 
Thanks. I really appreciate that. And this is very confusing. It's particularly confusing to me that 
the question about disproportionate impacts would be on the annual report but not on the impact 
report. I mean, that seems very weird, considering it's an impact that we're trying to anticipate. 
In any case that I had similar concerns about number seven, which again is in the annual 
reports on Westlaw. I thought number eight, which is web server access and error logging. I 
thought that gave a good answer. I think I have that number wrong. Yeah, but I think the 
example I was thinking of was actually the public health Maven impact report where they were 
very detailed about potential impacts on, on different communities. And then the bus camera. I 
had a question on the water meters. Do we use those to identify potential leaks? 
 
Sam Corda, Managing Director, Cambridge Water Department  79:33 
Do you Mr. Chair? Yes, we will monitor usage couple times a week and then based on that, see 
if it's changed versus the last six months and then we will make a call or email or text message 
people we have phones with to say that they might have a problem. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  79:52 
Great, thank you. That's very useful. Useful surveillance. I did have significant concerns about 
the Chromebooks, and this was mentioned in public comments, and the fact that we are 
essentially censoring information access to, for our students. And people are undoubtedly 
familiar with recent controversies that have arisen around that. And I think it's intuitively would 
seem like that would have a very disparate impact because, presumably, students of wealthier 
families can choose to use their own computers that are not subject to that censorship, whereas 
students from poorer families might be limited to the Chromebook are continue Obviously 
subject to that censorship whether at home or in the school and I, I think that is deeply 
concerning. And we should really look into whether we want to continue that as a, as a policy of 
our, our city. Then I had some questions about the ShotSpotter technology. There were 
concerns raised about it last year and it would be helpful to understand, you know, how is the 
police using this technology? And is it really providing any useful information that we couldn't 
obtain in another way? 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  81:45 
Through you Mr. Chair. So how are we utilize it, or you want to explain the technology? Or you... 
okay? So basically, what it is, is a system a microphones. ShotSpotter has an algorithm that is 
trained to identify sounds that it classifies as gun fire. When it does, it has, they have an actual 
human analyst listen to the sound in their headquarters in California. And if it actually sounds 
like gunfire. They send us a, just a brief, through the app, a brief snippet of that sound, that 
gunfire sound. We then, it then reports to ECC and we are dispatched. We go to a location and 
we try to find other evidence of that gun fire. What it is, is an ever-vigilant listening system, 
meaning that you or me may become so numb to hearing gunfire in our neighborhood that we 
not even pick up the phone letting folks know that gunfire happened. Sometimes it's not gunfire, 
sometimes with fireworks, sometimes it's a car backfiring or a steel plate with somebody driving 
over to steel plate. So, the officers will go and try to identify, corroborate whether it was gunfire 
or not, or just what... Once we learn over gunfire incident, then we report that out to the public, 
no matter whether there was a victim or anything, we find any corroborating evidence and we 
put that out. Last year, we had, you know, one actual gunshot victim in the whole City of 
Cambridge, where we had several other incidents of gunfire that we would not have known 
about, if not for ShotSpotter. We don't have listening capabilities other than what that, that small

snippet of sound that ShotSpotter sends to us. When it's activated. We initially, when it was 
installed, it was based on the prevalence of gunshot victims and reports of gunfire. It continues 
to be the locations of that 1.1 square mile that continues to be that, it has not the location hasn't 
changed. The microphones haven't changed but that's the area of the city where, shots have 
been reported or and, you know, more so than any anything else. I think putting the exact 
location of microphones and I'm not saying that it was suggested that we put that there. I think it 
emboldened individuals who think they're not in that coverage area to then, you know, fire 
gunshot. So, the information that we provide we viewed all of these as working documents, 
knowing that we would have literally until March to work with the ACLU and hash out concerns. 
It was about compliance. And then now, that's why you see so many supplemental submitted 
and that's why you'll continue to see that submitted. They continue to point out, you know, make 
salient points, some that we think should be better addressed through policy for instance, like 
Coplink and our using it regionally. 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  84:56 
That facial recognition component of it while we're in the process. putting out a policy as soon 
as the ordinance was, as soon as the ban was, putting out a policy, facial recognition, 
technology. Flat out ban any, any... you can't access that component. It'll be, you'll be violating 
departmental policy. So, we understand that. One of the questions that was raised about our 
poll cameras, we, we apply those in investigative situations only when there's a serious public 
safety concern, and only in public spaces, and so infrequently, but our policy, our practice was 
that it, you only could deploy one with the approval of Superintendent or above but are there 
was no policy to say that. So now the policy that we're preparing and soon to put up, says only 
upon approval of the superintendent or above. And last year... how many time did we deploy the 
cameras last year? I think one time and since I've been here in two and a half years, three 
times. So, you know, I readily admit that there's a potential for, you know, impact. However, the 
actual impact here may, you know, not be realized. When it comes to live scan. One. There's a 
requirement that anybody who's arrested has to be fingerprinted. The courts won't accept them 
unless they're fingerprinted. I think the analysis is different if our arrests are having a disparate 
impact on communities of color or disproportionate contact. That's a different analysis. But that 
live scan system as a setup it, it and my semantics of it. It is not, it doesn't pose a 
disproportionate impact. Whoever comes in the headquarters and is arrested has to be 
fingerprinted per state law or federal law. The courts won't even accept a body who hasn't been 
fingerprinted. So, we can have to fingerprint every, you know, a necessary component of a 
modern-day police department to have that technology. I think that analysis as to disparate, or 
disproportionate impact, is held in another place. Is better, you know, done somewhere else like 
reviewing arrest practices as opposed to what livescan does. We have to use that technology. 
And I'm not sitting here, I'm not going to address every single point that was brought up. But the 
point is that we are viewing these as living documents that we know you have, the council had 
the full review in March and we believe that we'll be able to in that timeframe, work out any 
information concerns and you know, it hasn't been an adversarial process up to now and it won't 
be moving forward. We're providing supplemental information and more information where 
necessary. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  88:02 
Thank you, Commissioner. I appreciate that. I do want to say that in terms of the disparate 
impacts, I completely recognize the distinction that you're drawing, I think there is still room to 
really dig into that question. And, and ask, ask ourselves, if particular communities are being 
impacted. Not precisely because of that technology, but because of our arrest practices. 
Nonetheless, that could be revealed to us through this process, right. And then we could take 
action. We can't in this particular case, say don't use the technology, I understand that. But it

might lead us to understand other things we could do to mitigate or reduce those impacts. On 
the, on the ShotSpotter. Just, you know, again, I understand how it works and how you are 
using it now and then thank you for that clarifying explanation. That I guess, again, you know, 
it's clear, first of all, that it does have a disparate impact on the community where it's being 
used, right? Because other communities don't have that technology, which could be good or 
bad, right? If there's a gunshot happening there, they don't know about it, you don't know about 
it, potentially. And vice versa. It could lead a lot of police activity into a particular area, that most 
of the time maybe spurious, right. And if there is a real incident and somebody got hurt, then 
presumably you would you would know about that. And so, you know, I do question whether we 
need that technology, and I think, part of this process, you know, obviously not all of it tonight, 
but part of this process really should be to ask ourselves, do we need all this surveillance, right? 
Because once we start using it, it's very difficult to say let's stop so I think we need to ask some 
of those difficult questions so that we're not just expanding this surveillance forever and ever 
and ever. And losing track of it. And I want to recognize Councillor McGovern, but if you had a 
quick response. 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  90:18 
Through you, Mr. Chair, I would just add that when we had that spate of gunfire that resulted in 
the task force being erected. We're sitting at average is 12 to 13 shooting victims a year. That 
year, we had five shooting victims, so we had way down, but our shooting incidents were way 
up. Many of those were no victim, one case in two cases, and would have went unreported, if 
not for the technology, so if not for that technology, alerting us to the gunfire, us confirming that 
there was gunfire and then making that information public, which any hit that we have we do we 
make public, then the need for that concerted effort that taskforce might have gone unnoticed 
because a lot of those incidents weren't reported and didn't weren't attached to a shooting victim 
where we would have activated and weren't called it ShotSpotter alerted us to those. So just a 
point of reference.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  91:17 
Thank you. Councillor McGovern. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  91:18 
Thank you. And I was actually going to mention the ShotSpotter on a follow up Councillor 
Zondervan. And I, not to debate whether it's a good technology or not. I think there is I think it's 
given us information, we, we say we want transparency, and we want to know what's going on 
in this. We wouldn't have known all those instance. So, I don't want to debate the technology 
itself. But when I look at the report, you know, look through all of these as we've been sitting 
here and all of these reports that maybe I missed one or two that talk about disproportionality, 
they all say no. That seems odd to me. I mean, maybe that's true, but it seems strange to me 
that every single one of them says nope, nothing going on here. It does lead to that, you know, I 
think back to the training we all went to last week with all the cards on the table about, you 
know, who's in the room making the decisions and who's looking at the information and who's 
assessing the information and reporting the information or what have you. And it you know, just 
it just odd to me that none of these are said yes, there's a disproportional impact. And so, I 
think, you know, for ShotSpotter, for example, even if this report said something like, you know, 
this although this technology detects the sound of gunshots universally, it should be noted that it 
is used in areas where there are where there has been increased gun activity, which happened 
to be areas that are lower income and higher minority neighborhoods, so at least that and then 
that leads to that discussion. So, again, I think, you know, that, you know, that information is 
important for us to have and it is so I guess, to add to the chorus, I guess, of saying you know 
digging deeper and peeling away more when looking at those types of impacts.   And you know,

and what may come of it. And we may say, well, okay, that's where it needs to be, because 
that's where things are happening. Or we may say, Well, wait a minute, to your point. You know, 
if, you know, maybe that gunshot that happens in fresh pond goes unnoticed, because we say 
we don't have the technology there. So, it does allow for that conversation to happen. So, I do, I 
just want to echo what my colleagues are saying. And there is a way to dig a little deeper I think 
with this and at least acknowledge that the technology in some instances are being used in 
areas that in certain areas and not others, and what is the reason for that? And then we can 
debate whether that reason makes sense or not. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  93:50 
Thank you. Any other comments? So are there any reports that my colleagues feel should be 
held in committee or do you feel comfortable sending these back to the council again, 
understanding that they will be supplemented with additional information based on this 
discussion and our questions. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  94:15 
So just a point of information. So we will be forwarding these reports on but at the same time, 
the police commissioner and his team will be working with Crockford at the ACLU to further dig 
into some of these description, descriptors, descriptions to give us a fuller picture of these, all of 
these reports or, sorry, the reports from the police department specifically. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  94:42 
That is my understanding and it's not just limited to the police department. So really, I think all of 
these reports should be reviewed based on tonight's discussion and any additional information 
that could be provided should be added to them as they're on the way to the council so to 
speak. And as Ms. Matthews has indicated, the department will be creating a website as well, 
where these will be posted. And so that should make it easier for us to review them and receive 
that information as well. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  95:18 
Through you Mr. Chair. Earlier, Ms. Matthews, you talked about how, you know, everyone fills 
them out differently. And so, you know, part of the training piece, let's maybe take the ones that 
are the examples of how it should be done and share those around and show people what the 
models are so that they can have a little guidance and how to do it. So, obviously, the language 
is always going to be different, but I do think, you know, I do think continuity is important. And I 
know we like sometimes to in the city to allow for creativity and in individual, individualism, but 
something reports like this continuity is really important and having so you know, that your 
getting all the same information. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  96:04 
So, unless we have other comments or discussion, I would entertain a motion to forward 
all 58 surveillance technology impact reports to the council for consideration and 
adoption. All those in favor? Any opposed? So, the motion carries. Motion to adjourn. All 
in favor. And we are adjourned. Thank you, everyone.

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

Cambridge Fire proposes to use the Verathon Corporation's Glidescope Go video 
laryngoscope. This is a medical device that facilitates critical medical care by capturing 
video of the back of the throat of an unconscious person in order to place an endotracheal 
tube (breathing tube).  
 
A laryngoscope is a medical device, essentially a curved tongue depressor with a light at 
the end, that lifts the tongue out of the way and allows a paramedic to look through the 
patient's mouth and see the patient's tracheal opening in order to place a breathing tube in 
the trachea (also known as intubation).  
 
Patients who require breathing tubes are the most critical patients we see, and usually are 
not breathing at all. In order to facilitate faster and more accurate breathing tube 
placement and improve outcomes, video laryngoscopy has been developed, which places 
a camera at the end of the device and a small video screen attached so the paramedic can 
see the tracheal opening better.  

Glidescope GO records video only. There is no audio or data recording. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Documenting and improving performance of City employees. 

The purpose of the technology is to improve critical health care processes and outcomes 
in order to provide the best available medical care to the residents and visitors of the City 
of Cambridge. 
 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

This technology will be on the CFD's Paramedic units, and will also be used in training 
with manikins. The video laryngoscopes will be deployed in or around May 2020. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
The privacy impact will be zero. There are no patient identifiers associated with the video 
in the instrument. If the video is uploaded into a patient’s chart or other data storage, it 
will be considered protected health information and access will be severely limited in 
accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). If the 
video is used in case review or training, there will be no patient identifiers associated 
with it. 
 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
The initial costs will be $24,784.00, which will be funded by a federal grant. This 
includes 120 disposable blades. Once the initial supply of blades is exhausted, 
replacement blades will be purchased by CFD at a cost of $40-$52 each, depending on 
the style of blade. Training and Quality Improvement costs are impossible to determine, 
because they will be embedded within our standard training and quality processes.

•  Maintaining the safety and security of City employees, students, customers, and 

City-owned or controlled buildings 

•  Enforcing obligations to the City 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

On Student Issued Chromebooks 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

Minimal privacy impact. The web filter on the school issued Chromebooks is the same 
whether used in school or not. All students and parents are advised through Chromebook 
user agreements that the web filter will be employed both in school and off campus.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs,

December 9, 2019 

Re:  Surveillance Use Policy and Related Documents 

Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge 

Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting the following to the City Council for review 
and discussion at the December 9, 2019 Council Meeting: 

 
•  A proposed Surveillance Use Policy, which has been approved by the City Solicitor and 

the City Manager and requires Council approval; 

•  Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, describing Surveillance Technologies which 

are subject to the Ordinance, which require Council approval; and 

•  An Annual Surveillance Report compiled from Department-specific Annual 

Surveillance Reports concerning the Surveillance Technologies used by those City 
departments since December 10, 2018, which requires Council approval.  

The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, the Information Technology 
Department, the Police Department and all other City departments have worked to complete 
these materials for submission to the City Council.  Since this is my first submission to the City 
Council under the Ordinance, I am also providing background information on the compliance 
process which the City Council may find helpful.   

Background 
 

The Ordinance was adopted by the City Council on December 10, 2018, after extensive 

work between the City Council, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts 
(“ACLUM”), Cambridge residents, and City staff.  The Ordinance regulates Surveillance 
Technology that may be acquired or used by the City and balances the right to privacy with the 
need to promote and ensure safety and security.  The Ordinance also provides for informed 
public discussion about Surveillance Technologies and any impacts they have on the civil rights 
and liberties of individuals, communities and groups in the City.  

Surveillance Ordinance Requirements 
 

The Ordinance addresses the following key components:

•  A Surveillance Use Policy, applicable to each City department that possesses or uses 

Surveillance Technology or foresees doing so in the near future.  The Surveillance Use 
Policy must be approved by the City Solicitor and the City Manager and submitted by the 
City Manager to the City Council for review and approval.   

•  Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, which relate to specific Surveillance 

Technologies, must be submitted by the City Manager to the City Council before the City 
seeks funds for or acquires Surveillance Technology, uses Surveillance Technology in a 
way not previously approved by the City Council, or enters into an agreement to share 
Surveillance Technology or the Surveillance Data it gathers with a non-City entity.   
•  An Annual Surveillance Report, submitted by the City Manager to the City Council, 
pertaining to each City department whose use of Surveillance Technology has been 
previously approved by the City Council in the past year.  The first Annual Surveillance 
Report is due to the City Council by December 10, 2019.  In 2020, and annually 
thereafter, the Report is due by March 1.   

•  The City Council must hold a meeting by May 31 of each year to discuss the City’s  
Annual Surveillance Reports and must also release a public report summarizing the 
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports received by the City Council during the prior 
year.   

Timing & Content of the Attached Surveillance Use Policy and Reports 
 

The Ordinance requires the City Manager to submit a proposed Surveillance Use Policy 

within 180 days after its effective date.  The Ordinance took effect on September 10, 2019.  
Therefore, a proposed Surveillance Use Policy is due to be submitted to the City Council by 
March 8, 2020.  Because the first Annual Surveillance Report, which is due to the City Council 
by December 10, 2019, assumes the existence of a Surveillance Use Policy, I am transmitting a 
proposed Surveillance Use Policy at this time, along with the Surveillance Technology Impact 
Reports and Annual Surveillance Report, for the Council’s review and approval.   
 

•  Specifically, the proposed Surveillance Use Policy includes the following five (5) 

appendices:  

o  Appendix A–a form for City departments’ internal report to the City Solicitor of 
technologies that may be Surveillance Technology as defined in the Ordinance.   

o  Appendix B–a Surveillance Technology Impact Report form. 
o  Appendix C–an Annual Surveillance Report form.  
o  Appendix D–a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Report form. 
o  Appendix E–a checklist for City departments and Compliance Officers to use as a 

guide when completing the above-referenced forms. 

•  The attached Surveillance Technology Impact Reports completed by City departments 
relate to existing Surveillance Technology covered by the Ordinance.  Therefore, the 
dates and costs listed are the original deployment dates and known costs.   

•  As this is the first submission of an Annual Surveillance Report under the Ordinance, the 
attached Annual Surveillance Report for this year to date does not include information

regarding complaints about Surveillance Technology or about violations of the 
Surveillance Use Policy. 

Department Compliance Process 
 

For each Surveillance Technology that was determined to be subject to the Ordinance, 

Department Heads were asked to review and confirm the applicability of the Ordinance to such 
Surveillance Technologies, complete a Surveillance Technology Impact Report, and complete an 
Annual Surveillance Report.  The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, and the IT 
Department worked with each department to review all technologies that potentially fall under 
the Ordinance and to ensure that each department’s submission was complete.   

Continued Compliance  
 

the Surveillance Ordinance: 

The City Solicitor will coordinate further trainings to ensure continued compliance with 

•  Compliance Officers.  Each Department that currently possesses Surveillance 

Technology and any Department that seeks to acquire Surveillance Technology in the 
future must designate a Compliance Officer.  As further explained in the Surveillance 
Use Policy, the Compliance Officer will oversee record-keeping within their department 
in order to ensure that the department complies with the Ordinance and the Surveillance 
Use Policy.   

•  Training.  The Law Department has held several meetings with other City departments 
in order to familiarize City staff with the provisions of the Ordinance, the proposed 
Surveillance Use Policy, and the types of Surveillance Technologies that must be 
reported to the City Council under the Ordinance. I will continue to work with City 
departments to continue training about the Ordinance and the Surveillance Use Policy for 
City staff. 

I respectfully request that the City Council approve the attached proposed Surveillance 
Use Policy as well as the Surveillance Technology Impact Reports and the Annual Surveillance 
Report that I have also submitted herewith. 

 

I look forward to reviewing these documents in detail with you at the December 9, 2019 

City Council meeting and to answering any questions you may have.   
 

Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Louis A. DePasquale 
City Manager

IV.  Oversight. 
 

The Department Head of each City department which currently possesses, uses or 
anticipates seeking to acquire or use Surveillance Technology shall submit to the City Manager 
the name of a designated Compliance Officer assigned by the Department Head to keep and 
maintain records on the acquisition and use of Surveillance Technology or Surveillance Data by 
that City department, including records on access to Surveillance Data to ensure that the 
requirements of the Ordinance and this Policy are followed.   
 

The Department Head or Compliance Officer for that City department shall be 

responsible for internal record keeping on the acquisition and use of Surveillance Technology or 
Surveillance Data by that City department, including records on access to Surveillance Data, to 
ensure compliance with this Policy.   
 

A.  Data Collection. 

Surveillance Technology produces Surveillance Data upon which the City relies for 
governmental functions.  It is the policy of the City to ensure that the Surveillance Technology it 
uses collects no more Surveillance Data than is necessary to achieve the specific, authorized 
purposes of that particular Surveillance Technology. 
 

In accordance with the Ordinance, the City has reviewed all of the Surveillance 
Technology currently in use by City departments as of the Effective Date.  The Surveillance 
Technology, the departments that use or propose to acquire or use the Surveillance Technology, 
the purposes for which the particular Surveillance Technology is used, the nature of the 
Surveillance Data the Surveillance Technology collects, and information as to whether the 
minimum amount of Surveillance Data necessary is being collected, shall be submitted in a 
report to the City Manager by each Department Head for each City department which uses or 
proposes to use Surveillance Technology.  If any employee, agent, or contractor of any City 
department becomes aware of any inaccuracies concerning the use of Surveillance Technology 
or Surveillance Data that is collected by a department’s Surveillance Technology other than as 
outlined in that City department’s report to the City Manager, that employee, agent, or contractor 
is required to immediately report the collection of such Surveillance Data or use of such 
Surveillance Technology to the department’s Compliance Officer, the Department Head, the City 
Manager, the City Solicitor, or the Personnel Director.  

 

B.  Data Protection. 

No Surveillance Data shall be stored, accessed, or transmitted without proper encryption, 

access and password controls, and access-oversight approved by the City’s Chief Information

Officer or his/her designee in the Information Technology Department (“ITD”).  Each City 
department’s Compliance Officer shall complete and submit to ITD a list of each type of 
Surveillance Technology currently used by that department, the Surveillance data it collects, the 
staff who have access to the Surveillance Data, and all other information required under 
Subsection A above.  ITD shall ensure that proper procedures are in place to protect all 
Surveillance Data.  In the event that any department is, in the judgment of ITD, unable to 
implement the security measures necessary to adequately protect Surveillance Data, ITD shall 
immediately contact the City Manager and the City Solicitor, and propose additional measures to 
protect Surveillance Data from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure. 
 

C.  Data Access. 

City employees may only have access to Surveillance Data when such access is necessary 

for their official duties. The Department Head or Compliance Officer of each City department 
shall report to ITD, the City Manager and the City Solicitor, the name of each employee, 
contractor, or other agent that requires access to Surveillance Data.  The Department Head or 
Compliance Officer shall state the specific Surveillance Data to which each individual may have 
access.  The City may, at any time, with or without notice to the individual, terminate any 
individual’s access to Surveillance Technology or Surveillance Data. 
 

D.  Data Retention. 

Surveillance Data will not be maintained any longer than is necessary to achieve its 
approved purpose(s), provided that the City will retain Surveillance Data for the periods required 
by the Massachusetts Public Records Law, G.L. c. 66, § 10, the Massachusetts Municipal 
Records Retention Schedule, or any other applicable laws or regulations.   
 

Exceptions to the Massachusetts Municipal Records Retention Schedule may be 
requested from the Commonwealth by the City Solicitor at the request of a Department Head as 
follows:  
 

1.  A Department Head may seek exceptions for a particular type of Surveillance Data by 

seeking the exception explicitly in a Surveillance Technology Impact Report or 
Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy; or 
 

2.  A Department Head may seek an exception for a particular type of Surveillance Data 

from the City Manager on a case-by-case basis.   

All exceptions and the reasons therefor shall be included in a department’s Annual 

Surveillance Report.

V. 
 

Public and Third-Party Access. 

The City shall comply with its obligations pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records 

Law, (G. L. c. 4, § 7 cl. 26, and G. L. c. 66, § 10 et seq.), Chapter 2.126 of the Cambridge 
Municipal Code (the “Open Data Ordinance”), and any other applicable law, regulation, or order 
of a court or state or federal administrative agency of competent jurisdiction that requires the 
disclosure of particular Surveillance Data. 
 

The City’s intent is to make as much information as possible available to the public 

without compromising the privacy of any Identifiable Individual(s), as defined in Section 
2.128.020(C) of the Ordinance.  The City shall, to the extent possible and permitted in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, anonymize, aggregate, and/or geomask 
Surveillance Data where necessary to protect the privacy of Identifiable Individuals. While some 
data may not on its own reveal the personal information of Identifiable Individuals, when 
combined with other data it may reveal information that would otherwise be exempt from 
disclosure by law.  In the event that a City employee suspects that the release of data would 
present such a risk, the employee shall report that risk to the Department Head or the 
Compliance Officer for that employee’s department and the Department Head or the Compliance 
Officer shall contact the City Manager and City Solicitor requesting a legal opinion from the 
City Solicitor as to whether the data is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law or 
other applicable law or regulation. 
 

Surveillance Data may only be accessed by authorized City employees, as described in 

Section IV(C) above, and may only be distributed to third parties in accordance with this Section 
V of this Policy.  However, any department may share Surveillance Data with the Police 
Department under Exigent Circumstances.  
 
VI. 
 

Training. 

Upon beginning employment or within a reasonable time after commencing employment, 

any City employees or City contractor who will be involved in the collection of Surveillance 
Data or use of Surveillance Technology will be given a copy of the Surveillance Ordinance and 
this Policy for their review and trained by their Department Head, supervisor, or other 
appropriate person assigned to conduct such trainings in ensuring that the activities to be 
performed by that staff or contractor comply with the Surveillance Ordinance and this Policy.

VII.  Relationship to Other Policies and Required Reports. 
 

All Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policies shall be consistent with the provisions 

set forth in this Policy as it may be amended from time to time.  To the extent there is a conflict 
between this Policy and a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy, this Policy shall govern.   
Departments Heads shall be responsible for submitting to the City Manager the following 
documents required by the Ordinance: 
 

A.  Surveillance Technology Impact Report(s) (Section 2.128.030) in the form provided in 

Appendix B attached hereto—submitted for each proposed acquisition or use of 
Surveillance Technology.   
 

B.  Annual Surveillance Report(s) (Section 2.128.060) in the form provided in Appendix C 
attached hereto—submitted annually by the City Manager to the City Council covering 
the prior calendar year. The first such report, describing all existing Surveillance 
Technologies and Surveillance Data is due to the City Council on December 10, 2019. 
Thereafter, the report will be due to the City Council by March 1 of each year.   
 

C.  Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy(ies) (Section 2.128.030) in the form 

provided in Appendix D attached hereto—submitted for each proposed acquisition or use 
of Surveillance Technology not already covered under this Policy.    
 
When providing any of the above reports or a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use 

Policy, a Department Head should pay particular attention to the impacts the use of the 
Surveillance Technology has on marginalized communities in the City, including, but, not 
limited to, communities of color.  For any disparity that exists, the Department Head shall 
explain its understanding as to why the disparity exists and how the Department Head intends to  
address the disparity. 
 
VIII.  Amendments. 
 

This Policy may be amended from time to time by the City Manager, provided that any 

proposed amendment shall be submitted to the City Council for approval.

APPENDIX C: CITY OF CAMBRIDGE ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REPORT 

Department: 
Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

 
 

 
 
 

 
1.  What Surveillance Technologies has the department used in the last year? 

List each Surveillance Technology and, for each Surveillance Technology, describe how it 
works and what it has been used for. For example: “Automatic license plate readers. 
Deployed on police and traffic enforcement vehicles to read license plates of vehicles as 
selected by the individual operator. Used by traffic enforcement to enforce parking laws. 
Used by police to aid in the identification and recovery of stolen vehicles.” 

 
 
2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party? 

List each entity with which Surveillance Data was shared, the date(s) on which Surveillance 
Data was shared with each entity, the type of Surveillance Data shared, and the purpose for 
sharing. 

 
 
3.  What complaints (if any) has your department received about Surveillance 

Technology? 
Describe how many complaints were received, the subject of the complaints, any department 
response, and the organizations responsible for the complaints, if any. 

 
 
4.  Were any violations of the Surveillance Use Policy found in the last year?  

List all known violations, the department’s diagnosis of the reason for the violation, and what 
remedial action was taken by the department. Also, identify steps taken to determine if 
violations have occurred. 

 
 
5.  Has Surveillance Technology been effective in achieving its identified purpose? 
For each Surveillance Technology and each stated purpose listed in (1) above, describe whether 
the Surveillance Technology has been effective in realizing the purpose. Be specific, using 

Page 9 of 12 

Packet Pg. 392

 
 

 
 

 

quantitative data whenever possible. For example: “Automatic license plate readers. Identified 
800 vehicles that had exceeded posted parking time limits, leading to $40,000 in fines collected.” 
 
 
6.  Did the department receive any public records requests concerning Surveillance 

Technology? 
Describe how many requests were received, how many records the department produced in 
response thereto, and generally what information the requests were seeking. 

 
 
7.  How much did it cost to acquire and operate Surveillance Technology? 

For each Surveillance Technology listed in (1) above, list all costs associated therewith. 
Costs include but are not limited to operating personnel, maintenance, upgrades, training, 
storage, and acquisition. Also explain the source of funding for each Surveillance 
Technology for next year. 

 
 
8.  Are any communities disproportionately impacted by Surveillance Technology? 
For each Surveillance Technology listed in (1) above, explain whether and how any 
communities are disproportionately impacted by the use of the Surveillance Technology. 
“Impact” in this context may mean that a population is disproportionately the target of a 
Surveillance Technology, disproportionately penalized as a result of the City’s use of a 
Surveillance Technology, or disproportionately excluded from reaping the benefits of the 
City’s use of a Surveillance Technology. 

Pay particular attention to low-income communities, communities of color, or any 
community that is marginalized in the City. If any disproportionality exists, explain either the 
department’s proposed remedy or why the disproportionality is appropriate. Use quantitative 
data whenever possible. For example: “Automatic license plate readers. Of the 1,000 vehicles 
stopped due to use of ALPRs, 400 were driven by African-Americans and 200 were driven 
by Hispanics. This is significantly disproportionate to the population of Cambridge. The 
department will adjust patrols in order to ensure that ALPRs are not deployed 
disproportionately in communities inhabited by African-American and Hispanic residents.”

APPENDIX E:  CHECKLIST FOR SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY COMPLIANCE 

 
In order to better assist departments in compliance with the Surveillance Use Policy, we have 
compiled the below checklist for department heads and compliance officers to review. 
 

1.  Is this a Surveillance Technology for which City Council approval has previously 

been obtained?   
 

a.  If yes, skip to No. 2.  

b.  If no, you will need to complete the following: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.  Surveillance Technology Impact Report (see Appendix B); and 

ii.  If the Surveillance Technology is not covered in the Surveillance Use 

Policy, you’ll also need a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy 
(see Appendix D). 

2.  Is there a proposal to use the Surveillance Technology for a purpose, in a manner, 

or in a location not previously approved by the City Council? 
 

a.  If no, skip to No. 3. 

b.  If yes, you will need to resubmit a Surveillance Technology Impact Report (see 
Appendix B); then you will need to list the Surveillance Technology in the 
Annual Surveillance Report (see Appendix C) referenced below in No. 3.  
 

3.  Surveillance Technologies previously approved by the City Council must be listed

LOUIS A. DePASQUALE LISA C. PETERSON '

City Manager Deputy City Manager

January 22, 2020

To the Honorable, the City Council:

Re: Supplemental Reports on Certain Police Department Surveillance Technologies

I am submitting supplements ("Supplements") to thirteen (13) Police Department
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports ("STIRs") to the City Council in connection with the
January 22, 2020 Public Safety Committee meeting (the "Committee Meeting"). STIRs relating
to these Technologies were submitted to the City Council on December 9, 2019 and are on the
Committee Meeting agenda. I believe the Supplements will assist the Public Safety Committee
in its review.

Supplements are submitted for the following Surveillance Technologies:

• BRIC Omega Dashboard
• Coplink
• CLEAR
• Focused Deterrence Database

• Digital Intelligence Workstation

• Dell Laptop BCERT

• Magnet Forensics - Axiom

• Getdata Forensic Explorer

• Shotspotter
• Keltech Covert Streetlight Camera

• CSA Pole Camera

• I.V.C.

• Case Cracker

The Supplements are added onto the original STIRs for each of these technologies. The

number of each STIR is indicated along with the additional and/or updated information, which is
shown in orange text and denoted by a line in the left margin. I look forward to reviewing these

documents with you at the Committee Meeting and to answering any questions you may have.

Sincerity,

Louis A. DePasquale
City Manager

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Algorithm to analyze RMS data   

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Crime Analysis and Focussed Deterrence Unit 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact as it analyzes existing incident reports from the 
Department’s Records Management System. The Department is required by state and 
federal law, as well as court procedural rules to document a variety of police 
encounters, whether for criminal, civil or administrative matters. The algorithm 
utilizes factors such as “role” played and “when” (allowing for a decaying weighted 
analysis). Additionally, crimes are weighted in strict accordance with Massachusetts 
Sentencing Guidelines.

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to

Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Deployed across the City with 12 sensors and 1.25 1.1 square mile coverage area 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has minimal impact as it captures the sound of gunshots. CPD has no 
listening capabilities; sensors are analyzed at Shotspotter HQ in CA, only incidents 
identified by Shotspotter’s proprietary algorithm as “in the class of gunshots” are sent 
to the Department via the application. No other audio is sent or sought. The 
placement of microphones has not changed since the implementation of the 
technology; initial placement based on prevelance of gunfire or gunshot victims. CPD 
has the ability to request movement but the high concentration (relative to 
Cambridge) has persisted in the same area.

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

Cambridge Fire proposes to use the Verathon Corporation's Glidescope Go video 
laryngoscope. This is a medical device that facilitates critical medical care by capturing 
video of the back of the throat of an unconscious person in order to place an endotracheal 
tube (breathing tube).  
 
A laryngoscope is a medical device, essentially a curved tongue depressor with a light at 
the end, that lifts the tongue out of the way and allows a paramedic to look through the 
patient's mouth and see the patient's tracheal opening in order to place a breathing tube in 
the trachea (also known as intubation).  
 
Patients who require breathing tubes are the most critical patients we see, and usually are 
not breathing at all. In order to facilitate faster and more accurate breathing tube 
placement and improve outcomes, video laryngoscopy has been developed, which places 
a camera at the end of the device and a small video screen attached so the paramedic can 
see the tracheal opening better.  

Glidescope GO records video only. There is no audio or data recording. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Documenting and improving performance of City employees. 

The purpose of the technology is to improve critical health care processes and outcomes 
in order to provide the best available medical care to the residents and visitors of the City 
of Cambridge. 
 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

This technology will be on the CFD's Paramedic units, and will also be used in training 
with manikins. The video laryngoscopes will be deployed in or around May 2020. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
The privacy impact will be zero. There are no patient identifiers associated with the video 
in the instrument. If the video is uploaded into a patient’s chart or other data storage, it 
will be considered protected health information and access will be severely limited in 
accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). If the 
video is used in case review or training, there will be no patient identifiers associated 
with it. 
 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
The initial costs will be $24,784.00, which will be funded by a federal grant. This 
includes 120 disposable blades. Once the initial supply of blades is exhausted, 
replacement blades will be purchased by CFD at a cost of $40-$52 each, depending on 
the style of blade. Training and Quality Improvement costs are impossible to determine, 
because they will be embedded within our standard training and quality processes.

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders

•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Deployed across the City with 12 sensors and 1.25 1.1 square mile coverage area 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has minimal impact as it captures the sound of gunshots. CPD has no 
listening capabilities; sensors are analyzed at Shotspotter HQ in CA, only incidents 
identified by Shotspotter’s proprietary algorithm as “in the class of gunshots” are sent 
to the Department via the application. No other audio is sent or sought. The 
placement of microphones has not changed since the implementation of the 
technology; initial placement based on prevelance of gunfire or gunshot victims. CPD 
has the ability to request movement but the high concentration (relative to 
Cambridge) has persisted in the same area.

•  Police station 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact since the recordings are all done voluntarily.  
In addition, the Supreme Judicial Court has expressed a preference that criminal 
interrogations and identification procedures be recorded whenever practicable.  See 
Commonwealth v. DiGiambattista, 442 Mass. 423 (2004); Commonwealth v. Silva-
Santiago, 453 Mass. 782 (2004), and there is a legal requirement to record criminal 
interrogations where practicable. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  Approximately $40,000

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 

Re:  Additional Surveillance Technology Impact Reports 

February 24, 2020 

Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge 

Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting the following to the City Council for review 
and discussion at the February 24, 2020 Council Meeting: 

 

•  Three (3) new Surveillance Technology Impact Reports (“STIRs”), describing 
Surveillance Technologies which are subject to the Ordinance, which require City 
Council approval.   

The attached new STIRs were not previously submitted.  They concern new Surveillance 

Technology the City is seeking to acquire and existing Surveillance Technology that – 
considering feedback from the Public Safety Committee – I am reporting to the Council in new, 
consolidated STIRs: 
 

•  Digital Evidence Management System, a new Surveillance Technology requested by 

the Emergency Communications Department.   

•  IP Address Collection Platforms, existing Surveillance Technology previously reported 
to the Council in two separate STIRs from the Information Technology Department.  (See 
“Checkpoint Firewall” and “Web server access and error logging” STIRs submitted at the 
December 9, 2019 Council Meeting.)  This new STIR clarifies the use of IP Address 
Collection Platforms throughout the City. 

•  Atlas RMV Portal, existing Surveillance Technology previously reported to the Council 

in two separate STIRs from the Finance Department and the Traffic, Parking and 
Transportation Department.  (See “Atlas Database (RMV)” and “ATLAS: Massachusetts 
RMV Website Portal” STIRs submitted at the December 9, 2019 Council Meeting.)  This 
new STIR clarifies the use of the Atlas RMV Portal throughout the City and incorporates 
the Assessing Department’s use of the Portal. 

In a separate communication, I will also submit the following to the City Council for  

review and discussion at the February 24, 2020 Council Meeting: 
 

•  Revised Surveillance Technology Impact Reports (“STIRs”), describing Surveillance 
Technologies which are subject to the Ordinance, which require City Council approval.  

 

 

 

 

 

The original STIRs were submitted to the City Council at the December 9, 2019 Council 
Meeting or to the Public Safety Committee at a January 22, 2020 committee meeting and 
were reviewed and discussed at the January 22, 2020 committee meeting.  The revised 
STIRs will address feedback from the Public Safety Committee. 

•  Summary of STIRs submitted to the City Council during the past year.  The Summary 
of STIRs will include a summary of all STIRs submitted to the City Council to date, 
including what action the City Council took on same, and reference all revised STIRs for 
ease of review by the Council. 
 

Those STIRs previously submitted to the City Council at the December 9, 2019 Council 

Meeting or to the Public Safety Committee at a January 22, 2020 committee meeting, were 
discussed in detail at the January 22, 2020 Public Safety Committee meeting and referred to the 
City Council by the Public Safety Committee with a recommendation that they be approved by 
the City Council.   

 
I look forward to reviewing these documents in detail with you at the February 24, 2020 

City Council meeting and to answering any questions you may have.   
 

Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Louis A. DePasquale 
City Manager

SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IMPACT REPORT 

Department: 
Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

Emergency Communications Department 
 

Walter Heffernan/Christina Giacobbe 
2/24/2020 
Digital Evidence Mangement System  

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  
 
•  A Digital Evidence Management System is similar to a document management 
solution. The Digital Evidence Management System is a repository of currently 
collected data such as 911 calls, Police Records Management System, Evidence, 
Computer Aided Dispatch, Crime Scene Photos, Interview Room Recordings, Lab 
Reports and Shot Spotter data.   

 
•  The purpose of this technology is to provide a centralized storage location for the 

existing data from our current disparate systems in the Emergency Communications 
and Police Departments and store it in one central repository to facilitate the 
management of investigations and digital evidence in a secure cloud-based system for 
authorized users.  This technology will store copies of existing protected Criminal 
Justice Information Services (CJIS) information and will be compliant as required by 
the CJIS security requirements for federal, state and local governments.  Additionally, 
this technology will provide a secure electronic connection to the Cambridge Police 
Department’s Court Prosecutors Office and the District Attorney’s Office.  This 
technology will automate the delivery of documentation that is currently required by 
the court.  Currently, there are over 4,000 cases assigned annually that we process for 
court.  

 
•  This technology also provides a secure automated evidence upload feature for citizens 
who voluntarily provide evidence to the police department.  For example, a witness of 
a crime may have a photo of a car and license plate that fled the scene.  This 
information could be uploaded to increase solvability factors as well as increased 
citizen participation.  In addition, business owners could voluntarily register their 
closed-circuit television systems through the technology, so that the Police 
Department does not have to canvas the neighborhood to locate these devices.   

 
•  The impact of this technology on the departments will increase business operations 
and effective data collection.  This will also reduce the risk of errors in manual data 
gathering and therefore provide more effective evidence collection.  In addition, there

will be a reduction in staff resources for data collection from various units and 
departments.    

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The current process for gathering data is very manual and labor intensive.  The Police 

and Emergency Communications Department receive requests daily from the 
Middlesex Attorney’s Office for all existing discoverable information for related 
cases prior to the initial court date.  They use this information to properly assess the 
facts of the case and determine prosecution.  This technology will automate the 
process reducing the manual effort of pulling this information, transporting case files 
and providing copies of 911 calls for review via discs.   

 
•  The purpose of a Digital Evidence Management System is to consolidate data from 

siloed applications and data sources.  The technology provides an automated solution 
for gathering evidence of violations of any criminal or civil law, administrative 
actions and collected records such as 911 audio, Police Records Management System, 
Evidence, and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD).  In addition, the technology 
provides secure connection to transfer required case evidence to the court.   

 
•  The technology also provides a secure connection for residents and registered 
business owners to upload case evidence including pictures and videos.  This 
application allows the police department to communicate with residents effectively 
and efficiently in obtaining additional information that will assist in solving crimes.   

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

  
•  The technology will be deployed in the data center at 125 6th Street so that it can 

connect to the existing systems that support the Police Department and Emergency 
Communications.    

If a cloud-based solution is chosen, then it will be deployed to both 125 6th Street 
data center and the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud.   Microsoft Azure 
Government Cloud is a commercial infrastructure cloud platform contractually 
committed to meeting the CJIS security requirements for federal, state and local 
governments.  It will then transmit the data over Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
connections that will be configured to meet the CJIS security requirements.  This will 
be used to send and receive data from court and residents and/or registered 
businesses. 

 
•  The target date for procuring this technology is spring 2020.   

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

•  The privacy impact of this technology is consistent with federal, state and local 

government policies for the purposes of law enforcement and public safety efforts.  
With the implementation of this technology, the authorized personnel performing law 
enforcement duties will have electronic access to records that currently exist in 
various systems.  The department continues to maintain those data sources and 
deliberately chose not to expand access to additional data from what it is today.  
Therefore, there is no additional privacy impact from the utilization of this 
technology.   

 
•  This technology will be configured with similar role-based access to the existing data 
in disparate systems to ensure protection of the data.  Therefore, only authorized users 
will have access for performing their duties in accordance with their role in the 
respective departments.  This technology will provide an electronic version of the 
same data set to the court that exists today in our systems that we use to gather 
information on case files. 

 
•  Because this technology provides an opportunity for citizens and business to engage 
and participate in sharing media, there may be a greater impact on privacy of the 
individuals or businesses who voluntarily provide such information to law 
enforcement officials. The Police Department will address these privacy impacts by 
limiting access to the information to assigned investigators and/or authorized users, 
similarly to current department policy.  All access will be password protected and 
there will be a change log identifying all users who access each record and data 
source.  In addition, we will conduct detailed training on the use of the system and 
best practices for protecting personal information as well as quality assurance 
measures for compliance.  Lastly, the department will ensure appropriate 
communications are visible on the portal and/or department webpage so that residents 
and business owners are aware of the use of this technology and shared media.   

 
•  This technology does not have the capacity to access residents or business owners’ 
devices.   Anyone who wishes to share information through the system will upload 
the media that they wish to share.  In addition, the technology will only record the 
information provided by the sender.  Business owners who voluntarily register on the 
technology platform may be asked by law enforcement to provide media for a 
specific date and time related to a case.  The business owner can voluntarily provide 
the media if they choose, but law enforcement cannot access the media without their 
consent.  The benefits of the business registration program allow for investigators to 
request media directly without having to canvass the area saving valuable time during 
investigations. 

 
•  Currently, citizens and business owners volunteer data in person and/or on the scene 
of an incident.  We receive a tremendous amount of support and cooperation in 
obtaining media related to incidents. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

•  Personnel Costs: Estimated to be one (1) System Admin and one (1) Application 
Developer for sixty (60) hours to implement this application.  On-going support is 
estimated at five (5) hours per month; we expect this time will be used researching 
any system or application issues and performing system maintenance. 

There should be a reduction in on-going personnel costs as this application 
consolidates all the required data gathering and documentation for court and 
organizes it in one place for reference which will increase resources to support other 
areas of the department.          

 

•  Source of funds:  Initial $92,900 EGov/Free Cash appropriation on December 16, 

2019.  Anticipate further funding through EGov/Free Cash.

IP Address Collection Platforms (Multiple) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The City of Cambridge uses various platforms that collect IP addresses from internal 
and external connections and connection attempts, e.g., the City website, Find It 
Cambridge, the City firewall and the City’s web servers.  While the platforms vary, 
the surveillance capabilities and functionality are the same.  IP address information is 
used to limit and protect the City network from malicious sites and unauthorized 
access. 

•  The identification of a device's IP address can be used to determine the country, city, 
or postal/ZIP code of the device, determining an object's generalized geographical 
location. 

•  The City’s Microsoft web server software records IP addresses, as well as date & 
time, referring URL (if provided by the browser), and user agent string (again, if 
provided by the user’s browser) at the time of the request for connection to the server.  
It also records connection errors. The data is written to log files on disk for future 
reference and analysis. 

•  The firewall uses the same information to protect City of Cambridge users and Data.  
When malicious activity occurs from a certain IP or region, we are able to adequately 
protect or defend city data.  We do not use this information to identify individuals 
only as a means to protect City employees, City data infrastructure, and personal 
information. 

•  This information is not sent to any third parties. 
 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Maintaining the safety and security of City Data, Infrastructure, Employees, Students, 

Customers, and City-owned or controlled buildings. 

•  Analyzing and managing service delivery.

•  The City of Cambridge collects information about visitors to public websites. This 
information is used for analytical and statistical purposes to help better manage the 
sites. Information that is collected includes the date and the type of browser being 
used. We use this information to learn how many visitors we have, the websites they 
are coming from, which parts of our web site are of most interest to users and other 
facts that will help us improve the web site and the services we offer. 
Identifying IP addresses is critical to the City’s network security.  The City is a 
member of the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center, an organization 
dedicated to improving cybersecurity for state and local governments.  Through this 
membership, ITD receives regular reports listing the top malware IP addresses.  
Identifying the IP addresses connecting to the City’s platforms allows ITD to protect 
against malware IP addresses and similar threats. (See attached report example.) 

• 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  All City web servers; firewall. 
•  The log files have been collected on these devices for over 20 years.  They are located 
at the Healy Building in Cambridge and on the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud.  
The Microsoft Azure Government Cloud is a commercial infrastructure cloud 
platform contractually committed to meeting  privacy and security requirements for 
federal, state and local governments. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The identification of a device's IP address can be used to determine the country, city, 
or postal/ZIP code of the device, determining an object's generalized geographical 
location. 

•  Access to all collected IP addresses is password protected, and authorized employees 

receive annual training on best practices for protecting personal information. 

•  This information is not sent to any third parties. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
Firewall 
•  $300,000 implementation cost 
•  $20,000 ongoing training 
•  $50,000 annual maintenance

Atlas RMV Portal 

Department: 

Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 

Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The Atlas RMV Portal is a web application provided by the Commonwealth of 

Massachusetts to access the RMV system.  The Atlas Database holds information on 
all the registered/licensed drivers in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These 
records are created and maintained by the RMV.  Information is collected by the 
RMV and is accessible to municipalities when users log in to view a driver or dealer’s 
profile. The City is not able to save or store any of this information internally, it is 
only available on the Database. When logged in, City users are connected directly to 
the RMV system.  Any changes made by the City are also updated at the RMV in real 
time.  

Departments access different types of data through the Portal, depending on their 
purpose for using the system: 

•  Finance/Revenue – The Portal allows staff to access a driver’s personal 

identifiable information as reported on their Massachusetts licenses: address, birth 
date, height, gender, eye color, etc., in order to administer the Commonwealth’s 
Motor Vehicle Excise Tax. This tax is required by Massachusetts General Laws 
and is levied by the city or town where the vehicle is principally garaged.   

 

 

The Portal is used when a driver contacts the Revenue office and requests to have 
a hold lifted from their account. Per City policy, in order to receive a release, 
drivers are required to pay all outstanding Excise bills to the City, regardless of 
which bills are on hold. In certain circumstances, the Finance Department will 
allow for a payment plan to aid drivers who are experiencing financial hardships.

Payment plans are granted on a case by case basis and require approval from the 
Treasurer. 
 

•  Finance/Assessing – The Portal allows staff to create excise tax bills for billing 
car dealerships with dealer plates.  The RMV provides a list of all dealer plates 
registered in Cambridge which are then billed for excise taxes. 
 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – The portal allows staff to access a driver’s 
name, address, license plate number, registration status, vehicle details, vehicle 
addresses and garage code.  This information is used to issue resident parking 
permits; view handicap placard information and clear holds on licenses and 
vehicle registrations.  

 

 

 

 

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Enforcing obligations to the City. 

 

 

 

•  Executing financial transactions between the City and any individual engaged in a 

financial transaction with the City. 

•  Finance/Revenue – The Portal is used in a very limited capacity to release the Non-
Renewal hold at the RMV for a taxpayer who has paid a delinquent Motor Vehicle 
Excise tax bill via credit card or cash.  The City provides this service to accommodate 
those taxpayers who need a release relatively quickly.  For instance, a taxpayer may 
not even realize they are on RMV hold until they go to the registry to renew their 
license or registration.  The taxpayer will pay the outstanding bill on-line via credit 
card and then call the Finance Office for a release.   

•  Finance/Assessing – The RMV requires municipalities to use the Atlas Portal for 

accessing dealer plate information needed for excise tax billing. 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – The Portal assists Parking Services staff in 

issuing resident parking permits, viewing handicap placard information, and clearing 
holds on licenses and vehicle registrations. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The Atlas RMV Portal is a web application accessed online, with individual 

usernames and passwords.

•  An updated Atlas RMV Portal deployed in November 2019.  A previous system 

had been in place since the early 2000s. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 

 

•  Finance/Revenue – The Portal provides access to personal identifiable information 

about drivers registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The information that 
is found on a Massachusetts issued driver’s license is found on the Portal: address, 
birth date, height, gender, eye color, etc. When viewing a driver profile, City users are 
able to see any outstanding excise tax bills, parking tickets, and pay-by-plate tickets 
that are under the driver’s name.  All drivers within the Commonwealth are subject to 
Excise tax.  Students moving in and out of the city between semesters, and other 
individuals coming and going, may lose track of where their vehicle is registered and 
may not receive their bill to pay it on time.  
 
Revenue mitigates privacy impacts by only granting access to three employees. The 
system requires a username, password, and a unique security code that is sent via 
email each time a log in attempt is made. Users are automatically logged out after 10 
minutes of inactivity and will be required to re-submit their username, password, and 
a new security code to re-enter. 
 

•  Finance/Assessing – The Portal provides information that is not available to the 

public regarding the number of dealer plates any dealership has in Cambridge.  The 
Assessing department has limited access to this database to three members of the 
department and has requested the least amount of information required for sending 
out bills.  The Assessing department has requested only vehicle inquiry roles related 
to dealer plates and no additional information that could be provided through the 
Atlas RMV Portal, such as driver inquiry or access to driving records. 
 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – The Portal allows TPT staff to access detailed 
personal information about Cambridge residents.  The information accessed is not 
collected or stored and the public cannot access it.  The information is only accessed 
by Parking Services staff when issuing resident parking permits, viewing handicap 
placard information, and clearing holds on licenses and vehicle registrations, all of 
which are requested by the customer. The data available on the Portal may have a 
greater impact on the privacy of those individuals who own a vehicle than those 
individuals who do not own a vehicle, since staff only access the vehicle registration 
data for resident who own cars.  Access to the Portal is password protected and the 
Parking Services Staff who use ATLAS receive individual, detailed training which 
includes best practices for protecting personal information.

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  Finance/Revenue – The City is assessed an RMV fee on the Cherry Sheet 

 

 

 

Assessments.  Massachusetts Statutes authorize an RMV Surcharge of $20.00 per 
each clear transaction made through the Atlas Database. The cost of the RMV 
Surcharge is built into the fees that are incurred on bills that have been paid late.  

 

 

•  Finance/Assessing – All costs associated with Assessing’s use for dealer plate billing 

are covered by the RMV. 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – There are no initial costs associated with Atlas 
and all maintenance costs are the responsibility of the Massachusetts RMV. There is a 
$20.00 RMV surcharge for clearing registration holds.  In FY 2019, there were 
17,973 chargeable clears for license and registration holds. Since FY2014, at the 
request of the Massachusetts RMV, the City provides an annual non-renewal 
reconciliation adjustment amount which is reported to the State Comptroller and then 
debited against municipalities’ local aid distributions.

LexisNexis 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  LexisNexis is a search engine.  Users pay a fee to searchpublic records and other 

information compiled by the provider.  
 

•  Assessing – Assesing is seeking to use LexisNexis to review information submitted 

by taxpayers seeking residential exemptions and personal exemptions. 
 

•  CPD – CPD uses LexisNexis as a research tool to locate people, companies, 

businesses, phone numbers, properties and fragments of information; this information 
helps to create a more complete picture of what CPD is investigating (e.g., the 
Department enters the name and phone number of an individual who had been the 
victim of a scam, this search leads us to where the “scammer” found the victim’s 
information, potentially creating a solid investigative lead).  

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Assessing: Preventing waste, fraud, and abuse of City resources.  This data will allow 
the Assessing department to vet information received from taxpayers in order to 
prevent fraud.   
 

•  CPD – Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing 

injury to persons or significant damage to property. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

•  Assessing – Will be used in the Assessing Department.  Anticipated start date spring 

2020. 
 

•  CPD – Crime Analysis and Criminal Investigations Division.  Currently in use. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact since it is composed of public records.  
Anyone can access LexisNexis.  The search engine offers various levels of 
information depending on subscription cost. 
 

•  Assessing will limit access to LexisNexis to two staff members.  These are staff who 
are currently part of the review process of the exemptions and access to this program 
should make their jobs easier.  Additionally, the use of the software by the Assessing 
department is reviewed by LexisNexis to ensure that it is used only for department 
business.  LexisNexis can audit the Assessing department to ensure that the data is 
being used only for business purposes.   
 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  Assessing - Assessing department budget will cover the costs for two licenses at 

$120.00 each, equaling $240.00 per year. 

•  CPD – Part of Accurint cost.

SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IMPACT REPORT 

(Revising STIR No. 2 Submitted December 9, 2019) 
 

Emergency Communications Department 
Emergency Communications Center 

Christina Giacobbe 
2/24/20 
RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System 

Department: 
Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System (RapidSOS) is a web platform that 
provides life-saving data directly to 911 and first responders in an emergency, 
providing faster, more effective responses. Callers who contact 911 do so voluntarily 
seeking emergency services.  RapidSOS integrates data from: personal devices such 
as smartphones and smartwatches, motor vehicles’ GPS and crash-detection systems, 
and home security systems, to provide real-time emergency data that supplements 
information provided during an individual 911 call. 
 

•  RapidSOS is deployed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ State 911 

• 

Department, which manages and oversees the Next Generation 911 system.  This 
state system delivers 911 calls to the appropriate jurisdiction and RapidSOS 
technology functions as a clearinghouse to present the call to the Public Safety 
Answering Point (PSAP), or call center, for emergency response.  ECC serves as a 
PSAP and is therefore required to access RapidSOS through the State 911 system. 
 
In Cambridge, when callers contact 911 their call is directed to Emergency 
Communications on the state’s Next Generation 911 platform and RapidSOS 
provides secondary, data-based location information to ECC through the RapidSOS 
clearinghouse The data that is collected at the time of the call is the caller location 
and phone number.  All 911 calls and caller information are required to be recorded.  
These records are kept according to record retention policies through the 
administrative portal of the Next General 911 System.   

•  The State 911 Department is required by law to review and assess all technological 

and operational capability of wireless 911 calls being routed and handled directly by

the PSAP in which the caller is located.  The State 911 Department is responsible for 
ensuring such capability exists and they establish the standards, by which our PSAP 
receives wireless calls.  

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of this technology is to provide ECC Call Takers and Dispatchers with 
an accurate phone number and location information of wireless callers who contact 
911 in our jurisdiction.  This is necessary to provide aid to the caller, dispatch 
emergency personnel and provide emergency services.   This information also allows 
Call Takers and Dispatchers to contact the caller if the call gets disconnected or for 
additional follow up.  

 
•  This technology supports our ability to maintain the safety and security of City 

employees, students, and residents when experiencing an emergency situation.  In 
addition, this technology allows us to communicate life saving information to first 
reponsders.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The RapidSOS technology is deployed by the State 911 Department to all PSAPs in 
the Commonwealth as part of the Next Generation 911 System.  The RapidSOS 
technology is housed on the State 911 system located in Middleboro and a local 
server for our PSAP is located at 125 Sixth Street. 

 
•  This technology was implemented in 2018. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The privacy impact of this technology is consistent with federal, state and local 

government policies for the purposes of law enforcement and public safety efforts.  
Records of 911 calls received through traditional call processing have previously 
included location and phone information provided by cellular carriers, and RapidSOS 
provides the same information.  However, with the rapid advancement of location-
based technology, our reliance on cellular carriers’ location information has 
decreased.  The RapidSOS technology provides more accurate location information.  
The Next Generation 911 System administered by the State provides also provides 
subscriber information, i.e., the name of the person to whom the phone is registered, 
as well as the phone address and number.  Currently, all callers that contact 911 are 
informed that the call is being recorded as required by law.

•  The State 911 Department provides role-based access to the data to ensure protection 
of caller information.  In ECC/our PSAP, Call Takers and Dispatchers have access to 
caller information during the call and for thirty minutes after the call has been 
disconnected. Authorized users will have access for performing their duties in 
accordance with their role during call processing, quality assurance and investigative 
matters.  

 
•  Because this technology provides an opportunity for citizens and business to access 
emergency services, there may be a greater impact on privacy of the individuals or 
businesses who voluntarily provide information to law enforcement officials during 
emergencies.  The Emergency Communications Department will address these 
privacy impacts by limiting access to the information to assigned investigators and/or 
authorized users, similarly to current department policy.   

 
•  All access to the RapidSOS administrative portal is limited to managers of the ECD 

and is password protected.    

•  The State 911 Department reviews and assesses new communications technologies

Trespass Tracking database 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

• 

 
• 

In Massachusetts, trespassing is a crime. G.L. c266, §120 provides private entities 
and departments within the City of Cambridge to obtain a no trespass order against 
individuals after providing appropriate posted notice on the property or providing 
notice to the person directly by the Cambridge Police Department. 

Information about no trespassing notices/letters provided to individuals through this 
process are recorded in the Trespass Tracking database during a call for service.  The 
Trespass Tracking database is part of CPD & ECC’s Computer Aided Dispatch 
(CAD) database.  (The CAD is itself a component of CPD’s complete QED/Records 
Management System.)   

•  The information recorded is the trespasser’s name, location of the trespass, and other 
identification information if known such as address, who served the order, driver’s 
license number and date of the notice’s issue and expiration.  The Police Department 
is required to maintain these notices.  All notices and the information in the notice are 
recorded in our Trespass Tracking database so that the information can be made 
readily available to first responders during calls for service. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of the database is to have a centralized record of all active trespass 

notices.  The recording of this information is to ensure public safety, in particular the 
safety of those impacted by the notice as well as officer safety.  In addition, the 
Trespass Tracking database allows us to maintain an electronic record of all active 
trespass notices in the City in one database in CAD.

•  This technology supports our ability to maintain the safety and security of City 

employees, students, and residents in Cambridge.  In addition, this technology allows 
us to communicate life saving information to first reponders.  With this vital 
information, police officers are able to identify and prevent threats to persons and 
property and prevent injury to persons or significant damage to property.  

 
•  The Police Department is able to identify, apprehend, and prosecute criminal 
offenders and gather evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and 
administrative actions.  Providing information to emergency personnel and enforcing 
obligations to the City is required to ensure a safe community.  Therefore, this 
information must be accessed with ease during emergency responses. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The technology is deployed in the data center at 125 6th Street so that it can connect 

to the existing CAD/RMS systems that support the Police Department and 
Emergency Communications.  The information is maintained in the CAD/QED 
system that is deployed in the Emergency Communications Center, Police, and Fire 
Departments.   

•  The department has been utilizing this database for the past ten years. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The individuals who are recorded in the Trespass Tracking database are notified 
verbally and in writing of the notice to not trespass at the said location, and that 
notice contains all information stored in the Trespass Tracking database.  Therefore, 
there is no additional privacy impact through the utilization of this technology as it is 
an electronic database of trespass notices that have already been served.   
 

•  The records are available electronically through the CAD/QED system to authorized 
personnel performing law enforcement duties. However, there are restictions and 
access to this database is managed by ECC.  There is no public access to this database 
and only authorized employees can review on a secure connection.   
 

•  This technology stores copies of existing protected Criminal Justice Information 

Services (CJIS) information and complies with mandatory CJIS security requirements 
for federal, state and local governments.  The privacy impact of this technology is 
consistent with federal, state and local government policies for the purposes of law 
enforcement and public safety efforts.

Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

Acting Chief Gerard E. Mahoney, Acting Chief 
1/222/24/2020 
Verathon Corporation's Glidescope Go video laryngoscope. 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

 

•  Cambridge FireFire proposes to use the Verathon Corporation's Glidescope Go video 

laryngoscope. This is a medical device that facilitates critical medical care by 
capturing video of the back of the throat of an unconscious person in order to place 
an endotracheal tube (breathing tube).  

 

 

•  A laryngoscope is a medical device, essentially a curved tongue depressor with a 

light at the end, that lifts the tongue out of the way and allows a paramedic to look 
through the patient's mouth and see the patient's tracheal opening in order to place a 
breathing tube in the trachea (also known as intubation).  

•  Patients who require breathing tubes are the most critical patients we see, and 
usually are not breathing at all. In order to facilitate faster and more accurate 
breathing tube placement and improve outcomes, video laryngoscopy has been 
developed, which places a camera at the end of the device and a small video screen 
attached so the paramedic can see the tracheal opening better.  

• 

  Glidescope GO records video only.on a mini SD card. There is no audio or data 
recording. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Documenting and improving performance of City employees.

•  The purpose of the technology is to improveImproving critical health care processes 
and outcomes in order to provide the best available medical care to the residents and 
visitors of the City of Cambridge. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  This technology will be on the CFD's Paramedic units, and will also be used in 
training with manikins. The video laryngoscopes will be acquired before June 
30,2020 and deployed in or around May 2020as soon as is practicable. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The privacy impact will be zero. There are no patient identifiers associated with 

thedevice is a simple video in the camera that stores the video on a removable mini 
SD card. The instrument. itself does not have the capacity to capture or store any 
images or data. If the device is used, the SD card will be secured until the video is 
uploaded into a HIPAA- compliant server, then the file on the SD card will be 
deleted.  

•  There is a slight chance that the camera could catch a very quick, low resolution 

image (~1.25 ip/mm according to the engineers) of part of the patient’s face while 
being inserted or removed. The operator will be moving fast because the patient is 
not breathing and the paramedic will be focused on placing the endotracheal tube 
quickly. Therefore, the probability of capturing a stable image of the full face is 
slim.  

•  When the video is uploaded into a patient’s chart or other data storage, itany image 
of the face will be considered protected health information and access will be 
severely limitedProtected Health Information (PHI) in accordance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Access to PHI is password 
protected with several levels of access, and each user has only the access they 
absolutely need (quality improvement, billing, etc.). 

• 

If the video is used in case review or training, there will be no patient identifiers 
associated with it., and only the relevant part of the video, the back of the airway and 
vocal cords, will be used. Any capture of the patient’s face will be obscured at the 
least, and most likely trimmed off the beginning/end of the video.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

•  The initialInitial costs: $24,784. Initial funding will be $24,784.00, which will be 

fundedprovided by a federal grant. This 

•  Ongoing maintenance: The initial purchase includes 120 disposable blades. Once the 
initial supply of blades is exhausted, replacement blades will be purchased by CFD 
at a cost of $40-$52 each, depending on the style of blade. Training and Quality 
Improvement costs are impossible to determine, because they will be embedded 
within our standard training and quality processes. Ongoing costs will be funded 
through federal grants if available at the time, or through the CFD budget.

Tweetdeck – Social media monitoring software through Twitter  

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  TweetDeck is a social media dashboard application for management of Twitter 

accounts. Originally an independent app, TweetDeck was subsequently acquired by 
Twitter Inc. and integrated into Twitter's interface. 
 

•  Tweetdeck allows users to organize and search Tweets in various ways.  From 

Twitter1: 

 

o  Collections – With collections, you can organize Tweets according to topics, 

events, interests, conversations, and more, all in real-time. Add your 
collections as columns and Tweet the URL to share it with others. 

o  Search Typeahead – When you begin to type characters into the search box, 
TweetDeck will run a real-time search that attempts to autocomplete your 
search term, surfacing potentially relevant search topics and accounts. 
Different search topics will be shown on the top half of the drop-down menu, 
whereas user accounts will be shown on the bottom half.  If you select one of 
the suggested search terms, you will be given the option to browse users 
related to that search topic or Tweets related to that search term.  

o  Sentiment – It’s easy to uncover sentiment surrounding a topic; simply search 
for a topic followed by a happy or sad emoticon. For example, you can create 
a search column with the keyword "San Francisco :)" to see Tweets regarding 
San Francisco in a positive manner.

o  Column filters – TweetDeck’s column filters are a powerful way to 

customize searches by keyword, date and time, and to stay on top of new 
Tweets as columns quickly update. 

▪  Content: Tweets matching keywords, media type, dates and time, 

language, or including or excluding Retweets 

▪  Location: Tweets geotagged in a specified locations 
▪  Users: Tweets from a specific account, members of a List, or verified 

accounts 

replies 

▪  Engagement: Tweets with a minimum number of Retweets, likes, or 

▪  Alerts: Tweet alerts through sound or desktop notifications 
o  List management – TweetDeck allows you to manage your Lists easily in 

one centralized place for all your accounts. You can create Lists in 
TweetDeck filtered by your interests or by particular accounts. Any List that 
you have set up or subscribed to previously can also be added as separate 
columns in TweetDeck. 

o  Tweets from a specific account – You can designate a column to display a 
specific account’s Tweets. Just add a Tweet column and search for the 
account you would like featured in the search box. 
 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  CPD 

o  Providing information to emergency personnel 
o  Analyzing and managing service delivery 
o  Documenting and improving performance of City employees 
o  Surveying and gathering feedback from constituents 

•  Mayor’s Office & Council Office – Surveying and gathering feedback from 
constituents. More frequently, people are using Twitter to communicate their 
constituent concerns or issues with City services much in the same way that they 
would send an email. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Through City-issued computers and laptops, the technology is available continuously.  
•  CPD – Public Information Office  
•  Mayor’s Office & Council Office – While not in use at this time, the Mayor’s Office 

and City Council Office anticipate that staff could use this technology in the future, as 
former Mayors’ staff has done.

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact as the software merely aggregates publicly 

available Twitter posts and mentions. 
 

•  Tweets complied by Tweetdeck potentially collect all Tweets responding to 

designated search criteria that are Public (see definition below) and Protected Tweets 
if a City account follows that person. In each case, staff would only be able to see 
information that a person has chosen to release publicly on their Twitter account, in 
accordance with Twitter’s Terms and Conditions. Obviously, the search also only 
applies to people who use Twitter, and only those who include identifiable 
information on their account (some accounts, for example, are anonymous, use a nom 
de plume or, perhaps more appropriately, nom de guerre). 
 
Impacts to privacy would likely not be felt by any individual, as a simple search of 
one’s Twitter profile shows all Tweets, likes, retweets, and other activity from a user 
over the course of that profile’s existence, and Tweetdeck would not provide any 
additional information than could be found during such a search. 
 

•  Additional information from Twitter: 
 

o  What is the difference between public and protected Tweets? 

▪  When you sign up for Twitter, your Tweets are public by default; 

▪ 

anyone can view and interact with your Tweets. Should you choose to 
protect your Tweets, you can do so through your account settings.  
If you protect your Tweets, you’ll receive a request when new people 
want to follow you, which you can approve or deny. Accounts that 
began following you before you protected your Tweets will still be 
able to view and interact with your protected Tweets unless you block 
them.  
o  Who can see my Tweets? 

▪  Public Tweets (the default setting): Are visible to anyone, whether or 

not they have a Twitter account. 

▪  Protected Tweets: Only visible to your Twitter followers. Please keep 
in mind, your followers may still capture images of your Tweets and 
share them. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  BRIC Omega Dashboard is the Intel portal for Boston Regional Intelligence Center 

(BRIC). The BRIC works at the forefront of intelligence collection and analysis. The 
BRIC allows for a regional approach to analyze whether crimes are interconnected by 
geography, type, or method.  The BRIC covers the Metro Boston Homeland Security 
Region (MBHSR), consisting of: Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, 
Quincy, Revere, Somerville, Winthrop, The Greater Boston Police Council (Boston 
Area Police Emergency Radio Network—BAPERN), Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), and 
Metro Fire Association.  
 
In order to have the most complete accounting of what crimes and trends are 
impacting the region, it is necessary for all cities and towns, including Cambridge to 
contribute intelligence information. As such, the Cambridge Police Department 
contributes the following information: Approved arrest reports and Field Interview 
and Observation (FIO) reports for certain cases (Confidential items, i.e., specifically 
marked domestic, juvenile, and sexual assault reports are excluded).

Intelligence information is fundamental to the prevention of crime and violence. The 
use of regional intelligence enables CPD to make better informed decisions to combat 
crime and terrorism committed by individuals and organizations. Intelligence also 
helps with decisions pertaining to the deployment of resources throughout the City 
and region. 

•  The BRIC frequently produces Officer Safety and Public Safety bulletins. Crime is 
not an isolated phenomena and Cambridge does not exist in a vaccuum; therefore, it 
is necessary for Cambridge to understand crime as it occurs throughout the region, as 
any crime committed in the region has the potential to impact crime and safety in 
Cambridge.   

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Crime Analysis Unit and Criminal Investigation Division: The BRIC Omega 

Dashboard’s usage and access is limited to members of the Procedural Justice Section 
(Crime Analysis) and the Criminal Investigation Divisions; as the Department 
analyzes and investigates criminal activity.  
 

•  Access to the BRIC Omega Dashboard (by personnel outside of the CPD) is 

determined by the BRIC. 
 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
•  Anytime that large amounts of intelligence information are gathered, significant 

privacy implications exist. The BRIC maintains a strict policy designed to “protect 
individual privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and other protected interests”.2 

o  The 43-page policy states [in part]: The BRIC will not seek or retain and 

originating agencies will agree to not submit information about individuals or 
organizations solely on the basis of their religious, political, or social views or 
activities; their participation in a particular noncriminal organization or lawful 
event; or their races, ethnicities, citizenship, places of origin, ages, disabilities, 
genders, or sexual orientation. 
 

•  The Cambridge Police are committed to responsibly accessing regional systems in 
manners that are consistent with Cambridge values and in compliance with its 
ordinances and practices. Based on its current usage and the significant safeguards in

Coplink 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Nespin portal for exchange of criminal justice incident reports. 
•  COPLINK is one of the “solutions and services” provided through NESPIN (New 

England State Police Information Network®). COPLINK is a data sharing and crime 
analytics platform.  
 

•  NESPIN is the local arm of a national project known as the RISS Program (Regional 
Information Sharing Systems). The goal of RISS is to assist local, state, federal and 
tribal Criminal Justice partners by providing adaptive solutions and services that 
facilitate information sharing, support criminal investigations, and promote officer 
safety.3 NESPIN is one of only six RISS centers operating nationwide.  
 
In order to have the most complete accounting of what crimes and trends are 
impacting the region (statewide), it is necessary for all cities and towns, including 
Cambridge to contribute intelligence information. As such, the Cambridge Police 
Department contributes the following information: Approved arrest reports and Field 
Interview and Observation (FIO) reports for certain cases (Confidential items, i.e., 
specifically marked domestic, juvenile, and sexual assault reports are excluded).  

• 

•  Currently there are 280 cities and towns of the Commonwealth that contribute and 

utilize COPLINK.

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

•  As noted on its website, COPLINK is utilized by CPD personnel to improve officer 
and community safety, identify high concentration of crime in order to reduce crime 
and prioritize resource reallocation, identify crime trends as they occur in real-time, 
and develop data-driven tools to improve crime analysis and operational 
effectiveness. COPLINK has also proven useful in fulfilling requirements related to 
the issuance of License to Carry Firearms and background checks for Public Safety.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Crime Analysis and Criminal Investigation Division. 
•  Crime Analysis Unit and Criminal Investigation Division: typically access to 

COPLINK (via NESPIN) is reserved to those members of the department assigned to 
Crime Analysis and Criminal Investigations; however, there are times when other 
members may be granted access. Because COPLINK contains Criminal Offender 
Record Information (CORI), only authorized persons in the performance of their 
official duties may access, use or disseminate this information for official and lawful 
criminal justice purposes.  
 

•  Access to the COPLINK (by personnel outside of the CPD) is determined by the 

NESPIN/RISS.  

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  Anytime that large amounts of intelligence information are gathered, significant 
privacy implications exist. The NESPIN/RISS Centers operate their intelligence 
system under the Criminal Intelligence Systems Operating Policies (28 Code of 
Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 23). All RISS member agencies have agreed to 
comply with the requirements of 28 CFR Part 23 with respect to any criminal 
information they submit into an applicable RISS Criminal Intelligence Database 
(RISS/Intel). RISS has adopted a comprehensive privacy policy to protect individual 
privacy, civil rights, civil liberties, and other protected interests.4

QED Records Management System 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  QED currently functions as CPD’s Record Management System (RMS). A records 

management system (RMS) is “an agency-wide system that provides for the storage, 
retrieval, retention, manipulation, archiving, and viewing of information, records, 
documents, or files pertaining to law enforcement operations. In this context, records 
are limited to documents or electronic files directly related to law enforcement 
operations such as incident and accident reports, arrests, citations, warrants, case 
management, field contacts, etc.”5 
 

•  Nearly all information that comes to the Department interacts with its RMS and it has 
implications for data collection for most all systems and processes, including but not 
limited to: Calls for service (Computer Aided Dispatch CAD), Incident Reporting, 
Investigative Case Management, Traffic Accident Reporting, Citations, Field 
Contacts, Pawns, Civil processes, Protective/Restraint Orders, Permits and Licences, 
etc.  
 

•  The Cambridge RMS satisfies the specifications required by the Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (BJA).  According to the, “Standard Functional Specifications for Law 
Enforcement Records Management Systems (RMS)”6, published by the Bureau of 
Justice Assistance (BJA), a Law Enforcement RMS must: Allow for Single entry (i.e., 
no duplicate data entry), should automatically submit data to external sources as 
defined by the agency, enable the ability to enter and query narrative(s)/text fields, 
provide capability to access multiple systems from a single RMS workstation, create

a single database (i.e., virtual or physical), and have validation on data entry (i.e., 
logical edits, edit checks for all fields).  

o  Additionally, according to the BJA standards, an RMS should provide the 
capabilities for users to generate inquiries to internal and external data 
sources—such as state Department of Motor Vehicles and criminal history 
files, as well as the National Crime Information Center (NCIC)—from within 
each module where such inquiries make sense.  

o  It must also provide the user with the ability to reuse and/or import data 

returned from external sources to eliminate redundant data entry. 

 

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  A records management system (RMS) is an agency-wide system that provides for the 
storage, retrieval, retention, manipulation, archiving, and viewing of information, 
records, documents, or files pertaining to law enforcement operations. In this context, 
records are limited to documents or electronic files directly related to law 
enforcement operations such as incident and accident reports, arrests, citations, 
warrants, case management, field contacts, etc. 
 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  QED is utilized by the entire Department. QED gathers information from several 

areas throughout the department and Public Safety Systems.  

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  Anytime that large amounts of intelligence information are gathered, significant 
privacy implications exist. QED serves as the central report writing and incident 
documentation system for the Department. The Department is required by state and 
federal law, as well as court procedural rules to document a variety of police 
encounters, whether for criminal, civil or administrative matters.  

•  The Cambridge Police Department is committed to responsibly maintaining systems 
in manners that are consistent with Cambridge values and in compliance with its 
ordinances and practices. Only CJIS Compliant Certified Public Safety Employees in 
the performance of their official duties may access, use or disseminate information 
contained in QED for official and lawful criminal justice purposes. Based on its 
current usage and the significant safeguards in place, this technology has a minimal 
privacy impact on Cantabrigians and surrounding communities.

•  Typically, this technology is reserved for members assigned to the Criminal 

Investigations Section.  

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  Anytime large quantities of data and information are accessed, even when those 
data/information are publicly available, significant privacy implications exist. 
Thomson Reuters’ CLEAR boast providing access to “billions of data points and 
thousands of datasets”. Thompson Reuters is a private, for-profit company that 
provides its service for a fee. The Cambridge Police Department is committed to 
responsibly accessing this service in a manner that is consistent with Cambridge’s 
values. The likelihood of disparately impacting a particular population via using this 
technology is small, as it has broad uses, aimed at providing information to assist the 
Department in providing services for those who have been harmed and locating those 
who have caused the harm.  
 

•  CLEAR is subscription-based and access to certain levels of information is governed 
by the user’s level of subscription. In addition to accessing these public records to 
gather information on criminal suspects, the Department utilizes CLEAR to locate 
victims, witnesses and to verify background information on applicants (Public Safety 
Employment or License to Carry Firearms (LTC)). Through the Department’s Legal 
Advisor, it has been confirmed that CPD does not have subscription access to 
advance features such as CLEAR LPR which contains information obtained via 
License Plate Recognition Technology.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

 

•  CPD currently has access to 5 licenses furnished to the Department by the Urban 

Area Security Initiative (UASI) at no cost to the agency. Information as to actual cost 
was not furnished by UASI.

Focused Deterrence Database 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Algorithm to analyze RMS data   
•  The Focused Deterrence Database uses an algorithm to analyze Records Management 
System (RMS) data based on past arrest and incident reports. The database algorithm 
identifies individuals who most recently have caused or been the subject of (i.e., 
victim/survivor) the greatest social harm and could currently benefit from social 
services and a case manager (offender or victim/survivor).  CPD reaches out to 
individuals identified through the Database to offer them the option of joining the 
Focused Deterrence Program.  
 

•  “Focused Deterrence” in terms of policing is a strategy that aims to deter specific 
criminal behavior through fear of specific sanctions, as well as anticipation of 
benefits for not engaging in crime. In its initial iteration here in Cambridge, Focused 
Deterrence closely resembled this. There have always been “variants” of the Focused 
Deterrence program in practice; here in Cambridge, Focused Deterrence has morphed 
into an altogether different program.  

•  Focused Deterrence in Cambridge does not utilize a predictive policing program, 

through the Focused Deterrence Database or otherwise. The department does not have 
a “gang database” (or any semblance thereof) and instead pulls information directly 
from the CPD RMS.  

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Assisting those who have most recently been the subject of the greatest amount of 

social harm and who could currently benefit from social services.

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Crime Analysis Unit and Focussed Deterrence Unit 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact as it analyzes existing incident reports from the 
Department’s Records Management System.RMS. The Department is required by 
state and federal law, as well as court procedural rules to document a variety of police 
encounters, whether for criminal, civil or administrative matters. The algorithm 
utilizes factors such as “role” played and “when” the incident occurred (allowing for 
a decaying weighted analysis). Additionally, crimes are weighted in strict accordance 
with Massachusetts Sentencing Guidelines.  
 

•  The Department is committed to responsibly utilizing data in a way that is protective 
of privacy, civil rights and civil liberties. The potential for a widespread or disparate 
impact is limited; currently 6 individuals are in the Focused Deterrence program. As a 
point of reference, the Focused Deterrence database was not utilized for the 
2019/2020 Focused Deterrence firearms violence program. Involved parties were 
identified through RMS arrest and firearms incident reports from the previous three 
years.  
 

5. What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 
ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  There is no cost associated with this technology; two CPD Detectives are assigned to 

this program in addition to their other duties/responsibilities.   

•  None.

probation. The information is accessed via restricted web site for official use only and 
provided through federally managed application/portal. Only CJIS Compliant 
Certified Public Safety Employees in the performance of their official duties may 
access, use or disseminate information contained in LENS for official and lawful 
criminal justice purposes. The LENS web site informs users that “…Unauthorized use 
is subject to prosecution under Title 18 of the U.S. Code”, and that “…all activities 
and access attempts are logged”.  

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  There are no costs to CPD, the program is federally managed and funded. None.

GPS Tracking Devices (2) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Location tracking through satellite triangulation 
• 

  Global Positioning System (GPS) is a technology that makes possible exact 
location tracking through satellite trilateration (sometimes mistakenly refered to as 
triangulation) using a network of satellites orbiting the Earth. The satellites are able to 
communicate with specialized receivers on the ground, providing the exact location 
of the receiver.  
 

•  The CPD possess and utilizes two of these receivers to assist in certain criminal 
investigations (thefts of bicycles and pacakages).  A GPS device is attached to a 
bicycle or package that might be stolen and, if a theft occurs, CPD tracks the item. 

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

• 

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Various locations throughout the City of Cambridge on an as needed basis (e.g., 

Bicycle Package Theft Sting Operations) 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

•  While the privacy implications for tracking individuals and items using GPS are 
wide-ranging; the technology as currently employed by the Cambridge Police 
Department should have no privacy impact because it is only utilized to track 
property (bikes/packages) stolen from the Cambridge Police Department. 

•  This technology should have no privacy impact since it is utilized to track property 

(bikes/packages) stolen from the Cambridge Police Department. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  The initial purchase price of this equipment was not available.

search warrant or exigent circumstances.  

o  Note: This technology has been/is used in protected spaces during 

investigations with third-party consent: (e.g., complainant thought that the 
presence of dead animals on multiple occasions may have been some type of 
threat; permission was given for CPD to place covert camera in protected 
space to capture image of culprit; it was determined that the dead animals 
were being placed by another animal).  
 

•  Equipment/software does not possess a “search” function and cannot record license 

plates or other personally identifying information other than images of the individuals 
themselves. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

• 
•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Police station interview rooms. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology has a minimal impact since the recordings are all done voluntarily.  
In addition, theAudiovisual recordings are posited to alleviate public concerns 
connected with suspect treatment in custodial settings. There is a compelling societal 
interest in requiring video recording of police interviews and interrogations. The 
benefits of recording custodial interrogations go above and beyond transparency.  The 
benefits extend not only to the accused, but also to the police, defense attorneys, 
prosecutors, fact finders, and the public8.

MAVEN (Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  "MAVEN" is the Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network - a PHIN (Public 
Health Information Network) compliant, secure web-based surveillance and case 
management system for infectious diseases that enables rapid, efficient 
communication among local and state health departments and laboratories. MAVEN 
is an easy way to conduct case investigations and management while also decreasing 
paperwork. The system was purchased and developed in 2005 by MDPH and local 
health partners. The data in MAVEN goes back until approximately 1989 for the 
general epidemiology and vaccine preventable disease events. For tuberculosis, the 
data goes back to approximately 1993. 
 
Infectious disease surveillance is the routine collection, analysis, interpretation, and 
distribution of data in order to reduce morbidity and mortality through the 
control and/or prevention of disease. 
 

• 

•  M.G.L. c.111, §§ 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 94C, 109, 110, 110B, 111 and 112 define the 

responsibilities of the local boards of health and the Department of Public Health with 
respect to the reporting and control of diseases dangerous to the public health. M.G.L. 
c.111D, § 6, references the obligation of clinical laboratories to report infectious 
diseases to the Department.   
 

•  By state law, when a MA resident is diagnosed or has a suspected diagnosis of a 

reportable condition, their medical providers are required to report information about

the patient (when available, full demographic, clinical and epidemiologic information, 
as defined by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health) to the health 
department. At this point in time, most of these reports are automatically sent by 
laboratories and providers electronically to the state health department through 
MAVEN; they can also report information via fax or phone to either the state health 
department or their local health department, where staff then enter this information 
into MAVEN by hand. Reporting is mandated by the state for certain conditions. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  "MAVEN" is the Massachusetts Virtual Epidemiologic Network - a PHIN (Public 
Health Information Network) compliant, secure web-based surveillance and case 
management system for infectious diseases that enables rapid, efficient 
communication among local and state health departments and laboratories. MAVEN 
is an easy way to conduct case investigations and management while also decreasing

health partners. The data in MAVEN goes back until approximately 1989 for the 
general epidemiology and vaccine preventable disease events. For tuberculosis, the 
data goes back to approximately 1993. 
 
Infectious disease surveillance is the routine collection, analysis, interpretation, and 
distribution of data in order to reduce morbidity and mortality through the 
control and/or prevention of disease. 
 

•  Surveillance data is used to: 

o  Monitor disease trends over time 
o  Rapidly detect increases in disease occurrence 
o  Implement control measures 
o  Identify high-risk groups 
o  Allocate resources & guide public health policy and action 

•  There are approximately 90 notifiable infectious diseases that have a required 

 

response.  

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The Cambridge Public Health Department has been using MAVEN since its inception 
in 2005. Access is limited by a user's roles and groups, so, by default, CPHD users 
can see only Cambridge residents’ information. Within CPHD, only those staff who

are required to use MAVEN to conduct infectious disease surveillance work have 
access to the system. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The information collected in MAVEN is considered protected health information 

(PHI) under HIPAA. HIPAA specifically allows public health reporting and access to 
PHI for public health activities without requiring an individual's authorization.  

•  Access to MAVEN is limited by a user's roles and groups, so, by default, CPHD users 
can see only Cambridge residents’ information. Within CPHD, only those staff who 
are required to use MAVEN to conduct infectious disease surveillance work have 
access to the system. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  MAVEN is managed and maintained by the Office of Integrated Surveillance and 

Informatics Services at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which funds 
MAVEN. CPHD staff use MAVEN to do state-mandated infectious disease 
investigations, but are not involved in the initial or ongoing maintenance of the 
system.

Traffic Signal Detection Cameras 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The traffic detection units each consist of a video camera device which is mounted 
approximately 10 feet above one of the traffic signal mast arms at an intersection.  
There are two types of cameras: 

o  MioVision SmartLink 360 cameras 
o  Iteris directional detection cameras 

 

•  The MioVision units are mounted in a location that allows visibility towards all 

approaches to the intersection and provide detection of users in all directions from a 
single device. The Iteris units are mounted for each approach where intersection 
detection is required and provide for detection of users from one roadway approach. 
 

•  The camera communicatesBoth types of cameras communicate a video feed via the 

hardwire signal conduit to the signal control cabinet at the intersection, where a video 
processing unit is installed. The video processing unit analyzes the video feed on-site 
in order to count and classify roadway users approaching the intersection by their 
transportation mode type and direction of travel.  

•  The MioVision Cameras and supporting software and hardware originally included 

the ability to collect video by plugging a laptop into the processing unit located in the 
traffic control cabinet at the intersection or to stream video upon demand to the cloud 
for access through an online portal. Use of captured video is needed from time to time 
to ensure proper functionality of the system to recognize and count vehicles, cyclists 
and pedestrians.

•  At our request, MioVision has changed the default settings so that the City cannot 

collect video at the control cabinet or stream video to the cloud. Only the Vendor will 
be able to collect video in the field or stream data to the cloud. The vendor has agreed 
in writing that they will do so only under specific circumstances and will notify the 
City in advance of streaming or collecting any data. They have also agreed to delete 
all captured video within 30 days. The circumstances agreed upon include: capture 
video for training purposes, capture video for intersection detection accuracy 
validation, capture video specifically to validate a solution to a problem at the 
intersection, and capture video to analyze and detect/root-cause a problem at the 
intersection.  
 

•  The Iteris cameras do not have the ability to stream or record video as configured. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of this technology is to analyze and manage service delivery, in this case 
operation of traffic signals and counting vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. The 
technology provides detection of roadway users, to classify their mode of 
transportation, and to quantify their movements at signalized intersections in the City 
of Cambridge. The aggregated data collected will beis analyzed and used to improve 
the efficiency and safety of operations for all roadway users. The technology will also 
provideprovides City staff with continuous roadway user counts to allow for 
evaluation of seasonal and annual traffic volume variations to assist in future design 
and planning projects.  
 

•  The processed data collected will beis used for two purposes: 

o  Traffic detection – this process provides a notification to the traffic signal 
controller requesting to call or extend a signal phase to allow for dynamic 
signal phasing that adapts to changes in the number of roadway users present. 

o  Traffic counts – providing continuous counts of roadway users traveling 

through the intersection. Counts are broken out by movement (i.e., direction 
of approach and turn or straight movement through the intersection) and by 
transportation mode type (i.e., truck, bus, vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian)). 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  MioVison Intersection Cameras were deployed in the field in the Fall of 2019 at 

multiple signalized intersections across the City.

•  MioVision Cameras will be installed at additional locations as funding becomes 

available.  
Iteris cameras have been installed at isolated locations over the past three years. 

• 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 
•  We expectTPT expects that the impact on privacy will be minimal, for the following 

reasons: 

o  The cameras do not have sufficient resolution to provide personally 
identifiable details in the video such as faces or license plates. 

o  While video streaming and collection is used in an extremely limited and 
controlled manner as indicated abovebelow, the core functionality of the 
technology operates through real-time processing of lower resolution video 
data, resulting in non-identifiable discrete data on number of users and 
deletion of video in real time on-site.  

The impacts of recording the location of individuals, even at lower 
resolutions, will be primarily mitigated by tight controls over when video is 
recorded or streamed.   
 

•  The MioVision Cameras and supporting software and hardware originally included 
the ability for the City to collect video by plugging a laptop into the processing unit 
located in the traffic control cabinet at the intersection or to stream video upon 
demand to the cloud for access through an online portal. Use of captured video is 
needed from time to time to ensure proper functionality of the system to recognize 
and count vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians.  
 

•  At our request, MioVision has changed the default settings so that the City cannot 
collect video at the control cabinet or stream video to the cloud. Only the vendor, 
MioVision, will be able to collect video in the field or stream data to the cloud.  The 
City will have no access to the video. The vendor has agreed in writing that they will 
do so only under specific circumstances and will request permission from the City in 
advance of streaming or collecting any data. They have also agreed to delete all 
captured video within 30 days. The circumstances agreed upon include: capture video 
for training purposes, capture video for intersection detection accuracy validation, 
capture video specifically to validate a solution to a problem at the intersection, and 
capture video to analyze and detect/root-cause a problem at the intersection.  
 

•  The Iteris cameras do not have the ability to stream or record video as configured.

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

 

•  The initial eight (8) MioVision units were purchased for just under $21,000 each and 
funded by the Casino Mitigation Fund. 4Five (5) additional units were installed as 
part of a new private developmentdevelopments and turned over to the City for no 
cost.   
 

•  Previous installation of Iteris cameras were installed as part of new private 

developments and State roadway improvement projects and turned over to the City 
for no cost.  

•  Ongoing operations and maintenance costs for the units will be covered by the 

Department’s signal operations budget.

MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  
 
•  MioVision Scout is a portable, battery operated, traffic video collection unit.  It is a 
standalone unit that is deployed in the field for unattended traffic video collection,. 
Video is collected over a series of days and stored in the Scout unit on a digital 
storage card.  At the end of the data collection period, the unit is removed and data is 
taken from the storage card and processed for traffic data. Additionally, Scout units 
have the capability of detecting and recording MAC addresses from devices searching 
for wireless networks within their range.  MAC addresses and timestamps are then 
transmitted to a central system. The central system then looks to see if the same MAC 
address has been recorded previously by other units and uses any matches to establish 
travel times. During deployment, the units also communicate wirelessly for 
monitoring purposes, but do not stream data. 
 

•  Additionally, there is an optional “Connect” component that can be added to Scout 

units that allows the unit to communicate wirelessly for monitoring purposes (but not 
to stream data) and has the capability of detecting MAC addresses from devices 
searching for wireless networks within their range. With the added ‘Connect” 
functionality, the Scout Unit can detect devices within an 80-100 foot radius of the 
unit.  The Scout Unit uses MD5 hash function to produce a 128 bit hash value for 
each MAC address, pseudonymizing the MAC addresses. This process is 
unidirectional and cannot be reversed, but the MAC addresses remain unique and 
matchable. These hashed addresses and timestamps are stored in the unit during the 
data collection period then transmitted to a central system operated by the vendor, 
MioVision. The central system then looks to see if the same hashed MAC address has 
been recorded previously by other scout units in the vicinity and in the same time 
frame and uses any matches to establish travel times.

•  The City of Cambridge does not own or plan to purchase Scout Units.  However, the 
units are used regularly by traffic engineering and transportation planning consultants 
in order to collect traffic data in Cambridge to complete Traffic Impact Studies and 
other transportation related studies. In the future, the City of Cambridge may contract 
with consulting or data collection firms to collect data, and in turn those firms may 
use Scout units to collect data on behalf of the City.  

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The purpose of this technology is to analyze and manage service delivery, in this case 
collecting traffic video and data that is later processed to provide a variety of traffic 
related data such as turning movement counts, intersection counts and classifications, 
road volume counts, and travel times.   

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

 
•  These units are deployed in the field, at various locations on a temporary basis. The 
units are typically attached to a signal, utility, or streetlight pole within the right of 
way. TheyThe boxes are locked and inaccessible during deployment.  

•  Deployment is based on the need for transportation data for use in a transportation 

study, traffic impact study, or other transportation related data analysis.   

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  MioVision Scout units records Videorecord video at 720 x 480 resolution. This 

standard resolution video offers limited personal information and does not include 
license plate reading ability, limiting privacy impacts. In addition, all video 
recordings will be done within the public right of way.   

•  While data collection is used across the City, it is possible that data collection, and 
thus video recording, will occur most frequently in areas with significant new 
development, thus possibly impacting these areas more than parts of the City with 
less development.   

•  The impacts of the collection of MAC addresses are mitigated to a great extent by the 
use of the MD5 pseudonymization process. There is no personally identifiable data 
remaining in the hashed MAC address, and the process is not reversible.  However, 
because the hashing process will always return the same hashed value for any given 
MAC address- as required to ensure the data remains unique and matchable- some

risk remains. If someone knew the exact time a wireless device was at a specific 
location and accessed the hashed data, they could identify the hash value and then 
find other instances where the Scout unit has recorded that same hashed MAC 
address.  We can further mitigate this risk by requiring that all hashed MAC 
addresses collected within in Cambridge be destroyed once the data has been used to 
establish travel times. We can do this through the proposed permitting process 
mentioned below.  

• 

In the past, consultants have deployed Scout units in Cambridge without approval 
from the City.  Moving forward, the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department 
will implement a permitting system that will require pre-approval for all deployments.  
The permit will require that all deployments meet certain data security and data 
retention requirements.   

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  All costs associated with the use of MioVision Scout Units are paid by private 

 

consultants and/or developers.

Automated Meter Reading System (AMR) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The Water Department’s AMR system is a radio-based system which transmits on a 
Federal Communication Commission (FCC) licensed/reserved frequency.  Meter 
Transmitter Units (MTUs) are attached to every water meter throughout the city. The 
MTU transmits water meter reads in a propriety format.  These reads are transmitted 
every 4 hours on a floating schedule.  For example, an MTU will transmit a read 
today at 6:00AM, and then transmit a read tomorrow at 6:03AM.  The reads are 
received by the Data Collection Units (DCUs) located within the city. The DCUs 
transmit the meter readings, using a cell phone network, to a communications 
computer located at the Water Department.  The communications computer then 
transfers the data to a database computer which translates the data in order for the city 
to view the water meter reads.  This allows the Water Department to provide actual 
reads for billing and allows us to alert customers for potential leaks at their property.    
Below is an example of our STAR AMR software and the data collected:

•  The AMR System allows the Water department to provide actual reads for billing and 

allows us to alert customers of potential leaks in their property. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  Meter Transmitter Units (MTUs) are attached to every water meter/building 

throughout the city and the deployment started in 2004.  Several Data Collection 
Units (DCUs) located within the city were installed in 2004. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  None, there has been no impact.   
•  Every property that has a water service has a water meter regardless of any other 

criteria, and the AMR system only gathers information regarding water usage. This 
allows CWD to provide actual reads for billing and to alert all customers of any 
potential leaks in their property. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  Initial costs – The original implementation cost onin 2004 was approximately 

$4,000,000.  

o  We are nearing completion of an upgrade of the AMR system to replace all 
the MTUs because the batteries reached their life expectancy.  The MTU 
replacement cost was $1,545,600 and the full value of the installation contract 
is $1,102,500.   

o  We also have a contract to upgrade the DCUs and software for $48,380. 

 

•  Ongoing maintenance – The Water Department has an annual maintenance 

agreement for approximately $15,000.   

•  Personnel costs – personnel costs related to reading water meters have gone down 

related towith the implementation of the AMR. 

•  Source of funds – Capital Water Funds for upgrade, Operating Water FunsFunds for 

the annual maintenance agreement.

1. Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data. 

(cid:120) Gun shot detection system
(cid:120) Shotspotter is a gun shot detection system.  Gun shot detection systems are designed 
to be an ever-vigilant reporting ear. In many neighborhoods across the country, 
residents have become so immune to the sound of gunshots that many incidents go 
unreported—many criminals count on this indifference and become emboldened in
such environments. Gunshot detection systems provide a perpetual reporting ear and 
alert law enforcement of these incidents. 

(cid:120) Here is a diagram of how the location of gunfire is obtained using an acoustic 

triangulation system [this is meant to serve as an overview, not to provide highly 
detailed knowledge]:

o Because the speed of sound in air is a known entity—340.29 meters per 

second [.21 miles per second] at sea level—the difference in the time it takes 
for the sound/shockwave of a gunshot to reach three different sensors can 
determine the location of that gunshot. Using a built-in GPS system as an 
accurate time source, three sensors work together to triangulate the location 
from which a shot was fired (illustration below). 

Example:

o A shot is fired somewhere in the city. Sensor 1 picks up the sound of the shot. 
Since each acoustic sensor has a range of about 2 miles, we know that the shot 
was fired within a 2-mile radius of Sensor 1.

o One second later, Sensor 2 picks up the sound waves of a gunshot. Based on 
the known speed of sound, we know that the shot was fired approximately 
one-fifth of a mile farther away from Sensor 2 than Sensor 1. We can draw a 
circle representing the perception radius of Sensor 2 overlapping the 
perception radius of Sensor1—since both sensors picked up the sound waves, 
the shot must have been fired within the overlapping coverage areas. Where 
the two circles intersect, we have two possible locations for our gunshot. 

o To figure out which of these two points is the location from which the shot 

was fired, we need to find a third sensor that picked up the sound of the shot. 
A third sensor, located to the south of Sensors 1 and 2, picked up the sound 
waves a half-second after Sensor 2 detected them. This would put the origin of 
the sound about one-tenth of a mile farther from Sensor 3 than from Sensor 2. 

o We now have our gunshot location [indicated in the above illustration as the 
point where all three circles intersect] at least in terms of distance from the 
sensors. The systems then use built-in GPS receivers to convert that known 
point into latitude and longitude coordinates, where it is converted into a

numerical address. This complex process takes seconds and arms law 
enforcement with the “exact” location.7

(cid:120) CPD has no listening capabilities; sensors are analyzed at Shotspotter HQ in 

California.  Only incidents identified by Shotspotter’s proprietary algorithm as “in the 
class of gunshots” generate a numerical address sent to the Department via the 
application. No other audio is sent to or sought by CPD.

2. What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology?

(cid:120)

Identifying and preventing threats to persons and property and preventing injury to 
persons or significant damage to property
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders

(cid:120)
(cid:120) Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions

3. Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

(cid:120) Deployed across the City with 12 sensors and a 1.1 square mile coverage area

4. What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

(cid:120) This technology has minimal impact as it captures the sound of gunshots. CPD has no 
listening capabilities; sensors are analyzed at Shotspotter HQ in CA, only.  Only
incidents identified by Shotspotter’s proprietary algorithm as “in the class of 
gunshots” aregenerate a numerical address sent to the Department via the application. 
No other audio is sent to or sought by CPD. The placement of microphones has not 
changed since the implementation of the technology; initial placement was based on 
prevelanceprevalence of gunfire or gunshot victims. CPD has the ability tocan request 
movement but the high concentration (relative to Cambridge) has persisted in the 
same area.

5. What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

(cid:120) The technology has a cost of approx. $50K /yr., which is funded by the Urban Area 
Security Initiative (UASI); the City would be responsible for continuing cost should 
the funding cease.

Securly for Chromebooks Web Filter

1. Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data. 

(cid:120) Securly for Chromebooks is employed as a web filter only on all CPS Chromebooks. 
The filter is a Chrome plugin that is managed and deployed at the Google Domain 
level to all CPS owned Chromebooks. One this is setup it requires no other 
maintenance. The web filter will block sites that are considered potentially unsafe or 
harmful to students. 

(cid:120) Securly blocks the following categories of content; Pornography, Drugs, Gambling, 
Other Adult Content, Social Media, Anonymous Proxies, Chat Messaging, Hate, 
Social Networking, Streaming Media and Games. There is also a Keyword blocking 
as well. These are “Generic” filter settings established by Securly. 

(cid:120) CRLS Adminstrators, faculty and students are currently having productive 

(cid:120)

discussions around the acceptable level of filtering in CRLS. Any recommendations 
of the web filter settings made by CRLS Administration will be implemented. 
Securly and logs browser activity whether in school or off campus. The web browser 
log collects web site addresses that were allowed and those that were blocked by each 
Chromebook, along with the student, or staff, ID of the individualthat is using the 
Chromebook. 

(cid:120) The filter is a Chrome plugin that is managed and deployed at the Google Domain 
level to all CPS owned Chromebooks. Once this is setup it requires no other 
maintenance by CPS.

2. What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology?

(cid:120) Maintaining the safety and security of City employees, students, customers, and City-

owned or controlled buildings
(cid:120) Enforcing obligations to the City

3. Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

(cid:120) Securly was implemented Fall 2017
(cid:120) On all CPS owned Chromebooks.

4. What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

(cid:120) The web filter on the school school-issued Chromebooks is the same whether used in 
school or not. The filter logs the user of the Chromebooks as well as web sites that are 
allowed or blocked. The logs of this activity are only accessible by CPS Senior IT. 

(cid:120) Securly is bound via a Student Data Privacy Agreement to NOT reuse any student 
level data for any other purpose other than the Filtering Service for which CPS 
engaged Securly.

(cid:120) All vendor provided provided-applications employed by the school department that 
may, or do, collect student student-level data are protected against inappropriate use 
of student data by the vendor via a valid executedthrough Student Data Privacy 
Agreements (DPA). These agreements ensure that any and all student- level data 
collected is only used for the purpose of providing the service the vendor was 
engaged for, and nothing else. All school department DPAs are available hereavailable 
on the CPS website.1 . The DPAs employed by CPS are both a MA State and 
National Model DPA developed by the Student Data Privacy ConsortiumStudent Data 
Privacy Consortium2 and leveraged throughout the K12 Educational Technology 
Marketplace to protect student data from inappropriate uses. 

(cid:120) All students and parents are advised through Chromebook user agreements that the 

Securly web filter will be employed both in school and off campus. 

5. What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

(cid:120) CPS employs the free version of Securly, which is onlyonly includes the filter 

functions. There are other value addAdditional functionality is available for a cost. 
Once the Securly Chrome add on is configured at the domain level there is no 
additional ongoing maintenance required.

Division or Unit 
(if applicable):
Submitted by:

Surveillance 
Technology:

1. Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data. 

(cid:120) Cameras are installed on all school buses, including buses for special education 

students, along with a posted notice that video recording is taking place. 

(cid:120) The cameras on the school buses allow usthe school department to review any 

incidents that take place, after the event is over.  The cameras allow usthe department
to determine the source of any behavioral outburstsissues on the bus, many of which 
take place out of the line of sight of the bus driver.

(cid:120)

Images and audio are recorded to a box, and the images & audio are retrieved 
manually by the Transportation Director when investigating an incident.  

2. What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology?

(cid:120) Supporting the safety of all students and staff on bus transportation by addressing 

disruptive behavior appropriately.

(cid:120) These cameras provide footage of any behavioral issues that may occur on school 

buses.  The footage helps CPS staff and parents clarify what actually happened during 
an incident and supplements any report from a student or bus driver. 

3. Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When?

(cid:120) All school buses have carried these on board cameras since their original installation 

in FY13.

4. What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

(cid:120) The data from these cameras is not maintained, but is over-recorded at monthly 

intervals.  Without physically retrieving the imaginingimaging data from the bus, it is 
not accessible to anyone.

(cid:120) For all students riding the busses their images and voices are recorded and saved to 

the device located on each bus. 

(cid:120) The recordings are secure and only accessed by the CPS Transportation Director in 
the event of an event investigation. At that time the recordings may be reviewed by 
select CPS Administrators. In some cases, parents can view the footage, but only of 
their child. All other students are blurred. 

(cid:120) All data, unless otherwise archived, is overwritten every 30 days. 

5. What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

(cid:120) The initial cost of the SEON camera system was $47,190 when it was installed in the 

spring of 2013.

(cid:120) There have been ongoing maintenance expenditures for moving equipment to newer 

buses, and adding cameras as needed. 

o FY14 $4,955
o FY16 $12,500

(cid:120)

It is not possible to determine the personnel costs of using this equipment.  The 
Transportation Director must board a bus after an incident and download the images 
in order to proceed with an investigation, but it is difficult to quantify the time 
involved.

(cid:120) Both equipment and personnel were funded from the School Department General 

Fund.

The Ordinance Committee will meet for a hearing on an order to amend section 11.202(b) of the 
zoning ordinance 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  00:14 
Good evening, everyone. A quorum of the Ordinance committee being present. I call tonight's 
meeting to order. The call of the meeting: The ordinance committee will meet for a hearing on 
an order to amend section 11.202 B of the zoning ordinance. We are being audio, and I believe 
we're on TV, audio and video recorded. Thank you everyone for being here. Real quickly, we're 
joined by my co-chair on the Ordinance committee Councillor Carlone, Mayor Siddiqui, Vice 
Mayor Mallon, Councillor Nolan, Councillor Zondervan and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  01:02 
Just to sort of, sort of frame this a little bit this is a... this meeting is coming from a policy order 
that was filed. Councillor Zondervan was the lead, the lead sponsor to raise the current linkage 
fee to $19 and, and 10 cents per square foot. This is not the end of this conversation. We, when 
we heard from CDD previously, there is still a process that we need to go through to address 
the, the report itself and sort of where we're going to end up based on that report. But during 
that conversation, it became clear that we could take this interim step of raising the fee by a 
couple dollars, while we are moving forward and doing that other work. So, I don't want anyone 
to think that this is the end of this conversation. In fact, that is actually just the beginning of this 
conversation. And this is something that we felt that we could do quickly to try and generate 
more funds while this slightly longer process is going on. So, I don't want folks to, you know, to 
feel that this is the end game here. We are going to hear from the city that they're going to do a 
quick presentation on the Nexus study, sort of in general, just to frame kind of where we are, but 
then, and then we will move on to questions, comments and public comment. So, with that, Ms. 
Farooq, you got, you got the mic. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  02:50 
Thank, thank you, Mr. Chair.

Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  02:53 
I just wanted to mention that today, we have our housing team who worked on the Nexus study. 
Chris Cotter, Housing Director, and in Linda Prosnitz, who is our Housing Planner, managing 
the process we thought it would be helpful opportunity for the council to hear from our 
consultant, Karl Seidman as well, just to, to be able to expound a little bit on what are the... what 
was the process and the findings of the study. Of course, we have Jeff Roberts and Arthur 
Goldberg from the Law department as well. And last night, the planning board had their hearing 
on this, this zoning petition and made a positive recommendation on it with the further 
invocation to the council to think about the... whatever was the highest possible amount that 
could be ultimately established, because they did feel like an increase was good. They felt that 
this was probably the small increase, and particularly, particularly given that it doesn't include 
the $1 a year escalator that is recommended by the study. So, I'll leave it at that. Give it over 
to... 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  04:14 
Let me interrupt for just one... just so because you know the call... And what we're amending is 
specific to the $19 and 10 cents. So just for my colleagues to when, when we hear this, we're 
really, I'm hoping that we don't get into a real in-depth conversation about the Nexus study 
specifically, because that's not really what the call of the meeting is. That and I want to make 
sure we stick to the call. So, Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  04:15 
Thank you just a point of information to repeat I believe what you said early, which is there will 
be relatively soon at another meeting of the Committee on the Nexus study, which means that 
conversation will happen and it can be full-fledged and comprehensive This, therefore will be 
limited and can be limited to this without any. Okay. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  05:04 
Correct. Yes, I also, you know, if we didn't... if we wanted to have the conversation and what the 
whole next study it would have been advertised that way. We might have had more people, I 
think it's important that we, you know, stick to the call as the call is. So, but it is also important to 
understand the big picture as to why we're taking this interim step. But I just in terms of 
questions, let's try to keep the questions to the $19 and 10 cents and not get too deep in the 
weeds of the report since that's not what the call is. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  05:32 
So, in the interest of time, then maybe we just get Carl Seidman to do the presentation and then 
kick off the conference discussion if that's the will of the council. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  05:42 
Sounds good. 
 
Karl F. Seidman, Consultant  05:59 
Thank you, city council members. I'll try and be quick, I realize you don't want to get into the full 
details of the study. But, you know, I know you're all familiar with the incentives zoning 
ordinance, established in 1988, amended in 2015 currently has a fee of $17 and 10 cents per 
square foot on all non-residential development over 30,000 square feet. You're also probably 
familiar with the 2015 Amendment, which raised the fee significantly and also expanded the 
application of the housing contributions to you know, all non-residential development essentially 
not tied to specific special permits. And just to show you the impact of those amendments, they

have significantly increased the revenue. It's projected to bring in over $5.7 million a year over 
the next five years compared to, you know, something on the order of 5% of that in prior years. 
So, it has had the desired impact. In terms of this particular study. We analyze development and 
employment trends and impact since that's ultimately what's generating the impacts. The 
contribution is designed to address, looked at an option for job contributions and then made 
recommendations on a new contribution rates and policy changes. Just to quickly give you an 
overview of the recommendations, recommending to raise the current housing contribution rate 
by $6 through a $2 increase in an additional dollar increments, maintain a single city wide rate 
but also change the time period for the policy review from three years to five years since that 
seems to be two shorter time period to really observe impacts, and also recommending that in 
lieu of the jobs contribution, you might look to meet the housing, the job training needs through 
other funding sources that could come into play more quickly.  
 
Karl F. Seidman, Consultant  08:24 
So, I won't go into this. It's in the report, there's a very prescribed methodology that was used to 
estimate the impact of new development on affordable housing demand and the acquired 
subsidy. And just to summarize some of the key points. we're estimating that development over 
the next 10 years will be on the level of 5.8 million square feet and generate almost 15,000 jobs. 
And these jobs will create a demand for 722 units of new affordable housing across low income, 
moderate and middle income. And then working with the city staff, we made a number of 
assumptions about how that would break down between low income, moderate income, middle 
income ownership and rental units. And that's way down in this chart and in the report. And 
then, based on that need for housing, we estimated the required subsidy. So, to build the 
necessary rental housing, it would cost $284 million. The actual income that residents could 
contribute will only provide a little less than $43 million of capital to pay for those costs. So, 
there's a need for subsidy of $240 million to build 471 rental units. On the ownership side, the 
building the 251 ownership units would cost $157 million. The income that buyers could provide 
would cover $75 million of that so there'd be a required subsidy of a little more than $92 million. 
So, we add those together, we have a total development subsidy that's needed of $322.8 
million. When we divide that by the expected level of new development, we get into a required 
subsidy per square foot $55 and 27 cents. However, we made some adjustment to that to reflect 
the fact that the Affordable Housing Trust has typically not covered the full subsidy. Other 
sources of funding of help pay for affordable housing. So based on recent experience, we apply 
Housing Trust Fund providing 43% of the subsidy for rental projects for low- and moderate-
income residents. 73% of the subsidy for middle income rental and 100% of the subsidy for 
ownership housing.  
 
Karl F. Seidman, Consultant  11:15 
So, based on those figures and the ability to bring in another subsidy, we came to a final 
conclusion that housing contribution fee could be $33 and 34 cents. Let me talk briefly now 
about the job contribution. Since this is a new policy area, I just wanted to talk about the sort of 
rational Nexus for having a job contribution. And the basic logic here is that new development 
will create employment opportunities for Cambridge residents. But many residents may not be 
able to access those opportunities without education and training services and there may similar 
to housing the funding gap to provide those services and if there's a funding gap, then a job 
contribution is warranted. So, since the city doesn't currently have a policy of resident 
employment for new development, we sort of looked at this across a range of goals, from 10% 
to 50% of the new jobs at these development projects going to city residents. And we focused 
really on the jobs that would be accessible to lower moderate-income residents, the low and 
middle skill jobs as opposed to jobs that require a college education and pay a higher wage. So, 
we estimated that at 5900, low and middle skill jobs over 10 years that sort of represents the

training demand. If your resident goal is 10%, you want to train 593 people for those jobs at 
40%. You're going to train 2373 people for jobs. So that's sort of the demand side of 
occupational training. And then we looked at the supply side from all these providers who 
provide training to Cambridge residents and how many Cambridge residents do they train 
during the year. And that indicated that the current training system is training somewhere 
between 1080 and 1300 Cambridge residents over a 10-year period, and that's so that's the 
supply side of the equation. We also looked at the potential need or gap for funding for adult 
basic education and ESLL. And our conclusion there was that existing services are essentially 
meeting that need, we don't need to provide additional funding for that. So the final figures we 
came up with when we compare the demand with the existing supply, there is a funding gap 
once you get to a policy goal of employing 30% of Cambridge residents in the new jobs, and the 
amount of funding you need would be about between $4.7 million and $8.8 million dependent 
upon the goal and the level of supply. So that would translate into a housing contribution fee of 
between 82 cents and $1 and 51 cents. 
 
Karl F. Seidman, Consultant  14:32 
So, I'd say we also did work in a number of policy options such as changing the size threshold, 
varying the contribution rate, or use varying the contribution rate by geography. I think 
ultimately, the recommendation was to sort of stay with the existing policy environment. There 
are not many projects under the 30,000 square foot size threshold so there's not much impact in 
changing that. While impacts vary by use, the administrative complexity and the difficulty of 
knowing for sure how changes might, how uses might change over time argue for keeping a 
uniform rate by use. And there is a big difference between rents in West Cambridge and East 
Cambridge. But there was some concern of creating a sort of boundary where fees will be 
different, could have unintended consequences in terms of development. So, in terms of some 
context for setting your fee, this table summarizes that the fees and in other cities locally, 
Cambridge has the highest fee by a significant margin. It's still lower, at some level to places like 
Seattle and San Francisco, which on some level, you might think of as, as competitive cities to 
Cambridge for some of the industry's you're attracting. And then lastly, we gave some 
consideration to what impact the $33 and 34 cent fee could have on Cambridge's desirability, 
competitiveness as a location. And it would have an impact on commercial rents, increasing 
them by some... between two and a half to 4.3%. If the fee was paid totally by developers’ 
equity and not passed on to tenants, it could reduce returns by as much as 100 basis points. 
And I think the other consideration for Cambridge is you have, certainly East Cambridge has the 
highest rents in the region. And a large increase in the fee, you know, will further potentially 
impact those rents and, and make you know, Boston or some of your other locations particularly 
more attractive, and I think West Cambridge in particular, that could be a concern since your 
rents are considerably higher than some of the competing suburbs. So, I think these factors led 
me to recommend a final fee that's less than the 33, 34. And to come up with a fee that, you 
know, in the mid-20s, that would be implemented over time so that it's predictable and 
developers could plan for it. So, I'll stop there. I went through that quickly. I know, this really isn't 
the focus of your meeting. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  17:32 
Thank you. Way to summarize 100-page report in 15 minutes. So again, the call of this meeting 
is really about this interim increase to $19 and 10 cents. That was a policy order that was... 
Councillor Zondervan was the lead sponsor. I will... Councillor Zondervan do you want to talk 
about that order and why you filed?

Thank you, Mr. Chair and thank you for the presentation. So essentially, we reconstructed the 
timeline a little bit. Mayor Siddiqui in February 2018 filed a policy order requesting a timeline for 
this study that we just saw. And in March, we were told that it would be completed... would be 
initiated fall of 2018 and will take about six to eight months and ultimately, it was not delivered 
until December 2019. So, at that time in December, when we received the report, there had not 
been an update to the linkage fee other than the CPI adjustment since September 2018. So, we 
introduced this petition to... based on the recommendations, immediately increase it by $2. Just 
as recommended in the report. And so that petition is in front of us now. There's clearly appetite, 
I think in the community and on this council to increase it even further. And even in this report, 
that's noted. And personally, I would prefer that we go at least to the $34, if not, all the way to 
the $55 or higher. You know, it's, I mean, I appreciate this analysis and this report, but I don't 
think it really accounts for the full impact of commercial development in terms of gentrification 
and displacement that it causes in our city. So, it's really important that we get this right and that 
we mitigate those impacts. So that will take us some time to process this report and figure out 
what the right answer is. And so, the intent of this petition was to just very quickly increase it by 
a fairly non-controversial amount of $2, which would generate hundreds of thousands of dollars 
for affordable housing construction projects while we deliberate and the ultimate fee schedule. I 
do want to touch briefly on the planning board hearing last night, because the... first of all, 
there's different language that I think CDD proposed, as compared to the original policy order 
still achieve the same purpose. It's just textually different. So, I asked Dan to print out copies for 
everybody. So, we have that before us because I think we want to vote on that text rather than 
the original policy order. And then there was some discussion about whether we could increase 
it again, within three years. If we increase it now. And I had some discussion with the law 
department, and we can basically interpret that ruling as applying retroactively. And so, we can 
modify the, the ordinance and the fee at the same time when we're ready to do so. So, I hope 
we can pass this with a favorable recommendation and, and then get into the deeper discussion 
on what it should ultimately be. And one more thing is that we would also want to amend the 
date upon ordination so that it takes effect when we ordained it, because right now it says 
January 28. So probably it will be ordained in early March. So, we would just change the date at 
that time. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  22:01 
Okay, thank you, Councillor. So again, to my colleagues any, again, the call the meaning was to 
go to the $19 and 10 cents. I do have a... as you are doing your presentation, there were a lot of 
questions I had about the bigger picture, certainly around the job creation piece to I've been 
working with some folks I won't name at the moment because we don't have an agreement, but 
on putting money towards free... making Community College free for graduates of our high 
school. And Boston does that and part of the way Boston funds it is through their linkage fee. 
And so, you know, I'm curious as to... I have a lot of questions about that, because I think that's, 
you know, would be something that would be really beneficial and how we would do that, but I'm 
going to hold off on that until the later date. So, are there questions from the council? Councillor 
Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  23:03 
Thank you. I understand we are just focused on this one section. And based on what Councillor 
Zondervan said it sounds like we might need to make sure that the language is exactly what the 
memo of the CDD is. I'm just curious as to whether we can amend it right now, understanding 
that is $2. But at least right now, instead of $19, and 10 cents to $20 and 10 cents to include an 
extra dollar right now, we are in the hottest time of development right now, whatever projects 
that can apply to the sooner the better. I know that, which we all know, that when the rate was 
raised just a few years ago, it clearly didn't have a, one iota of impact on the amount of

development that happened in the city so that the sooner that we can get to a greater amount of 
linkage fees in my mind is the better and I recognize there's a range of opportunity for us in the 
future to change it, but it seems to me that I would like us to raise it even more, especially that it 
sounded like the planning board last night suggested that it could go up even higher than just 
the $2. So, I'd be curious as to if they had a specific recommendation for more than this $2 and 
whether we couldn't do it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  24:22 
Mr. Roberts? 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  24:24 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'll start just to summarize the planning board recommendation. They... I 
believe planning board expressed that they understood the intent of the city council to make the 
change to this rate now ultimately, expressing the opinion that they, they believe the rate should 
be as high as it's reasonable, deemed reasonable by the City Council to, to make it but also 
acknowledging the purpose of this effort is to establish a, an immediate increase and then 
continue to discuss future increases at some future time. I would caution that there is a zoning 
petition before the city council and ordinarily, there may be question... with any zoning petition, 
any amendments that are made would need to remain within the scope and it'll be the same, 
substantially the same as what was originally advertised as the zoning petition. So I would 
generally defer to my colleagues at the law department for advice on whether a change such as 
an amendment that would increase the rate during the hearing process would be seen as 
remaining within the bounds of the original petition or whether it might be considered something 
that would need to be then re-advertised for new hearings. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  26:07 
Can we get that legal? Not right now? 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  26:11 
Mr. Chair, I think raising the $19 and 10 cents $1 would be within the original petition. I don't 
think that is such a dramatic change from what was advertised as to require a whole new 
process. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  26:31 
Okay, and I propose that... I'm not sure how to propose it. But if I'd love to. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  26:38 
So Councillor Nolan is making an amendment to raise the fee to $20 and 10 cents per square 
foot. Discussion? Councillor Simmons. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  26:50 
I thank you. I just want to be clear, because we just got the planning board report and we've not 
read it yet. So, I guess my question is, and I think my colleague spoke to, but I wasn't trying to 
quite grasp the answer. So, if we went to $22 or say $24, would we be able within the 
discussion on the incentives zoning... Within that discussion, will we be able to still if there was 
an interest to go higher?  I mean, I think it was 30... between 34 and 50. I don't have it in front of 
me. So, I just want to be sure what we do now. One does not lock us into doing something when 
we have a fuller discussion. And then I and then again to you, Mr. Chair. Did you say you 
believe or did not believe that if we did that, did vote to change it tonight. We, we could do that, 
or we could not do that because we are making some change that needed to be advertised. I 
wasn't clear. I just wanted to be sure about that.

Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  28:01 
Through you, Mr. Chair.  Gesundheit. I said that I believed you could go up to $20 and 10 cents 
without having to advertise this petition.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  28:18 
Okay. And then still in the discussion. Excuse me, through you Mr. Chair. And then if we ask me 
later, look at the fuller document, have a longer conversation about the workforce contribution 
and all those other little nuances. And the council's felt that maybe we should go up a little 
higher, we'd still be able to do that? 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  28:42 
I believe you could do that. Yes, because this that would be a separate zoning petition, and 
separately advertised and as Councillor Zondervan pointed out that to the extent there's less 
language in the ordinance now about there has to be a study no less than every three years 
from the previous amendment of the rate. To the extent that language was seen as limiting what 
the council could do its ordinance language so it can be amended by the Council, if the council 
so chooses. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  29:23 
And then my last question is more to my colleagues. So, I believe my colleague said 21 or 28? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  29:30 
Twenty. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  29:31 
Twenty. And I just wanted to hear from the rest of my colleagues. Is that about right? Is it still 
too low did we want to make it higher? So, before I sort of, if you will indulge your colleagues, 
before we kind of just jump into the $21 bandwagon, onto that bandwagon. I'm interested in 
hearing a little bit more from my esteemed colleagues, where they are on that. So, with that, Mr. 
Chair, I yield the floor. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  30:00 
Pleasure of the Council? Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  30:06 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think the fear that Mr. Seidman mentioned about it affecting labs and 
offices in particular in West Cambridge in Alewife area actually doesn't bother me because I 
act... I believe we're over... We're encouraging too much of that kind of development, traffic-
oriented development. If you look at the rents in East Cambridge, yeah, this might be average, 
but we're hearing rents over $100 a foot in new buildings. And the developer, I think, and we 
have an expert here, a couple experts here, will get that back over time and then some. So, I'm 
fine with it at 20. But if we want to entertain more, I think that's fine too. But the real, the real 
issue is what are we going to do in the next phase of this analysis? And this is a holding pattern 
that Councillor Zondervan brought forth that makes all the sense in the world, incrementally, 
incrementally increasing it is Councillor Nolan has suggested, I'm all for and knowing the 
market, as I do, certainly in East Cambridge, knowing the market. This will have absolutely 
minimal impact. I agree West Cambridge might be affected but as I said earlier, I think we're 
over developing the office and lab market in West Cambridge any way, given the transportation 
available. Thanks Mr. Chair.

Mayor Marc McGovern  32:01 
Mayor Siddiqui. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  32:02 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think Mr. Roberts mentioned this earlier. Going back to the first 
paragraph on page two, I assume this was written by Mr. Roberts, but it says, I don't know who 
wrote it. But note that the text changes below are intended only to establish a new rate of 19.10 
with ongoing adjustments made for CPI but without establishing any other future rate increases, 
because the petition does not explicitly state whether such increases are intended. It seems that 
to clarify Mr. Solicitor that you think it would be okay beyond 19.10 and if that is the case, it 
contradicts his language. But I think going to 20 that seems reasonable to me. With the... I think 
expectation a lot of us had that we, you know, we have a lot of questions. We do want to think 
about what that amount is. And that will require I think, some further discussion. I haven't read 
the report in a while and so I wasn't prepared to really go through and think about those 
numbers and think about that. I don't think any of us were, so I think I'm trying to 20, I think 
concert of Simmons asked. I'm fine with it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  33:29 
Thank you. Pleasure of the Council? Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  33:31 
Thank you. I would support Councillor Nolan's suggestion to go to $20.10 and which is dollar 
higher than was proposed and ultimately, I think we need to go much higher than that. I think 
we're all on the same page about that. And one of the... I had two questions. One was about the 
for... $1 annual increases and setting that tonight. I'm just a little confused if we all agree we're 
going to go and set it higher why we're deciding that tonight if it's just in case a meteor hits that 
we, we have that side or if there's some other reason there. And then the other question was 
about one of the slides in the presentation. It seems like all the other metropolitan areas outside 
Boston, break linkage down by zone or by use. And I'm just curious if there are different 
demographic or economic factors that go into that or why that isn't prevalent in Boston.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  34:22 
Who wants it? 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  34:23 
I could take part of it. Mr. Chair. I think if the council were tonight to go beyond the one year, 
the, the one change to the 19.10. If you were to go to other years, I think that would require 
another petition. And another advertised hearing, so I think that would go beyond what's before 
you tonight. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  34:50 
If I could just follow up, I just think I'm not sure why we're including annual increases if the idea 
is to in the next couple weeks... Is that not part of the... It's not what we're considering tonight 
Okay, great. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  35:03 
Pleasure of the Council? Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  35:08 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I feel like I'm in an auction. I think we should go as high as, as we can. 
But I think tonight, we should probably, I mean, I only propose $2 because I figured that will be

quick and easy and non-controversial. And then we would buy ourselves enough time to have 
the deeper discussion about where it should ultimately end up. So, I think, you know, if there's 
appetite to go to 20, then by all means, let's do that. And then [sic] let's advance the petition and 
have the deeper discussion. I think we should probably vote first to adopt the amendments 
proposed by CDD and then amend it further to $20 and 10 cents. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  35:58 
So, just my, for my $2 and 10 cents in this comments. You know, I think one of the other 
reasons we went to, we went to 19.10. Also, because we felt it was a pretty quick and an easy 
thing to do, but also, that's what the recommendation was. So, I don't want to go too far above 
that tonight for just one is sort of to make sure we're on solid, you know, legal footing, I think 20 
is fine. But if we were to go to 25, 26, 27 tonight, I think that's a different ballgame. And, and 
also, I mean, just in terms of fairness, I think if we had advertised this, that we were going to go 
to $25 or $26 or $27 per square foot, my guess is that the business community would be out 
here, people would want to come out and have that conversation. I don't think it's really fair, that 
we go too far beyond what we advertised. Because I don't think that's really you know, that's not 
what we, that's not what we said we were going to be discussing tonight. So, I want to be a little 
mindful of that. So, I think, I think the $20 and 10 cents is within that, within that range and is 
fine. So, I would certainly support that amendment. But I probably wouldn't go much higher than 
that tonight. But I do, you know, for folks in the... I hesitate to speak for my colleagues, but I 
think I feel pretty comfortable saying that nobody wants us to hang around and to linger that we 
want to have this discussion about going, increasing this fee even more, sooner rather than 
later. So, you know, I don't, I don't think that this is something that we're going to do this and 
then we're going to come back to this in eight months, or, you know, or seven or seven months, 
I think we're going to look to forward this conversation more quickly and get to another number, 
you know, in quick order. So, you know, at the end of the day 19.10, 20.10. If we amended this 
in three months, and it's 35 or whatever it ends up being, you know, that $1 difference isn't 
really going to make a big deal one way or the other, but I think... So, I'd be fine with that. But I 
think we need to... I wouldn't go much higher than that tonight. So... Councillor Mallon or Vice 
Mayor, sorry. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  38:09 
Point of information. Before we vote, are we going to be hearing from the public? I see some 
people here signed up. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  38:17 
Yeah. [sic] we have public comment. We can... We have a motion in front of us for the 
amendment. So, we have to sort of deal with that first, but yes, we will, we will go to public 
comment. So, there's... Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  38:35 
Sorry, if I don't know the rules, if it makes more sense with this protocol for me to withdraw that 
to you from the public before we vote on it, I would be happy to do that. I don't know what 
makes most sense for all of you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  38:47 
You can, you can do that. We also have, we also have to adopt the amended language from 
CDD. And then also Councillor Zondervan. You talked about taking out September 20, January 
28, and putting in upon ordination. So, we do have another couple of the amendments floating 
around, but I think we can... I don't think any of those were formally made. So, I think we can 
hold off on voting on those until public comment. So, I guess we will go to public comments

now. Please, when I call your name, come to the podium, state your name and your address, 
and you will have three minutes. Chris Schmidt followed by Alexandra Markiewicz. 
 
39:32 
Chris Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street. Thank you all for considering moving ahead with this. I really 
appreciate the work that went into the Nexus study and the numbers that we're seeing. It seems 
clear to me that there's some confusion among members of the council, among CDD, among 
the community about this moving with 19.10, now. I'm not going to really like sit here and nitpick 
over $1 or two here or there. I'm actually much more frustrated that I haven't seen any 
movement in the past two months on what comes next. You know, we've passed in December, 
sending this to Ordinance committee and there's no other committee hearings scheduled on the 
full Nexus study, as, as was pointed out by Councillor Zondervan. This was, you know, later 
than we expected. And I really hope that that can be scheduled. I know that everyone's here 
saying, we really want to get this done. But, but there's nothing on the schedule that I can see. 
So that, that's the biggest thing that I would say is like, you know, there's clearly an appetite 
from the members of the council, from the members of the community. And, and I know, the 
business community, as you said, is going to come here and tell us, you know, we'll never build 
a building again, in Cambridge, just as soon as you'd say it's going to be $34 or $2. They'll say 
that, but, you know, we really want to be having those conversations, because, you know, now 
we wasted or spent two months on this process. It's going to be another two to six to eight 
months before we get something else done. And we're going to be talking about an entire year 
of development that's not subject to, you know, a fuller rate. I'll also call out you know, just 
briefly, I think the Nexus study does a good job of analyzing, you know, a certain subset. You 
know, people who want to live in Cambridge because they get a new job here and would be low 
income or other things like that. But as Councillor Zondervan pointed out, does not 
accommodate for displacement and the many the other effects that the commercial businesses 
have. And that applies to jobs and to other things as well. I, I know I'm saying things you've all 
heard. I know that and I recognize that. The difference between $19 and $20 tonight makes 
much less difference to me, than the difference between $20 and $34. And that was the 
conversation I wish we were having tonight. So, thank you for your time, feel free, you know, 
please move forward in the expedient way. But the most important thing is not this 10%, 5% 
raise. It's, it's to talk about the 50% raise we should really be talking about. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  41:43 
Thank you. Alexandra Markiewicz followed by Peter Williams. 
 
41:51 
Hi, Alexandra Markiewicz, 6Laurel Street, just here to lend my support number one to be 
against taking action where we can, so lend my support for passing the $20, I guess it is, fee 
tonight. But then echoing Chris's comments, moving quickly on understanding how we can raise 
that even further to somewhere where we're tangibly increasing opportunity for affordable 
housing, finding what is the point where we can optimize that. So, encourage folks to... 
encourage the members of the council to move forward on that. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  42:32 
Thank you, Peter Williams fall by Larry Bluestone. 
 
42:38 
Hi, I'm Peter Williams, 35 Homer Avenue. I guess I don't really have a whole lot to add from 
what you've just heard. I'm really glad to see the energy for this kind of work, and the council 
here today. And, you know, I'd love to see things go up. I think, has been said before, you know,

really $3 even this kind of $50 number that seems like something that's a could make a real 
difference. But the first step is what we're talking about tonight. And so, I just really want to 
voice my support for moving forward as expeditiously as we can. Thanks. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  43:08 
Thank you. Larry Bluestone. 
 
43:13 
Good evening, Larry Bluestone, 18 Centre Street. I just want to echo what everybody has said 
before me. I fully support the increase that is being proposed tonight. But I think we soon need 
to move on to the larger conversation of increasing the linkage fee considerably more than what 
has been recommended in the Nexus report. The one point I do want to make is that if we do 
discuss significant increases in the future, the jeopardy always couched in how developers will 
react to it. Developers have a much greater issue which is they have to rent their buildings to 
businesses. Businesses need to attract employees and those employees will not come if they 
cannot afford to live in the area. So, increases in linkage fees are going to be beneficial to 
developers, and I hope we consider that in the future. Thank you.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  44:05 
Thank you, Alan Sadun, followed by Carolyn Fuller. 
 
44:12 
Hi, Alan Sadun, 17 Pleasant Place. I know the call for this meeting is narrow. And as Councillor 
McGovern said, this is not the end of the process of understanding the Nexus study. And I 
support this amendment with reservations because it will raise some money for affordable 
housing and that's good. But I have reservations because I know that needed change can come 
very slowly, especially when temporary action has already been taken. I worry about the fact 
that, you know, we're now considering in late... other business an extension to the tree 
protection ordinance because action on permanent policy was slower than expected. I worry 
about the fact that to my knowledge; no further meeting has been scheduled yet to discuss 
further action on raising the linkage fee. So, I want to underscore the fact that our affordable 
housing linkage fee should be raised significantly higher than $20.10. That action on this issue 
should not get lost. The Nexus study as Councillor Zondervan noted does not account for 
displacement. The primary concern that motivated the modest recommendation of the Nexus 
study was regional competitiveness. But the forecasted impact on regional rents even in the 
worst-case scenario, is miniscule compared to the year over year increase in commercial rents 
caused by construction industry changes and the general intensification of commercial interest 
in Cambridge real estate. So, raising the linkage fee is really not what's going to make or break 
our regional competitiveness. I don't want to stray too far off the topic of this meetings call. So, I 
just want to reiterate my hope and request the subsequent study and discussion begins soon 
and proceed swiftly and boldly. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  45:40 
Thank you, Carolyn Fuller, followed by William McAvinney. 
 
45:45 
Carolyn Fuller, 12 Douglas Street, and I just want to reiterate what everybody else says which 
means I support you passing the petition tonight. But I hope the $20... and I hope you take up 
discussion soon, very soon.

Thank you, Bill McAvinney. 
 
46:07 
Bill McAvinney, 12 Douglas street, Cambridge. I am here to support this passing. But I also am 
feeling like we are currently incentivizing commercial development over housing development. 
It's a little difficult to figure out what is the comparison between inclusionary zoning and linkage 
fee. But I did a sort of back of the napkin type approach to trying to do that. So, I figured while 
it's kind of obvious at 20% inclusionary, the rental, the other rental units in the building will be 
25% additional to cover that 20... to cover the ones they're supporting. If there were no income 
from that, there is income from that. I took a guess that the average income of people in the 
affordable housing units is $60,000. I suspect that's really high. But 60,000 times 30% is 18,000 
per year. I also guessed that well, I know that 2700 is the current median rental income in 
Cambridge, for new units, I suspect is higher. So, I guess 3000 are approximately 3000, 3000 
times 12 is 36,000. So, 18,000 is half of 36,000. So, you could trigger roughly 50% less than the 
25%. So that's 12 and a half percent. I've heard figures of a minimum of $400 for just 
construction costs on new, new construction. Twelve and a half percent of.... Where was I... 
Twelve and a half percent of $400 is $50. So that's kind of rough guess, of a minimum of what 
we are charging our housing developers. So, I think our commercial linkage fees should be 
much closer to that. Thank you.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  48:12 
Thank you. Jonathan Behrens followed by Lee Ferris. 
 
Karl F. Seidman, Consultant  48:19 
Jonathan Behrens, 115 Hampshire Streets. I'm going to echo the statements by everyone, 
pretty much everyone before me and say that this action is good, but we need much further 
action, hopefully soon after. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  48:33 
 Thank you. Lee Ferris. 
 
48:38 
Hi, Lee Ferris, 269 Norfolk Street. I am speaking for the Cambridge Residents Alliance. We 
strongly support this increase and $20 is certainly better than $19 and we would like it to go 
higher. And you certainly had strong support from the planning board last night, saying that it 
should go higher as well. And they said that they felt it was basically a political judgment for the 
City Council as to how high exactly it should go. So, they hand it off to you guys. I know you're 
not considering going higher tonight, but just for food for thought going forward. The planning 
board members noted that the study does not include the impact of the new jobs in the 
commercial buildings on existing rents in existing apartments. And they noted that the 
commercial buildings in effect displace building housing. And my observation, a little bit similar 
to Bill's is that Cambridge, it's not getting the right ratio of commercial to housing square footage 
per year. And it might be good for our bottom line of taxes, but it's not good for livability of the 
city. Our tax situation is quite good. So, I think we should, when we come back to the further 
consideration of, of increasing linkage further, we should think about that ratio of, of commercial 
to housing. I also want to address the ways that the report calculates... why it doesn't ask for 
50... $55 per square foot. So, as I understood it, what the report does is subtract the amount of 
contribution that the Affordable Housing Trust Fund has been making. And they say that the 
Affordable Housing Trust Fund has contributed 43% to recent affordable housing developments, 
and so they project that forward. I don't think that that's the way we should calculate what we 
need because we just increased for the first time substantially the city revenue that is going to

affordable housing last year. But that's still not enough. And if we presume that the trust is going 
to contribute 43% of everything going forward, we will never catch up, because I think we can 
count on the federal and state funds not continuing to provide the remainder at the level that we 
would need if we presume that we're going to continue to fund at the 43% rate. So, I think a lot 
of the calculations in the report, or the report may need to be revisited. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  51:42 
Thank you. Is there anyone who did not sign up to speak who has been so inspired that they 
want to get up now? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  51:51 
Come on up, name, address. 
 
51:53 
So, Henry Wortis, 106 Berkshire Street. And I'm speaking for myself and also Our Revolution. 
We're strong supporters of this as a first step. And the only thing I would add beyond applause 
for what other people have already said, is that we're facing a deficit built up over the years in 
which there has been under investment in housing, affordable housing, that has resulted in 
displacement of many, many people. And in effect, those people have basically supported 
through their laws, the commercial development that has fueled the favorable tax rates that the 
rest of us have enjoyed. So, there's a lot to be made up and this is a welcome first step, but 
speed is also important because We've got decades to catch up on. Thank you very much.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  53:04 
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  53:05 
On a motion by Councillor Zondervan to close public comment. All those in favor say aye. 
Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. Real quickly, just for the folks who talked about the 
timeline. And we certainly hear you just not to... Just to put it in a little bit in perspective, you 
know, we didn't run into a little bit of a problem where, when this came forward in December, we 
were switching, the council was switching over there was a change in the administration of the 
mayor's office. Committees were announced in the middle of January. We have been, 
Councillor Carlone and I have been meeting with CDD and with the mayor, to talk about all the 
other... there's a number of ordinances that are in front of us to make this happen. So, you 
know, there were a lot of... it's just some of it is a question of bad timing, but we, I will apologize, 
I'm taking my first vacation in two years with my kids next week. But when I come back, we have 
a meeting that Monday to really lay out a timeline for all of these pending issues. So, you will, 
this is going to happen, I promise you this is going to happen and it's going to be scheduled 
soon. So, with that, there are three amendments.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  54:22 

The  first  is  to  amend...  is  to  amend  11.202  Section  B  amend  by  substitution  with  CDD 
language 11.202 Section B. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have 
it. The second amendment is an amendment by Councillor Zondervan to change January 
28,  2022  to  upon  ordination,  all  those  in  favor  say  aye.  Those  opposed  nay.  The  ayes 
have it. The third amendment by Councillor Nolan to change $19 and 10 cents to $20 and 
10 cents. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. And then on a 
motion  by  Councillor  Zondervan  to  send  the  amended  language  to  the  full  city  council

The Government Operations/Rules and Claims Committee with meet to discuss potential 
amendments to the Rules of the of City Council 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  03:00 
Good morning. A quorum of the government operations and rules committee being present I will 
now call the meeting to order. I'm Denise Simmons, chair, and present this morning is Councillor 
Marc McGovern. Mr. Neal Alpert, our Clerk, Mr. Anthony Wilson, Councillor Zondervan, 
Councillor Toomey, and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. We will be joined I believe by Nancy 
Glowa from the clerk's (as she arrives). The City Manager gives his apologies for not being here 
this morning. I will now read the call: "The Government Operations, Rules and Claims 
Committee will meet to discuss potential amendments to the rules of the city council."  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  03:46 
Our agenda is going to be as follows: I will give brief opening remarks, we'll then hear from our 
city clerk Anthony Wilson, after which I will introduce some items that were submitted in writing 
by the Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon, who gives her regrets about not being here, so please have 
the record show that she's an excused absence, and Councillor Zondervan as well as my own 
suggestions. I will open the floor to hear from - well, before we do that, we want to walk through 
the document rather quickly, only taking those pieces out where we want to make amendments. 
We will then hear public comment, take any unnecessary roads after that and then we will 
adjourn. So welcome to the first meeting of rules claims for '20-21 of the City Council term, as 
the term is just opening - as the term is in its opening weeks, and we have a new member and 
two new city councilors, we'd like to take this opportunity to review the rules that will govern the 
City Council through this term. Hopefully these proposed tweaks and adjustments will help the 
City Council function more smoothly going forward. This morning we'll ask our City Clerk, 
Anthony Wilson, to share some of his thoughts about the rules governing this body from his 
perspective as our resident parliamentarian, two members of the committee, Vice Mayor Mallon 
and Councillor Zondervan, have offered their suggestions for rule changes, and we shall bring 
those forward for discussion, I will introduce a couple of rule changes I would like to bring 
forward for discussion. And after that, as I said earlier, we will move into public comment. I 
would also ask; I went around just introducing everyone that was here present for the meeting. I 
will yield the floor now to our city clerk after which we will run through the agenda. And we might

do this, which is when your particular change, we get to that item, we might just stop and say at 
this point, let's make this change. So, you have changes that you - for example, Councillor 
Zondervan, say you wanted to make changes in a particular section - I would say when that 
section comes before us, you could then offer your amendments. Clerk Wilson? You have the 
floor.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  06:03 
So just as a sort of brief overview, as I'm sure most of the people here are aware, the City 
Council rules function as a document that provides guidance on how the city moves forward - on 
how the council moves forward in handling its business. The primary function of the rules is to 
allow for smooth meetings that are predictable and regular. The city council and its operation in 
addition to its rules are governed by several other laws including the city's ordinances, state law 
most the one that most probably comes up is the Open Meeting Law. And so, rules changes by 
the City Council are often cabin by those other caveats. I see we have the City Solicitor here to 
guide the council as it makes rule changes within that regard. We've got at least proposals from 
three councillors: Councillor Zondervan, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillor Simmons, I've had a 
chance to review all of the submissions from all of the counselors. I have, I guess I will address 
my comments to specific changes or thoughts that I have on specific changes when they come 
before the body. But generally speaking, the council should consider as it reviews, the reviews 
these proposed changes, thoughts about logistically how this will affect the council - its 
operation in terms of reviewing legislation and passing that legislation on to potentially be 
ordained or adopted in some form or fashion by the body. With that, I turn it back to Madam 
Chair.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  07:50 
Thank you, Mr. Clerk. So, without any further discussion, does everyone have their rules 
document? Some of us don't.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  08:00 
If I may, Madam Chair, if there are any councillors that have their laptops, the rules are available 
online on the City Council webpage. I can also have Naomie make copies for the remainder of 
the body. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  08:14 
Okay, while you do that, I will just start going through. So, if you look at page one, it's rule one. 
Are there any changes? Let me give you a moment to get there. Councillor Toomey? If you 
would use your mic, or the mic closest to you. So, the Councillor just - I'll, let's wait a few 
minutes, let our Executive Assistant get copies, and when everyone has a copy, I'll continue. 
So, you now have a copy, and Councillor Zondervan, are you online? Cool. Alright, so rule one 
that's on page one. Are there any changes? Hearing none, we're going to move to Duties and 
Powers of the Chair. That's rule two.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  09:14 
Are there any changes, would people like me to read them out to them? If not, I'll just go 
numerically through each rule. People need it read out? Hearing no, then I will not read them 
out. Rule three. Any changes? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  09:35 
Rule four - are there any changes?

Rule six, which talks about all final votes of the city council. Any changes? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  10:03

Rule 10, any changes? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  10:35 
Rule 11, any changes? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  10:43 
Turning to page three, we are now at rule 12, any changes? I don't have any changes, but I do 
want, I did highlight that when a question comes under debate to avoid personalities. This is 
something I always mentioned when I was chairing a meeting as a call, I did not do it for this 
meeting. So, I apologize, which basically goes over the rules of decorum for the public. I don't 
see public per se. But had there been one, I think it's always important to say what the rules of 
decorum are, particularly when we have people that are coming to a meeting for the first time 
and don't always know what the rules are, but speak specifically - this kind of talking to us right 
now about not engaging in personalities. And again, it was something that I practice, particularly 
as mayor, I know, Councillor McGovern, as mayor practiced the same method of operation, 
which is just reminding people, even when we talk to each other, we don't say well, Neal Alpert, 
I disagree with him. I would say something more like "the council just introduced that, I 
disagree." And by doing that, I think it also sort of dampens down any personality conflicts that 
might arise. I just want to note for the record that we've been joined by Councillor Nolan, I'll ask 
her to take a seat at the table, please join us. Okay, we are on page three. And what we're 
doing is we're taking each rule and asking if there's any changes. So, we're at rule 13 Yes. 
Please use the mic. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  12:29 
I really apologize for not being here earlier. I actually had a question on page two, would it be 
okay to ask that? And it may already have been addressed. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  12:37 
Nothing. Do we have unanimous consent to go back to page two? Hearing no objections, 
Councillor, you have the floor. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  12:46 
Thank you. I was in reviewing this, and again, I apologize if it's already been discussed, but on 
rule six - All Final Votes of the City Council on Questions Involving Expenditure of $50 or More - 
I was curious as to where that dollar amount came from and whether it's still appropriate, given 
the amount of money we're spending, I know on School Committee, it's more like $5,000. As

you might remember that there are individual votes taken not that the information wouldn't be 
shared but that that seems like a relatively low amount. So, I don't know if that's already been 
discussed and if so, I apologize. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  13:14 
We did not discuss it. It's interesting that you should bring it up because I put a question mark 
by it, but usually - I'm pleased our solicitor or our clerk actually can speak to this - usually all 
votes that we require money, we just take a roll call vote on and maybe that preempts the need 
to put on amount because every vote that has money requires roll call vote, but I will defer to the 
clerk and then to Ms. Glowa if you want to add. Mr. Clerk, you have the floor. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  13:43 
Yeah, I will end up turning this over to the city solicitor, but under state law, the expenditures of 
funds most of those require the expense and require roll call vote of the City Council. There's 
recently been an amendment to the state law, The Municipal Monetization Act, I think it may 
have changed the amounts that the city council was required for roll calls on, but the city 
solicitor would know more about that. I think, I don't want to put her on the spot. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  14:10 
Madam solicitor, you have the floor.  
 
Nancy Glowa  14:13 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I do not know the exact amount I guess I would say that since it's 
been the practice of the council to take a roll call for the expenditure of money and that is 
something that's a significant part of the role of the Council. I would recommend leaving it alone 
but if you like I could look at the exact under the Municipal Modernization Act, what the floor is 
for the lowest amount that is required and report back to the council.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  14:41 
So, we will put it we'll put a pin in this one that City Solicitor will come back because we do need 
to have a final looks through before we present this to the council. So, think of this as clearly a 
working meeting. Any questions we put them forward on the table, solicitor or the clerk will get 
back to us with final suggestions for which that we would then move this favorably forward to the 
council for adoption. Thank you. We're going to go back now to page three, I lost where I was. I 
was on 13. Are there any changes? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  15:17 
I don't suggest any changes. But I do,  I did highlight this to say, and I talked to the clerk a little 
bit about this, at some point, it might be just helpful for the council to have what I would call 
Robert's Rules 101, you know, what's the difference between a point of order and a point of 
personal privilege? Some people take those get those two confused, but also in addition, not 
this council, I'm happy to say but in the past people would take point of order as an opportunity 
to hijack the agenda in terms of changing the role of the order of who speaks by say, oh point of 
order. Mark has the floor is a point of order and then Marc says, "You know, I really don't agree 
with that because..." and then he goes on. That's not a point of order. That was hijacking the 
agenda, not to use you, you never do that Marc. But just to give you an example, so I think it's 
important for people to understand the difference between a point of order, a point of personal 
privilege, and there is another one that escapes me right now, just to know so when you know 
how it works, when to insert it, when not to. Mr. Clerk.

So briefly, and I can send something around, if councilors are inclined, to direct them to the 
specific citation, the Robert's Rules of Order but a point of order -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  16:31 
This lovely book that looks like a paperweight -  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  16:37 
But a point of order is, is a particular action where the any councilor, essentially may raise it at 
any time to ask the question if the city council is following its rules as adopted. So for example, I 
can't think of a good example right now, but if a city councilor is - I think a good example may 
during public speak, if an individual speaking on something, it's not any agenda and the chair, or 
the mayor does not stop them, a councillor may raise a point of order and say, "I believe our 
rules instruct us to keep people to, I think items and" -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  17:14 
I think I have an example for you. Yesterday, during Public Comment, there was clapping in the 
gallery. And I think I raised the point of order because that was something that we had laid down 
in terms of our rules of behavior, that we wouldn't do clapping, hissing, booing. And so to keep 
with that, so I raised that as a point of order because we broke with the order that we have been 
observing prior, which is we didn't do that because we didn't want to raise up one group of 
people to the disadvantage of another group of people. I yield the floor. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  17:48 
So, in summary, a point of order since simply directs the body to recognize its rules and enforce 
its rules as those instances arise. A point of personal privilege is, or a point of personal privilege 
is a little bit more flexible, in the sense that it is a member asking for something that they would 
not normally be entitled to, for example, an older member asking to stand during the 
proceedings or, or asking to be excused  to get some water or to do something that is not 
particularly in conformity with the rules. It's really at the discretion of the chair whether or not to 
allow the point of privilege, but it's discouraged to allow members to do things that are in direct 
contradiction with the rule. So, points of the points of personal privileges are essentially for the 
comfort of a member. The only other place where I've seen it used that sort of might take it out 
of the comfort range, is a councilor maybe saying that their vote wasn't recorded properly or to 
say, you know, my statement was not properly reflected in the minutes, something like that. But 
essentially, it's to provide for the comfort of members in a specific circumstance.

Councilor McGovern? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  19:11 
So a lot of times - through you, Madam Chair - a lot of times people will say, point of order to 
just ask a question, Where are we in in this what what's the, is there may not be questioning 
that, that we're violating a rule, or it may not be a special request to stand or what have you, but 
they have just a general question of procedure, what have you,  so what would they use in that 
case?

So being put on the spot, obviously, you know, always my mind goes blank, but there's a 
particular question that comes up as a question of information. Again, the point of any of these 
particular motions points of order, points of personal privilege, or particular question to the chair 
or not to redirect debate, if a member needs to ask a question to clarify where they are in the 
proceedings that can be appropriate and important, so that the councilors know what they're 
voting on and sort of how the meeting is proceeding. But it should be the question of the point, 
the response, and then we'll back to whatever the body is doing, and not really a time for debate 
on those particular items.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  20:32 
Any further questions on that? Councilor Toomey? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  20:34 
I didn't see anything in here for a member of the chair to call for like a 10 minute recess? Should 
that be in here? I know last time at times we've had to, because the meeting kind of getting out 
of hand and stuff that maybe public safety issue that the chair, a member, would ask for a 10-
minute recess. Should that be spelled out here? I don't see it here. So, is that allowed? Because 
I don't see it here. I'm just curious. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  21:05 
So, though the chair: the rule, I don't know exactly where it is, there is the rule for I believe the 
rule for calling a recess is in the rules, I'd have to sort of go through it to double check. But even 
if it is not, the city council rules specifically incorporate Robert's Rules which talk about a recess, 
which is a motion which members can call anytime it's one of the motions of what's called a 
privilege motion therefore can be called it anytime. And so, if it is not specifically laid out in the 
city council rules the city council can amend the rules to add it. I'm going to take a moment to 
sort of review I believe I've seen it in here. And it would be in order to call the meeting to recess 
for things such as the public being disorderly or people needing time to review a particular 
document something of that nature. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  22:01 
Thank you, Mr. Clerk. Councilor Toomey? Are you yielding the floor? Ok then. Number 14, then. 
Any questions? Changes?  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  22:17 
Hearing none, we'll move to rule number 15. Mr. Clerk? 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  22:24 
If I may, Madam Chair. So, I just did a sort of brief review of the rules. And so, the motion to go 
into recess is not specifically laid out in the rules. It's not specifically laid out in the city council 
rules. But it is a part of Robert's Rules, which these rules specifically incorporate if the council 
wishes to add a rule talking about recess, that's entirely appropriate. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  22:44 
Thank you. So, to the councilor, are you asking that some note, some mention of how to 
properly call or put on the floor, the need to recess, would you like that incorporated in the 
rules? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  22:57 
Something to consider, I think if it's in the Robert's Rules, and we can utilize that, that's fine as 
long as the chair and the members are aware of that. I think, certainly last term, the mayor

called brief recesses several times. So, I just wanted to make sure that it's something that's 
allowed, and we can't be challenged on that. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  23:14 
Absolutely. And I would agree we have had, fortunately or unfortunately, a couple of times in the 
last term to have to call a recess to kind of cool the temperature in the room. And so, it's good to 
know that tool whether or not you use it is not important. It's to have in your toolbox of operating 
procedures. Miss Glowa, I see you pulling the mic, would you like to have some input on this 
item? Do you yield the floor, Councilor?  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  23:43 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to note, as the clerk noted, that the rules provide that if 
something is not addressed in the council's rules, then you look to Robert's Rules. But since our 
rules do not explicitly provide for this, and this is an important issue as you've all just discussed, 
you could consider putting in here in rule 13 make a point of order request an explanation 
request a point of personal privilege or request a recess or request that the chair call a recess. 
So, you could make it more explicit if that would be of interest to the council.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  24:25 
Thank you, Ms. Glowa. Councilor Toomey, yes?  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  24:28 
Madam Chair, I would move to amend, to add that language. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  24:32 
So, we will add up to one to one of several motions that we would add to rule 13, Call to 
Recess. And this will also ask I think sort of drives home the point the need for us to then do a 
little tutorial because we're going to be adding new practices and procedures in that we know 
how to use them. Very good. Any further on this item? Having yielded floor, we'll move to 
number 14: any changes or amendments?  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  25:04 
Number 15? Hearing none, I move to rule 16. Councillor McGovern? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  25:16 
Just in terms of consistency: rule 16 and rule 35 both deal with reconsideration. In rule 35 -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  25:28 
Which is on page? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  25:29 
Which is on page 12, it notes that you have to be on the prevailing side to file reconsideration. 
So, I just think, for consistency, if we're talking about reconsideration and rule 16, we might want 
to say that as well. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  25:53 
Very good. Any questions or discussion on that item? Then there will be language added to rule 
16 on reconsideration for consistency, thank you. Any further discussion? Hearing none, we're 
going to go to Special Events, Presentations and Regular Meetings. We are at rule 17. Any 
changes to number 17? Hearing none, we move to rule 18. Hearing none?

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  26:39 
There's no change, but I think if we do a little sort of tutorial, it would be very important to talk 
about when meetings start: what happens when a chair is not there. And what happens when 
neither chair is there. The most senior member and then the most senior member by age, and I 
think people don't often know that until we have had a situation where the chair wasn't there, 
and no one knew, or could figure out right there in the moment, who should chair the meeting. 
And so, I think that'd just be important thing in terms of going over the rules once they've been 
promulgated, to do a little tutorial about those items, so that we'll understand and not be sort of 
trying to figure it all out. Also, in that rule 18, this is a curiosity to me:  "All city council meeting 
show and no later than 12 o'clock midnight." Now, that's what the rules say. But I know that we 
have to our own probably discomfort, when we've had a meeting going that went past midnight, 
we would move to have the meeting extended, but it doesn't speak to that here. And so, I'm 
curious, are we not following the rules, or when it gets to be 12 o'clock, regardless, the meeting 
just adjourns? Or are we in safe waters, where we call for a vote to extend the meeting to a time 
certain? I yield the floor to you, Mr. Clerk. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  28:13 
I believe the practice of the city council to extend the meetings has been to suspend the rules, 
which is particularly to suspend the rule regarding when the meeting should end, which requires 
a two thirds vote. So - and the council has the power to suspend its rules on a vote of a number 
of its members. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  28:33 
So, thank you. Thank you for the edification. I think it should be written in the rules because it's 
not there. I want to pause to welcome our mayor and thank you for being here. It's been the 
practice (and that we did on the school committee side for years), but when I read the rules, I 
said I didn't know that just says the meeting ends. And I think if it's not codified or put in writing 
someone from the public might just say - not challenge us on the floor because they can't do it, 
but might raise it as "Well there's nothing in your rules that say you can continue the meeting 
past 12 o'clock." So, if it's a practice, let's put it in the rules so that it's there in terms of 
transparency, and everybody and being on the same page. Councillor Nolan?  
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  29:26 
Thank you, Madam Chair. If this is the appropriate time to raise a question on the regular 
meetings, it is a question of how summer meetings get scheduled and the question of whether 
instead of having just one summer meeting, which I believe has been the practice whether there 
might be a way to at least if not, it's right through July and August, at least have one meeting in 
July and one in August? Having attended many of the council meetings at that summer meeting, 
which is somewhat similar on school committee, but even less so is that those agendas can be 
huge and long because so much time has elapsed since the prior meeting. So, I wonder if it's 
the will of the council to at least consider instead of having just one meeting for all of July and 
August to have maybe one meeting in July, one in August, and if this would be the appropriate 
rule to amend to that, as a consideration? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  30:17 
It would, it seems to me that this is the appropriate place to amend that. It says that "If agreed to 
by majority of the council at any other suitable public meeting within the City of Cambridge at 
5:30..." - it says: "...from the first Monday in January, to and including the last Monday in June, 
and from the second Monday in September, to and including the last Monday of December," -- it 
doesn't really look like it speaks to summer meetings. And so the interesting thing about the 
summer meeting, just I would say by practice, it was the practice for the council to adjourn -  the

idea is it gives you opportunity to retool, if you have children, you know, you have this block of 
time to reorder your life. And in the past, it gave us an opportunity when we were falling behind 
with some committee reports, minutes and things of that nature, to catch up. The current 
councils, not just this one, but the trend over the last several terms has been that we just plow 
through the summer. And that does make, that's why those agendas are so rich. Before? There 
was I'll call a "gentle persons agreement," we just didn't meet in the summer. And again, that's 
not the case anymore. And so, I think it's certainly something we should think about because 
two things have to happen. Either we amend the rules to have plow right through, we don't have 
adjournment,  or we have a shorter adjournment, or we exercise the discipline, that anything 
that needs to be done gets done before June so that people do have that time.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  31:56 
The only other thing I might mention is the impact on staff. So, we often when we do have 
meetings, we call staff to attend those meetings, beyond the clerk. We have a law department; if 
it's a particular area of expertise, it might be Human Services, or DPW. And the practice, I'm not 
saying it's the rule, has been people would say, "Oh, well, the summer it'll be quieter, and we 
can do what we've been putting off." So, I would say the Council has put before us the idea of 
maybe having more than one meeting in the summer. Are there - if you yield the floor on that, I 
want to see if there's any discussion on that. Otherwise, I will put it into the document as 
something for the clerk and the city solicitor to work on. Because what would that look like? Is it: 
do we meet, instead of adjourning in June for the summer, and then having one special meeting 
that the mayor calls, it means that we meet, are you asking that we meet in July and meet in 
August as opposed to just meeting and August? So, do you yield the floor? 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  33:01 
Well, I would answer that question with that I was not suggesting that we meet every single 
Monday through the entire summer, but just pick one meeting in July and one meeting in 
August, with the hope and expectation that that would perhaps make the fall meetings less rich, 
because we have dealt with some of the issues that come up over the summer. So that was the 
concept for consideration. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  33:23 
Discussion - Councilor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  33:27 
Thank you, Madam Chair. The rules do not speak to the July meeting. So, I'm presuming that's 
a special meeting that we just traditionally called at the end of July? So, it would seem to me 
that if we wanted to also have a meeting in August, that would also be a special meeting. And 
I'm not quite sure that we are in a place where we could amend these rules in an informed way, 
because we don't really know what the needs would be for a meeting in August. So maybe 
there's a way to have a sense of what the agenda would look like before we call a special 
meeting. I don't know exactly how we would do that. But if there's a certain number of 
submissions that are pending for policy orders, or city manager updates that we would identify a 
need to call this special meeting. And I don't know if we want to codify something like that in the 
rules, but I would be a little bit cautious about changing the schedule. Especially given that our 
current schedule, in terms of this July summer meeting isn't already in the rules. So that's a 
special meeting. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  34:57 
Thank you, Councillor. Further discussion?

Councillor Timothy Toomey  35:01 
I strongly feel that the July meeting is sufficient. And I go back to a lot of the points that you 
raised. That is the time for - the committee meetings still take place during the summer, but it is 
a time certainly for the staff to sort of regroup and get a lot of committee reports done a lot of 
vacation time that takes place during the summer months. And I think it's in fairness to every 
staff that they have an opportunity to get some rest too. And after July meeting, the council can 
buy suspension of the rules, extend the meeting to complete the business. So that option is 
there. And I think we've utilized that several times in the past. And I think having that July 
knowing that there's the one meeting in July, people are focused on making sure that they get 
their policy orders in and conduct the meeting in an efficient way so that all the business is 
taken care of. So, whether we have a meeting at the end August and then usually the second 
Monday in September. I'm not sure how much that would alleviate a heavy agenda and in 
September, so I think leaving it the way the July meeting is more than sufficient. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  36:21 
Thank you, Council. Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler, do you want to weigh in on this? Madam 
Mayor? 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  36:29 
Thank you. I think I'd just add that if it's looking, to Councillor Toomey's point, I think, and 
Councillor Zondervan's point, I think if it's looking like it's going to be a busier season, then we 
have that conversation in early June. And look at the calendar right now. I'm looking at July and 
it's I think we usually do it for the last week, that last Monday in July. Sometimes it's that first 
Monday in August, and then between then, and then Labor Day, it's four weeks. And I know that 
folks go on vacation, and that's a prime time. So, either we do a meeting, maybe on July 15. 
And then if we want, we can do one, two weeks later if we are worried, but I think it's not in the 
rules. Better to not put it in now and then just have open communication through a 
communication or so forth. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  37:33 
Thank you, Madam Mayor, Councillor McGovern, anything on this? Madam Solicitor? I thought 
that you wanted to speak.  
 
Nancy Glowa  37:40 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I did but it was on a different point, the earlier point about who would 
be chairing meetings. I believe that that's provided either in the charter or the municipal code. 
So I want to say that If the council wanted me to, I could look up that provision and report back 
to the council, if it is provided there, but I know that it has been traditional that if neither the 
mayor nor the vice mayor was present, it would be the most senior member. And if on occasion 
there have been two members of the same seniority than it would be what's already there.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  38:23 
It's in the rule. And it says if the senior members have the same amount of years, then you go 
by age. 
 
Nancy Glowa  38:30 
I stand corrected. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  38:32 
Okay, very good, thank you. So, on this point, I do understand what my colleague is saying 
about the agendas coming out of the actual term being so rich that by the time we get to July or

August, the agenda's like this. But I do also hear what is codified in the rules: if we say that we 
will have a July and August meeting, then we would have to have a motion, I believe, to not 
have it because it's now in the schedule, which might get cumbersome, I don't know. That's 
number one. Number two: one idea is what we have been doing is the mayor just calls a special 
meeting of the City Council. We usually connect it with the senior luncheon so that people, 
people that tend to go away, but want to be here, the two have been sort of in the area of each 
other the summer meeting and the Harvard luncheon. Not to say that we should be scheduling 
what we do around Harvard's luncheon, but that has been the tradition. Again, I'm not rallying 
for that. I guess my recommendation would be, and I put this to the floor, is - let me go back. We 
have the provision already that the mayor can call a special meeting, correct Ms. Glowa?  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  39:56 
Yes, Madam Chair.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  39:57 
So if the mayor has the privilege and opportunity, right, to call a special meeting and it's been 
our practice to call a summer meeting, my inclination is to kind of not change that because 
again, I think it gets more cumbersome to have to have a motion at a meeting that's not 
happening to have a meeting, that's not happening. Any thoughts on that? Councillor 
Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  40:29 
Thank you, Madam Chair, perhaps it might be helpful to add to the rules, again, it's more for 
clarification than anything else, that state that if necessary, the mayor will call one or more 
meetings during the summer to conduct the council's business. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  40:49 
Thoughts on that? Councillor Toomey, thoughts on that? Because you've said just stick with the 
one, you were arguing to keep just the one meeting, your colleague is saying we could put 
provision that says at the discretion of the mayor, we could add a special meeting. Your 
thoughts on that? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  41:07 
It's redundant, the mayor can call a special meeting at any point for any purpose, so... 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  41:12 
Ok. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler? 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler  41:16 
Thank you, Madam Chair. Through you. I think that makes sense. To sort of clarify - 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  41:21 
Which makes sense? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  41:22 
Adding the extra sentence sort of elucidating what the procedure could be. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  41:34 
I think because it calls out, I think we have a special meeting procedure, that it is redundant. I 
think the only thing it changes, and I would look to you, Solicitor Glowa, if we want to get more

specific. But saying summer somewhere in the rules, I'm okay with the special mayor's 
discretion.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  41:58 
Councillor McGovern? You're fine with leaving it the way it is?  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  42:14 
So, I'm fine with adding that extra language for clarification. I do agree with Councillor Toomey 
that it's redundant, but I think we're redundant in other places as well. And it's not making a 
change. It's just highlighting what's already a rule. But I honestly, I - pleasure of the committee, I 
don't think it's necessary, but I don't think it hurts either. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  42:40 
Were you looking like you want to say something? No?  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  42:43 
No, Thank you, Madam Chair. I think it's the pleasure of the Council.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  42:45 
Councillor Nolan, and then Madam Mayor. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  42:48 
Thank you. And for me, it actually surprised me to see in the rules that summer meeting isn't 
mentioned at all. And if I just read this, I would assume there was never summer meetings since 
it really only anticipates regular meetings January to June and September through December. 
So, it was actually a surprise to me as a member of the public who has been to those meetings 
that it's not actually in the rules that at least one summer meeting will be the language proposed 
is one or more doesn't even say it will necessarily be one summer meeting. So, for me, it's more 
clarity whether it's redundant or not. Because under special meeting, it doesn't say a special 
meeting, for example, a summer meeting. So, since the word doesn't appear anywhere, if you 
just read these, you would think the council didn't even have that summer meeting, which is to 
deal with the richness. So, for me, it seems like it would be prudent to add it because it's more 
clarifying as opposed to redundant because of that timing. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  43:39 
Okay, very good. I think we're divided on this question. I don't even know how we would -  I 
could ask the clerk or the solicitor to put language together, but my inclination - I would be 
leaning toward not doing it. It's sort of like the if it ain't broke, don't fix it kind of ruling and I just 
I'm afraid that - I want a little bit more wiggle room. And because it's under the discretion of the 
mayor to call special meetings, it's been our practice in every meeting that we have, however 
big or small whenever it may happen. It's all publicly announced or presented, people would 
know about it. So my inclination and if I can read the temperature, it's four not to change it, and 
three to change it, but I'm always concerned about told this five members of the committee 
segment to vote so - you're not on the committee so you would not have the option to vote on 
this, I don't believe, but the clerk could correct me on this. Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  44:43 
Thank you, Madam Mayor. I do agree that it would be redundant, and the purpose would be just 
clarification. The language that I'm proposing would say, if necessary, the mayor may call one or 
more special meetings during July and August to conduct the council's business. And so, it

would just be a clarification for someone reading roles including newly elected councillors to 
have an expectation that there would be a potentially a meeting during the summer. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  45:18 
So again, I think we're divided on that, on that question. And then in terms of the members that 
are actually voting members of this committee, there may not be sufficient votes, but I could call 
for a motion, and we can see if it's accepted. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  45:34 
Can you read the language again? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  45:36 
So, moved. The language says if necessary, the mayor may call one or more special meetings 
during July and August to conduct the council's business. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  45:46 
So, there's a motion by Councillor Zondervan to amend the rule to rule 18 to add language 
relevant to special meetings in the summer. Only members that are appointed to the committee 
can vote on that. Is that correct? Right. Right. So, all those in favor, say aye. Opposed?  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  46:09 
No.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  46:09 
No. So there's how many, four of us present?  
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  46:14 
I'm ex officio, so I can vote.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  46:17 
So, are you voting in favor of or against adding this language? 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  46:22 
I'll vote in favor.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  46:26 
Through you Madam Chair - just for clarification there are five members present from the 
Committee. The members are Councillor Simmons, councillor McGovern, Council, Councillor 
Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor Toomey, Councillor Zondervan. And the mayor is an ex officio 
member, which will make six members. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  46:46 
Alright, so, on the motion that we add this provision, it appears that there are votes for the 
provision to be added. So, the provision goes forward as part of the recommendations in the 
minutes to the full Council on the affirmative vote of I don't know. Councillor Zondervan voted for 
it. Wheeler, Nolan - 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  47:13 
That's right, Councillor Zondervan, Wheeler, and the Mayor and McGovern voted for it. Four 
against, four in favor.

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  47:24 
I think I'm not supposed to vote. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  47:26 
Say again? I have to announce the vote? 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  47:29 
No, no, I'm sorry. I don't think I can vote. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  47:34 
Councillor McGovern just brought to my attention and I think he's correct that although the 
mayor is a member of every committee ex officio, I believe that the mayor does not vote. So, I 
wanted to clarify that. If I could add another point of order Madam Chair. I thought that this 
would be properly placed in rule 19, because in 19, because if necessary, "the mayor may call 
one or more special meetings during July and August" would properly fall under Special 
Meetings rule 19 not under Regular Meetings rule 18. So, if I could suggest to Councillor 
Zondervan, that would be the appropriate place for such a rule if it's agreed upon by the 
committee.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  48:25 
Alright, so, a couple of things. On the vote of the Committee on Rules, that motion - pass on a 
vote of three in favor and two against - I think I had that right. But now I think we have to amend 
that vote, because Councillor Zondervan asked it to be added to rule 18 and the solicitor is 
recommending that it should be added to rule 19 - correct? So, then we will vote to add the 
amendment that was just voted that it be added to rule 19 and not rule 18. So, on the motion: All 
those in favor say aye. Opposed? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  49:11 
No.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  49:14 
The ayes have it with four voting in favor and one voting against. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  49:18 
Madam Mayor, further clarification: are we on 19 now? It's my understanding that four members 
- and it says, "any four council members can call a special meeting." But my understanding is 
they can call a special meeting but if five members don't show up, there's no meeting because 
there's no quorum, is that correct? 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  49:41 
Yes, that is correct. A quorum of the council is five regardless of whether there's a provision 
allowing for four members to call for a meeting. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  49:52 
That should be clarified, and so does it need to be? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  49:56 
So Councillor Toomey is asking that we - 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  49:58 
I just don't want people to feel by four members we're going to -

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  50:01 
It says four but actually you can't do it unless you have a quorum and the quorum is five. So, on 
a recommendation that that rule be cleaned up to reflect what actually happens, and not what's 
here, which is a little misleading. Any discussion on that? Do you have that Mr. Clerk? Okay. 
So, we're going to send this all to you as PDF with the red lines in it so you can see the changes 
a lot easier. Anything else on rule 19? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  50:36 
So, on the motion to go from four to five, all those in favor say Aye? All those in favor say Aye. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  50:44 
Sorry, point of clarification: are we voting to change the number from four to five? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  50:51 
What Councillor Toomey has said in the solicitor has said to be true, it says four members could 
call a special meeting. But it takes five to actually to hold the meeting. And so, he wanted to 
change it from four members could call it to five, because that would reflect what the quorum 
asked for, if I understand what he said. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  51:17 
Right that wasn't my understanding, I thought he was offering to clarify that. I think it would be 
problematic for five members to get together and try to call a meeting because then as soon as 
they're together there, it's already a meeting. So, I don't think we can change that number. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  51:35 
So Councillor, we'll put that up for the solicitor or the clerk to address, but Councillor McGovern 
it looks like, did you want to...? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  51:44 
I was going to say the same thing. I think if there were five members, it would be an Open 
Meeting Law violation. If all five members got on the same policy order to call a special meeting. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  51:55 
Good point. So, you have to leave it at four to call, but five have to attend for the meeting to go 
forward. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  52:03 
If I may, Madam Chair: members may discuss scheduling a meeting. They can't discuss the 
substance of legislative items before them. But scheduling is specifically called out in the Open 
Meeting Law guide as something that members can discuss. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  52:23 
If I could - we have gotten guidance from the Attorney General's office on that point, and I would 
hate to have any confusion about how much can be discussed. The Attorney General's Office 
interprets that fairly narrowly. So I would respectfully suggest that you could leave this as four 
members could call a meeting, but point back to rule number one, which provides that all 
business to be conducted at any meeting requires a quorum of five so you could put that part in 
here, as well, to make clear that although four members can call a meeting, five members must 
be present for the meeting to be convened.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  53:03 
Discussion? Councillor McGovern? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  53:08 
To our clerk's point: it wouldn't just be scheduling. I mean, I would assume you would have to 
discuss what you want the special meeting for. I would think, speaking for myself, if someone 
said, "Do you want to sign on for a special meeting," I would say, "Well, what are we having a 
special meeting for?" And the minute they say, "Oh, it's because I want to file a policy order on 
x," we have now entered into a discussion of policy. So, I think it's better to leave it. And of 
course, refer it back, there needs to be a quorum. But there's a difference between how many 
you need to call the meeting and then how many you need to hold the meeting. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  53:50 
But further, there's provisions - and maybe in this rule, I didn't read it again - that say if 
something is sent to the Government Ops Committee from the Council floor, and for whatever 
reason I don't call a meeting, four members could get together and say, "We want a meeting on 
that subject." So, any further discussion? So, as I understand it, we're going to leave the 
language as it is. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  54:21 
So, as I understand it, there's a motion before - and then we're going to leave this as it is? 
Because I've kind of lost the thread here. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  54:31 
Councillor Toomey has proposed a motion to amend rule 19 to go from four to five members to 
call a special meeting. The council can vote that motion up or down. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  54:43 
So, the motion before us is as read by the Clerk. Any further discussion before I call the vote? 
Councillor Toomey? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  54:51 
Could you repeat that again, please? The purpose that I brought this issue was to inform 
especially the new members that even though that four members can call it, but if five don't 
show, there's no meeting. I don't want the impression "Okay, four members can call a meeting 
any time and then come in here, four members can have a Council meeting." That was my point 
of informing the new members. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  55:14 
So, this is more a point of information than wanting to have a formal order? If that's the case, 
then please rescind your motion. Do you rescind your motion? On Councillor Toomey rescinding 
his motion, all those in favor say aye? Opposed? The ayes have it. The motion is rescinded. We 
are now going to Calendar Rule 20. Are there any changes? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  55:44 
Hearing none, I'm going to move us to rule 21. Any changes? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  55:54 
Hearing none, we'll move to rule 22

Any changes? Hearing none, I will move us to rule 23. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  56:08 
Hearing none, moving to rule 24. Any changes? Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler? 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler  56:17 
Thank you. 24C? If that's - I don't want to skip over 24A or 24B, if there's anything else anyone 
wants to address, but -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  56:26 
24C, what is your...? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  56:30 
It's on Public Comment, and it's on 24 1A. It's around speaking time. I think Public Comment is 
really valuable. I think three minutes is plenty for most times. I've been at meetings where there 
are so many people signed up to speak it sort of place the meeting and that I've, as a member 
of the public been to meetings where so many folks are signed up that I've left just knowing that 
it would take forever to get to it. So I'm wondering if we might consider amending it if there are 
more than say 15 people signed up to speak that Public Comment would be two minutes, rather 
than three, and keep it three minutes for a smaller number of speakers, I would like to put that 
on as a potential amendment. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  57:15 
Discussion? I think that's a great idea. It all ends up - and please correct me Mr. Clerk or 
Madam Solicitor - it's sort of the call of the mayor, generally you know if there's a crowd of 
people that the mayor would have the discretion to say "Because there's such a large audience, 
the Public Comment will be reduced to two minutes for each person," and then the timer will be 
accordingly so - Madam Mayor, and then Councillor McGovern.  
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  57:48 
Oh, no, I'm fine. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  57:51 
I actually like the idea of having a set number rather than to the discretion of the chair. Because 
that also holds true for committee meetings as well. Because then you run into, you know, some 
chairs say, "Well, there's 100 people, and we're going to give them all five minutes," some 
reduce it, so having consistency, so everyone knows, and that the chairs also need to be 
consistent with that, I think is a good idea. I don't know if 15 - I mean, 15 seems reasonable, but 
- I like that idea. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  58:24 
So Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler suggests that we just reduce it when there's more than two, 
Councillor McGovern is saying maybe put in a sort of a schedule, is that what you're saying? 
Did you say 15? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  58:37 
Sorry, I was suggesting that if there's more than 15 people signed up to speak that it would be 
two minutes per person. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  58:45 
Councillor Nolan, and then Councillor Zondervan.

Councillor Patricia Nolan  58:47 
Thank you. I agree this is a concern. And yet, we're always trying to balance we want to hear 
from the public. We want to make sure their voices are heard. There are some people for whom 
it's quite stressful already to think of speaking. So, I don't know what the right answer is. I think 
it's critically important. People know this, because people sometimes have come here, they've 
carefully prepared their three minutes, I've sometimes been one of those, and then it's reduced 
to two. And you're kind of flummoxed and really concerned. So, I, I recognize we want to 
balance our desire, which all of us share, to hear from people, with ensuring that we're not going 
through two hours of Public Comment and then being tired when we get to the meeting. So, I 
think having a specific set number might be good. And if we do that, let's make sure we do 
everything we can to communicate to people as they walk in the door that this might happen, 
because then they might have time to amend some of their comments because it's, it's very 
stressful, particularly for people who aren't comfortable with public speaking, it becomes even 
more stressful to think that the time is coming up and it's dinging, and I haven't said half of what 
I want to say. So, I don't know if 15 is the right number, I would think it might be a little bit 
higher. It might be good to review the last couple years of how often that would have been 
triggered because if its every meeting that it would have been triggered then we might want to 
be pretty careful about doing it. I'm not sure I would want to limit it at every single meeting. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  60:08 
Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  60:09 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I agree that 15 might be a little bit low. If we if we did 20 at 3 minutes, 
that's one hour, which is generally what we have allocated on the schedule. So maybe if we 
said, if there's more than 20. I'm not sure where this would go, but I had sent the suggestion to 
the clerk that if there was a way for people's communications to appear before us at the 
meeting, even if they were sent after Thursday at three o'clock, I know they can't be on the 
regular agenda because logistically that would be difficult, but if they could be printed out and on 
our desks or if there's some way for us to have people's communications also before us, during 
Public Comment, during the meeting, then it could also reduce some pressure on people to feel 
like they have to read their letter to us or somehow communicate everything in three, let alone 
two minutes, if they know that we have easy access to their communication so that we can get 
all of their comments. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  61:24 
Further discussion? 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  61:35 
So, I think, having done this three times chairing, there's folks who sign up after 5:30-6, and 
then you know, I'm figuring out how we manage that. Because there's a lot of people who walk 
in, and it goes to the other point of usually the practice has been, for those who haven't signed 
up, please -- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  61:59 
Which I want to speak to. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  62:00 
Yeah. So, we I think we should talk about all that scenario together, so I just wanted to raise 
that.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  62:08 
I would agree. Councillor McGovern? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  62:11 
To Ms. Nolan's point. I mean, I think yes, I mean that certainly there are folks that for a variety of 
reasons, need more time at the podium, and I think traditionally, the chair has always, has been 
pretty good. And we haven't really had it necessarily this term, but if someone if English isn't 
their first language or something, we extend time and we do that, so I think there's discretion on 
the chair's part there to do that. I would also say, if we probably went back and looked, I would 
think that most of the people who speak at Public Comment are people who speak at Public 
Comment every single week and the same thing. And it's certainly their right to do that and I 
want to hear that, but at least when I was in the chair, you know, when someone was a new 
voice, I would give them a little more leeway, then the frequent flyers, as we say. And I think that 
the chair should have that discretion. So, I'm not too worried about that. And then to the 
communications, I mean, we do, I think, you know, we do tell people to leave their comments in 
the basket. I think we all look at the communications and the emails and stuff we get. So, you 
know, that is an opportunity for people in Public Comment. If they don't finish their comments, 
they leave them or email them, and we see them anyway.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  63:34 
Thank you. Councillor Toomey?  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  63:39 
I concur with Councillor McGovern that we've certainly seen the chair - and a member can 
always move suspension of the rules to extend a minute to someone who we feel was probably 
new at public speaking, and I think we've always shown that deference in trying to assist that 
individual. So, we leave it to the discretion of the chair, and like I said, a member can move 
suspension of the rules to extend the speaker's time by a minute. And we've certainly done that 
many, many times.  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  64:13 
One issue that I have probably, you know, trying to figure out how many people are going to 
speak on a set subject. What I've seen, I'm sure everyone has seen it: I don't even know why 
we have that you have to sign up by a certain point of time, because that's gone out the window 
completely. Anybody can come in at any time. There are certain people who know that they 
have to sign up by a certain time and don't sign in. But when it's asked for people who have not 
spoken to speak, and then some of the same individuals didn't get up and speak so...I'm not 
sure why we even bother with that. Because it just seems that nobody respects that anymore. 
And I can see special circumstances of individuals. But some of these are the regular people 
who come here and know the rules. So, I just think that somehow that has to be tightened up 
somehow. Because you can have 40 people in the audience that we don't know what they're 
going to speak on. It could be one issue, and then just say, "well, don't sign up because they're 
going to restrict our time." And so, when we ask who hasn't spoken who would like to speak at 
eight o'clock in Public Comment, and 40 people can raise their hands and come up. So, I really 
think we have to look at somehow tightening. Or just do away with that rule, then you don't have 
to sign up. You just come Monday night and sit in the audience and just sign in at 5:30 and go 
from there. So that's something that I've just noticed. I think it's maybe a small issue to people. 
But I think in terms of running the meeting that it should be tightened up somehow. I'm just 
throwing that out there.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  66:09 
And I certainly agree with you. Who has not spoken on this? Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  66:15 
Thank you, Madam Chair, I share Councillor Toomey's concerns as well. And I wonder if there 
is a way to maybe balance these two things. So, for example, I haven't fully thought this out. I'm 
just thinking on the spot, but we could say that, if more than an hour has passed in Public 
Comment 40 people have signed up, then it's at the discretion of the chair whether to allow 
other people to speak who are not signed up. That's one idea. Another option could be that we 
could say that people who are signed up can speak for three minutes. And then people who are 
not signed up, if they're allowed to speak, it's at the discretion of the chair to be three minutes or 
shorter. And that would also allow people who were prepared and who are signed up, they know 
that they will have their full three minutes, but people who just decide on the spot "Oh, I have 
something to say," they would know that their time might be limited. So, these are just some 
ideas to consider. I haven't fully thought this all out. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  67:43 
I think this needs a little more thought. I mean, just trying to troubleshoot that, you know, you'd 
certainly get folks who would [say] "Why do they get three and I get two?" and it gets into that 
whole thing where if it's consistent for everybody. I would also say I think that the sign-in is 
important just in terms of when you're in the chair, you know, when you get to that end and you 
say "Anyone who hasn't signed up who wants to speak?" and seven hands go up, and you don't 
know everybody's names, and it gets people started. You know, the sign-in is good for keeping 
order. One thing I've noticed since we've gone to the online sign up, especially, is that a lot of 
times you get one person who signs up for multiple people. And so, it's also a way that 
sometimes people use that to stack the public comment. I've heard people say this: "let's get our 
20 people at the beginning," so that by the time the other people go, you know, maybe they've 
left. You know, I've heard groups organize in that way. And when you have to call in and give 
your name, then that doesn't really happen because Naomi and Mary know you sign up just for 
yourself. But online, I think people are signing up for multiple people or they come here, and 
they sign for multiple people. So, I mean, that's just another part of this that I don't think it's the 
intent of our rules to allow that, but people have figured out how to game that a little bit. And 
maybe it's not a problem. But if you have, especially a long meeting that you're going to have 
hours of Public Comment, if you're forcing people of a certain point of view to be at the end of 
that, then they're going to get less attention and people are going to leave. So that's just another 
bug in this whole thing. So, I don't know if we can solve all that today, but I think it's worth 
looking at. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  69:41 
I don't think we can solve it all today. And this could take a meeting in and of itself. You know, 
Public Comment is sort of the center point of council meetings for people that attend, because 
it's their opportunity to be in front of the council to state their case, if you will. But to be as open 
as possible, it's gotten a little clunky. As one person that opened the gate for it, "Did anyone that 
didn't get signed up want to speak?" it was for that one meeting, and now it's like run out the 
barn and down the road, and do we get that issue back into the barn? I'm almost inclined to say: 
the rules say you have to be signed up by six o'clock, and if you're not you're just not. Only 
because some people are better at knowing this and some people are not, number one.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  70:29 
Number two, and I think Councillor McGovern was going here: some people say, "Well, I don't 
have to get there until eight o'clock because I know Public Comment is still open, I get to still

speak." And then we don't get to the business. So, I almost want to go back to where we were: 
"If you've not signed up in person by six o'clock, I'm sorry. Please put your communication in 
writing, which everybody can do." And I believe it's given to us, even if it's left in that basket by 
12 o'clock. You might want to open that up, it will be on the record. But we're not extending it 
and extending it and extending it. So, my, my recommendation would be that we follow the rules 
as they are. And then if you're not signed up by six, I'm sorry. But if you have a written 
communication, you can certainly leave it, say, in the basket, and the clerk will pick it up, and it 
will be part of the record for that meeting. Yes, Madam Mayor. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  71:27 
Thank you. So, if the committee decides to go that route, I think two suggestions I'd have would 
be to make sure that we do something either - right now the computer terminal is in the Council 
office. Is there a way to move that outside? I think people don't know how to sign up, on certain 
levels, or they need to be reminded. And you know, I've said during that last meeting, "If you've 
just come in, go sign up." I could do that. But what I'm afraid of, and this has happened, is that 
there's some folks who are the frequent flyers who do have that expectation of "Wait, I did sign 
up, I wanted to talk." And so, I can see that happening. And then I'm in a position to say, "well, 
we have rules, we've decided this." So how do we, if we are doing this change, make sure...? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  72:22 
A couple of suggestions. One would be: we could say the rules have changed, this particular 
rule is changing, it goes into effect - I'm just making this up - on March 1. Number one. Number 
two: one of the recommendations, and I talked to the clerk about this, is that we have 
information on easels that go up when you come in, and they come down after Public Comment 
that say, "These are the rules of Public Comment. You have to sign up at the kiosk, sign up for 
Public Comment closes at 6pm, and there are no exceptions." I think whatever we do, it needs 
to be put out in the public domain in a way that people see it. Because you're saying that there 
are people that are regulars, they come every meeting regardless, and there are people that are 
coming for the first time and they don't know the rules. And so this going after six o'clock, or 
extending "you can talk, you can talk, you can talk," it's something that's never been put in the 
rules, but now it's become a common practice so it feels like it's in the rules. And I just feel like 
it's a slippery slope. It's the road of good intentions, but it's taking us to a place that we 
necessarily don't want to be. So, one of my recommendations would be that we just go back to 
the sign up by 6 o'clock, and if you were feeling giddy and you want to say 6:30, you can say 
6:30 for people that are coming from work and are trying to get here. But I just feel strongly 
about closing that door. Ms. Glowa, I feel is itching to say something, then to you, and then to 
the mayor. Ms. Glowa, did you want to say something?  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  73:49 
Madam Chair, I want to just speak to Councillor Zondervan's earlier point about the written 
communication. So, if people still want to discuss this issue, I can wait. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  73:58 
Ok we'll come back to it. Is this relative to when people can sign up? 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  74:04 
Yes. So, rule 24C, 1-B, we say here, under procedure: "An individual may sign up to speak 
before the City Council via telephone to the City Council office on Mondays from nine to three, 
or online via the city's website starting at nine on the Friday before." I don't understand why it's 3 
pm. So, if we change it to five, I don't understand that break.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  74:34 
Okay. So, one change you're asking is to make it from nine to five, and not nine to three. I would 
want to have the executive secretary of the city council, who is the keeper of that part of it, do 
you have any strong feelings about - what it says in the rules is that you can sign up to three 
o'clock...? If you're not on mic, we can't hear, so please come to a mice or come to the table, 
whichever your preference. 
 
Naomie Stephan  75:05 
So, the break from three to five predates me. We don't need it. People can sign up from three to 
five online. So, if we were to go to a system where we set up a kiosk here, then we could do it 
between three and five. We don't need the break. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  75:22 
Very good. Thank you. So, it doesn't seem that it causes any logistical complications. More? 
Madam Mayor, any more on this? Then to you and then to Councillor Toomey, 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  75:37 
I have a different amendment on Public Comment. But if we're still talking, if Councillor Toomey 
wants to comment on this thread.  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  75:44 
To follow up on the mayor's suggestion, and it does get very crowded when people coming in to 
sign up, and probably a lot of people don't know that they have to come into the Council office. 
So, I would suggest following what the mayor said and work with Naomi Stephen to possibly 
have a more welcoming sign, and outside of the Council office, so that when people coming in 
know where to go. And I would suggest that maybe rotate every week one of the legislative 
assistants could staff that little booth. Because, Naomie and certainly Mary Horgan, they're very 
busy at that time. So I think maybe utilize the legislative assistants in that way so that, as people 
come up the stairs or get off the elevator, and the individual will welcome them and say "If 
you're here for Public Comment, please sign in here" and I think that would maybe alleviate a lot 
of the crush that comes between 5, 5:30 of people going to the Council office. And we're coming 
in, so it gets very crowded and very confusing. So that's something, maybe we can talk to our 
Council Assistant and see if this... 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  77:14 
If a Council assistant could do this? I think that needs a little bit more conversation. During one 
term, I had a page, or an usher. It didn't work all that well, but the idea was a high school 
student whose job was - it was kind of like a little civics lesson. You know, you sit there, and you 
sort of guide people to put your stuff in this basket, you leave your card there, you sign up here. 
I think there's some merit to some sort of Wayfinding around this Public Comment piece. 
Councillor Zondervan, is this relative to signing up for Public Comment? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  77:46 
Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to be clear about what we're proposing. And I think last night, I 
was a little bit confused by the by the vote. I believe what we're saying is that if people are going 
to be allowed to speak, who have not signed up, then there would be a vote by the Council to 
suspend the rules. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  78:13 
I'm going to pause for a moment. That used to be a practice we always exercised if somehow, 
we're going to extend someone's talking time, you're talking about?

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  78:21 
No, if people have not signed up to speak, but we wish to allow them to speak anyway, then 
there would be a vote by the Council to suspend the rules.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  78:31 
Not to interrupt but just to edify. There was a time we voted for everything. If you wanted to 
cough, we'd vote for that. So, I kind of appreciated it, since everybody signed on to the fact that 
we were going to allow more public comment. so, I just wanted to give you that background.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  78:50 
Thank you, Madam Chair. So, I agree. I think maybe there can be, I think we could be more 
clear about that. So, we can say you know, suspending the rules to allow people who have not 
signed up to speak. And maybe we can even have a little poll that first shows us how many 
people want to speak before we vote, so that we can have that information and decide whether 
given the businesses that's before us, whether we want to open it up like that. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  79:27 
On this, and eventually get back to me, but I wanted to comment -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  79:30 
What I'm going to actually do is kind of reign this in and go back to the top of, because we're 
talking about all of 24, and it's getting a little confusing for me. So, I want you to speak, I think 
the clerk wants to say something, and then I'm going to go back to 24 and just take it 24 A, B, C 
so I can kind of follow the symmetry. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  79:47 
I have concerns about that, just because what I've seen in practice is that whether it's the 
School Committee or the Council, most councilors don't want to be the one to vote not to allow 
people to speak. And what happens is some councilors kind of stick to what the expectation is, 
and other councilors don't. And it ends up becoming actually a divisive conversation amongst 
the elected officials. I feel very strongly, for example, that I don't think - I never vote to suspend 
the rules to allow someone to speak on a late order, for example, because I think what happens 
with the late order is, if I'm filing a late order, I tell the people who support that order: "Oh, I'm 
filing this late order, come and speak to it." But if it's not on the agenda, other people don't 
know. And I've gotten into that situation on the School Committee tons of times last term where I 
would say, we shouldn't allow people to speak on a late order because it's not known to the 
public ahead of time. But committee members don't want to be the one to make someone upset. 
And so, then that one person, the chair normally, looks like they're the one trying to deny the 
people the right to speak. So, I think that gets really - unless we all agree on something, I think it 
gets really sticky in that regard, and I find it to actually create a lot of tension rather than make 
things easier. But I do want to make one amendment on this before -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  81:12 
What I'm going to do, if there's no more discussion on how long we speak, or [how long] people 
speak in Public Comment, I'm going to take us back to rule 24A and go item by item, because 
it's getting it's bouncing back a little bit too much. Yes. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  81:29 
Through the chair, just for the edification of the Council. I noticed that there was a rule 24 CB 
which described the procedure by which a person could come and give public comment to the

to the council. I suggested to the mayor last night, during Monday's meeting, that to allow 
people who haven't signed up to speak, you may want to suspend the rules to allow members to 
speak. I think that if you're going to have a rule in your rules, that is going to make requirement 
of individuals to make comments, then you do have to go through some sort of procedure to 
then deviate from them, whatever the rule happens to be, just for the edification of the Council. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  82:10 
And I think that's a good point. So, on Public Comment, is there any more discussion, because 
I'm going to take this back to rule 24A, just to take it procedurally through the items. Councillor 
Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  82:22 
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, and to the Clerk's point: I'm reading these rules, and I think it is 
unclear. It doesn't say that an individual who's not signed up for these rules isn't allowed to 
speak. So, I think we need to clarify that. I don't think we can necessarily resolve all this today, 
because there's a lot of thoughts about it, but I do think we need to be very clear about what's 
the rule, and then if we need to vote to suspend the rules. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  82:55 
I agree with you. I think Public Comment is such a big item and an important item, we might 
want to just pull it out, and I could appoint two people to work with me just to pull this out and 
make some real sustained recommendation. Because it's just so big. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  83:16 
And Madam Chair, I want to just add what I'm hearing is we have these two conflicting tensions, 
right? Either we're saying, just sign up between 5:30 and 6, or then we're leaving this other 
opportunity open. So, I don't think both can exist. I don't think both can exist. So, I think getting 
together with you and whomever from the committee, but the committee has to decide which 
way they want to be consistent.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  83:43 
I want us to move through this because this meeting I'm really trying to keep it to two hours. And 
we do have some recommendations that we're not taking up. Let's go through rule 24 as much 
as we can, and anything else that's left over I would ask two people to say let's sit down at 
another time before we call the next meeting to make recommendations on how you want to see 
Public Comment changed. Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  83:53 
And thank you, Madam Chair. Just a point of order: I think we would still need to discuss it in 
committee because right now, if there's two members of the committee, that's a quorum. So, I 
agree that we should move through the agenda right now, but I think if we want to come back to 
this, we should either have another meeting or... 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  84:27 
There's two ways to do that. We could not adjourn this meeting, so this meeting is still going. 
And then, as long as we have two members, we can - so what I would say is: I will recess this 
meeting, just because we haven't adopted any changes, I'll recess this meeting, have two 
people come that want to sit down and flesh out this with the clerk and the solicitor, and then 
come back. And when we come back, we're not coming back to a new meeting, we're coming 
back out of a recess of this meeting. Am I within my jurisdiction to do that?

Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  84:58 
Madam Chair, that sounds great. I've just been struggling a little bit with some of the tightened 
enforcement of the Open Meeting Law requirements by the Attorney General and the 
conversation about late orders and resolutions. I just wanted to bring to the committee's 
attention that I have a concern about allowing public comment on late orders and resolutions 
because the way the Attorney General has explained their interpretation of this, there should be 
discussion at the Council on matters that have been previously notified and posted to the public. 
So, if we're talking about a late order or resolution that was not in any way posted, then I would 
suggest that there not be public comment. And moreover, I believe the practice recently has 
been, quite properly, to read in their entirety, a late order or resolution at the time that they're 
being brought up when that agenda item is before the council, and that way, people who are 
either present can hear the entirely order or resolution, or if they're watching it on TV, either at 
home or later, they can hear what it is that the council is about to discuss. But if there's a late 
order or resolution that's not been posted, and people are commenting upon it, then people 
listening don't necessarily know what that's about. So, I wanted to encourage the committee to 
consider removing that from items that can be considered. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  86:43 
And where is it?  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  86:44 
In 24C-1A, the list of things, the long paragraph we were just discussing. It seems to me to be 
saying that you can discuss, at the end of that next to last sentence, that you can discuss late 
policy orders and resolutions in Public Comment. And I would recommend deleting that from 
that list of items that are --  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  87:15 
I can't even find it. Okay, thank you. So, you're asking that be struck? Very good. Any 
discussion? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  87:30 
In this section, just so people know, because we're recessing this meeting, the mini-committee 
on this will also look at that again. So, this will come back to the small committee about striking 
and the reason why we strike it, and then when we come back and the full committee will say, 
we'll have a full explanation of why we're making the following recommendations. Councillor 
Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  87:51 
Thank you, Madam Chair. Just in response to that, I think I understand the solicitor's concern. I 
guess, my question is: if we do delete that, then essentially there is no opportunity for the public 
to comment on late orders at all, which creates different problems. So, I'm not sure exactly how 
we would address that.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  88:16 
If I may say this, it says somewhere in these minutes that, not unless some late policy orders, if 
it's not an emergency, you shouldn't do it anyway. And I think that it speaks to Councillor 
McGovern's sentiment and mine that you can't talk about transparency and then have a late 
policy order, not unless it's an emergency. Resolutions? A little bit more flexibility. You know, 
you find out that your neighbor had a loss in their family and the funeral is on Wednesday and 
we're meeting on Monday. That, I think, justifies, not that you need to suspend the rules to do 
that.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  88:53 
But policy orders are a bigger deal because it says it speaks to this in the rules that even how 
you say what's a policy, and what's an order, and how it has to be presented, because you're 
changing the rules. So, I think we should always try to keep to the rules as much as possible. 
And if it's not an emergency, then we shouldn't even have a late policy order. If you bring the 
late policy order, and you say, I'm going to lay this on the table. So now you've done your due 
diligence, you brought in that late policy order, but you reserve the ability to really comment on it 
until the next meeting. Councillor, did you yield the floor? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  89:37 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I completely agree with you. I'm not suggesting otherwise. I'm just 
raising a concern that if there is a late policy order, and we remove it from this rule, then there is 
no opportunity for the public to comment on that policy order at all. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  89:55 
Maybe I misunderstand, Councillor Zondervan, and I look to the city solicitor. I thought she was 
saying  there's no public comment on that late policy order, not that you couldn't submit it. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  90:09 
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  90:11 
And I would just - on that two things: one, we can always move suspension. We do it all the time 
and change the rules and do that sort of, you know. But to be honest, I actually think it should 
be a rule that you can't speak. Because I've seen it abused so many times. You know, one 
person's emergency is another person's non-emergency. And what happens is, someone files a 
late order that they want to do X, and so then they tell all of their supporters, "I'm filing a policy 
order." So those people know about it. So, they come, and then that councilor says "I want to 
allow these people to speak on a late order," people feel compelled to let them do it because 
otherwise they get (in the press) that they're stifling first amendment rights. So, they say yes, 
and now you have only a certain group of people speaking in favor of a late policy order that 
nobody else knew about. It completely flies in the face of transparency; which we say we want 
to be about. So, I don't think we should allow it. And if there's a compelling reason, we always 
have suspension of the rules, and the motion maker can say, look, this is why I think this is 
different. And then we can, we can do that. But I really, I feel pretty strongly about this, I've seen 
it abused way too many times. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  91:34 
So Councillor, what we're going to do, and members of the committee, we're going to - let's get 
through rule 24, taking in as many changes or suggested changes as possible, knowing that this 
meeting is going to be recessed, and two of this body, including me - so three people from this 
body will kind of look at those recommendations and bring that back to when we when we have 
the meeting again, so Just because in the spirit of time, you have a number of suggestions to 
this council, Vice Mayor Mallon and myself, I want to make sure to get on the floor before we 
have to adjourn. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  92:10 
Madam Chair? I'm just have another amendment, which we may be able to do right now, but if 
not, put it in the queue for 24C

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  92:19 
What I'm saying is I want to put all of the conversation around it, and maybe just put it on the 
table so that we at least get through to the end of the docket.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  92:27 
So, one thing I think we should be clear about speakers, so people know: speakers are not 
allowed to cede their time to other speakers. Madam Chair, when you were mayor and we were 
on School Committee together, we would have during the Innovation Agenda conversation, I'm 
not kidding you, people would come with their five, six, and seven year old kids and say "I cede 
my time to my mother." And the person who has more friends would get 10 minutes to speak, 
and the person who didn't have anybody ceding their time would get three. And we just don't we 
don't allow it, we always say we should put it in the rule so that people know, so someone 
doesn't come with five people... So that would just be somewhere in 24C-1A, it can be tacked 
on anywhere: "Speakers are not allowed to cede their time to other speakers." 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  93:19 
And also, just to follow up on that point, it also says something about "I'm reading this letter from 
my dog Skippy." And that's always a little crazy place, you know, because how do I know that 
your dog Skippy really wanted that read into the record? And so, I would just say as we talk 
about this section, who has the authority to speak for someone who is not present? Anything 
else? Because I'm going to take us to the top or 24. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  93:48 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm still confused about process. So, I understand that the plan is to 
recess this meeting. I don't understand how three members of the committee could get together 
offline and work on this subject matter, because that would be a quorum of the committee. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  94:12 
Madam Chair, I think that's correct. So, you could post the meeting with a smaller group.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  94:18 
I could post the meeting and whoever comes as long as we have a quorum. And I wouldn't be 
strong-arming people that didn't sign up to work on this particular - and it will say the call was "to 
continue the discussion specific to rule 24A." So, on 24A, is there anything that talks about the 
order of the business? Does anyone see any changes? I wanted to add this: nowhere in the 
order of business does it say how you call the meeting to order. I don't know if that's an 
operational thing, Mr. Clerk, which talks about stating what the rules are, decorum, that kind of 
thing. It just says public Comment, it's like relative to the business. And so, I'm just asking, do 
we want to add to the call? It just says Public Comment, as if we didn't call the meeting to order 
at all. I want it to say, "Order of Business - call meeting to order, read the call, and the rules of 
decorum." That's what I would like to just add in so that everybody has the same standard. 
When you call a meeting, you say, you know, "The meeting of x, y, z. This is this is the reason 
why we're here. Relative to Public Comment, we do this." Does that need to be in the order? Or 
is it something that we...I think it should be as a part of the Order of Business so that everybody 
has the same standard? Mr. Clerk? 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  95:53 
So, I just want to want to wrap my hands around what you said Councillor Simmons. So, are 
you saying that...? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  96:01

In the call as it's written, it just says "At every regular meeting of the City Council, except for 
roundtables, the order the business shall be as follows." And then it says Public Comment. And 
I'm saying the order of business will be as follows: "Call the meeting to order, introduce the 
rules, then Public Comment." 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  96:21 
I think that's up to the will of the Council as to how they want to go through their meetings. I 
think currently it's structured - the order of business is structured in terms of potential legislative 
actions by the Council. So, the meeting goes to public comment, reading of the record from the 
previous meetings. But yes, I would think that the Order of the Business? That can be structured 
based on the will of the Council, whatever the body feels is most appropriate. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  96:55 
So, then my question, we'll take this up in a more robust manner at the continuation of this 
meeting, is one of the things I'm looking for is continuity and consistency that meetings should 
all follow the same order for a couple of reasons. One, as you move through the cycle, anyone 
that ascends to the chair of the mayor, this is good place to get the experience on how to 
properly run a meeting. So that's number one. Number two, that everyone that comes to the 
meeting has the same expectation because the meetings are always run the same way. I've sat 
in meetings, and I'll be brief because we're running on a time, where the chair of the meeting 
says, "Okay, let's get started." There was really no call to get the meeting to start. And then at 
the meeting, they said "Okay, we're all done." Okay, let's adjourn, and everybody got up and left 
the room. The meeting was improperly adjourned. And so, I just think it's those little nuances 
that are not correct procedural form that we carry through the way we run meetings even at the 
highest level, which is a business meeting at the City Council. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  98:01 
I'm sorry, Madam Chair. If you're referring to the order instructions of committee meetings, then 
I would think would be, I guess adding those types of instructions to rule 27 or in the section. 
The next section is on page seven, Start Communication to Committees. And those rules 
specifically address the operations of committees. So, if its rules about how the committees 
should run their meetings, I think presumably -- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  98:28 
I think that should be okay. I could concede to that. I just want order. That's what I'm basically 
asking. Symmetry, transparency, and predictability. You know what to expect when you come 
because the meetings are all run the same way. So, the Clerk says in terms of how the council 
committees run, that that change should been put on Number 27. And if there's no objection to 
that, I would like to add that. Alright, so there's no objection will go forward. 24B? Yes? What? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  99:12 
Alright, point of order. I'm not clear what we're adding to what? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  99:15 
So, I had said I wanted to add some expectations, for lack of a better word to call it, in the 
meetings in terms of the order of the business, particularly that the committee meetings should 
mirror how business meetings of the council are run. The Clerk says that should be added to 
rule 27.

Correct. And I agree with the Clerk. However, it's not clear to me where in rule 27 we would add 
that right now. So, I guess my suggestion would be, let's wait till we get to rule  27 to discuss 
that. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  99:55 
That's what the other thing that we can do too. So, I will yield it on  24A, and move it to 24, and 
I'll have the Clerk remind me when we get there. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  100:04 
Madam Chair. I'm a little confused also. So, looking at 24A, on page five at the top, I thought 
you were talking about perhaps adding to the rules before Public Comment: "announced call of 
the meeting, make statement about rules." And then at the end of that list, after 
announcements, add adjournment. So that the council would vote to adjourn, which would be 
the proper way to adjourn the meeting. And at the beginning, when you had talked about 
wanting to announce the call the meeting before Public Comment, you could put that in that list 
of items if that's what you were getting at.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  100:51 
Thank you. Thanks for reminding me. So, if I can bring your attention back to 24. What I was 
asking not only that the committees did it - so in here, it looks like we open the meeting with 
Public Comment, as opposed to a Call to Order. So, I wanted to put that in the rules, and then 
announce how our meetings are operated. And then at the end, you see it says announcements 
but doesn't say you adjourn. Everybody on board with that? Okay. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  101:27 
Not only do we do the Call of the Meeting first, but typically we do the accepting the minutes 
before Public Comment. Right? So those just need to be changed in the order. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  101:41 
You're right, it doesn't say - it says, "reading of the record," and I guess that is supposed to be 
where we adopt the minutes and we need to make that more clear."  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  101:51 
We usually do that before Public Comment. So, in this list, we should flip those.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  101:56 
Alright, so we're going to flip -  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  101:58 
Point of clarification? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  102:01 
I just want to go back to Councillor McGovern. And so, you want to take number two, which just 
says "reading of the record," if request, and say "adoption of the record" before Public 
Comment, because that's usually where it happens.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  102:14 
Yeah, I mean, honestly, we could do Public Comment first. I don't necessarily think we have to 
accept the minutes first. But we need to be consistent. If the rules in here say we're going to call 
the meeting and then Public Comment is going to happen before anything else, that's fine. But 
that's not how we do it. That's not how we do it, so they need to jive.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  102:36 
Right. Either follow the rules or change the rules to mimic what we do. Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  102:41 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like clarification on what exactly "reading of the record if 
requested by the City Council means." 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  102:48 
I don't even know. I took that as it was the adoption of the minutes. That's why it's a very good 
point that it says reading of the record, which I assume is the minutes, and we adopt the 
minutes, we don't read them, and we do it before we go into Public Comment, I believe. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  103:04 
So, can we get clarification from the solicitor or the clerk as to what that actually means? 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  103:10 
I would defer to the clerk. I don't know what it means either. So, my recommendation would be 
to just change that, Number two, to adopt minutes of prior meetings. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  103:23 
I'm an agreement. So, I read those rules and I assumed that meant the adoption of the record. I 
think the council probably should change that rule to be the adoption of previous minutes of the 
City Council, whatever the language is, and place it where the council believes is appropriate in 
its order of...  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  103:41 
In order sequence as typically. I want to welcome Vice Mayor Mallon to the meeting. Thank you 
for joining us. Is there anything else in terms of the order of business? So, we're going to make 
some modification, we're going to have call to order because that's what we do. We're going to 
add adoption of the minutes and strike reading of the record and we're going to put that before 
Public Comment, as is our procedures, what we just normally do. And then at the very end 
number 15, will be added and that's going to be adjournment. Okay, very good. Vice Mayor, 
we're just going through the rules. Do you have a copy of the rules with you? Do you need a 
copy? Okay, we'll get you a copy. And it's online as well. We are at 24B - any changes? None? 
 
Councillor Denise Simmons  104:43 
24C. We talked a little bit about this. In terms of striking the late policy orders and resolutions. 
Were there any other changes? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  105:03 
I had talked a little bit about under 24C-1A adding a line -  and I incorporated the suggestion 
from a couple other councilors: if 20 or more speakers have signed up for Public Comment 
before the start of the meeting, each speaker shall limit their comments to no more than two 
minutes. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  105:19 
Very good. So that is a change being recommended by Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. Are you 
introducing that as a formal motion?

I will submit that as a motion. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  105:29 
There is a motion on the floor by Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler to amend 24CA to read 
something to the effect "In the event there are 20 or more speakers signed speakers signed up, 
that the amount of time allocated would be two minutes." Discussion. All those in favor say aye. 
Opposed? The ayes have it and that motion has been adopted. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  105:56 
And then I will just formerly do a motion that speakers are not allowed to cede their time to other 
speakers. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  106:05 
Okay, so also Councillor McGovern puts on the table for a vote: "Stopping the practice of 
allowing a person to come and say I cede my time to so and so and so."  Does everyone 
understand that?  Discussion? Hearing none, on the motion by Councillor McGovern, all those 
in favor say aye. Opposed? The ayes have it, and the changed is being offered.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  106:36 
Okay, we talked about public comment. So now there's that - Councillor Zondervan.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  106:43 
Thank you, Madam Chair. Are we striking late policy orders and resolutions as well? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  106:51 
Striking resolutions? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  106:53 
Late policy orders and resolutions on 24C-1A. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  106:59 
I have - yes, strike it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  107:06 
I'll move that we strike late policyholders and resolutions. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  107:11 
On a motion by Councillor McGovern to strike the second to last line. I think the second the last 
line. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  107:21 
It's part of the second to last sentence but specifically we're taking late policy orders and 
resolutions. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  107:31 
We're just striking the late policy orders and resolutions. So why don't we just say that? To strike 
late policy orders and resolutions - discussion?  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  107:43 
And the "and" before it.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  107:45 
And the what? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  107:47 
The word "and" before "late policy orders." 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  107:49 
Well I struck it in my - "and late policies and resolutions from other city offices," period. All those 
in favor say Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it, the change has been adopted. 24-1B? We said 
we're going to change the online from nine to three to nine to six.  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  108:17 
If it's possible, on this one here, I think this is so important for the public to be aware of what 
we're doing. I made some suggestions that we're having a better system of someone outside 
the council office directly helping people. You know, when a lot of people we've seen certainly 
the council office, as I said, the two staff getting ready for the council meeting. A lot of members 
of the public who come in who are not as computer savvy as others, and I count myself as one 
of those people, and they have very difficult time trying to sign up online and it creates a line, 
and someone has to help them. So, I really think if there was a way to just hold this one and 
have a more full discussion on just how this whole process should be. I think that really needs to 
be reformed. I think it's important that we hear from the public, but we want the public to know, 
you know, that they're welcome here and how they can participate. I just think this here needs 
further discussion. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  109:26 
I agree. I agree. What I think you're talking about is not quite but a little bit like hospitality, which 
may not be a procedural piece. So, I would ask that we make the change in line three from nine 
to three to nine to six. And to your question about how do we operationalize signing for public 
comment, this smaller group of folks bring back a recommendation saying, We changed the 
rules to reflect this, we might say the public will sign up through the page or the - you know, we'll 
operationalize that, because I think the two are a little bit different. So, I want to take you back 
to, if you yield the floor, are you yielding the floor now?  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  110:06 
Just to follow what you're saying the operation part of this is like, especially if it's a first-time 
person coming into City Hall, because we know at the beginning of the meeting there's a crowd 
in front of the chamber doors. And so, you don't know which way to go to, and you might get a 
little intimidated and say, "Well, maybe I'm not." So, I just think we have to have a better 
operational way of welcoming the public who probably never stepped foot in City Hall into that, 
you know, "this is your time for public comment, this is your place." And I just don't think, you 
know, the people who come in, they know exactly what to do. But someone new coming in the 
doors can feel very intimidated and not sure or feel embarrassing that they're not as aware of 
other people. So, I just think that has to be a more, I don't want to repeat the word "welcoming," 
but it has to be more inviting. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  111:02 
Thank you. Councillor Zondervan.

7.3

Thank you, Madam Chair. I do agree with Councillor Toomey. However, I don't think we would 
capture that in the rules. I think the rule change we're proposing is via telephone on Mondays 
from 9am to 5pm. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  111:21 
Five or six? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  111:23 
Yeah, I would say five, because the staff needs to prepare for the meeting to start at 5:30 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  111:31 
Very good. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  111:33 
Naomie is over there giving me the six signal. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  111:39 
Ms. Stephan, why don't you take a seat at the table? See, Councillor Zondervan is making a 
way for you. Thank you for joining us. 
 
Naomie Stephen, Executive Assistant to the City Council  112:00 
I think 6pm, because so many people don't make it here by five. So then when you have people 
that are coming in later, they can still sign up even though the meetings already started. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  112:12 
Discussion? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  112:14 
So that's already provided for in, "on Mondays between five and six, a computer terminal will be 
available to the public in City Council office for online sign up." So, what we're discussing now is 
by telephone, so if someone were to call the office after five to sign up, versus if they came in 
person, they would sign up via the computer. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  112:43 
Not to speak for our executive, but I think what she's saying: if you're in transit and you have 
access to a computer, and you know you may not get here at the 11th hour, it gives you to the 
11th hour, but I'm not speaking for her. I mean, did you want to discuss? 
 
Naomie Stephen, Executive Assistant to the City Council  112:59 
Are you talking about the break between three and five? If someone calls in? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  113:05 
No, we're saying that we would change the rules so that someone could sign up by telephone 
until 5pm. And then after 5pm, in person at the public, at the City Council office, using the 
computer. 
 
Naomie Stephen, Executive Assistant to the City Council  113:22 
Yes, I think that makes sense, particularly if you add, like sort of making the kiosk or signing up 
improves, and if there's an extra hand to help with it. What ends up happening primarily now is 
there's a crowd that forms at five o'clock, and there's typically only one person in the office. 
Another change that we've asked for is - the thing that takes the most time as people never

know where in the agenda, what they're signing up to speak on, is. So, we've asked for IT to 
look into creating as a drop down on the sign-in page, so that they're already pre-loaded and 
then they just are clicking on their thing, as opposed to trying to figure out where the agenda is 
and if it's even on the agenda sometimes. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  114:10 
Thank you. So, the change is till five now, and not till six. It says, "in which must sign in to speak 
before the City Council via telephone to the City Council office on Mondays from 9am to five." 
Correct? Any further discussion? Miss Glowa? Were you itching to say something? Okay. Any 
other changes in that part? Do I need a motion? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  114:33 
So, moved. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  114:34 
So, on a motion by Councillor Zondervan to change rule 24 C section A under 1-B to the third 
sentence from three o'clock to five o'clock. All those in favor? Aye? Thank you. Opposed? The 
ayes have it and the change has been adopted. We're now to Roundtable Working Meetings. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  115:04 
Madam Chair, and I apologize, I do have to leave right at 12. On this, over the last few years, 
we have gradually moved towards televising Roundtables. We used to not do it at all, then we 
would do some of them, and now it's at the request, it has to be put in the policy order. I just 
think we should televise all Roundtables and working meetings for a whole host of reasons. But 
I can explain if there's questions. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  115:32 
No, because we only have five minutes, and what I'm going to suggest is that I want to read the 
changes that my colleagues have put forward onto the record so that when we do our work, we 
can continue. So, on number two, because they - and then we have Public Comment that we 
haven't gotten to. Not unless, I can also entertain a motion to extend the meeting for another 15 
minutes, which will also help us. So, let's go back to what's in front of us. Did you want to speak 
on this piece? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  116:04 
Yes. So, I believe we changed the rules so that all meetings in the chamber are video recorded. 
I don't know if that applies to Roundtable working meeting -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  116:15 
It doesn't.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  116:17 
I think that would be where we would change that. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  116:23 
I would, Madam Chair through you, I would think - I don't know I guess I would look to the City 
Solicitor. I would imagine we would put it under the Roundtable portion, where we talk about, I 
guess it could go either place or both.   
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  116:41 
So, where's?

Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  116:44 
If I may, just for the edification, because I don't believe that the auto video recording is in the 
rules. I believe it was a policy order. So, I don't think it's something that's in the rules.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  116:54 
Okay, very good. Councillor McGovern, so you're asking still to make? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  117:01 
I'm asking that we add to 24 C2: "All Roundtables, working meetings will be televised." 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  117:10 
Want to put "when possible," and the reason why I say that is what if the Roundtable's not here? 
What if we took a Roundtable or working meeting outside in the community. So, if you say, "Will 
be televised," you've boxed yourself to where you'll have it. Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  117:26 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess again, I would suggest that rather than doing it here we made 
a rule change to codify our practice that all meetings of the City Council in Sullivan Chamber are 
televised, because this is where we have the equipment in order to do that. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  117:47 
I wouldn't say Sullivan Chamber, because sometimes we're in the School Committee chamber 
so, that's why the "when possible" makes more sense. You said all meetings in the Sullivan 
Chamber, but we take our show on the road, not very often, but once in a while where there is 
filming capability. So why not just say "when possible?" 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  118:05 
Yeah, so we could do both. We could say "In Sullivan Chamber or, if possible, in a different 
location." But that creates a clear expectation that if it's in the chamber, it will be televised. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  118:16 
I have no disagreement; I just don't want to box us in. Miss Glowa.  
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  118:20 
Madam Chair, I was going to suggest that we look back to rule 18 Regular Meetings, because 
that's the section that talks about when meetings are held, and you could put in a sentence at 
the end of that first paragraph that says - or you could put it at the end of the section that says -  
"All regular meetings, as well as Roundtables/special meetings of the city council, shall be 
televised, unless technically infeasible." 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  119:00 
If I may, just to piggyback on the Solicitor, on section 24 C, specifically talking about public 
comments, I don't know if that would be the appropriate place to talk about. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  119:08 
So Councillor McGovern, given what we know which we change it to the appropriate section, 
and the only discussion now is it's "all Roundtables will be, and working meetings will be 
televised." My only concern is that what if we use it shall be, and I just want to have enough 
wiggle room that if the Roundtable were in the community, it certainly could be filmed, but it 
couldn't be recorded live. I want some language in there that allows us that flexibility. That's why

I said, "when possible." Or however, when technically possible. Councillor McGovern, any more 
on that? Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  119:49 
Thank you, Madam Chair. I agree. And again, I would suggest that we put in "when held in the 
Sullivan Chamber" or if possible - that we add "when held in the Sullivan Chamber or if possible, 
elsewhere" and that we add committee meetings as well, because that's also already the 
practice. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  120:11 
Committee meetings are already in the rules to be televised. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  120:14 
It's just our practice now that any meeting of the City Council in this chamber is televised so we 
would just capture that in our rules and then add that if it's being held elsewhere, if it's 
technically feasible, that we would also broadcast it or video record it. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  120:40 
I would just ask for clarity from the Chair on what the motion is before the body. I currently have 
all meetings of the City Council, Roundtable/working meetings be televised when technically 
possible. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  120:54 
Madam Chair, I will rescind that because we've determined this is not the appropriate section to 
put it in, and when we ever get to that appropriate section, I will make it again. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  121:06 
Okay, so we have two minutes in this meeting that was supposed to go for two hours. So, 
before we do anything else, I'd like a motion to extend the meeting for a half an hour with a stop 
at 12:20 to allow for Public Comment. Because otherwise we're rolling right to the 12:30. First of 
all, can members, so there's the motion to extend the meeting. Discussion? Can people not do 
that? Because if we're going to lose quorum or the body, then we should just go right to Public 
Comment, recess the meeting, and I'll reschedule without - and I will just make another motion 
that the changes be put into the record. So that can be taken up at the next meeting. So, I need 
to extend the meeting first. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  121:50 
Thank you, Madam Chair. So, I agree, and I don't see anyone for Public Comment. We can 
certainly - 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  121:56 
Mr. Hawkinson feels compelled to speak. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  121:59 
So Yeah, I would support a motion to have Public Comment and then recess the meeting until 
the next possible time. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  122:08 
Okay. So, there's a motion by Councillor Zondervan to go to Public Comment and then recess 
the meeting, that a meeting will be called as soon as possible to pick up the items where we left 
off but also to formally have the committee accept the suggestions that were put forward. So

that's before us as well. So, on the motion to extend the meeting long enough to have Public 
Comments and to have the suggestions of my colleagues added to the record for discussion at 
the meeting when it resumes. All those in favor say Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it. We will go 
to Public Comment, after which we will recess. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  123:01 
Please give your name and address for the record. 
 
John Hawkinson  123:03 
Thank you, Madam Chair, John Hawkinson, 84 Mass Ave. It was my intention to address you 
primarily regarding quorums. But quite a number of I think important issues came up during your 
discussion and thank you for having it. So, I'd want to just touch on those quickly. I think most 
importantly, this question of the reduction of time for Public Comment from three minutes to two 
minutes, when there are more than 20 speakers, it's a really, really big deal. A lot of people 
have difficulty articulating their comments, their speech, fitting it into three minutes. And that's 
the nature of things. Not everyone is a professional speaker. And I think pushing it to two will 
make it extremely challenging for many people, and maybe at the point of abrogating their rights 
to express themselves and I would urge the council to look at it very, very carefully. And 
certainly, to billboard it clearly that it's coming, maybe present at the public meeting of the 
council that you've been under consideration in a really explicit way before adopting that sort of 
change. Because I think it's very important.  
 
John Hawkinson  123:04 
Also, with respect to the question of addressing late items, I want to remind the council that the 
charter under Section 98 provides that the rules of the City Council shall provide the citizens 
and employees of the city a reasonable opportunity to be heard at any such meeting in regard to 
any matter considered there at, so I think a rule change that bars speaking to late items, 
essentially is a charter problem. And so, I think you should look very carefully at that. Smaller 
items: with respect to this question of personalities and naming councilors, I think, urge you to 
be very careful with the First Amendment, which you know, requires you to have only 
reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions on the speech of the public and saying that the 
public can't reference a particular councilor by name when that's really the only practical way to 
explain some event that's of relevance and pertinent to business before the council is really 
troubling. I don't think that's what personalities and Robert's Rules means. I understand the 
council has interpreted it differently than I have. But I don't think that's what it means. It means 
essentially try to avoid saying names where you can, but where you must.  
 
John Hawkinson  125:11 
And I have some other comments, I'll put them in writing because I think that you'll be meeting 
again. But with respect to quorums, what I really want to address you on, I think the change a 
couple of sessions ago to two member quorums for subcommittee meetings was extremely ill 
advised. It means no single councilor can speak with any other single councilor about business 
before a committee. And while you can quibble about what's business with our committee, most 
stuff is business before some committee. And furthermore, it sets the expectation that 
councilors are not required to attend their committee meetings. Only two people are required for 
a committee of five. I think the expectation ought to be that all members should attend meetings 
where practical. Of course, that won't always be the case. But it should be at the expectation 
and the goal and lowering the quorum from nominally three for a committee of five to two really 
hurts that expectation. So, I would strongly urge the council to revert the change made, I think it 
was two sessions ago. And to return the quorums, to three, or whatever the appropriate is for

the number of committees that have more than five members, it's different, but half plus one, 
roughly.  Thank you for your attention. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  126:23 
Thank you for your comments. By the vote of the members, the voting members presents, we 
agreed that we would recess the meeting after public comment.  Does recess require a motion? 
On a motion to recess by, the motion is by Councillor McGovern. All those in favor say aye. 
Opposed? The ayes have... Can I rescind that?  Did I also say that the information from this 
previous meeting would be forwarded? Thank you. Alright. So, all those in favor say aye. 
Opposed, no. The ayes have it. The meeting is recessed to a time that will be set by the chair.  
Thank you for your attention.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 

Re:  Additional Surveillance Technology Impact Reports 

February 24, 2020 

Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge 

Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting the following to the City Council for review 
and discussion at the February 24, 2020 Council Meeting: 

 

•  Three (3) new Surveillance Technology Impact Reports (“STIRs”), describing 
Surveillance Technologies which are subject to the Ordinance, which require City 
Council approval.   

The attached new STIRs were not previously submitted.  They concern new Surveillance 

Technology the City is seeking to acquire and existing Surveillance Technology that – 
considering feedback from the Public Safety Committee – I am reporting to the Council in new, 
consolidated STIRs: 
 

•  Digital Evidence Management System, a new Surveillance Technology requested by 

the Emergency Communications Department.   

•  IP Address Collection Platforms, existing Surveillance Technology previously reported 
to the Council in two separate STIRs from the Information Technology Department.  (See 
“Checkpoint Firewall” and “Web server access and error logging” STIRs submitted at the 
December 9, 2019 Council Meeting.)  This new STIR clarifies the use of IP Address 
Collection Platforms throughout the City. 

•  Atlas RMV Portal, existing Surveillance Technology previously reported to the Council 

in two separate STIRs from the Finance Department and the Traffic, Parking and 
Transportation Department.  (See “Atlas Database (RMV)” and “ATLAS: Massachusetts 
RMV Website Portal” STIRs submitted at the December 9, 2019 Council Meeting.)  This 
new STIR clarifies the use of the Atlas RMV Portal throughout the City and incorporates 
the Assessing Department’s use of the Portal. 

In a separate communication, I will also submit the following to the City Council for  

review and discussion at the February 24, 2020 Council Meeting: 
 

•  Revised Surveillance Technology Impact Reports (“STIRs”), describing Surveillance 
Technologies which are subject to the Ordinance, which require City Council approval.  

 

 

 

 

 

The original STIRs were submitted to the City Council at the December 9, 2019 Council 
Meeting or to the Public Safety Committee at a January 22, 2020 committee meeting and 
were reviewed and discussed at the January 22, 2020 committee meeting.  The revised 
STIRs will address feedback from the Public Safety Committee. 

•  Summary of STIRs submitted to the City Council during the past year.  The Summary 
of STIRs will include a summary of all STIRs submitted to the City Council to date, 
including what action the City Council took on same, and reference all revised STIRs for 
ease of review by the Council. 
 

Those STIRs previously submitted to the City Council at the December 9, 2019 Council 

Meeting or to the Public Safety Committee at a January 22, 2020 committee meeting, were 
discussed in detail at the January 22, 2020 Public Safety Committee meeting and referred to the 
City Council by the Public Safety Committee with a recommendation that they be approved by 
the City Council.   

 
I look forward to reviewing these documents in detail with you at the February 24, 2020 

City Council meeting and to answering any questions you may have.   
 

Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Louis A. DePasquale 
City Manager

Digital Evidence Mangement System  

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  
 
•  A Digital Evidence Management System is similar to a document management 
solution. The Digital Evidence Management System is a repository of currently 
collected data such as 911 calls, Police Records Management System, Evidence, 
Computer Aided Dispatch, Crime Scene Photos, Interview Room Recordings, Lab 
Reports and Shot Spotter data.   

 
•  The purpose of this technology is to provide a centralized storage location for the 

existing data from our current disparate systems in the Emergency Communications 
and Police Departments and store it in one central repository to facilitate the 
management of investigations and digital evidence in a secure cloud-based system for 
authorized users.  This technology will store copies of existing protected Criminal 
Justice Information Services (CJIS) information and will be compliant as required by 
the CJIS security requirements for federal, state and local governments.  Additionally, 
this technology will provide a secure electronic connection to the Cambridge Police 
Department’s Court Prosecutors Office and the District Attorney’s Office.  This 
technology will automate the delivery of documentation that is currently required by 
the court.  Currently, there are over 4,000 cases assigned annually that we process for 
court.  

 
•  This technology also provides a secure automated evidence upload feature for citizens 
who voluntarily provide evidence to the police department.  For example, a witness of 
a crime may have a photo of a car and license plate that fled the scene.  This 
information could be uploaded to increase solvability factors as well as increased 
citizen participation.  In addition, business owners could voluntarily register their 
closed-circuit television systems through the technology, so that the Police 
Department does not have to canvas the neighborhood to locate these devices.   

 
•  The impact of this technology on the departments will increase business operations 
and effective data collection.  This will also reduce the risk of errors in manual data 
gathering and therefore provide more effective evidence collection.  In addition, there

will be a reduction in staff resources for data collection from various units and 
departments.    

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  The current process for gathering data is very manual and labor intensive.  The Police 

and Emergency Communications Department receive requests daily from the 
Middlesex Attorney’s Office for all existing discoverable information for related 
cases prior to the initial court date.  They use this information to properly assess the 
facts of the case and determine prosecution.  This technology will automate the 
process reducing the manual effort of pulling this information, transporting case files 
and providing copies of 911 calls for review via discs.   

 
•  The purpose of a Digital Evidence Management System is to consolidate data from 

siloed applications and data sources.  The technology provides an automated solution 
for gathering evidence of violations of any criminal or civil law, administrative 
actions and collected records such as 911 audio, Police Records Management System, 
Evidence, and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD).  In addition, the technology 
provides secure connection to transfer required case evidence to the court.   

 
•  The technology also provides a secure connection for residents and registered 
business owners to upload case evidence including pictures and videos.  This 
application allows the police department to communicate with residents effectively 
and efficiently in obtaining additional information that will assist in solving crimes.   

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

  
•  The technology will be deployed in the data center at 125 6th Street so that it can 

connect to the existing systems that support the Police Department and Emergency 
Communications.    

If a cloud-based solution is chosen, then it will be deployed to both 125 6th Street 
data center and the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud.   Microsoft Azure 
Government Cloud is a commercial infrastructure cloud platform contractually 
committed to meeting the CJIS security requirements for federal, state and local 
governments.  It will then transmit the data over Virtual Private Network (VPN) 
connections that will be configured to meet the CJIS security requirements.  This will 
be used to send and receive data from court and residents and/or registered 
businesses. 

 
•  The target date for procuring this technology is spring 2020.   

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have?

•  The privacy impact of this technology is consistent with federal, state and local 

government policies for the purposes of law enforcement and public safety efforts.  
With the implementation of this technology, the authorized personnel performing law 
enforcement duties will have electronic access to records that currently exist in 
various systems.  The department continues to maintain those data sources and 
deliberately chose not to expand access to additional data from what it is today.  
Therefore, there is no additional privacy impact from the utilization of this 
technology.   

 
•  This technology will be configured with similar role-based access to the existing data 
in disparate systems to ensure protection of the data.  Therefore, only authorized users 
will have access for performing their duties in accordance with their role in the 
respective departments.  This technology will provide an electronic version of the 
same data set to the court that exists today in our systems that we use to gather 
information on case files. 

 
•  Because this technology provides an opportunity for citizens and business to engage 
and participate in sharing media, there may be a greater impact on privacy of the 
individuals or businesses who voluntarily provide such information to law 
enforcement officials. The Police Department will address these privacy impacts by 
limiting access to the information to assigned investigators and/or authorized users, 
similarly to current department policy.  All access will be password protected and 
there will be a change log identifying all users who access each record and data 
source.  In addition, we will conduct detailed training on the use of the system and 
best practices for protecting personal information as well as quality assurance 
measures for compliance.  Lastly, the department will ensure appropriate 
communications are visible on the portal and/or department webpage so that residents 
and business owners are aware of the use of this technology and shared media.   

 
•  This technology does not have the capacity to access residents or business owners’ 
devices.   Anyone who wishes to share information through the system will upload 
the media that they wish to share.  In addition, the technology will only record the 
information provided by the sender.  Business owners who voluntarily register on the 
technology platform may be asked by law enforcement to provide media for a 
specific date and time related to a case.  The business owner can voluntarily provide 
the media if they choose, but law enforcement cannot access the media without their 
consent.  The benefits of the business registration program allow for investigators to 
request media directly without having to canvass the area saving valuable time during 
investigations. 

 
•  Currently, citizens and business owners volunteer data in person and/or on the scene 
of an incident.  We receive a tremendous amount of support and cooperation in 
obtaining media related to incidents. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

IP Address Collection Platforms (Multiple) 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The City of Cambridge uses various platforms that collect IP addresses from internal 
and external connections and connection attempts, e.g., the City website, Find It 
Cambridge, the City firewall and the City’s web servers.  While the platforms vary, 
the surveillance capabilities and functionality are the same.  IP address information is 
used to limit and protect the City network from malicious sites and unauthorized 
access. 

•  The identification of a device's IP address can be used to determine the country, city, 
or postal/ZIP code of the device, determining an object's generalized geographical 
location. 

•  The City’s Microsoft web server software records IP addresses, as well as date & 
time, referring URL (if provided by the browser), and user agent string (again, if 
provided by the user’s browser) at the time of the request for connection to the server.  
It also records connection errors. The data is written to log files on disk for future 
reference and analysis. 

•  The firewall uses the same information to protect City of Cambridge users and Data.  
When malicious activity occurs from a certain IP or region, we are able to adequately 
protect or defend city data.  We do not use this information to identify individuals 
only as a means to protect City employees, City data infrastructure, and personal 
information. 

•  This information is not sent to any third parties. 
 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Maintaining the safety and security of City Data, Infrastructure, Employees, Students, 

Customers, and City-owned or controlled buildings. 

•  Analyzing and managing service delivery.

•  The City of Cambridge collects information about visitors to public websites. This 
information is used for analytical and statistical purposes to help better manage the 
sites. Information that is collected includes the date and the type of browser being 
used. We use this information to learn how many visitors we have, the websites they 
are coming from, which parts of our web site are of most interest to users and other 
facts that will help us improve the web site and the services we offer. 
Identifying IP addresses is critical to the City’s network security.  The City is a 
member of the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center, an organization 
dedicated to improving cybersecurity for state and local governments.  Through this 
membership, ITD receives regular reports listing the top malware IP addresses.  
Identifying the IP addresses connecting to the City’s platforms allows ITD to protect 
against malware IP addresses and similar threats. (See attached report example.) 

• 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  All City web servers; firewall. 
•  The log files have been collected on these devices for over 20 years.  They are located 
at the Healy Building in Cambridge and on the Microsoft Azure Government Cloud.  
The Microsoft Azure Government Cloud is a commercial infrastructure cloud 
platform contractually committed to meeting  privacy and security requirements for 
federal, state and local governments. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The identification of a device's IP address can be used to determine the country, city, 
or postal/ZIP code of the device, determining an object's generalized geographical 
location. 

•  Access to all collected IP addresses is password protected, and authorized employees 

receive annual training on best practices for protecting personal information. 

•  This information is not sent to any third parties. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?

Atlas RMV Portal 

Department: 

Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 

Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The Atlas RMV Portal is a web application provided by the Commonwealth of 

Massachusetts to access the RMV system.  The Atlas Database holds information on 
all the registered/licensed drivers in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These 
records are created and maintained by the RMV.  Information is collected by the 
RMV and is accessible to municipalities when users log in to view a driver or dealer’s 
profile. The City is not able to save or store any of this information internally, it is 
only available on the Database. When logged in, City users are connected directly to 
the RMV system.  Any changes made by the City are also updated at the RMV in real 
time.  

Departments access different types of data through the Portal, depending on their 
purpose for using the system: 

•  Finance/Revenue – The Portal allows staff to access a driver’s personal 

identifiable information as reported on their Massachusetts licenses: address, birth 
date, height, gender, eye color, etc., in order to administer the Commonwealth’s 
Motor Vehicle Excise Tax. This tax is required by Massachusetts General Laws 
and is levied by the city or town where the vehicle is principally garaged.   

 

 

The Portal is used when a driver contacts the Revenue office and requests to have 
a hold lifted from their account. Per City policy, in order to receive a release, 
drivers are required to pay all outstanding Excise bills to the City, regardless of 
which bills are on hold. In certain circumstances, the Finance Department will 
allow for a payment plan to aid drivers who are experiencing financial hardships.

Payment plans are granted on a case by case basis and require approval from the 
Treasurer. 
 

•  Finance/Assessing – The Portal allows staff to create excise tax bills for billing 
car dealerships with dealer plates.  The RMV provides a list of all dealer plates 
registered in Cambridge which are then billed for excise taxes. 
 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – The portal allows staff to access a driver’s 
name, address, license plate number, registration status, vehicle details, vehicle 
addresses and garage code.  This information is used to issue resident parking 
permits; view handicap placard information and clear holds on licenses and 
vehicle registrations.  

 

 

 

 

 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Enforcing obligations to the City. 

 

 

 

•  Executing financial transactions between the City and any individual engaged in a 

financial transaction with the City. 

•  Finance/Revenue – The Portal is used in a very limited capacity to release the Non-
Renewal hold at the RMV for a taxpayer who has paid a delinquent Motor Vehicle 
Excise tax bill via credit card or cash.  The City provides this service to accommodate 
those taxpayers who need a release relatively quickly.  For instance, a taxpayer may 
not even realize they are on RMV hold until they go to the registry to renew their 
license or registration.  The taxpayer will pay the outstanding bill on-line via credit 
card and then call the Finance Office for a release.   

•  Finance/Assessing – The RMV requires municipalities to use the Atlas Portal for 

accessing dealer plate information needed for excise tax billing. 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – The Portal assists Parking Services staff in 

issuing resident parking permits, viewing handicap placard information, and clearing 
holds on licenses and vehicle registrations.

•  An updated Atlas RMV Portal deployed in November 2019.  A previous system 

had been in place since the early 2000s. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

 

 

•  Finance/Revenue – The Portal provides access to personal identifiable information 

about drivers registered in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The information that 
is found on a Massachusetts issued driver’s license is found on the Portal: address, 
birth date, height, gender, eye color, etc. When viewing a driver profile, City users are 
able to see any outstanding excise tax bills, parking tickets, and pay-by-plate tickets 
that are under the driver’s name.  All drivers within the Commonwealth are subject to 
Excise tax.  Students moving in and out of the city between semesters, and other 
individuals coming and going, may lose track of where their vehicle is registered and 
may not receive their bill to pay it on time.  
 
Revenue mitigates privacy impacts by only granting access to three employees. The 
system requires a username, password, and a unique security code that is sent via 
email each time a log in attempt is made. Users are automatically logged out after 10 
minutes of inactivity and will be required to re-submit their username, password, and 
a new security code to re-enter. 
 

•  Finance/Assessing – The Portal provides information that is not available to the 

public regarding the number of dealer plates any dealership has in Cambridge.  The 
Assessing department has limited access to this database to three members of the 
department and has requested the least amount of information required for sending 
out bills.  The Assessing department has requested only vehicle inquiry roles related 
to dealer plates and no additional information that could be provided through the 
Atlas RMV Portal, such as driver inquiry or access to driving records. 
 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – The Portal allows TPT staff to access detailed 
personal information about Cambridge residents.  The information accessed is not 
collected or stored and the public cannot access it.  The information is only accessed 
by Parking Services staff when issuing resident parking permits, viewing handicap 
placard information, and clearing holds on licenses and vehicle registrations, all of 
which are requested by the customer. The data available on the Portal may have a 
greater impact on the privacy of those individuals who own a vehicle than those 
individuals who do not own a vehicle, since staff only access the vehicle registration 
data for resident who own cars.  Access to the Portal is password protected and the 
Parking Services Staff who use ATLAS receive individual, detailed training which 
includes best practices for protecting personal information.

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 
 
•  Finance/Revenue – The City is assessed an RMV fee on the Cherry Sheet 

 

 

 

Assessments.  Massachusetts Statutes authorize an RMV Surcharge of $20.00 per 
each clear transaction made through the Atlas Database. The cost of the RMV 
Surcharge is built into the fees that are incurred on bills that have been paid late.  

 

 

•  Finance/Assessing – All costs associated with Assessing’s use for dealer plate billing 

are covered by the RMV. 

•  Traffic, Parking, and Transportation – There are no initial costs associated with Atlas 
and all maintenance costs are the responsibility of the Massachusetts RMV. There is a 
$20.00 RMV surcharge for clearing registration holds.  In FY 2019, there were 
17,973 chargeable clears for license and registration holds. Since FY2014, at the 
request of the Massachusetts RMV, the City provides an annual non-renewal 
reconciliation adjustment amount which is reported to the State Comptroller and then 
debited against municipalities’ local aid distributions.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL 

 

Cambridge City Council 
Councillor Marc McGovern 
February 20, 2019 
Comments on Refiling the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning Petition 2020 

Marc C. McGovern 

City Councillor 

TO: 
 
FROM:  
DATE:  
RE: 
 
 
Fellow Councillors: 

In the months since the Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning Petition (AHO) was tabled, having 
secured favorable recommendations out of the Ordinance Committee and Planning Board, Cambridge’s 
housing crisis has not subsided. If anything, the acuteness of the region’s housing shortage has only 
become more focused. A new report out of the Metropolitan Planning Area Council confirmed the 
particular challenges that blue-collar families with children <https://metrocommon.mapc.org/reports/10> 
face in securing affordable housing. The Boston Globe finally endorsed 
<https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/18/opinion/letting-towns-solve-mass-housing-shortage/> 
Governor Baker’s Housing Choices Bill, lamenting the “Commonwealth’s bizarre housing laws…that 
empowers small minorities to thwart just the kind of housing projects that the state so desperately needs.” 
(The same bizarre law, as it happens, that thwarted the AHO last year and doomed it to sit on the table 
with a majority of Councillors in support of passage.) 

The refiled AHO petition takes the language recommended out of the Ordinance Committee as its 
base text. This version was the result of an extensive and lengthy public process. All told, the AHO was 
discussed at more than a dozen community meetings, nine Housing Committee meetings over two years, 
and four Ordinance Committee hearings logging more than 21 hours of public comment and debate (not 
to mention full City Council meetings). Councillors voted on some 62 amendments in Ordinance 
Committee, the vast majority (46 amendments) of which were adopted. Nearly all of the successful 
amendments (41) were offered by Councillors who ultimately voted against the AHO.  

As the Community Development Department cautioned in a memo to the Council last year, however, 

“to the extent that these [additional] requirements add cost to, or complicate the development of, AHO 
projects, and particularly if these requirements are not similarly imposed on market-rate developments, 
the potential impact of the AHO may be lessened.” Accordingly, the petitioners have offered some 
amendments in consultation with Cambridge’s affordable housing developers to better enable the AHO to 

Packet Pg. 825

8.2

create housing more quickly, predictably, and efficiently, as was originally intended. The amendments 
from AHO 2019 are summarized as follows: 

•  Amendments in section 11.207.3 Standards for Eligibility, Rent, and Initial Sale Price for AHO 

• 

• 

Units are included so as not to conflict with state funding requirements, and to clarify that certain 
regulations are project specific.  
It is reasonable to assume that existing building might be relocated on the parcel as well as 
“altered, reconstructed, extended, or enlarged” in order to more suitable meeting the intent and 
guidelines of this overlay. This is now reflected in 11.207.5.3 Standards for Existing Buildings to 
permit the type of historical preservation achieved, for example, in the Frost Terrace project.  
In section 11.207.5.2 Dimensional Standards for AHO, effort has been made to avoid confusions 
where a zoning district intersects property lines by measuring buffer zones from an abutting 
parcel line that is in a lower-density district, rather than a district line which may split a parcel 
otherwise suitable for affordable housing. 

•  An amendment to section 11.207.5.2.3 establishes a minimum front yard setback of 15 feet, 
greater than the 10 feet observed by the Cambridge Urban Forest Master Plan to produce the 
City’s densest canopy, except where the existing base zoning is less restrictive, or where such a 
setback would not fit the context of abutting properties.  

•  An amendment to section 107.5.2.4 Open Space restores a test for setting required open space 
percentages originally recommended to the Council and ensures affordable housing developers 
have flexibility in meeting the Council’s open space goals.  

•  Current language in section 11.207.6.1 Required Off-Street Accessory Parking would require 

expansive, likely non-permeable off-street facilities to accommodate passenger pick-up/drop off 
and delivery trucks regardless of the project size. A revision to this section would avoid eating 
into open space for the purpose of off-street vehicle facilities on projects with fewer than 20 units. 

•  Responding to feedback from our affordable housing partners that portions of section 11.207.7.2 
Site Design and Arrangement requirements would render a project unworkable and might not 
achieve the desired streetscape design, dimensional standards have been relaxed in breaking up 
building massing while still preserving the Council goal of preventing unbroken facades of more 
than 150 feet. Some additional clarifying amendments are included.  

•  Window sizes for non-residential portions of buildings are set at 30 percent in Section 11.207.7.3 
Building Facades and Section 11.207.7.4 Ground Stories and Stories Below Grade, which should 
translate to less energy loss than the previously proposed 70 percent glazing. Further, the mandate 
that affordable housing developers subsidize the building of retail space is lifted, allowing non-
residential uses to be created where site appropriate.  

•  Section 11.207.7.6 Environmental Design Standards creates something of a double negative in 
the municipal code with regard to the applicability of the Tree Protection Ordinance to AHO 
projects-tree regulations do not not apply to affordable housing projects exempted from the Tree 
Protection Ordinance. The release of the Urban Tree Canopy Master Plan and expected overhaul 
of the Tree Protection Ordinance will provide an opportunity to apply a single standard to all 
affordable housing projects, and thus this contorted language may be stricken altogether.  

 
Sincerely,

IN CITY COUNCIL 
February 24, 2020 

The  following portions of the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition contain proposed 
amendments by the Ordinance Committee Co-Chair for existing Sections 20.4.2 Building Height 
Limitations, 20.54.5 Building Setbacks, and 20.54.7 Additional FAR to enhance the petition goals. All 
proposed amendments are highlighted in red, italicized text. 
 
20.50    Harvard Square Overlay District and Harvard Square Historic Overlay District 
 
20.54.2 Building Height Limitations. The maximum height of buildings in the Harvard Square Overlay 

District shall be governed by the requirements of this Section 20.54.2; however, at locations 
where the base zoning district establishes a more restrictive height limitation, the more restrictive 
shall apply. 

1.   As of Right Height Limitations. The maximum height of any building shall be sixty   (60) 
feet. 
2.   Special Permit for Additional Height. The maximum allowable height in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District may be increased up to eighty (80) feet upon issuance of a Special Permit by 
the Planning Board. If a Special Permit is issued portions of the building may extend to 
eighty (80) feet in height provided that those portions in excess of sixty (60) feet are set back 
from the street line at least ten (10) feet, and that those portions are also set back from one or 
more forty-five (45) degree sky exposure planes, unless otherwise permitted by the Planning 
Board. A forty-five (45) degree sky exposure plane shall be an imaginary inclined plane 
beginning fifty-five (55) feet above any street-line in the districts and rising over one or more 
lots at a forty-five (45 ) degree angle.” 

 

Allowed Special Permit exceptions to upper floor setbacks must successfully reduce the 
overall negative effect of multiple floor setbacks and enhance both the proposed building 
silhouette and townscape of the block. Such architectural elements as pergolas, and 
occupiable corner pavilions, raised pediment above the main building entry, and special 
features that animate the public domain experience. All such exceptions are to be limited 
in scope. 
 
All approved facade setbacks are to provide accessible, useable balconies for tenants. 

 
20.54.5 Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's positive diversity of 

building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards and courtyards is encouraged 
throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to permit design flexibility to allow any physical 
change in the District to reflect the character of the area within which it is located. To this end 
any building in the Harvard Square Overlay District shall be exempt from the yard requirements 
as specified in Section 5.30 
<https://library.municode.com/ma/cambridge/codes/zoning_ordinance?nodeId=ZONING_ORDI

Packet Pg. 828

8.3

NANCE_ART5.000DEST_5.30DIDIRE>, (except as noted in number 3 below and where such 
yard abuts a lot, but not a public way, outside the Overlay District) if the following conditions are 
met: 
 
1.   The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been issued   by that 
date, or 
2.  For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning district,   for 
which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the Planning Board  
Permit exempting the building from yard requirements provided: 

issues a Special 

 

 
 

a.  The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the objectives    
and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development Guidelines. 
b.  No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to 

terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing building; 
and 

c.  No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the site in the 

preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to terminate or preclude its 
designation or demolished prior to the application. 

3.  For any new building in a Business B district seeking a Special Permit a rear yard 
setback of twenty (20) feet shall be provided with upper floor ten (10) foot 
setbacks beginning at forty-five (45) feet above grade. The resulting yard shall 
create a landscaped open space. 

 
20.54.7 Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit granting authority 

(Planning Board) may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot in the Business B 
district located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for any residential use in section 4.31 
(a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or 4.35 provided the Planning Board finds that the 
use and design complies with the goals and design guidelines set forth in the Harvard Square 
Conservation District and provides additional public benefits commensurate with the additional 
development, such as the following: 
1.  Ground floors that are devoted to retail and similar uses that activate the square 

and serve the needs of the surrounding community and visitors; 

2.  Commitments to recruit and retain small, local, and independent businesses, in 
part through maintaining 50 percent of first floor public frontage as commercial 
rental space of approximately 1,500 sq. ft.in size; 

3.  Creation of mixed-income housing;  
4.  Commitments to sustainable design that minimize greenhouse gas emissions and 

increases vegetation, and; 

5.  Investments into creating or improving public space.
