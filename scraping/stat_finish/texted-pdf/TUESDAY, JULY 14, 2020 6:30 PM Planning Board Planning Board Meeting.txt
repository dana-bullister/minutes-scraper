          CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER:  Okay.  Welcome to the July 

14, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My name 

is Catherine Preston Connolly and I am the Chair.  This 

meeting is being held remotely, due to the statewide 

emergency actions limiting the size of public gatherings in 

response to COVID-19, and in accordance with Governor 

Charles D Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements to the Open  

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge temporary 

emergency restrictions on public meetings, city events, and 

city permitted events, due to COVID-19, dated May 27, 2020. 

          This meeting is being audio and visually recorded,

There will also be a transcript of the proceedings.

public will state their name before speaking, and all votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, but you can also find

Member present.  Mary Flynn and Corinne Espinoza are not 

present at the meeting.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you very much.  Okay.      

So the first item on the agenda is an Update from Community 

Development.  Please also introduce the staff present at the 

meeting.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you again to the Chair -- 

Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development.  I'll be 

doing the in the room for this one.   

          With me, as always on my team: Swaathi Joseph 

working the controls on the slide presentation.  Also from 

my team, Daniel Messplay is present.  Liza Paden is present.  

Khalil Mogassabi, the Chief Planner and Deputy Director of

Community Development is present.  Erik Thorkildsen from the 

Urban Design Team is present. 

          And also, I would introduce Adam Shulman from our 

Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department.  He is 

present and all available to answer any questions about the 

case coming forward. 

          In terms of an update on future schedule, where 

we're at right now, tonight's meeting we are picking up 

resumption of our continued special permit, public hearings 

that were postponed from back in March. 

          So we have one public hearing on the agenda 

tonight.  We have two additional public hearings scheduled 

for July 21, and potentially some other General Business.   

          We are not having anything scheduled at the point 

for July 28.  But beginning in August we will have more 

public hearings that are -- again, continued from -- many of 

them continued from before. 

          On August 4, we have scheduled a public hearing on 

the Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning Petition, the City 

Council zoning petition that was scheduled to be heard back 

in April, and had its public hearing at the Ordinance 

Committee last week. 

8

          We also plan to have review of a comprehensive 

permit case; a case that will be having its public hearing 

in the Board of Zoning Appeal at some point in the future. I 

don't know that date yet.  But the Planning Board will do 

its review.  This is Case Number402 Rindge Avenue, the 

development of some additional affordable housing units. 

          We have many more public hearings to go.  We are 

planning to have meetings on August 11 and August 18.  Those 

will be fairly full agendas -- I won't get into all the 

details at this time, I'll update at the next meeting. 

          But again, we're hoping at this point to not 

schedule anything from August 25 -- that may change in the 

future as time goes on, but we'll provide updates as we go. 

          And I already mentioned that the Ordinance 

Committee had a hearing on the affordable housing zoning 

petition last week.  They announced that they are going to 

have a continued hearing on August 19, and thus far that is 

all I'm aware of that's scheduled for the Ordinance 

          I'll turn it back over to you.    

Committee.

(6:35 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven A. 

                  Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, 

                  and Nikolas Bowie       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  The next item on the 

agenda would be the approval of meeting minutes.  However, 

the Board has not received any transcripts for past 

meetings. 

          So we'll move on to the next item on the agenda, 

which is the continued public hearing, as Jeff noted, on 

Planning Board Case Number 355 -- a proposal by Budega for a 

cannabis retail store at 1686 Massachusetts Avenue within an 

existing retail space.   

          And we will start again by having Jeff Roberts 

from CDD staff summarize procedurally where this is before 

us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair once again.  

So this is a case that had its public hearing opened on 

December 10, 2019.  The Board heard the applicants' proposal 

at that time and took comments from the public.

          At the conclusion of that session, the Board left 

the hearing open, and asked the applicant to provide 

responses to a number of outstanding questions. 

          So the applicant provided additional materials.  

The hearing would have been continued on March 20 of this 

year, but that meeting had to be postponed, for reasons that 

we're all familiar with at this point.   

          Just as a reminder for the Board, a cannabis 

retail store is allowed in this zoning district, the 

Business A2 District, by special permit from the Planning 

Board, if it's found to conform to the criteria in Section 

11.00 of the zoning ordinance and the General Special Permit 

criteria in Section 10.43.   

          CDD Staff has provided a memo summarizing the 

Special Permit criteria that are applicable, and providing 

some comments on the additional information that was 

provided by the applicant.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right So the 

presenter for the applicant is Arish Halani.  If you can 

begin by introducing yourself and other speakers from your 

team, and then you can begin your presentation, you'll have 

up to 30 minutes, unless the Board grants you more time.

          ARISH HALANI:  Okay, wonderful.  You guys want to 

give me a thumbs up if you can hear me?  All right, 

wonderful.   

          My name is Arish Halani.  I am representing 

Budega, Inc.  I would like to introduce a few of my team 

members on this call.  We have Rich Acevedo, we have Sohail 

Halani, we have we have Erik Gould (phonetic) and Aoife 

Troxel from the Architect Team, and then we have Chris Burns 

from our Security Team.   

          So without further ado, I will get started on this 

presentation and kind of get everyone up to speed as to 

where we're at.  Thank you for changing the slide, Swaathi.  

          In order to get everyone on the same page in 

regards to the timeline and process that Cambridge is 

following for recreational marijuana, in October of 2019, 

Budega, Inc. received their cannabis business permit 

application approval in order to seek a special permit.  

This step 2 of the process, into July, 2020, where we are 

today.  We are seeking a special permit. 

          In between July 2020 and December 2020, we hope to 

receive a permit, and also, execute a host community 

agreement with the City of Cambridge.

          Thereafter, in between December 2020 and December 

2021, we hope to continue to apply to various city and state 

procedures, such as the business permit, occupancy permit, 

provisional license, final license, and construct our 

facility. 

          And if all goes to time and we get our final 

approvals, we hope to open doors on July 22.  Obviously, 

this is an expected timeline; we will see how this goes. 

          Next slide please. 

          As Jeff was so kind to kind of give an overview of 

the different milestones, I wanted to just take a quick 

opportunity to get everyone on the same page as to where 

this application is, what we've done, and where we're at 

today.   

          So in October of 2019, we submitted our first 

narrative and plan set submission.  After that, we had our 

first meeting in December of 2019.  We took comments from 

Planning Board, Urban Design and Traffic Department, and 

discussed with them during the December timeline and 

submitted a revised narrative on January 27. 

          Thereafter, we received some additional comments 

from Traffic Department, which we incorporated into our 

13

design plans and narrative, and we submitted a revised 

narrative on February 13, 2020. 

          Thereafter, we had a meeting scheduled for 

February 25.  We postponed that meeting, due to lack of 

quorum of Planning Board members. And as a result, given 

that we had some time in between, we met with CDD again and 

Urban Planning again in order to discuss further 

recommendations that they wanted to see on our plans. 

          And finally, taking in all the recommendations we 

have submitted our final plan set as of March 12, which you 

guys should all have, which is the final revised narrative 

and plan set submission, which is what we will be going off 

for today's meeting. 

          Lastly, we had a meeting scheduled.  Obviously, we 

had it postponed due to COVID, and that brings us to today, 

July 14. 

          Next slide, thanks. 

          So the agenda for this meeting will be we're going 

to start with discussing the exterior design changes, then 

the interior design changes, and then some additional 

questions from the Planning Board, and then we can open it 

up for Q&A.

          So we're going to start with the exterior.  The 

very first recommendation made by the Planning Board was an 

order to consider the recommendation made by CDD to retain 

the existing recessed entry and historical look of the 

storefront. 

          2) A recommendation was in order to regarding the 

clear façade versus the cover façade, and we were 

recommended to remove the artwork from the existing façade 

proposal, and use a clear glass façade that was compliant 

with the CCC. 

facility. 

          And the last and final exterior recommendation was 

in regards to including an awning on the exterior of the 

          So if we can move to the next slide, thanks.   

          On the top portion here, you will see our original 

plans as of December, and then our proposed final plans as 

of March, and notated as on 1),2),3) are the various 

recommendations.  And I will go over them. 

          Recommendation Number One was in regards to the 

recessed door.  We moved the door to the right, and it is 

recessed in order to preserve the historical look.  In 

addition to:  we have committed to existing a new marble

that resembles the existing marble, and raised the height of 

the facility. 

          The second recommendation was in regard to the 

clear façade.  As you can see here, we have removed the 

artwork, and the waiting vestibule acts as a buffer into the 

dispensary.  So it is still a clear façade. 

          And then the last and final recommendation was in 

regards to the awning.  As you will see here, we have added 

a matching awning on the top of the facility.   

          The -- I'm going to talk now about the interior 

design plan changes.  The fourth recommendation, made by the 

Planning Board, was in regard to bike parking.  We were 

recommended to identify an area for bicycle storage on the 

first floor for ease of bike loading access.   

          The fifth recommendation was in regards to trash, 

for us to identify an area for trash storage, and described 

a plan for trash removal. 

          And then the sixth recommendation was to reduce 

customer queuing, we added an additional POS station.  So 

again, you'll see a before and after -- before on the left 

as of December, and after on the right as of March. 

          And recommendation four is the bicycles, where we

have placed in the rear left of the facility. 

          Recommendation five is the trash storage, where we 

have placed in the rear right of the facility. 

          And recommendation six, we have added an 

additional POS station at the end of our stations here, 

where you see the number 6. 

          Now I will discuss some of the additional 

requested information by the Planning Board.  So the seventh 

requested item from the Planning Board was a site plan.  

They wanted to see a visual representation of the dispensary 

floor plan overlaid on the existing site plan.  We have 

provided that in the Project Plans and Illustrations 

section.   

          The eighth recommendation was in order for us to 

consider the flow of operations.  And as a result, we have 

submitted a draft operation plans to the TPT, and that will 

become an ongoing discussion as we get closer to opening our 

facility.  It will be a living document. 

          The ninth recommendation is in regards to the rear 

door access.  The Planning Board wanted some information 

regarding the rear door and what goes out of it and where it 

goes.  We have provided that in the narrative, in the

Project Plans and Illustrations.   

          The tenth recommendation was in regards to 

capacity, and the response to that was that this vestibule -

- waiting vestibule has a capacity of 15.  The retail 

dispensing space has a capacity of 13 -- serving 13 

customers and six employees, which brings our total first-

floor occupancy to about 34, with a maximum of 49.   

          The eleventh recommendation was in regards to 

deliveries.  The Planning Board wanted to know if we would 

be making deliveries from this facility.  The response is 

that as per Section 11.8 of the Cambridge City Ordinance, 

retailers are prohibited from delivering cannabis, and as a 

result, we will not be delivering any cannabis from this 

facility. 

          And the last recommendation was in regards to 

contact with abutters.  They recommended that we communicate 

with our abutters, and as a result we have met with the 

Porter Square Neighborhood Association.  And in addition, we 

have communicated with both our direct abutters, 1688 Mass 

Ave and 1684 Mass Ave. 

          And that's everything that we were asked for, and 

I can now open it up for Q&A.      

18

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So at 

this time, we'll take clarifying questions from Board 

members.  Any additional information or exposition you'd 

like from the applicant, if you have any such questions, you 

can raise your hand virtually, or just unmute yourself and 

say your name.     

          [Pause]            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Madam Chair?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  This is Tom Sieniewicz.  I have a 

question for the applicant.  There was, as I recall at the 

last hearing, concerns about the path of egress from the 

rear exit door, and whether you had a clear pathway that 

could be defined and kept clear -- important because it's a 

criteria for issuing a special permit.  [29:15 audio 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Tom, you 

trailed off a bit there at the end, but I think your points 

unclear].    

was clear.   

          I believe, Mr. Halani, you referenced that that 

was -- that some information about the rear egress was I 

called in the narrative.  But if you wouldn't mind taking a

few minutes to talk us through that -- that the egress 

situation is, that would be helpful.   

          ARISH HALANI:  Yes, absolutely.  So if anybody 

were to exit from the rear of the facility on the egress, 

they would be walking down the pathway that brings it into 

the landlord's rear yard where there is a brick path, with a 

gate that opens into the 10 Bowdoin Street parcel. 

          And from there, a person can walk onto that 

parcel, take a left, go into 1688 Mass Ave's parking lot, 

and then walk onto 10 Bowdoin Street.      

          CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER:  Okay.  Any other 

clarifying questions or information that Board members would 

like to request at this time?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I have a quick one.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I don't know if the -- I 

haven't got all of the drawings, but my drawings don't show 

a recessed door.  Of course, I have it drawn that way 

because I think it should go that way.  But am I the only 

one?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Swaathi, can you 

bring back the floor plan drawing?  Thank you.

          ARISH HALANI:  So in order to -- oh, there it is, 

there you go.  You'll see the recessed door on the --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  So Lou, if you 

see the front of the building there on the left, it's 

straight across.  But on the right, instead of having the 

recessed door in the middle, as it exists today, they have 

recessed the door, but it is on the right-hand side.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I guess we just didn't get 

updated drawings.  I saw it on the presentation.  I was just 

wondering why our drawings didn't have -- I guess we have 

older drawings.      

Ted?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So I have two questions.  One, 

we've just received an e-mail while the presentation was 

being made, that challenges the ability to use the rear 

emergency access.   

          So if we could have a little more information 

about that; whether there actually is access to a public way 

or an easement or some other written agreement about it. 

          And then the second question I have relates to the 

recessed door.  I understand the current configuration of 

21

the door is not compliant, but walking up and down Mass Ave, 

looking at other stores, they all seem to have similar 

doors.  And I'm wondering are they all noncompliant?  And at 

what point do they have to become compliant?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So Mr. Halani, why 

don't you start with going back to the rear access?   

          ARISH HALANI:  Sure.  Swaathi, would you be able 

to share the project plans and illustrations Number Five?  

It's the site plan that will have a visual representation of 

the rear exit?    

          [33:23 SPEAKER UNIDENTIFIED]:  Arish, just 

checking, is it part of this presentation, or --  

          ARISH HALANI:  No, it's a part of the plan set 

that the Board members should have.  Or if the Board members 

have it, I can walk everyone through it.  I have it in front 

of me.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  If I could jump in, actually, 

Swaathi, I can try to share my screen because -- this is 

Jeff Roberts, I can -- I actually have it in front of me.  I 

brought it up while the Board members were talking.  I'm 

going to try to do -- I think this is the --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yep.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- plan that you're referring to.   

          ARISH HALANI:  Yes.  So as I mentioned verbally, 

now we have an opportunity to see it from a visual 

perspective.  Where this site plan begins is pretty much the 

rear.   

          On the right-hand side of this site plan is -- if 

you exited the rear of the facility, you would walk down 

this path and be able to go into the back yard. 

          Walk down this brick path, as it's noted.  At the 

end of the brick path there is a gate; you will open the 

gate, and then there is an open wall -- a 10 Bowdoin Street 

parcel, which would then bring you onto the open back rear 

parking lot of the 1682 parcel.  You walk down that, you 

will go get onto Bowdoin Street.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, does that 

address your question, or do you want more information on 

that from the applicant?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I guess the question is -

- I mean there's a challenge as to the right of people in 

that facility to use that access way.  I don't know whether 

that's accurate or not, and I'm just wondering, you know, is 

this all public property, or if it's private property, is

there an agreement to allow Budega or the current tenant in 

the property to use it?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So there is an easement with the 10 

Bowdoin Street parcel, and then there's a verbal agreement 

with the 1682 Mass Ave parcel.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

And then as to compliance of other neighboring facilities 

that have similar doors, I presume that you have not 

actually researched their compliance.  But if you have and 

can speak to whether or not they are similarly noncompliant, 

that would be helpful.   

          ARISH HALANI:  I am unaware of the abutting 

parcels, but I can tell you that our front door will be 

handicapped- compliant, as shown on the plans.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Jeff, do we 

have any more information on the compliance of other area 

properties from a staff point of view?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  To the Chair -- this is Jeff 

Roberts, I'm going to maybe pass that onto Erik Thorkildsen.  

It's not --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- specifically within our

jurisdiction at CDD.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  There are other departments that 

are involved in review for accessible compliance.  But maybe 

Erik can fill in a little bit.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Erik, do you 

have any context around the ADA compliance issue and 

surrounding properties?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  No, actually I haven't --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  -- compared, but I can imagine 

probably there are similar conditions where it's a little 

too narrow or a little too steep, just because they're old 

buildings.  I think you'd have to go out there with a tape 

measure and a level to really research it. 

          But I guess the issue was -- it had to do with 

could the existing -- does the existing entry have to be 

replaced because it's not compliant?  And so, that raised 

the issue of, "Is there precedent for others, and where 

they're perfectly functional, or functional enough without 

being compliant?" 

          It sounds more like a question for our 

25

Accessibility Department.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  

Well, thank you for providing what context you could around 

that.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Could I comment?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, please.  Hugh.            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So there are several aspects to 

having a compliant entrance.  One is, as Erik mentioned, the 

slope of the entrance has to be 2 percent or less, which is 

nearly flat.  The second is that the clear opening width has 

to be two to three feet.  It might be 32 inches, but there's 

a number.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And the third thing is that there 

has to be a way for a person in a wheelchair to get into the 

building using hardware.   

          So the typical entries along the avenue don't have 

a space that you can place a wheelchair next to the door so 

you can open this is properly.  You can stay on the screen 

what that looks like on the lower right-hand corner. 

          However, there is an alternative that is

compliant, which is you put in a door operator with a button 

that is out on the face of the building -- you push the 

button, the door opens, and therefore you don't need that 

extra space.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So those are three aspects to it.   

I know a lot about this because I just restored some 1897 

historic storefronts, so that they were accessible and -- 

you know, the facts on this one are unclear, because of the 

slopes aren't --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- but my personal opinion is you 

can do something that requires only very minor modifications 

to the existing design and come up with a compliant 

entrance.  You know, you may have to mess with the grades, 

you may have to make the doors slightly wider.   

          I think Erik suggested that the recess could be 

slightly shallower to make the door wider.  I think it can 

be done, but, you know, if they don't want to do it, they're 

not going to do it.      

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right Tom, did you have -- 

yeah, a clarifying question?

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah, sorry, if we're finished 

with the door, I don't want to -- the format is a little 

awkward, because I actually had a question related to the 

rear access, and we zoomed out.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, yeah, you can go 

back to that.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So the exhibit that the 

petitioner rightfully -- thank you for putting it up -- was 

clarifying was good, because it actually was marked, 

"easement" right?  So the abutting property has a formal 

legal mechanism for people to walk on that property. 

          However, the petitioner then went on to say that 

there was a verbal agreement with the other property owner, 

and that doesn't feel right to me, especially under the 

10.43 criteria that means that we've got to make sure these 

things actually work, right? 

          So sorry to be a stickler, and I'm not the lawyer 

on the panel, but it seems like we need to get that squared 

away.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom, this is Hugh.  As I read the 

current application, they are not relying on the emergency 

28

exit to provide means of egress for the people who are in 

the shop.  I don't know what they're going to use -- what if 

anything, but by having only occupancy less than 49, they 

only need a single means of egress.  Is that your 

understanding of the way the code works?   

          ARISH HALANI:  That is correct.  That is noted on 

our application.  The reason we provided information about 

the rear was because the Planning Board requested it.  Hugh 

is absolutely correct; we do not intend to use the rear as 

an exit.  We will only use the front as a primary exit, 

given our code is under 49.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, at the same 

time I agree that the customers are not expected to use the 

rear, but the location of the bike storage and trash 

receptacles certainly indicates that that rear exit will be 

used by staff with some regularity.   

          ARISH HALANI:  We do not intend to use the rear, 

and actually we had a discussion to close the door for the 

next meeting and not show it, but since you guys requested 

to show the rear, we thought we'd give a full explanation.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          ARISH HALANI:  For the record, we do not intend to

use the rear for any reason.  All of the deliveries -- 

loading, bicycle, customers, employees, staff, will all come 

through the front.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  We 

still have several steps to go in this public hearing.  So 

we'll have more time for a Board discussion and further 

exploration of some of these issues that folks have been 

requesting information on. 

          But if there are any other kind of points of 

information, we can take those now, or we can move to public 

comment.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I have a quick one.      

          CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER:  All right.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  This is to the architects -- 

all three.  Does the egress to the basement of this building 

make a problem for that single egress to the front?  Also 

the gate in the rear that you spoke of, is this locked?  Is 

this access to this gate all the time?  What's the 

situation?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I'm not sure who is 

speaking on behalf of the applicants' architects here, but 

we are not hearing anybody at the moment.   

          ARISH HALANI:  It should be Erik or Aoiefa.  Erik, 

30

are you available?   

          ERIK GOULD:  Yeah, I'm here.   

          ARISH HALANI:  All right. 

          ERIK GOULD:  I don’t know if you can show the 

slide of the basement?   

on this presentation.   

          ARISH HALANI:  It should be in the plans, but not 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'll do this again if you want, and 

can you just give your name -- your full name for the 

record?   

          ERIK GOULD:  It's Erik Gould, Architect, Helicon 

Design Group.  On the plan set, we're showing the max exit 

distance -- means of egress distance from the basement -- as 

compliant.  It wouldn't be that sheet.  I think we an Egress 

Compliance Sheet.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Can you give me a sheet number?   

          ERIK GOULD:  Um--.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The Egress Compliance Sheet was not 

a part of the submission.  But if you want to speak to it, 

Erik. 

          ERIK GOULD:  I'm trying to recall the max distance

that we were showing on the plan set.  If I can provide that 

later, I'd appreciate it.  But we did review this with our 

code consultant, and we -- that's why the configuration is 

shown with the mechanical room demised as it is in the 

basement, because that's the max distance that we have. 

          Aoiefa, if you have that on your screen, you can 

text me the distance that we were looking at on that plan 

set? I don't want to get out of Zoom here and get onto my 

drawings, because I'm afraid I won't be able to get back.  

But --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          ERIK GOULD:  You know, we're considering it 

compliant in the configuration zone, for simple means of 

egress out onto Mass Ave.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Okay.  We 

can come back to that, Board members, while they look it up.  

We can do public comment, and then if we can get an answer 

to that question later, that seems like it would work best. 

          So if no Board members have additional questions, 

we can move onto public comment.  Okay?  So, again, this is 

a public hearing.  So any members of the public who wish to 

speak, you should now be able to click the button that says,

"Raise hand." Or if you're calling in by phone, you raise 

your hand by pressing *9. 

          Because this is a continued hearing, we ask you to 

focus your comments on new materials that have been 

presented at this meeting. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, we received written 

communications from the following individuals: Matthew 

Starr, Michael Pagliarini and Pamela Rawlston, Cathleen 

Gallery, Jatinder Pabla, Jeffrey Wang, Rob Chalpin, Marie 

Taylor, John L. Clark, Jr.; Erin Angela Sawyer, Dallas 

Foster, Paul Gulderman, John Rassler, and Rick McLaughlin 

[all names phonetic].   

          Prior to the first hearing, we'd also received 

written communications from Tony L. Hill, Nick Gustopolous, 

David Wheelan, Patrice and Margaret Higginet [all names 

phonetic], and a petition by a group identifying as mental 

health professionals practicing at 1677, 1679, 1696, 1734 

and 1753 Mass Ave. 

          Any additional communications received after 5:00 

p.m. yesterday will be entered into the case file.   

          So now we're going to check hands here.  So it 

looks like we have one speaker with their hand up.  We'll

now have staff unmute speakers one at a time.   

          When you're unmuted, please begin by saying your 

name and address.  Staff will confirm that we can hear you.  

And after that, you will have up to three minutes to speak, 

before I ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair -- this is 

Jeff Roberts again with staff.  I'll be working the 

controls.  I apologize if I don't say your name right, but 

you will have the opportunity to say your name, spell your 

name so that we have it for the record, and give your 

address.  And after you do that, I'll confirm that we can 

hear you so that you can proceed. 

          So the first name that we have, Carl Biancucci, 

can you start by saying your name, spelling your name and 

giving your address?   

          CARL BIANCUCCI:  Good evening.  My name is Carl 

Biancucci -- Carl with a C -- last name B-i-a-n-c-u-c-c-i 

from Arlington, Massachusetts.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  We can hear you.  You 

can go ahead.     

          CARL BIANCUCCI:  Great.  I'm hoping this is the 

appropriate time to speak in terms of my preference for the

current tenant -- Stereo Jack's Record Store.   

          I've been going to Jack's for over 30 years, and I 

appreciate not only the great service, but the fact that he 

keeps a storied music alive.   

          The store is always full.  The staff is very 

knowledgeable.  It's a fun place to go, and it has a 

community atmosphere to it.  And I just wanted to let you 

know that I oppose the forthcoming plan, and hope you would 

consider that the landlord keep Stereo Jack's at that 

address.  Thank you very much.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next hand -- there was another 

hand raised -- the name is Mark Gottlieb, can you start by 

giving your name, spelling your name, and giving your 

address?   

          MARK GOTTLIEB: Yes, Mark with a k Gottlieb; G-o-t-

t-l-i-e-b, and I'm at 43 Loomis Street in Cambridge.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  You can proceed.         

          MARK GOTTLIEB: Like the previous speaker, I want 

to oppose this proposal in favor of the current tenant.  I 

think the elimination of Stereo Jack's in order to make room 

for the Budega proposal would diminish the cultural

landscape of Cambridge.   

          And there are surely other locations that could 

work for this proposed dispensary without snuffing out a 38-

year-old Cambridge institution and an important landmark 

between Harvard and Porter Square. 

          Stereo Jack's has been on Mass Ave since I moved 

to Cambridge back in 1989.  It's always offered an 

extraordinary assortment of historic music, expertly curated 

by an incredibly knowledgeable and very friendly staff. 

          Current hit music and fads have never mattered to 

the customers of Stereo Jack's, but if one is seeking rare 

historic or sometimes even playing weird records from the 

past, a trip to Stereo Jack's is always a treat, and there's 

always a number of customers in there sharing their 

enthusiasm for a variety of music. 

          There's no record store quite like it in Cambridge 

or elsewhere for that matter. 

          In addition, as a fixture on Mass Ave, the window 

display at Stereo Jack's has always been an entertaining 

work of popular art that helps to imbue the retail 

neighborhood with Cambridge character.   

          I think the applicant's proposal is -- you know, 

36

basically inoffensive.  It's rather bland, and it could 

surely be placed at another site without elimination of the 

rich history and character of Stereo Jack's.  And I hope 

that that utility can be the result of this process.  Thank 

you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Are there 

any other members of the public who want to be heard on this 

matter?  If so, please again hit "Raise hand," the "Raise 

hand" button or *9 if you're calling in by phone, "Raise 

hand." 

          [Pause]  

          All right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I see another hand raised, to the 

Chair.  The name is Nick Ristopholos (phonetic), and you can 

unmute yourself and speak now.  Please start by giving your 

name, spelling your name and giving your address.   

          NICK RISTOPHOLOS:  Hello, this is Nick 

Ristopholos, and I'm an attorney for 1688 Massachusetts 

Avenue, the direct abutter.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, we can hear you, you can go 

ahead.

need to repeat myself, however.  My name is Nick 

Ristopholos, and I'm an attorney for the direct abutter to 

1686 Massachusetts Ave, where Temple Bar is located.  I have 

directly pointed out that there is no agreement that 

currently exists for rear access onto 10 Bowdoin Street, 

that is a patent lie. 

          There is no easement on record at the Middlesex 

Registry of Deeds.  So the Board needs to review where is 

this easement?  If such an easement exists, it must have to 

be recorded. 

          The 10 Bowdoin Street Condominium does not reflect 

any sort of easement to a tenement at 1686 Mass Ave, the 

proposed site for Budega. 

          Additionally, a verbal agreement with 1682 Mass 

Ave is legally insufficient to grant any sort of temporary 

or permanent access to enter onto that property.        

          Additionally, lastly, I need to address the fact 

that, you know, they will be infringing upon our patio, and 

the first thing they've now proposed to put that door closer 

to Temple Bar and its patio, I mean, it's patently evident 

that that will inevitably interfere. 

          So I think the Board has to do its research here 

38

and -- because there is no easement on record.  The current, 

you know, I submitted a note.   

          The current owner of 1686 Mass Ave does not have 

and has never had any sort of agreement.  So I think you 

need to look at this closely, because there is no rear 

access.   

          And that would automatically eliminate it by 

virtue of the ordinance for legal requirements from there 

being an actual granting of a special permit application. 

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you 

very much. Is there anyone else who wishes to be heard on 

this matter?  Okay.  Then --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I saw a hand coming --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, there we go.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Just at the last minute.  And again 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I didn't say, "sold."  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And again, for people who are maybe 

watching and wondering what to do, you can hit the "Raise 

hand" function at any time, and it will put everyone in 

--   

All right.   

order.

          But the name that I see is Matthew Starr.  I've 

just allowed you to talk.  You can unmute yourself.  Start 

by saying your name, spelling your name and giving your 

address.  I'll confirm we can hear you.     

          MATTHEW STARR:  My name is Matthew Starr.  Can you 

hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.     

          MATTHEW STARR:  M-a-t-t-h-e-w S-t-a-r-r.  I live 

at 11 Hallman Road, Melrose, Massachusetts; and I have been 

the manager of Stereo Jack's, the current occupant of 1686 

Mass Ave for 37 years, so I know the building very well.   

          And if they do indeed need rear access, that rear 

access -- Mr. Halani makes it sound like it's an easy stroll 

down that path, but it is an even up, down obstructed to 26 

inches, which does not meet any guidelines. 

          There is a kind of roof overhang at 65 inches, 

which violates Mass Egress Code 1010.5.2, and there are 

numerous other code infractions that makes that exit no a 

legal fire egress.   

          But more importantly, at the last meeting on 

December 10, the Board recommended a parking plan.  And I 

don't see in any of the revised narrative any kind of 

40

parking plan.  All I see for a parking plan is in the 

footnote to the dimensional form chart that the Halanis have 

submitted. 

          In the tiniest possible illegible print it says, 

"A small business that requires four or fewer spaces the 

applicant seeks an exemption from off-street parking." 

          Now, since when does a 35 to 49 occupant building 

require four or less spaces?  So they are violating the 

recommendation of the Board to present a parking plan.  They 

have completely ignored it.   

          They also, as I recall at the December 10 meeting, 

promised the Board a bike rack for employees to cut down on 

traffic, and yet they have reneged on this plan in the same 

footnote to the dimensional form chart. 

          In minute, barely legible print it says, "The 

bicycle parking and -- " excuse me, they also apply for an 

exemption from supplying bicycle parking in fine print, 

which of course they promised the Board that they would 

supply bicycle parking at the previous meeting; one of the 

other major issues.   

          And finally, the Special Permit Requirement 11.80 

says that "Loading, refuse and service areas must be

shielded from abutting use," and yet Mr. Halani has said 

everything's going in and out the front door because the 

back door is unusable.  So that is a violation of special 

permit code there as well. 

          So I hope the Board will -- and plus I have 

submitted a written statement with additional code 

infractions that I hope the Board will review before 

granting a permit.  Thank you very much.     

          DANIEL KLASNIC:  Okay.  Are there any other 

members of the public who wish to be heard on this matter?  

          [Pause] 

          Yep?  We have another one, Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I do.  I see it's Derek Kopon.  

Please, I've allowed you to talk.  You can unmute yourself, 

give your name, spell your name and give your address.

you can proceed.       

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  We can hear you, Derek, 

          DEREK KOPON:  Thanks.  So at the last hearing, 

myself and many, many of my neighbors and many medical 

health professionals who work in the neighborhood talk about

our concerns about the public health menace that this 

facility would pose to our children and, you know, our 

families. 

          And I can't speak for others, but for me this is 

our greatest concern.  There is a reason why statewide 

there's a 500-foot buffer zone between schools and pot 

shops.  It's not because it's not a threat to children, it's 

because it is a threat to children.  Otherwise, there would 

be no buffer zone.   

          Now in the zoning, the Cambridge City Council 

reduced that buffer zone, I believe it's from 500 feet to 

300 feet, or 0 with Planning Board approval.  And I would 

point out that a lot of the Council members who voted for 

that change take a lot of money from cannabis organizations.  

So it seems quite biased. 

          And to my knowledge, there's been no public health 

professionals testifying that that's a good idea, and quite 

a few public health professionals testifying that that's a 

bad idea. 

          So at the last hearing, all of us said all these 

things, and none of the Planning Board members addressed 

these concerns, and they seemed to be very dismissive and

glossed over it.   

          Now, this location is right in the middle of a 

triangle -- I believe between three schools, barely away 

from 300 feet from any of those.  It's right next to 

playground, it's right next to ice cream shops.   

          This is a neighborhood where people have children.  

I have a young child, and I am concerned about his well-

being.  So I'd like to hear these concerns addressed, 

please.  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Are there 

any further comments from members of the public?     

          All right.  Seeing none, I will turn it back -- 

bring it back to Board members. Do Board members have 

questions for staff?  We have received memos both from 

Community Development and Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation on this proposal, albeit some time ago.  We 

do have staff members from both departments here, if there 

are questions for either of them.             

          [Pause]  

          I'm going to ask Erik Thorkildsen can you talk 

some about the conversations that you have had with the 

applicant about the design, and in particular the façade and 

44

22

what kinds of solutions you've discussed and what the 

receptiveness, or what the response has been?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  Let's see, I've got some 

notes here.  I'm just picking out the right part.  We met in 

March with the applicant, and went over what they're 

proposing.   

          They told us that the knee wall marble -- you 

know, the lower, say I don't know 28 inches or so, is in bad 

shape.  Some of it's broken and dislodged. 

          I went out actually this morning and looked, and 

that's correct.  They said it would be difficult to repair 

and restore, and that's part of the reason why they're 

proposing to replace the entire façade.   

          In addition, some of the mullions are a bit beat 

up, including the two small corner covers are missing.  Let 

me just put this in a little bit more context.  The -- 

although it's showing its age, the existing façade is 

actually quite appealing -- the combination of the very slim 

vertical aluminum mullions with the dark green marble. 

          And there are several other façades along this 

same block that have the same basic system.  Some of them 

are in better shape than others, but they have the old 

45

22

aluminum mullions which have more interesting and narrower 

profiles than you typically get today. 

          So in other words, this façade is actually part of 

a pattern that runs along the block.  And I think that's a 

big significant in terms of, you know, your experience of 

the street front. 

          And so, we and the Planning Board have both 

commented that it would be preferable to keep the façade, 

restoring it and repairing it as is needed, and that in any 

case, even if that can't be done, it would be good if the 

entry door was recessed.  And they now have recessed it, 

instead of being flat across the front. 

          However, it would be -- you talked about various 

things you could do to avoid replacing the door or changing 

the façade, just replace the door.  Really, we'd only have 

to either address the door itself, motorized button, or 

maybe just change the tapered area -- the tapered recess 

area.   

          But anyway, back to discussions.  So the -- in 

that meeting, the applicant proposed to replace the façade, 

incorporating a knee wall, perhaps of marble.  The current 

drawings say, "stone cladding."  They said they would look 

46

22

at using mullions with a more interesting profile than the 

typical contemporary system, but the current drawings in the 

set don't show me details. 

          They did respond to the request that we made at 

that time that if this façade can't be kept, that the door 

be recessed, which seems like a really good thing. 

          So basically the solution to replace the entire 

façade -- the fenestration part, the shopfront part -- seems 

an okay solution if the existing façade really can't be 

restored.  But we haven’t really heard a really convincing 

argument that it can't be restored. 

          In any case, if the façade -- if the storefront is 

to be replaced, we would like to review materials, colors, 

details as they are developed.  So that's sort of the 

summary of where -- you know, the history of it, since you 

last met.  And -- yeah.  It could be fixed I think, but it's 

a more fiddly job, we understand that.   

          On the other hand, it might save money also.  It 

would be nice to -- the sense of history that you get in a 

city I think is really important -- that the city endures 

over time, and you have connections to people that aren't 

even here anymore.  And so, there's some value to that, I 

47

think.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Do Board 

members have questions for Erik?    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep, go ahead.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I don't recall whether it was 

Board members who suggested it, or whether staff suggested 

it, but I'm not clear on why there's an elimination of 

artwork from the façade -- certainly, at least partway up 

from the ground, since basically what you'll see if you're 

passing by is people standing in the vestibule, as it were, 

or the holding area, waiting to go inside.   

          And wouldn't it be preferable to have some sort of 

artwork, or some sort of design on the windows to at least 

make it a little more attractive?   

          I mean, I realize we've got other stores in the 

block that are just retail stores and people come and go.  

But I don't understand why artwork was viewed as a negative.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Erik, did you have 

any conversations with the applicant about that?   

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  I don't remember talking about 

that.  I think the issue was it probably in the first-floor

round there was the idea of having something on the glass 

that would obscure vision into the waiting room, and that 

seems not to be necessary, because there's the second wall 

back there that hides the actual merchandise. 

          I think we did probably point out that those -- in 

effect, those two bay windows that you have on either side 

of the existing doorway form really great places for some 

sort of display, as used by Stereo Jack's. 

          And so, that seems another plus in keeping the 

existing façade, although it's intruding into the useable 

square footage within the store.   

          As I'm looking at this plan, there's also -- the 

question of really we're going to be looking through these 

large plate glass windows, or whatever they are, into what 

could be a sort of boring room with a bunch of people 

standing around.   

the display. 

          So it's really as though that back wall of the 

waiting area is important because it sort of almost becomes 

          And so, I'm not sure how far the Planning Board 

can go into what do lobbies look like within buildings, but 

it does seem to be an issue that could be a real increase in

space and quite beautiful, or it could be sort of boring.   

          And some of the other cannabis establishments that 

we've -- that have come before us actually do talk this -- 

you know, designs painting murals and so on on the interior 

of the vestibule.  So I think it's a good question to raise.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yep.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  All right, 

Adam Shulman, can you speak on behalf of Traffic and Parking 

to what conversations had been had with the applicant about 

queuing, line management, and any parking -- bike or auto --  

that has been discussed?   

          ALLAN SADUN:  Yes, Thank you, Madam Chair.  This 

is Adam Shulman, S-h-u-l-m-a-n from the Cambridge Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation Department.   

          So just to remind the Board, the Traffic 

Department did submit a comment letter last October, and our 

comments really haven't changed since that, I'd say except 

for one change I'd say is that in that memo we had 

recommended the applicant try to provide some long-term bike 

parking for employees on on-site on the first floor. 

          And I think because -- and I think the original 

50

plan had some long-term bike parking in the basement, which 

was not as accessible, having to go up and down the steps 

with the bikes. 

          So that, as was presented today, that has changed.  

They're now proposing two bike spaces in the rear of the 

store for employees.  So that's a positive change. 

          The other comments have pretty much been 

consistent in our letter.  Regarding queuing, sidewalk 

queuing:  That was one of the comments or concerns we've 

raised in our letter, which is consistent with all the other 

cannabis retail stores that we've seen is none of us want to 

see a line of people in public out at the store onto the 

public sidewalk.  That wouldn't -- you know, there would be 

a concern, it would block the public sidewalk, have 

conflicts with people. 

          And so, we -- my understanding is the applicant 

has talked about having -- as most of them have -- talked 

about having, like, appointment-only type of an operation 

or, sort of a like restaurant type of a thing, where you go 

and you put your name in and you get a buzzer, or you give 

them your cell phone and they buzz you when you can come. 

          So they've talked about doing something like that.

22

So I think that tends to be the way most of these places 

want to go, especially in the interim in the short term, 

because with the few cannabis retail stores that have opened 

up -- say the one in Brookline, Massachusetts, there have 

been problems with lines of people waiting outside. 

          You know, everyone tends to think that those 

issues will become less of a problem as more and more 

cannabis retail stores open up, and more people have more 

choices to go, and there shouldn't be as many lines.  There 

shouldn't be any lines, hopefully.   

          And certainly, the Traffic Department and the City 

of Cambridge and I'm sure the Police Department wouldn't 

want to see any lines on the public sidewalk. 

          So, you know, it would be those kind of management 

-- those commitments by the applicant to really manage their 

patrons to not cause lines -- any lines -- out on the public 

sidewalk.  They do show in their plans how they can queue up 

people -- a certain number of people inside their store.   

          And the other thing is, the other key issue is 

making sure there is also no drop off/pickup type activity 

for this, because this site has a bike -- there's a bike 

lane right in front of this site.

          It has a curb extension, so it has sort of a wide, 

slightly wider sidewalk in front of this site, and then 

there's a bicycle lane, a travel lane.  So there's no place 

for any vehicles to stop, to drop off or pick up people, 

other than stopping illegally and unsafely in the bicycle 

lane. 

          And so, that's been also a concern that we've 

raised on other cannabis retail store applications, and 

we've raised again here, and that really will require 

management by the property owner or by the attendant to make 

sure that doesn't happen, and providing really good 

information to customers that they cannot do that, and 

making sure that they come by preferably sustainable modes 

of transportation like walking, biking, taking transit. 

          And that goes to the question about parking 

spaces.  This project is seeking approval from the Planning 

Board to have zero parking spaces.  Essentially believe -- 

and maybe Jeff Roberts will correct me if I'm wrong, I think 

I believe that the way that the zoning is is that the 

Planning Board gets to decide whether or not the project 

needs parking or not.   

          And so, this project is in their application 

53

asking for zero parking spaces, which is more of why it's so 

important that they get their customers to come by public 

transportation, walking or biking for public transportation. 

          They did do a logistics plan that was provided in 

the application, and they did include a parking plan.  They 

did say in the parking plan, I believe, that they expect to 

have some parking needs -- some people, some customers that 

will come by car.  And they're expecting that those people 

will have to use street parking, because they will not have 

any parking of their own. 

          And so, I would just say that's a decision for the 

applicant, really, to decide whether or not this is the 

right place or the right location to serve their customers 

if they think they're going to have customers only coming by 

car or have customers that need parking and they don't have 

parking of their own and this might -- you know, that's 

their choice as to whether they pick this place or not. 

          But this is a -- what we have here is an existing 

retail store with no parking on site to it being asked to be 

changed to another retail store with no parking on site.   

          And so, I think it's -- you know, up that the 

Planning Board to think about if they feel comfortable with 

54

that, and ask the applicant more questions, if any they 

have, about parking.  And like I said, I think the Planning 

Board gets to decide if they feel that this project, you 

know, is okay with getting a special permit with the zero 

parking. 

          Lastly, just saying in our comment letter, we 

recommended a handful of transportation management measures, 

and those are things that are intended to help really 

encourage and support both employees and patrons to be able 

to visit the site, work at the site, without needing to use 

an automobile.   

          And I believe the applicant has agreed to all 

these measures, and there are things like providing transit 

pass subsidies to employees.   

          So providing free membership in the Bluebike 

network for employees, having the transportation coordinator 

who could help employees to work on alternative modes of 

transportation, and also help educate their customers about 

preferably coming by sustainable modes of transportation, 

that there is not parking here. 

          And it also includes monitoring  

          And then lastly, as we've recommended in the other

-- all the other cannabis retail stores -- is that we'd 

recommend that they contribute -- as a transportation 

mitigation we recommend a contribution, a one-time 

contribution to the city for $35,000 for cannabis -- new 

cannabis retail stores in the city for being an Economic 

Empowerment entity.   

          We've also been supportive of those funds being 

contributed in two phases; one half at building permit, and 

the remaining half at an occupancy permit, so that it's not 

all due at the -- you know, at the beginning. 

          So those are our -- that's summary of our 

comments.  Again, it hasn't really changed all that much 

from the original comment letter, and happy to answer any 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you so much.  

All right.  Do Board members have questions for Adam?  Let 

me see -- I'm not seeing any Board members with questions 

questions.    

for Adam.   

          So we can move to Board member discussion, and if 

you want to get clarification from the applicant on any of 

the points that have been brought up, you can do so when 

making your comments as well.

          Who wants to get us started?  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah, just three points.  I 

appreciate the comment that there's a maximum population of 

49 people here in this premises, which would mean only 

required doorway.   

          So the discussion around the rear exit is moot.  

If they need somehow 51 people in here, then I probably 

would not be in support of the proposal on those grounds, so 

that's point 1. 

          Point 2, I appreciate the comment about parking, 

that this is a successful -- as reported tonight, even in 

public comment -- a successful retail establishment which 

has no parking, and we're replacing it with a retail 

establishment with has no parking. 

          Sor relative to that issue, this Board member 

feels like the concerns have been addressed in the 

mitigation that Adam referenced in the bike storage that's 

been provided. 

          Lastly, I would like a little bit of discussion 

amongst all Board members relative to the effects on the 

abutting retail establishment.  We've got comments made 

publicly that raised some concerns about that.  That's very

hard for me to judge, you know, how this might affect the 

terrace next door.   

          The door, yes, has moved four or five feet closer 

to that terrace, but it's recessed.  It -- I can't really 

measure what the actual effects might be on the 

establishment next door.  I just want to make sure that the 

Board discusses that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you, 

Tom.  Who wants to share thoughts next?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I will remind Board 

members that I can't see you all at once.  So if you can 

also use the "Raise hand" button on the Zoom, that helps me 

out a lot.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  Following up on a lot of 

what Tom said, assuming the 49 takes it out of the area 

where they need more than the one access, then I don't have 

questions about the rear access, and I'm going with that.   

          With regard to parking, there are many, many other 

stores on the struts of Mass Avenue, many restaurants that 

do not have any parking.  And I think we've authorized a 

number of other marijuana facilities that are similar 

58

situations that don't have parking. 

          And so, I'm fine with the arrangements they have 

made to date, and we'll continue to work out with Traffic 

and Parking.  We've also been trying to eliminate parking 

wherever we can.   

          So I think promoting public transportation and 

bicycle riding -- pedestrian, it will be one more retail 

facility on this stretch of Mass Ave that deals with its 

clients.   

          Another issue that Tom didn't raise is yes, Stereo 

Jacks is a wonderful place.  It would wonderful if it could 

stay there, but I don't think that is within our 

jurisdiction.  But that is an issue between the landlord and 

the current tenant, and whether this goes in or doesn't go 

in -- whether Stereo Jacks stays or doesn't stay is not up 

to us.  It is really an issue for other people. 

          With regard to its location in the neighborhood, 

I'll remind you that Cambridge voted overwhelmingly in favor 

of marijuana facilities.  The City Council adopted an 

ordinance.  We've been using that throughout the city.   

          Similar questions have been raised about proximity 

to schools, but this complies in all aspects with the 

59

location issues.   

          And, you know, there people complained about 

Harvard Square, about Central Square, about Inman Square -- 

this is just another location where it seems perfectly 

appropriate to me. 

          With regard to impact on abutting property, I 

don't know that this is one facility better or worse than 

any other retail establishment that can go in there.  

Certainly, if they -- they're not supposed to -- under their 

own timeline, they're not going to go in for two years.   

          By that point in time, I don't know that any 

actual marijuana facility is opened yet in Cambridge.  I 

think several were scheduled to open before the pandemic 

hit.   

          But presumably by July 2022, there will be other 

facilities in Cambridge and other facilities in Somerville, 

and that the lines that have been shown in Brookline as 

being the only nearby facility will have dissipated.  This 

place intends to use appointment-only or a text and cell 

phone situation.   

          So I don't see that it is different really from 

any other retail facility.  And, you know, like Temple Bar.

But, you know, they've got outdoor seating on the public 

sidewalk.  I don't know that it's become their sidewalk, and 

that they have the right to -- you know, really impose their 

will upon their neighbors and any other retail facility that 

might go in. 

          If there is a problem with queuing, then I think, 

you know, we and Traffic and Parking will have to deal with 

it if it really becomes an issue.  But, you know, currently 

during the pandemic, people are queuing up outside a lot of 

facilities, because there are limitations on numbers of 

people who can go in. 

          Before the pandemic people lined up Outside 

Bagelsaurus every weekend for hours on end, and no one 

seemed to complain about that.  And I just think, you know, 

we all hope that every business will be successful and that 

more retail, you know, there would be more and more retail 

and fewer vacant stores.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Ted.  

Hugh?  I saw your hand next.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.  So I'm sort of torn 

between two possible outcomes.  One outcome is to say it's 

just not going to work at this location, and it's -- they're 

61

proposing a destruction of historic storefronts.  This is 

not the right place.   

          I think Ted makes some cogent arguments.  The only 

bone I would pick with him is that this use could be far 

more intense than Stereo Jack's in terms of the number of 

people at any given time.  I think I've only been in Stereo 

Jack's a couple of times, and I did not -- it was probably 

not on a peak hour.   

          But anyway, so the other side is to say okay, what 

can we do to make sure this fits in the neighborhood, and 

doesn't create big problems.   

          And I think we can do two things.  We can require 

them to basically restore the storefront, or if they cannot 

restore it, to rebuild it in the same configuration or -- 

you know, except for a few inches here and there, and so, 

that that preserves the street and the appearance.   

          I would note that on the question of the windows, 

in addition to the wall that's got the entry doors inside 

the vestibule, there's also a large wall on the left side 

that could have art work or something else on it.   

          And if the original design were kept, there could 

be -- you know, freestanding displays in the bay windows 

62

that could be artistic or educational or whatever. Can't be 

educational about marijuana, because the state doesn't allow 

it.   

          So the other piece that I think is critical really 

comes from the Traffic Department memorandum.  I mean, it's 

sort of kind of throwing up their hands saying, "There's no 

loading area, there's no dropoff place.  People are just 

going to block the bike lanes.  And they don't like it."  

          So I think what we can do is to require that the 

applicant use the appointment-only management process to 

limit the rate at which people come, the number of people 

who are there.  If there are five point-of-sale terminals, 

and there's space for 15 people at the queue, half of them 

in the existing lobby and half of them inside, it seems to 

me you don't need more than 15 people to serve point-of-sale 

terminals if you schedule them properly. 

          So I think we should require them to do the 

appointment-only operation.  If in a few years of operation 

they can demonstrate that that's no longer required, then 

that's fine.   

          But I think we have to start out at it's not a 

month, it's not six months, it's the operating mode that you 

63

have to prove that in some way based on the operations they 

have that condition relaxed. 

          So again, I'm a little torn as to which -- whether 

we would just say no, or do we say, "Yes, but here's the 

conditions."  

want to chime in next?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve, do you 

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure.  I'll be brief.  I've got 

a number of good points that have been made.  But, you know, 

the state and the city in its great wisdom have legalized 

these dispensaries, and with some detailed exceptions, they 

have asked us to treat it more or less like any other retail 

establishment.   

          So, again, we've raised, you know, a couple of 

legal issues here about access and some building code 

issues, but I think those issues should be treated in the 

ordinary course of business by other parties, rather than 

us.   

          I mean, it seems to me, at least from my 

perspective, that we should be fascinating primarily on the 

storefront, and the aesthetic appearance of this sort of 

establishment, just like any other retail establishment in 

64

the city. 

          And so, focusing on the storefront, I've -- you 

know, heard two issues.  Number 1, just the glass -- there 

are a number of other similar establishments where we have 

really focused on art, on the storefront and not just having 

a blank, you know, glass façade.   

          Now, some of them were a little different, because 

you could actually see what was going on inside, and here 

you can't really see it, you're only seeing the people in 

line.  But the principle I think is the same here.  So I 

think that some aesthetics, some art, should be required in 

the storefront, in order to make it attractive in the 

street. 

          The other façade issue that has been raised is the 

virtue of maintaining the existing semi-historic façade, 

versus removing that and replacing it.   

          And I'm not clear exactly where the application is 

on that, but I think that a that is an issue that staff 

should look further into, and make a clear and strong 

recommendation one way or the other, seek to retain and 

preserve the existing façade, or -- you know, are we okay 

losing that façade?

22

          But other than those two façade issues, I really 

don't have many concerns.  Good points have been made by the 

other members, but -- you know, we're getting into all sorts 

of details of the interior that we would not be focusing on 

if this were another sort of retail establishment. 

          So my biggest concerns -- as I say, are the 

aesthetics of the façade.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, just a couple of quick 

ones.  And I don't know who this should go to.  Will their 

occupancy permit be restricted to 49 people?  That's one 

question I have, considering that's what we're basing the 

egress on.   

          Also, I'm in agreement with you.  I think we 

should have the storefront with the central door, and 

possibly in the idea of artwork, maybe there's a shelf that 

will go around the inside of the bays, so they can put some 

kind of dormer on the windows, so they don't use up so much 

of their queuing space.  But original design really has 

something to offer, and this trend's kind of bland.   

          And those are really my two, but I really stress 

the storefront issue is a problem for me.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Let's see.  I 

don't see -- Niko, do you want to weigh in on this?   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sure.  I think it's fine.  I don't 

have any complaints with the application.  I think I would 

prefer not to impose conditions like requiring appointment-

only for a multi-year period.  That seems very excessive.   

          But otherwise, I think I agree with everything 

that Ted said.  This is not far from a liquor store.  We've 

permitted similar dispensaries around the city.  A lot of 

the complaints about dispensaries are similar, and I think 

at odds with the overwhelming vote in Cambridge for 

legalizing dispensaries.  So I think this is consistent with 

the overall purpose of the ordinance.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Very good.  So 

Hugh, I want to come back to you, since when last you spoke, 

you were torn.  Are you still torn, do you feel like with 

the appropriate conditions, you would be in support of 

granting the permit?   

          I'm hearing a lot of support for -- I believe -- 

from other Board members for granting the permit with some 

conditions, ranging from very few on Niko's end to quite 

substantial.  But I want to see if you're kind of in that

camp at this point?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think the part of a Board process 

that works so well is you hear what your colleagues have to 

say, which is -- so what I am hearing is there is no 

objection to this use at this location.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And therefore, I think therefore I 

need to focus on what are the conditions that need to be 

added, so that it will fit in properly, and therefore --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- be in support of the consensus 

of what the Board has come up with.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Yeah, I think 

that's what I'm hearing as well, is that -- you know, the 

Board has seen a great number of these applications 

throughout the city.   

          And the fact is that there are children in the 

city everywhere, and yeah, the state and the Council 

specified specifically what we were measuring from and what 

was outside that buffer zone, and if you're outside that 

buffer zone, then, you know, you don't need a special 

finding that you're not having that impact.

          We have applied that standard elsewhere in the 

city, and I think that is the appropriate standard to apply 

here.   

          In terms of the Traffic and Parking, I agree that 

I think, you know, if this were any other retail store, we 

would be fully in support of not requiring parking.   

          But at the same time, fully in support of needing 

to do all the transportation mitigation measures to ensure 

that it does have the smallest possible impact on the 

surrounding neighborhood -- both the other businesses and 

the residential neighbors. 

          I do think the point about dropoff and pickup is 

an important one.  This was also raised at several of the 

Central Square dispensary permits that we discussed.   

          And I believe that Traffic and Parking has worked 

with those applicants, and the major providers of 

ridesharing apps and drivers to create a geofence, so that 

people are being dropped off and picked up not in front of 

the door, but at an appropriate location where, say, it is 

possible to pick up and discharge passengers without 

interfering with traffic operations or endangering anyone. 

          I would look for the same kind of cooperation with 

69

Traffic and Parking here. 

          I'm torn on the façade.  And interestingly, the 

artwork is actually more challenging to me I think than the 

location or -- recessed or not -- of the door of the 

artwork.   

          We have fought so hard to get visibility into 

retail spaces and the signs of human activity within them, 

that and I felt like it was frankly a win for the city when 

it was determined by the Cannabis Control Board that we 

could -- if you couldn't see into the showroom, you could 

have transparent windows.   

          I think that -- I personally feel like the 

transparent windows where we can see people, even if all 

they're doing is standing in line, is a better situation for 

activity than even the nicest artwork. 

          I maybe in the minority on that, but that's -- I 

think of all the times we have tried and failed to convince 

other owners to keep their windows transparent, and I think 

that would be a lost opportunity here, to force them to put 

artwork in windows that could otherwise show that there are 

people in the boat.

it, Erik clearly expressed in his memo, and then again in 

his comments here, that from his perspective, this is part 

of a pattern of retail development along the Mass Ave 

corridor that has value, and is useful.   

          I think back to a similar issue we dealt with on a 

Santander Bank not that long ago on Mass Ave in Central 

Square, where they similarly had an ADA accessibility issue 

and wanted to transform the façade because of that.  We 

asked them to do better.   

          I think it's okay to ask retail stores, banks, 

cannabis or retailers -- all of those -- anyone doing 

substantial work to renovate their space to do better and 

help us preserve the elements that make our city unique. 

          So I would lean towards Erik's recommendation that 

the façade is preferably preserved as is.  That from my 

point of view can be achieved either by getting a variance 

from the Mass Architectural Accessibility Board or by, you 

know, making the necessary adjustments to it.  I don't know 

which of those is more realistic in this case.    

          I know I've gotten clients variances from the MAAB 

before.  So it is possible with the right application, but 

if it is not reasonable for this use in this location, then 

71

I think the architects on the Board have provided feedback 

of the minor changes that would be needed to meet those 

accessibility requirements. 

          I think its biggest impact would be on circulation 

in the vestibule, if they had to do that.  And I think that 

can be addressed by using an appointment queuing system, 

which has been mentioned, is desirable for a number of 

reasons, especially at the onset of the operation. 

          That's kind of where I am on this.  So do other 

Board members -- having heard everybody's had a chance to 

speak at least once, and we do kind of have a range on the 

kinds of mitigation and conditions we impose.  So Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Just quickly, I would second your 

well-spoken argument for transparency in the window, so the 

EC people there.  I think that's better.   

          And I've been accused of being a sentimentalist, 

but that's not why I would argue for keeping the historic 

fabric there.  I think -- been scratched and shows its age 

and has patina, it's part of that neighborhood, and I think 

we should ask the applicant to do better.   

          But other than that, I'm wholly in favor of the 

proposal beyond those [1:47:06 audio unclear]

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other comments, 

thoughts from Board members?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Um--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou, you've muted 

yourself.    

          [Pause]  

          Lou?  Can't hear you.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  There you go.  Oh, 

no, you just turned it off again.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  My hand holding up and mute 

button are close.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ah, there you go.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The location seems fine, the 

use seems fine, the TDM measures I think are well thought 

out and will be adequate.  My only sticking point is the 

façade, the storefront.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'd like to see some effort 

put into maintaining the original, or recreating in like 

kind.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I think it actually works in 

both ways.  If you put the two bays on it, and provide some 

kind of a shelving or, you know, maybe 12 inches on the 

window side, it allows for some artwork or some kind of 

interest in the windows also.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That's it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah.  I think the only thing I 

would say, if it's not an enormous issue what we put in the 

windows.  

          I understand the contrary points raised by some of 

the others.  But you know, if all we're going to do is look 

through the window and see people standing in line, I mean, 

you know, it might as well be an unemployment line during  

the coronavirus.   

          It's nothing I think dynamic or exciting or saying 

anything about community.  You know, frankly I'd rather see 

the product and all sorts of marijuana in the window, but I 

don't think that we're allowed to do that. 

          So I -- you know, it's not a huge point, but I 

would rather see something aesthetically pleasing in the

window.  I'm not talking about covering the entire window, 

so we can't see anything, but, you know, I think some sort 

of art in the window would be good. 

          You know, and the other issue, again, as I say, is 

the storefront.  I wish we could retain the historic 

storefront.  But that's a complex thing of construction 

issues and code issues and access issues. 

          You know, I don't want them to go crazy to do 

this, but it seems to me that staff ought to be able to 

evaluate this issue and determine whether there is a 

reasonable solution -- and if so, to require that reasonable 

solution.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Several of you have left your hands up.  So I'm not sure if 

you still want to be heard, or if you've just left your 

hands up.  I'm seeing Lou, Steve and Hugh still all -- there 

we go. 

          All right, maybe at this point we could hear from 

the applicant.  Mr. Halani, do you want to weigh in on what 

you're hearing from the Board?  I think you're hearing 

pretty strong support for preserving that façade to the best 

of your ability, and this Board member would like to know if

that is something you are open to?   

          ARISH HALANI:  I'm going to briefly comment.  I'm 

also going to give an opportunity for Sohail to comment.  He 

was a part of these discussions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.   

          ARISH HALANI:  We are open to it.  I think one of 

the reasons why we decided that the storefront we have is in 

regards to compliance in addition, in order -- in regards to 

the CCC regulations for handicap accessibility. 

          And then lastly, the preservation of the marble.  

I have pictures that I have shared with Erik, and I think he 

mentioned this in his comment, that they are very cracked 

and broken.   

          So they will be extremely difficult to preserve.  

And if we compare the façade as it is today versus as it is 

proposed, I think the only change we've done is move the 

door.  And we really tried to keep that same green marble on 

that storefront. 

          So we are open.  I think that it's just, like, as 

one of the Board member mentions, there will be several 

variations of approvals in addition city and state, to make 

sure it gets there.  But, you know, we are willing to go

through that, if that is a condition of ours.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Yeah.  I think 

what I have heard from the Board member -- and then I'll 

turn it back over to the applicant, because you indicated 

you wanted someone else to speak on this as well, is that 

this moving of the door is significant.   

          It is -- you know, the pattern of where the doors 

are located in these façade is something that is an 

important part of the pattern in this neighborhood.   

          And while that might not seem like a significant 

move to you, it is something that matters to the Board.  So 

I think what I'm hearing is that we would like you to make 

those efforts, understanding that you may come back to use 

after some effort and say the various other permitting 

authorities will not let us do what you've asked us to do, 

and we would like you to find that us proceeding with those 

as permitted is consistent with your permit. 

          That is something that this Board has done before 

and can, but that -- keeping the door in the center I think, 

and recessed, is going to be important to this Board that 

you try.   

          But you said you had someone else we should hear 

77

from.  So let me turn that back to you.   

          ARISH HALANI:  I think it's okay.  I'm actually 

communicating there, they don't want to make a comment.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          ARISH HALANI:  But just in response, yes, we're 

willing to explore that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          ARISH HALANI:  And yeah, we can definitely do it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think from a historic point of 

view, preserving the original fabric is what you're supposed 

to do.  In this case, we're really talking about the design.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- rather than, we're not the 

Historic Commission.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Planning Board.  And so, I think if 

you -- even if every piece of that façade is brand new, if 

it looks like it looks today, just fixed up, I would be very 

satisfied.  I think we will have accomplished what we need 

to accomplish, and I just don't think that that's a -- 

something that cannot be accomplished.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I would agree with you and just 

mention that recreating the existing façade will be easier 

on us as an applicant than attempting to preserve it, and we 

would be happy to do that.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  That's helpful 

to know.  It sounds like while the Board would like you to 

certainly explore the preservation; as Hugh rightly notes, 

we're not the Historic Commission, and we do not have that 

kind of specificity in the things we look at.   

          And I agree with you that if we maintain the shape 

and fabric of the layout of that façade, we will have done 

what we are charged with doing in terms of how the street 

works, in this case.  Okay. 

          So I think that addresses I think the façade 

question.  I would propose in terms of artwork versus 

transparency.  It sounds like all the Board members are for 

attractive but not opaque artwork being visible in the 

windows.   

          You can -- if we can still see into the vestibule 

and see that there are people around in there when there are 

-- but that there is an attractive window display as well,

22

that seems to be kind of the best of all worlds, where we do 

see that there's activity, even if it is just standing in 

line -- but that we can -- no one, including myself, objects 

to there being attractive displays in the window that don't 

obscure the windows entirely.   

          ARISH HALANI:  That was our original intention, 

and we'd be happy to do that again.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          ARISH HALANI:  We wanted artwork to begin with, so 

we'd be happy to --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great, okay.  Then I 

think the only operational issues that the Board has raised 

are about the drop off and pickup, and the appointment-only 

period.   

          And I would suggest that here it is appropriate 

for the applicant to work with Traffic and Parking on those, 

and give Traffic and Parking the staff level review to tweak 

the length as necessary, but also to help with -- like I 

said, the geofencing, but really to treat it in the same way 

that we have treated other applicants. 

          Do any Board members object to that?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Excellent.  

Then, I think -- I'm checking my notes here.  Staff has 

helpfully -- when I can't make eye contact with the staff 

all the time to make sure I'm doing it right, I have to look 

at my notes that they prepare for me on what I'm supposed to 

do. 

          Okay.  So we've had additional questions.  We've 

had discussion.  I think then the next thing that I want to 

do is ask if there's any objection to closing public comment 

at this time.   

          Do any Board members object to me doing that?  All 

right.  Seeing and hearing no objection, I'm going to -- the 

public comment is closed on this matter, but any written 

communications will be entered into the case file.   

          All right.  Then are we prepared to take action on 

this matter?  In which case, I believe what I'm hearing from 

the Board is that we're looking at a motion to grant the 

special permit with the conditions discussed, having found 

that the proposal conforms to the applicable criteria in the 

zoning ordinance.   

          And so, the conditions would be those listed in 

the Community Development memo, the Traffic and Parking

memo, and those we have just discussed as a Board.  And 

before I have somebody make that motion, let me just pause 

here and ask. 

cover?   

          Jeff, did I cover everything I'm supposed to 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  And I 

would just note that that is -- I think that is where the 

Board is at right now.  So the decision is whether to make a 

motion to grant the special permit.   

          I would advise the Board to state the criteria for 

the -- or the special permit criteria for the record, and 

just make affirmative findings that the proposal meet those 

criteria, and then just take a moment. 

          And we can help too to try to fill in and make 

sure we have all of the conditions, so that we can make sure 

that the written decision reflects all of those conditions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So I am 

pulling up the criteria here, which staff has provided on 

the webpage.  So if any of you are looking to follow along 

on that, there is under, "City Staff Documents" the Planning 

Board criteria. 

          So in granting the permit, we would need to make a

finding that this is located in one of the applicable 

districts or a BA-1 District only if it is designated by the 

Cannabis Control Commission as an Economic Empowerment 

applicant, or is qualifying for the Social Equity program.   

          Jeff, what district is this, remind me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, this is located in Business 

A-2 which is one of the districts that's listed here.  And 

these -- the zoning requirements that we put in the summary 

of conditions, those are all -- those specific criteria that 

the kind of objective criteria, are laid out in the CDD 

memo.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I think you could make a finding 

based on that that the proposal is in conformance with those 

zoning requirements, and then move to finding whether it 

meets the criteria that the Planning Board needs to 

evaluate.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Got it.  

Okay.  So it is in compliance, it is in one of the 

applicable zoning districts in a permanent building, not 

within 1800 feet of another cannabis retail store, not 

within 300 feet of an existing public or private K-12 school

or 300 feet of a public children's playground with an 

athletic field or youth recreational facility, and that no 

packaging or repackaging of products will occur on site.   

          So then, so given that it meets those -- as you 

say, Jeff, objective criteria, then we look at the specific 

criteria that the Planning Board needs to evaluate. 

          Can we make a finding that the site design 

provides convenient, safe and secure access and egress for 

clients and employees arriving to and leaving from the site, 

using all modes of transportation, including drivers 

pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation users, 

given the conditions that we have discussed tonight. 

          If Board members -- since I can't just have you 

guys nod when we're doing it this way, if Board members 

could verbally say your name and say yes or no to that 

finding, that would be fine.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steve, yes.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes, Tom.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis, yes.         

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.

          [All vote YES]    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  The 

location and design of cannabis use will not detract from 

the sense of activity with opaque, unwelcoming façade at 

ground level -- at the ground-floor in retail areas.  And 

again, that's with the conditions we've discussed.  Can we 

make that finding?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steve, yes.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom, yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh, yes.    

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Lou, yes.            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think there's a condition for 

additional staff review that would --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.  That is part of 

the memo from staff, but affirming that there will be 

ongoing staff review as appropriate.  Okay.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Niko, yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Niko.  I 

then heard all Board members say yes, we can make that 

finding as well.   

          Loading, refuse and service areas are designed to 

85

be secure and shielded from abutting uses.  Again, all of 

the loading, refuse and service is going in and out the 

front door.   

          So it -- again, will need to be managed in the 

ways that all the other retail areas that go in and out 

their front door need to, but that that will be part of 

their operational plan that they will work on with the 

various city departments prior to opening. 

          Given that, do Board members feel we can make that 

finding?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh, yes.     

          COLLECTIVE:  Yes.   

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom, yes.               

          [All vote YES]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  My apologies for 

that, Cathy.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  To the Chair -- this is Jeff, and 

I'll just make a suggestion that might be time-saving --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We like that.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- if the Board entertains it.  You 

could, you know, read the findings and ask if Board members 

have any particular objection or any particular qualifying

comments they want to make to the finding, and then we could 

move through, and as Tom suggested, just take a vote on the 

whole set.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you for 

that.  We're all still finding our way through this and 

trying to be efficient, while still making sure the record 

reflects everything it needs to.  So thank you all for 

bearing with me and providing on the fly advice when I need 

it. 

          So I will do that.  I will go through -- there are 

only two more conditions.  I'll go through those, and then 

ask Board members if there are any additional qualifying 

comments or conditions we need to add, and then we can -- 

and then I'll entertain a motion to make the -- to grant the 

permit, based on those findings with the conditions 

contained in the CDD and Traffic and Parking memos, and 

those we've discussed tonight. 

          So the two other findings are that the building 

and Site Design -- building and site are designed -- excuse 

me -- to be compatible with other buildings in the area, to 

mitigate any negative aesthetic impacts that might result 

from required security measures and restrictions on

visibility into the building's interior, which has been the 

kind of focus of our discussion on the façade. 

          And that the facility will provide programs to 

assist qualifying patients in obtaining services under the 

Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana program. 

          Mr. Halani, I don't think we've addressed that 

tonight, and I apologize, but I don't recall if you have 

spoken to that previously.  Do you have a plan for directing 

folks who qualify for medical marijuana on where they could 

obtain such a product?   

          ARISH HALANI:  Yes.  We have -- we will be 

accepting all qualifying patients.  That's not something --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  So 

given those findings, and what we've discussed tonight, does 

someone want to make a motion -- please state your name when 

you do -- to grant the special permit?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Based on the findings that the 

Board has made, I would move that we grant the special 

permit, with the conditions also as detailed in our 

discussion and recorded by staff and the stenographer.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Moved.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So I 

heard Tom made the motion, and I heard Lou second.  Jeff, I 

believe now I can turn it back over to you for an actual 

roll call vote.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, this is Jeff.  And I'll do the 

roll call.  So this is the motion to grant the special 

permit with conditions.  Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  H Theodore Cohen?       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  Do we also have to note 

that -- make findings that it's in accordance with Section 

10.43, the General Special Permit Requirements, which I 

think we all know and could easily find?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's an excellent 

point.  So going back to Tom, who made the motion, Tom, 

would you entertain an amendment?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Absolutely.  Absolutely I'll 

entertain an amendment, this is Tom.  We'll add the criteria 

to Section 10.43.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Lou, second.    

89

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Then 

Jeff, let's start that roll call again.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I will begin that again.  So on the 

motion to make the findings that are in the 11.800, as well 

as the findings 10.43 with the conditions that have been 

discussed and granting the special permit, this is Louis 

Bacci, Jr.:       

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  H Theodore Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steven Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Nikolas Bowie?                      

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Catherine Preston Connolly?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.             

          [All vote YES]   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's seven members voting in

favor.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you 

all very much.  So that concludes the business on our 

agenda.  Are there any additional comments from staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Not many at this time.  Good job 

with this hearing.  There is a reason we only scheduled one 

hearing for this first one.  And again, as a reminder, we 

have two public hearings scheduled for next week.  So thank 

you to all the Board members.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Jeff. And 

to the whole CDD and Traffic and Parking team as well, I 

appreciate everyone helping us through the first one of 

these that we've done remotely, where we've actually had to 

have a full, formal public hearing and vote on a permit.   

          Do Board members have anything to add before we 

adjourn?  Nope? Seeing none, seeing no hands, okay then, we 

are adjourned.  Thank you all very much.       

COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.
