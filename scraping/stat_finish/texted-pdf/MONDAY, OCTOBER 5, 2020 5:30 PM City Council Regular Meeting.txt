To The Honorable, the City Council: 
 
The establishment of the FY21 property tax rate by the Board of Assessors, subject to the approval 
of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, is the final step in the fiscal process that begins in 
the spring with the submission of the annual budget to the City Council. With this memo, I am 
transmitting to you my recommendations for the required votes necessary to minimize taxes on 
residential properties. In addition, you will find analyses of the FY21 property tax levy, property 
values, and other supporting information. 
 
COVID-19 IMPACTS 

COVID-19 emerged in our community after work began on the FY21 annual budget.  While this 
led to some uncertainty during the budget development process, it became clear that there were 
likely going to be significant fiscal impacts to the City in FY21 and beyond.  As a result, the budget 
was reduced so that the 33 new full-time positions were only funded for 3 months of the fiscal 
year. However, this item was revised  during a subsequent City Council meeting to allow some 
positions related to Housing, Library Social Worker, Early Childhood, Outreach Worker and Early 
Childhood Program Quality Manager positions to be filled sooner as a result of delaying the start 
of  the  Police  Academy  for  new  officers.    Since  the  time  of  budget  adoption,  the  City  has  also 
closely  monitored  non-property  tax  revenues,  which  are  key  to  supporting  the  expansion  of 
important  programs  and  new  initiatives,  and  implementing  City  Council  priorities,  while 
minimizing the tax burden placed on residential properties.    
 
During the FY21 Budget hearings, we informed the City Council that some of the major sources 
of non-property tax revenue would be impacted both in FY20 and FY21 due to COVID-19. In 
addition, we informed the City Council during the FY21 Budget hearings that adjustments to our 
projected revenues would be required as part of the FY21 tax rate classification process.   We also 
noted that we would monitor and control our expenditures and adjust, as needed.  Currently, the 
City has approximately 125 vacant positions as a result of monitoring expenditures and adhering 
to  COVID-19  capacity  restrictions  that  will  support  a  recommendation  to  the  City  Council  to 
reduce the Adopted FY21 General Fund Budget.  
 
I am pleased to report the following with the adoption of the recommendations contained in this 
communication:  

•  The City will again be able to provide to a majority of the residential taxpayers (59%) a 
reduction, no increase or an increase of less than $100 in their FY21 property tax bill. 

•  The percentage of residential taxpayers receiving an increase of $500 or more will 

decrease this year to 10% from 13% last year. 

•  A reduced commercial property tax rate.

•  As a result of our financial position we will be able to use a limited amount of additional 
Free Cash and other reserves to offset projected non-property tax revenue shortfalls in 
FY21. This allows for the current projected levy increase.   

•  Avoid employee layoffs and furloughs or a reduction in services to our residents in FY21. 

•  Ability to fill vacancies in FY21 as needed, and based on City Council goals and 

priorities. 

 

Free Cash 

Our Free Cash certification amount of $209,862,872 demonstrates the important value of our long-
standing  fiscal  policies  and  management,  which  will  allow  us  to  effectively  manage  the  fiscal 
uncertainties that face us during FY21 and beyond.  
 
It is important to note that the City was having a strong year fiscally in FY20 before the COVID-
19 crisis hit and because of our conservative revenue projection practices, the financial impact was 
not as dramatic as it could have been on our non-property tax revenues. This, coupled with our 
ability to control expenditures in the last quarter of the fiscal year, allowed us to have a certified 
Free Cash amount of $210 million.  In FY20, the City expended $100 million in Free Cash.  This 
amount included major key initiatives of the City administration and City Council including (but 
not  limited  to):  Preserving  Affordability  of  Fresh  Pond  Apartments  ($15  million)  Support  of 
Foundry Building Construction ($23 million); War Memorial Temporary Homeless Shelter ($2.2 
million); COVID-19 related expenditures ($1.6 million);  Complete Streets-Elm Street and Bicycle 
Network ($5 million); expanded Tree Planting ($1.2 million); Universal Playground Design and 
Construction ($5.3 million); Glacken Field Reconstruction ($7.3 million); Fire station and DPW 
facilities support ($1.7 million).  
 
I am recommending that a total of $22 million in Free Cash be used to reduce the property tax levy 
as follows:  

•  $14 million in the Free Cash authorization is requested at this time from the City’s Free 
Cash balance in order to reduce the property tax levy increase ($9 million).  This year’s 
Free Cash authorization also offsets $5 million in additional funding for affordable housing 
included in the FY21 Adopted Budget. 

•  An additional $8 million in Free Cash as a net revenue offset to reduced estimated non-

property tax revenue in FY21.  

 

Typically,  the  City  in  recent  years  has  replenished  the  amount  appropriated  to  the  Debt 
Stabilization from Free Cash. This year the amount of replenishment would have been $7 million 
to  the  Debt  Stabilization  Fund  but  instead,  this  year  we  are  using  $8  million  for  revenue 
replenishment  for  non-property  tax  revenue  that  are  projected  to  be  less  budgeted.    The  Debt 
Stabilization Fund had a balance of $56.5 million at the end of FY20, which allows us to redirect 
the Free Cash replenishment in FY21.  It is anticipated that we will be able to resume our prior 
practice of replenishing the fund as has been done in prior years.    
 
The Department of Revenue (DOR) does not allow formal authorizations of Free Cash by the City 
Council until the DOR has certified a Free Cash balance at the conclusion of the fiscal year.

1.1.a

Non-property Tax Decreases 

Hotel Motel excise tax revenue will continue to be impacted throughout FY21, based on reduced 
occupancy levels, reduced room rates and continued limits on travel and event cancellations.  This 
revenue was budgeted at $15.9 million in FY21 and has been reduced by $11.925 million, or 75% 
to $3.975 million.     
 
Meals excise tax revenue is projected to be $2.425 million lower than budgeted. While the City 
has  assisted  our  restaurant  community  in  providing  and  facilitating  increased  outdoor  seating 
where possible, the ability to project the patron volume when outdoor seating is not possible will 
be a challenge.  In addition, there will be a revenue impact as a result of reduced indoor seating 
capacity,  reduced  capacity  for  gatherings,  such  as  weddings,  conferences  and  seminars  and 
business closures.  This revenue was budgeted at $4.850 million in FY21 and has been reduced by 
$2.425 million, or 50% to $2.425 million.     
 
Through  emergency  regulations  to  be  issued  by  the  Department  of  Revenue,  state  government 
plans  to  delay  tax  deadlines  for  small  businesses. Sales,  meals  and  room  occupancy  taxes  for 
qualifying businesses for March 2020 through April 2021 will not be due to the state until May 
2021. This will inhibit our ability to track our actual revenues until the end of this fiscal year. 
 
Department  of  Human  Service  Programs  (DHSP)  revenues  are  projected  to  be  $3.0  million 
lower than budgeted in FY21 because of COVID-19 related changes to programming and services. 
This  should be a one-time adjustment for FY21 with  the assumption that normal  activities can 
resume in large part in FY22. This includes in person preschools, afterschool childcare, community 
schools,  and  the  King  Open  Extended  Day.  At  this  point,  the  only  in  person  programming  is 
through the preschools which have reduced revenues because health and safety regulations limit 
service to approximately half of the normal participants. For now, except for outdoor recreational 
programming, the Department anticipates that all its other programming for children and youth 
will be virtual and families will not be charged fees for that programming. The outdoor recreational 
programming for children and youth is being provided in fields around the city and is also being 
provided free of charge. The additional revenue shortfalls are the result of reduced adult recreation 
on fields because of the prioritizing of youth recreation, no indoor recreational programming at the 
War Memorial and some reduction in golf course revenues because of social distancing and health 
and safety rules. 
 
License Commission budgeted revenues are estimated to be $553,900 lower due to a 40% 
reduction on the total license renewal fees for all license types except: Pole & Conduit, Waste 
Haulers, Leaf Blowers, and Flammables.   
 
State Aid- While major categories of State Aid will not be reduced from FY20, the city will not 
receive an additional $1.3 million in Chapter 70 School Aid funding that had been included as part 
of the FY21 budget. In addition, final State Assessments have been issued and reflect a $1.358 
million increase from the FY21 Budget. Overall, the stability of our two major State Aid revenues 
in FY21 will be better than was anticipated this past spring.   
 
Non-Property Tax Revenue Increases 

Typically, the City has been able to use additional non-property tax revenues to lower the required 
property tax levy after an analysis of prior year revenues and fund balances and current year trends.  
However, this year we needed to use any additional non-property tax revenues to offset revenue

reductions  as  described  earlier.  For  FY21,  the  following  increases  have  been  made:  interest 
earnings ($500,000); building permits ($3.0 million); Health Claims Trust Fund ($1.0 million) and; 
Debt Stabilization Fund ($1.0 million).   
 
Additional approaches were also analyzed to replace revenues that have been lowered in FY21. 
This  includes  using one-time revenue from  available agency fund balances ($2.4 million).  It  is 
anticipated that some of the non-property tax revenues, such as Hotel/Motel and Meals excise tax 
can be increased in FY22 to replace this one-time use as a revenue source. In addition, we will 
continue  to  identify  unexpended  balances  in  other  funds,  such  as  Capital  to  use  as  alternative 
funding sources. 
 
FY21 Budget Reductions 

As  noted  at  the  Budget  Hearings  in  the  spring,  we  would  monitor  our  FY21  expenditures  and 
possibly identify reductions in the FY21 Budget that would be brought before the City Council as 
part  of  the  tax  rate/classification  process  in  the  fall.  Based  on  our  current  projection,  I  am 
recommending that the City Council rescind $5 million from the General Fund Employee Benefits 
Budget to reflect estimated salary and fringe benefit savings based on vacant positions that will 
not be filled quickly mainly due to the current COVID-19 related capacity restrictions as well as 
to help mitigate FY21 financial uncertainties.

OVERVIEW 

The actual FY21 property tax levy is $472,520,148. This is an increase of $34,391,454 or 7.85% 
from FY20 and reflects the City Council goal to “Ensure the City’s Budget allocates resources 
responsibly and responsively.” As in years past we have been able to provide an actual increase 
that is lower than the estimated increase projected in May 2020, and what was presented to the 
rating agencies in February.  Responsible and responsive fiscal policies and practices are key to

addressing the challenge of balancing expansion and investment in new programs and initiatives, 
while also minimizing the impact of increases in the tax levy.    
 
The FY21 Adopted Operating Budget increased by 5.1% over the FY20 Adjusted Budget.  The 
FY21 Budget adopted by the City Council in June 2020 projected a property tax levy increase of 
$35.2 million, or 8.03%, to $473,296,465 in order to fund operating and capital expenditures.   
 
With approval of these recommendations, the property tax levy increase will be lowered to 7.85%.   
The property tax levy increase is  above the five-year (FY17-FY21)  annual  average increase of 
5.9%,  and  the  ten-year  (FY12-FY21)  annual  average  increase  of  5.2%.    The  property  tax  levy 
increase for FY21 is significantly higher than previous years due to the fact that additional non-
property tax revenue was used to offset shortages in other revenue categories instead of to lower 
the levy.    
 
The FY21 Budget is especially significant in terms of creating and preserving affordable rental 
and homeownership opportunities for low, moderate  and middle-income  families.     Affordable 
housing funding in FY21 includes: $5 million funded from building permit revenue which is 25% 
of budgeted revenues, an additional $5 million funded from property taxes, and $5 million funded 
from Free Cash. This is in addition to $12.3 million appropriated by the City Council from FY21 
Community Preservation Act (CPA) Funds. 
 
With these appropriations, the City has met a commitment, made in FY19, to double the amount 
of funds dedicated to affordable housing in Cambridge within 3-5 years.  A total of $27.3 million 
of  direct  financial  support  is  provided  to  the  Affordable  Housing  Trust  in  FY21,  which  is  an 
increase of $7 million from FY20 ($20.3 million), and  achieves the goal of doubling the FY19 
funding ($13.6 million) for affordable housing in 2 years, which is earlier than was anticipated.     
 
The City has also increased property tax support to schools by 5.9%, which resulted in an increase 
of $10,561,245.  The FY21 School budget includes 57 new Full Time Equivalent (FTE) positions.   
Because of the high priority the City places on supporting our schools, City funds budgeted for the 
School Department in FY21 were not revisited due to the COVID-19 crisis.     
 
The City’s early childhood education efforts will expand in FY21, including an increase in the 
number of scholarships, an expansion of the number of sites, and developing a detailed plan for 
Universal  Pre-K  that  will  serve  4-year  old  children  through  the  schools  ,  city  programs,  and 
community preschools.   
 
Small  business  support  has  also  been  critical  during  the  COVID-19  crisis.  The  FY21  budget 
includes funding to expand small business recycling services to an additional 125 businesses, and 
there  is  increased  funding  for  the  business  district  beautification  program  for  plantings  and 
decorative lighting in commercial areas throughout Cambridge.  The City will also be providing a 
small business property tax exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $10,000 
in assessed value.   This initiative has impacted approximately 1,192 businesses.  The City has 
submitted a Home Rule petition to the State Legislature to allow for a larger $20,000 personal 
property tax exemption for small businesses in the future.  The City is also recommending that 
certain licensing fees be reduced by up to 40% in FY21 in order to provide additional financial 
relief to businesses affected by COVID-19.

1.1.a

The FY21 budget includes enhanced funding for art initiatives, including additional funding for 
the  Public  Arts  Grant  Program  and  increased  support  for  the  Central  Square  BID  and  Cultural 
District.  
 
In  addition,  the FY21 Budget  supports  capital  improvements  including  funds to  implement  the 
winning projects from cycle six of the Participatory Budget program, and major capital projects 
including Fire station upgrades, a multi-year Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan, technology 
initiatives, and construction of the Tobin Montessori School and Vassal Lane Upper School.  
 
Based on a property tax levy of $472.5 million, the FY21 residential tax rate will be $5.85 per 
thousand dollars of value, subject to Department of Revenue approval. This is an increase of $0.10, 
or 1.7% from FY20. However, as can be seen in Table III, the median residential tax bill has only 
moderately increased.  The commercial tax rate will be $11.85, which is a decrease of $0.83, or -
6.5%  from  FY20.  Establishing  the  tax  rate  is  a  straightforward  calculation:  the  total  tax  levy 
divided by the total assessed valuation (less any exemptions), equals the tax rate for FY21.    
 
In June, the City Council was informed that the actual tax levy increase presented with the Adopted 
Budget was not likely to be reduced, and may actually have needed to be further increased due to 
lower  projected  revenues  significantly  affected  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  has  been  
discussed in further detail in the earlier COVID-19 Impacts Section.  In addition, the Cherry Sheet 
is projected to have a net negative impact (increase in the amount needed) of $2.4 million on the 
levy.  Using actual FY20 revenues as a guide, we have been able implement additional strategies 
in order to allow for a slight reduction of in the property tax levy increase from what was presented 
with the budget.   These strategies have allowed for an overall reduction of $776,317 from the 
original projected property tax levy for FY21.  This is due to the use of certain increased non-
property tax revenues based on FY20 actuals and fund balances including: $3,000,000 in building 
permits;  $500,000  in  interest  earnings;  $1,000,000  from  the  Debt  Stabilization  Fund;  and 
$1,000,000 from the Health Claims Trust Fund. We will also use $2,400,000 from available agency 
fund balances as a one-time revenue source.  There is a recommendation to use $22 million in Free 
Cash to lower the tax levy.  As noted previously, the amount that normally would have been used 
to replenish the Debt Stabilization Fund has been redirected in order to offset reduced projected 
non-property tax revenue in FY21. I am also recommending that $5,000,000 be reduced from the 
General Fund Employee Benefits budget.  These actions will result in a lower required property 
tax levy and will allow for a reduction in certain non-property tax revenues to be offset.      
 
This  letter  includes  a  recommendation  to  use  $24.5  million  in  reserve  accounts  to  lower  the 
property tax levy: $2.5 million from overlay surplus and $22 million in Free Cash. The certified 
Free Cash amount of $209.9 million, a decrease of $36.8 million or 14.9% from the previous year’s 
certification, is inflated by $3.7 million in unappropriated mitigation receipts. Per MGL Chapter 
144 Section 53, these receipts must flow through the Free Cash certification process before being 
available for appropriation by the Council. Excluding mitigation receipts, net certified Free Cash 
is  $206.2  million.    The  City  Manager  will  be  coming  before  the  City  Council  with  a 
recommendation for the appropriation of mitigation receipts later in the fiscal year. 
 
There  is  a  recommendation  to  use  $8  million  from  the  City  Debt  Stabilization  Fund  to  offset 
increases in debt service costs that would otherwise have been funded from property taxes.  This 
is an increase of $2 million from FY20.  This year, we will not use Free Cash to replenish this

amount back into the fund.  At the end of FY20, the Debt Stabilization Fund had balance of $56.5 
million, which provides flexibility to redirect the Free Cash replenishment in FY21. 
 
Prudent use of reserves allows the City to maintain stability in both current and future property tax 
increases while investing in significant capital and infrastructure projects. This strategy of using 
an increased amount of non-property tax revenues and reserves to lower property taxes will not 
jeopardize our long-term fiscal health. However, if the City used too much of its reserves in one 
year to artificially reduce property taxes, it would mean that in the following year, the City would 
be required to either increase taxes significantly or dramatically reduce expenditures.  
 
The City’s strategy for the use of reserves has also been positively recognized by the three major 
credit rating agencies and is reflected in our AAA credit rating.  It is also important to recognize 
that a healthy balance of development between residential and commercial be continued to ensure 
homeowner’s real estate taxes remain affordable. 
 
 
IMPACT ON TAXPAYERS 

This will be the sixteenth year in a row that a majority of residential taxpayers will see a reduction, 
no change, or an increase of less than $100 in their tax bill. In fact, in FY21, 59% of residential 
taxpayers will see a reduction, no increase or an increase of less than $100; and 77% of residential 
taxpayers  will  see  an  average  increase  of  less  than  $250.  This  is  a  small  decrease  from  FY20, 
where 61% of residential taxpayers saw a reduction, no increase, or an increase of less than $100.  
However, it is an increase from FY20 in terms of the percentage of residential taxpayers (74%) 
that saw an average increase of less than $250. 
 
Over the past ten years (FY12-21), the City has seen an average of 69.8% of residential taxpayers 
see a reduction, no increase, or an increase of less than a $100 to their residential tax bill, and 
65.2% over the past five years (FY17-21).  Even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the city 
has  been  able  to  consistently  achieve  these  results  while  maintaining  and  expanding  City  and 
school services that citizens have come to expect and while providing a robust capital improvement 
program.

The analysis that follows explains in further detail how the City determined property values and 
property tax rates for FY21. There are three major factors which determine a property tax bill: 1) 
the Budget, 2) Commercial-Residential Property Tax Classification, and 3) Property Values. As 
discussed below, all three factors contributed to lower tax bills for many homeowners.  
 
The Budget: If the City Council adopts the proposed recommendations, there will be  a 7.85% 
increase in the property tax levy required to balance the FY21 Budget, which supports the City 
Council Goal to “Ensure the City’s Budget allocates resources responsibly and responsively.”  
 
Commercial-Residential Property Tax Classification: Tax classification allows municipalities 
to  tax  commercial  taxpayers  at  a  higher  rate  than  residential  taxpayers.  In  FY21,  commercial 
property owners will pay 65.4% of the property tax levy, the same share as in FY20. Consequently, 
residential property owners’ share of the FY21 tax levy is 34.6%, also the same as in FY20.   
 
Property Values: Every January 1st, the City of Cambridge must meet Department of Revenue 
requirements to certify that property values represent full and fair market value.  As a result of the 
market activity in calendar year 2019, which is the basis of the FY21 property assessment, total 
residential  property  values  increased  by  5.6%.  Total  commercial  property  values  increased  by 
15.4%. This year’s increase in total values reflects the robust real estate market, which has been 
driven by continued new construction in both residential and commercial classes, as well as the 
continued desirability of the Cambridge market. While the City has no control over the increase in 
property values, it does have control over levy increases, which ultimately impact taxes paid by 
property owners. Distinct from prior years, the residential rate will increase while the commercial 
rate decreases.  This is due to the Minimum Residential Factor calculated by the Department of 
Revenue.  One of the requirements that are affecting the rate this year is that residential taxpayers 
cannot pay less than the lowest percentage share of the levy they have paid since classification 
began.  However, as can be seen in Table III, the median residential tax bill has only moderately 
increased.    Additionally,  a  major  concern  going  forward  is  that  if  residential  value  increases 
outpace commercial/industrial/personal property increases, the City could hit the ceiling for the

property tax classification shift. Once the classification ceiling is reached, the residential class will 
bear the majority of any tax levy increase.   
 
As part of the process, the City must successfully complete the Department of Revenue’s (DOR) 
interim  year  certification  process  of  the  City’s  real  and  personal  property  values,  system  and 
methodologies.

CITY-WIDE ASSESSED VALUES 

FY21 values are based on market activity that occurred during calendar year 2019, during which 
the overall valuation of both the City’s residential property and commercial property increased. 
This reflects an increase in commercial rental rates and a slight decrease in commercial vacancies, 
which  has  an  impact  on  existing  commercial  property  values.    The  major  components  which 
impact  the  commercial  values  are  the  construction  of  life  science  buildings  and  the  personal 
property associated with these developments.   
 
For  FY21,  the  total  assessed  value  of  taxable  property  in  the  City  equals  $60,234,892,929, 
approximately $5.3 billion or a 9.6% increase over FY20 values. The actual FY21 total assessed 
values are greater than the projections presented to the rating agencies in February 2020 due to 
continued strength in the Cambridge real estate market. 
 
COVID-19 PROPERTY TAX IMPACTS 

The real estate tax assessments always look back in time.  Based on state law, the November 2020 
property  tax  bill  for  the  Fiscal  Year  (FY)  2021  uses  January  1,  2020,  as  the  date  to  determine 
values, looking at income and expenses, or sales for residential properties that occurred during 
calendar year 2019.  Unfortunately, this will not consider the circumstances that are happening 
now.  The impact of COVID-19 will be part of the assessments for FY22.  During calendar year 
2019,  many  businesses  and  apartment  buildings  in  Cambridge  saw  increases  in  rents  and  low 
vacancy rates.   
 
This chart illustrates the timeframes used for commercial valuations for each fiscal year.

The City has no ability to change the lien date or consider the current economic circumstances for 
the FY21 tax bills.  The timeframes used for assessments are determined by state law.  Any changes 
to state law would require the Legislature's approval and the Governor's signature.  The Assessing 
department  continues  to  meet  with  the  Commonwealth's  Department  of  Revenue  to  discuss 
economic  concerns  based  on  the  impact  of  COVID-19.    The  Assessing  Department  has  been 
meeting with and updating the neighborhood business associations, the Cambridge Chamber of 
Commerce, and local business owners with information to clarify the basis for the FY21 property 
tax bills.   
 
As noted above, the City is required to assess properties at full and fair market value. Therefore, it 
is extremely important to control the increase in the property tax levy in order to limit the impact 
on tax bills.  While property values have increased significantly, residential tax bills have increased 
more moderately.  As a result, the City has consistently received a limited number of abatement 
applications annually.  
 
In FY20, the market for both commercial and residential properties increased at a faster pace than 
most of the Greater Boston area, resulting in the continuation of a tax distribution similar to FY20 
between commercial taxpayers and residential taxpayers.  Despite this environment of increasing 
values, it is important to note that due to the City’s ability to control taxes and therefore produce 
tax bills with moderate increases, the City has incurred a limited number of abatement requests 
annually. This has allowed for a $2.5 million overlay surplus to be applied towards lowering the 
FY21 property tax levy, as has been our practice in prior years.    
 
The  table  below  breaks  out  new  construction  values  and  tax  base  levy  growth  due  to  new 
construction  by  property  type.  This  new  construction  growth,  coupled  with  moderate  budget 
increases, has allowed the City to maintain the classification of taxes and increase the City’s excess 
levy capacity.

1.1.a

For FY21, the City was able to increase its levy limit by approximately $31.2 million, to $659.7 
million. Approximately $15.4 million of this increase was due to new construction and amended 
FY20 new growth. State law allows the City to increase its tax levy limit by an amount equal to 
the total FY21 value of newly constructed or renovated property, multiplied by the FY20 tax rate. 
The remaining $15.8 million is the 2.5% increase over the FY20 levy allowed by Proposition 2½. 
As projected in the City’s rating agency presentation, the City’s excess levy capacity decreased by 
approximately $3.2 million, or 1.67 %, to $187.2 million in FY21.  This reduction in excess levy 
capacity is primarily the result of budget growth and the corresponding levy increase for FY21.

FY21 VALUATION PROCESS 

Each  year,  the  Board  of  Assessors  conducts  a  reappraisal  of  all  property  within  the  City.  The 
residential  and commercial valuation  models are  refined each year to  reflect  market  conditions 
which  have  impacted  assessed  values.  This  fiscal  year,  the  Department  of  Revenue  (DOR) 
conducted statistical validation of the models. 
 
The  FY21  valuation  model  is  based  upon  sales  of  property  that  occurred  during  calendar  year 
2019, to establish the market value of all property as of January 1, 2020.  For FY21, the number 
of assessing districts has remained unchanged.  In prior years, some consolidation of districts took 
place to create a larger sales sample size.   
 
The ultimate test for any mass appraisal model is the comparison between actual sales not part of 
the model building process and the predicted value from the model. Comparing the FY20 model 
to calendar year 2019 sales data, the model showed the following results.

The assessment ratios were between 84%-92% of calendar year 2019 sales, reflecting increasing 
market values during the last year.   

 
Calendar year 2019 sales demonstrated that the FY20 model needed to be updated based on current 
market  trends  and  overall  property  class  statistics.  The  individual  neighborhoods  also  showed 
some inconsistent growth trends and required review.  As a result, sales data from the calendar 
year 2019 real estate market has been utilized, along with what was learned from the prior year 
abatement  activity,  to  establish  the  FY21  assessed  values  as  of  January  1,  2020.    Using 
technologies  such  as  the  Geographical  Information  System  (GIS)  allowed  for  a  more  in-depth 
review of data.  Using GIS, the Board of Assessors was able to visually display market activity 
and thereby validate the assessing districts using this information.   
 
Modifications were made to the residential and condominium models, as well as to residential land 
values.   The residential land had adjustments for neighborhood, while the residential model was 
recalibrated  for  use,  grade,  finished  basements  and  condition  adjustments.   The  condominium 
model was adjusted by neighborhood for market conditions as of the assessment date.  In addition, 
4,112 inspections were completed along with a detailed field review of property. These inspections 
served  to  ensure  consistency  within  neighborhoods  and  across  the  city.    The  analysis  for 
determining property values depends on several factors: the trends of the real estate market in the 
areas of sales; property improvements; changes in the economics of real  estate finance and the 
high demand for real estate in the city.  To arrive at full and fair cash values for all 24,873 parcels, 
the  Assessing  Department  uses  a  state-of-the-art  Computer  Assisted  Mass  Appraisal  system 
(CAMA). Market adjusted cost approach models, extracted from residential sales for calendar year 
2019,  were  refined  to  best  reflect  the  equity  of  comparable  properties  as  demonstrated  in  the 
various neighborhoods.  Sales of almost 1,000 houses and condominium units were analyzed to 
develop  these  valuation  models  by  property  type  (one-family,  two-family,  three-family,  and 
condominium units).   
 
COMMUNITY PRESERVATION ACT SURCHARGE 

In  November  2001,  Cambridge  voters  approved  adoption  of  the  Community  Preservation  Act 
(CPA), a State law that allows the City to receive matching funds from the State for money raised 
locally in support of affordable housing, historic preservation and open space. The local portion of 
CPA funding is raised through a 3% surcharge on taxes.  
 
However, the State match has enabled the City to provide additional funding for these initiatives. 
To date, Cambridge has received more CPA matching funds from the Commonwealth than any 
other participating community. Consequently, Cambridge residents will continue to benefit from

to  come.    The  State  also  recently  approved  increased  fees  at  the  Registry  of  Deeds,  which  is 
anticipated to increase the matching funds that the City receives from the State next fiscal year.   
 
To date, the City has appropriated/reserved a total of $222.6 million in CPA funds, of which $54.8 
million can be attributed to the State match.

9.  That the City Council vote to increase the FY20 income and assets limits for elderly persons 
(age 65 or older). Income limits of $27,234 to $27,860 for those who are single and $40,852 
to $41,792 for those who are married, asset limits of $54,465 to $55,718 for those who are 
single and $74,890 to $76,612 for those who are married, as allowed under MGL, Chapter 59,

(at  least  65  years  old)  as  determined  by  the  Commissioner  of  Revenue  for  the  purposes  of 
MGL, Chapter 62, Section 6, subsection (k), for a single person who is not head of household 
($60,000) and for a married couple ($90,000), as allowed under MGL Chapter 59, Section 5, 
Clause 41A.  The reduction of the interest rate to 4% for deferred taxes, which was approved 
by the City Council previously, will continue. 

11. That  the  City  Council  vote  to  rescind  $5,000,000  from  the  FY21  General  Fund  Employee 

Benefits budget (Salary and Wages).

a revenue source to the General Fund Budget. 
 

 
ISSUES/REQUIRED VOTES 

As the City Council is aware, by the time the classification vote is taken in the fall of each year, 
the  options  for  the  City are  fairly  limited.    Failure  to  approve  the  recommended  classification, 
residential exemption and the doubling of statutory exemptions would result in significantly higher 
taxes for residential property owners. After the classification vote is taken, the establishment of 
the tax rate is a fairly simple mathematical calculation: the tax levy required to support the City 
budget, divided by the total assessed valuation (less any exemptions), equals the tax rate for FY21. 
 
The following is a summary of the votes required by the City Council.  
 
•  Authorize $22,000,000 in Free Cash to Reduce the FY21 Tax Levy.  For the fiscal year that 
ended June 30, 2020, the City of Cambridge has a certified Free Cash balance of $209,862,872 
a  decrease  of  approximately  $36.7  million  from  the  previous  year.    This  balance  includes 
approximately $3.7 million in unappropriated mitigation receipts which, according to MGL 
chapter 44 section 53, must flow through the Free Cash certification process before the receipts 
are available for appropriation by the Council.  After the reduction of mitigation funds, the net 
certified Free Cash Balance is $206.2 million.  
 
The $22 million in the Free Cash authorization is requested at this time from the City’s Free 
Cash  balance  in  order  to  reduce  the  property  tax  levy  increase.    This  year’s  Free  Cash 
authorization helps offset $5 million in funding for affordable housing included in the FY21 
Adopted Budget. 

The Department of Revenue (DOR) does not allow formal authorizations of Free Cash by the 
City Council until the DOR has certified a Free Cash balance at the conclusion of the fiscal 
year.

1.1.a

•  Transfer of Excess Overlay Balances.  The City is authorized to increase each tax levy by up 
to  five  percent  as  an  “overlay”  to  provide  for  tax  abatements.  If  abatements  are  granted  in 
excess of the applicable overlay, the excess is required to be added to the next tax levy, or 
transfers may be made from surplus balances from prior fiscal years.  
 
Overall, the City has approximately  $19.1 million in  overlay balances as of June 30, 2020.  
However, there are cases pending at the Appellate Tax Board for which the City must have 
sufficient balances to cover abatements if it loses these cases. Based upon the overall size of 
the  overlay  surplus,  I  am  recommending  that  the  City  use  $2.5  million  of  this  surplus  to 
decrease the tax levy.  This conservative approach will allow the City to maintain a sufficient 
overlay reserve while reducing older overlay balances to help lower the tax levy.   
 

•  Authorize $8,000,000 in City Debt Stabilization Funds.  In recognition of increases in debt 
service costs related to major capital projects, the City established a City Debt Stabilization 
Fund.  The  Adopted  FY21  Budget  included  $7.0  million  from  this  source,  which  has  been 
increased  to  $8.0  million,  to  fund  debt  service  costs  related  to  the  elementary  school 
reconstruction program. 

       
•  Classify  Property  and  Establish  Minimum  Residential  Factor.  Since  1984,  the  City 
Council  has  voted  annually  to  follow  State  law  allowing  the  classification  of  property 
according to use (residential or commercial) and to allocate the legal maximum portion of the 
tax levy to the commercial class.  State law allows the residential portion of the tax levy to be 
as  low  as  50%  of  what  it  would  be  if  there  were  single  tax  rates.    However,  there  are  two 
exceptions to the 50% minimum: 
 
The residential percent of the levy cannot drop to less than its lowest level since classification 
was initially voted by the City Council (34.5615% in 1985 in Cambridge); and the 50% level 
does not cause the commercial class to bear a portion of the levy greater than 175% of what it 
would be if both classes were taxed equally.  
 
Under the requirements for classification, the City Council sets the levy distribution each year 
by voting for a Minimum Residential Factor. The result of voting for the Minimum Residential 
Factor  of  60.9858%  this  year  will  be  a  residential  property  share  of  the  total  tax  levy  of 
34.5615%.  This means that Commercial property will pay the remainder, 65.4385% of the 
levy.  The commercial portion of the levy is 151.028% of what it would be with a single tax 
rate, if classification was not adopted.   
 

•  Residential Exemptions. Home Rule Legislation allowing the City to increase the residential 
exemption from 20% to 30% was filed by a unanimous vote of the City Council and signed 
into  law  in  September  2003.  This  change  enables  the  City  to  grant  owner  occupants  of 
residential properties a deduction of up to 30% of the average residential parcel value before 
the  tax  rate  is  applied.  I  am  recommending  that  the  City  Council  accept  the  Residential 
Exemption at 30%. This amount is deducted from the assessed value of each owner-occupied 
property prior to applying the tax rate. The residential exemption serves to reduce the effective 
tax rate on lower valued properties while raising it on higher valued properties.  Since the same 
amount is deducted from every value, its impact is greatest on the lower valued properties. The 
residential  exemption  is  paid  for by raising the residential  tax  rate sufficiently to  cover the 
number of taxpayers claiming the residential exemption.

1.1.a

For FY21, there are approximately 14,400 residential exemptions on the Assessing Department 
files  on  owner-occupied  homes.  The  Assessing  Department  conducts  random  audits  and 
responds  to  inquiries  about  individuals  claiming  the  residential  exemption,  to  ensure  the 
validity of the program. 

 
If Cambridge did not adopt a residential exemption, the residential tax rate would be $4.79 
instead of $5.85. The higher tax rate results in  a "break-even"  value over which the higher 
valued residential properties are assessed higher taxes than would be the case if there were no 
residential exemption. In FY21, the break-even assessed value is approximately $2,369,550.

●  Double  Statutory  Exemptions/Exemption  Increases.  State  legislation  requires  cities  and 
towns to grant a variety of tax exemptions to elderly taxpayers, blind taxpayers, veterans and 
surviving spouses who qualify by virtue of residency, income, and assets. There are also two 
pieces  of  legislation  which  authorize  cities  and  towns  to  increase  the  amounts  of  these 
exemptions.   

The first allows cities and towns to double the statutory amount of exemption for taxpayers 
whose tax bills have increased over the prior year's bill. The City Council votes annually for 
this increase.  I am recommending that the Council do this for FY21, as it has since FY87.   

The second allows cities and towns under Massachusetts General Laws (MGL) Chapter 59, 
Section 5, Clause 17D to increase the amount of the exemption for a senior citizen 70 or older, 
surviving  spouse,  or  minor  with  a  deceased  parent,  by  the  increase  in  the  cost-of-living  as 
measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  
 
The cost of living adjustment (COLA), as determined by the DOR, is measured by the increase 
in the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index 
for Urban Consumers, Boston (CPI-U) for the previous calendar year.  The percentage increase 
for  this  period  was  2.3%.  Therefore,  the  FY21  exemption  amounts,  income  limits  or  asset 
limits under these local options will increase over the FY20 amounts and limits. Therefore, the 
FY21 exemption will be $341 from $333. 
  

   
      In addition, under Clause 17E, which Cambridge has already adopted, cities and towns can 
increase  the  asset  amounts  by  the  CPI  percentage  for  this  same  group.  The  FY21  amounts 
increases to $67,379 from $65,864. 

MGL Chapter 59, Section 5, Clause 41D allows cities and towns to increase the income and 
assets limits for elderly persons (age 65 or older) by the CPI percentage.  For FY21, the income 
limits will be $27,860 for those who are single, $41,792 for those who are married, and the 
asset limits will be $55,718 for those who are single and $76,612 for those who are married.

1.1.a

●  Income  Limit  for  Tax  Deferral.    Another  form  of  tax  relief  available  to  property  owners 
under  state  law  is  found  in  MGL  Chapter  59,  Section  3,  Clause  41A.    This  statute  allows 
taxpayers who are at least 65 years old to defer tax payments until they are deceased, or the 
property is transferred.  The statutory income limit for this deferral is $40,000. However, a 
change in the statute, allows the City Council to vote to increase the income limit for deferral 
of  real  estate  taxes  by  elderly  persons  (at  least  65  years  old)  from  $40,000  to  the  amount 
determined by the Commissioner of Revenue for the purposes of subsection (k) of section 6 of 
chapter 62, (currently $60,000 for a single person and $90,000 for a married couple, which 
may be indexed by Massachusetts DOR for FY21), as allowed under MGL Chapter 59, Section 
5, Clause 41A. I am recommending that the City Council vote to adopt the deferral amount.  
The City Council has previously  voted to  reduce the interest  percentage to  4% on deferred 
property tax balances. 

 
●  Rescind $5,000,000 from the FY21 General Fund Employee Benefits Budget (Salary and 
Wages).  This one-time rescission reflects the fact that the City currently has approximately 
125  vacant  positions  as  a  result  of  monitoring  expenditures  and  adhering  to  COVID-19 
capacity restrictions that provides the ability to support budget savings related to insurance and 
fringe benefits. 

 
●  Authorize $2,400,000 in City Agency Funds. Available Agency Fund balances will provide 
a one-time revenue source in FY21 to offset reduced projected revenues in other categories. 

CONCLUSION 

In June, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the City Council adopted a balanced FY21 Budget 
that continues to provide stability and reinvests in our community. The Budget includes additional 
funding for affordable housing, school services, early childhood education, small business support, 
the  arts  traffic  safety,  and  climate  initiatives.    It  also  includes  a  robust  capital  plan,  including 
funding to continue efforts to rehabilitate and reconstruct fire stations and continue the multi-year 
school  reconstruction  program.    This  has  been  achieved  by  our  strong  fiscal  practices,  which 
control budget growth and property tax levy increases. 
 
Approximately  66%  of  the  revenues  that  fund  the  City’s  budget  are  raised  through  property  taxes. 
Massachusetts communities are limited in how they can raise revenues, resulting in a greater reliance 
on the property tax, since it is the largest and most stable revenue. The City has been able to achieve a 
lower property tax rate and lower residential property tax bill than surrounding communities due to its 
ability to generate diverse non-property tax revenues, foster new construction, control budget growth, 
and plan prudent use of reserves.  In addition, a strong, stable commercial tax base is a key component 
of our ability to limit impacts on residential taxpayers.     
 
Overall, continued sound financial management and planning have enabled the City Council to 
limit the growth of residential property taxes in FY21. In addition, with City Council approval, the 
City will use $24.5 million of reserves (Free Cash/overlay surplus) in FY21 to lessen the amount 
to be raised from the property tax levy, which translates into a lower property tax burden for the 
taxpayers of the City.  This amount includes $22 million from Free Cash and $2.5 million from 
the Overlay Surplus.  Last year, $6 million in Free Cash was appropriated to replenish an equal 
amount of revenue used from the City’s Debt Stabilization Fund.  For FY21, I am recommending

that $8 million in Free Cash that would have been used to replenish the Debt Stabilization Fund is 
instead used to lower the tax levy.  
 
With the approval of this recommendation, the Debt Stabilization Fund is projected to have a FY21 
year-end balance of $49 million to help offset some of the future debt service costs of the school 
reconstruction  program  and  other  municipal  projects.  The  City  will  continue  to  pursue 
opportunities for reimbursement through the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) 
program  for  smaller  repair  projects;  these  funds  are  not  included  in  our  current  financial 
projections. 
 
Our  current  four-year  debt  schedule  (FY21-24)  which  is  under  review,  is  projected  to  be  over 
$519.1 million, which is comprised of $393.2 million in tax supported debt and $125.9 million of 
sewer debt. The multi-year school reconstruction program makes up $202 million of this total and 
includes  the  construction  of  the  Tobin  Montessori  and  Vassal  Lane  Upper  School  project. 
However,  it  should  be  noted  that  with  this  projected  debt  issuance,  the  City’s  ability  to  fund 
additional major projects is limited. 
 
Although there were significant impacts on several key revenues for the city due to difficult but 
necessary steps taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the past fiscal year was relatively strong 
financially  for  the  City  based  on  several  indicators,  with  total  assessed  values  continuing  to 
increase;  total  actual  revenues  which  exceeded  projections  and  prior  year  collections;  and 
controlled expenditures.    Although longer term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis remain unknown, 
the City continues to have considerable flexibility to respond to the crisis while also providing a 
high level of services to the community.    The current crisis will also likely have both immediate 
and  long-term  effects  on  valuations,  so  it  is  still  important  to  maintain  a  healthy  balance  of 
development  between  residential  and  commercial  to  ensure  that  homeowners’  real  estate  taxes 
remain  affordable.      As  we  plan  for  the  FY22  budget  process,  it  is  clear  that  we  will  need  to 
continue  to  be  prudent  in  developing  the  budget,  which  may  not  have  the  same  expansion  of 
positions and services that we have been able to include in prior years.   
 
The City used $99.7 million in Free Cash in FY20, the highest amount ever for the City. With the 
approval of this recommendation, the City will use $22 million in Free Cash, reducing the net Free 
Cash  balance  to  $184.2  million.    The  City  has  used  an  average  of  $55.1  million  in  Free  Cash 
annually over the last 5 years.  The strategic use of Free Cash is not only used to reduce the current 
tax levy and stabilize the impact of future debt supported capital projects, but is also available to 
fund one-time items. This planned approach has allowed us to maintain our Free Cash balances, 
enabled  us  to  weather  uncertain  economic  times,  and  is  the  City’s  insurance  policy  against 
unforeseen catastrophes.  
 
It is important to recognize that while the Free Cash balance is relatively high, is it significantly 
reduced from last year.  It is also anticipated that there will be several additional recommendations 
for significant Free Cash expenditures in FY21 which will likely result in a decrease in next year’s 
certified Free Cash balance. Subject to City Manager recommendation and City Council approval, 
a partial list of the possible items to be recommended for appropriation from Free Cash in FY21 
include:  additional School and COVID-19 costs; temporary shelter operating expenses; additional 
appropriation  for  the  Foundry  Building  construction;  DPW  facility  lease;  public  safety  radio 
equipment;  Central  Square  Branch  Library  improvements;  E-Gov  Projects;  School  Building 
Feasibility  Study;  War  Memorial  structural  repairs;    the  Green  Line  Extension  payment;  and

snowstorm related expenses.   
 
Despite the economic uncertainty facing much of the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The 
long-term outlook for Cambridge continues to be very strong and reinforces the City’s practice of 
managing our resources wisely.  We will continue to use our five-year financial and capital plan, 
debt and reserve policies, and the City Council goals as a blueprint for our long-range planning.   
 
It is important to note that the flexibility to adjust the tax levy in a way that helps minimize the 
impacts on property owners is provided by adherence to long standing fiscal practices and policies, 
maintaining sufficient reserves, and controlling the budget. The FY21 Budget maintains a high 
level of services and includes no staff or program reductions.   Further, there is additional funding 
for affordable housing which is a key City Council priority, and increased City funds to support 
for the School Department.   
 
The prudent use of the City’s reserve balances that we have created over the years, has allowed us 
to lessen the tax burden of our tax payers while maintaining our fiscal flexibility and continuing 
to position Cambridge as a favorable place to live and do business. In addition, our reserves allow 
us to fund one-time capital projects and other programmatic initiatives that reflect City Council 
priorities. 
 
I would like to thank the City Council for their continued guidance and support as well as staff for 
their hard work, that makes Cambridge the most fiscally sound city in the Commonwealth.

RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System – Enhancement 
(RapidSOS Ready) 

Department: 
Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System (RapidSOS) is a web platform that 
provides life-saving data directly to 911 and first responders in an emergency, 
providing faster, more effective responses. Callers who contact 911 do so voluntarily 
seeking emergency services.  RapidSOS integrates data from: personal devices such 
as smartphones and smartwatches, motor vehicles’ GPS and crash-detection systems, 
and home security systems, to provide real-time emergency data that supplements 
information provided during an individual 911 call. 

 

•  RapidSOS is deployed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ State 911 

Department, which manages and oversees the Next Generation 911 system.  This 
state system delivers 911 calls to the appropriate jurisdiction and RapidSOS 
technology functions as a clearinghouse to present the call to the Public Safety 
Answering Point (PSAP), or call center, for emergency response.  ECC serves as a 
PSAP and is therefore required to access RapidSOS through the State 911 system. 

• 

 
In Cambridge, when callers contact 911 their call is directed to Emergency 
Communications on the state’s Next Generation 911 platform and RapidSOS 
provides secondary, data-based location information to ECC through the RapidSOS 
clearinghouse The data that is collected at the time of the call is the caller location 
and phone number.  All 911 calls and caller information are required to be recorded.  
These records are kept according to record retention policies through the 
administrative portal of the Next General 911 System.

•  The State 911 Department is required by law to review and assess all technological 

and operational capability of wireless 911 calls being routed and handled directly by 
the PSAP in which the caller is located.  The State 911 Department is responsible for 
ensuring such capability exists and they establish the standards, by which our PSAP 
receives wireless calls.  

 
•  RapidSOS has enhanced their platform to include the capacity to present emergency 
profiles of 911 callers.  Through collaboration with the American Heart Association 
(AHA), American Red Cross and Direct Relief, RapidSOS has developed emergency 
response data platform, RapidSOS Ready that securely links life-saving data from 
connected devices or profiles to 911 and first responders duirng an emergency . 
through RapidSOS Data Integration System. 

 

 
 
•  Residents can now create an Emergency Health Profile, providing first responders 
with the critical information they need to care for individuals in the field during a 
medical emergency.   

o  Signing up is voluntary and free of charge.  
o  During an emergency call, the emergency profile will be presented through 
the RapidSOS platform to Call Takers which will provide life saving 
informaiton to first responders. 

•o  Information is protected by the Emergency Health Profile Associaition and 

will only be sent to the jurisdication handling the 911 call duirng an 
emergency through the registered phone number provided via the existing 
RapidSOS platform. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

 

 

•  The purpose of this technology is to provide ECC Call Takers and Dispatchers with 
an accurate phone number and location information of wireless callers who contact 
911 in our jurisdiction.  This is necessary to provide aid to the caller, dispatch 
emergency personnel and provide emergency services.   This information also allows 
Call Takers and Dispatchers to contact the caller if the call gets disconnected or for 
additional follow up.  

 
•  This technology supports our ability to maintain the safety and security of City 

employees, students, and residents when experiencing an emergency situation.  In 
addition, this technology allows us to communicate life saving information to first 
reponsders.

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The RapidSOS technology is deployed by the State 911 Department to all PSAPs in 
the Commonwealth as part of the Next Generation 911 System.  The RapidSOS 
technology is housed on the State 911 system located in Middleboro and a local 
server for our PSAP is located at 125 Sixth Street. 

 
•  This technology was implemented in 2018. 

 
•  This enhancement to the RapidSOS platform will provide first responders with 
additional lifesaving information for those who create an Emergency Profile. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The privacy impact of this technology is consistent with federal, state and local 

government policies for the purposes of law enforcement and public safety efforts.  
Records of 911 calls received through traditional call processing have previously 
included location and phone information provided by cellular carriers, and RapidSOS 
provides the same information.  However, with the rapid advancement of location-
based technology, our reliance on cellular carriers’ location information has 
decreased.  The RapidSOS technology provides more accurate location information.  
The Next Generation 911 System administered by the State provides also provides 
subscriber information, i.e., the name of the person to whom the phone is registered, 
as well as the phone address and number.  Currently, all callers that contact 911 are 
informed that the call is being recorded as required by law.    

 
•  The State 911 Department provides role-based access to the data to ensure protection 
of caller information.  In ECC/our PSAP, Call Takers and Dispatchers have access to 
caller information during the call and for thirty minutes after the call has been 
disconnected. Authorized users will have access for performing their duties in 
accordance with their role during call processing, quality assurance and investigative 
matters.  

 
•  Because this technology provides an opportunity for citizens and business to access 
emergency services, there may be a greater impact on privacy of the individuals or 
businesses who voluntarily provide information to law enforcement officials during 
emergencies.  The Emergency Communications Department will address these

privacy impacts by limiting access to the information to assigned investigators and/or 
authorized users, similarly to current department policy.   

 
•  All access to the RapidSOS administrative portal is limited to managers of the ECD 

and is password protected.    

•  The State 911 Department reviews and assesses new communications technologies 
that may serve as Next Generation 911 technology platforms, consistent with FCC 
decisions and federal law.  RapidSOS technology has been thoroughly vetted by the 
State to provide life-saving information during emergencies. 

 
•  RapidSOS enhanced platform will provide lifesaving information through the 

Emergency Profile.  It is voluntary and participants can provide as much information 
as they are comfortable with.  However, callers who contact 911 will have their 
privacy impacted due to requesting emergency services. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  There are no associated costs with RapidSOS technology as it is deployed by the 

State 911 Department as part of the State Next Generation 911 system. 

•  There is no additional cost to the City or residents in utilizing the Emergency Profile 

created by RapidSOS.

Commissioner DPW 
 

Columbia Street at the end of each of the Summer months. 
 

 

 

 
 

In response to the above referenced awaiting report, please know that traditionally one or two 
weeks prior to June 1st and one or two weeks prior to September 1st the City sees 
disproportionately larger amounts of bulky waste (furniture, matresses, desks, etc.) set out at the 
curb in comparison to the rest of the year.  This behavior is typically associated with students 
moving in and/or out during those time frames. This practice is a City wide issue and has been 
happening for decades. In response,  Public Works increases enforcement activity during these 
periods and has day and evening crews work longer days, sending trucks back to sections for 
additional pickups, and more recently adding additional vehicles to assist with mattress and 
boxspring recycling. 
 
This year, while we still saw large amounts of debris during the time frames mentioned above, 
we also saw  this practice happening at the end of each month on streets such as Columbia 
Street.   Although to a much lesser degree than the traditional move in/move out weeks, small 
amounts of furniture have begun showing up on sidewalks at the end of every month.  While we 
have not identified a definitive reason for this, we began noticing these changes just after the 
start of the pandemic.  Inspectors are sent out to issue tickets and talk with property owners 
where possible, and additional trucks are sent out to remove debris from the street as quickly as 
possible.  This will continue as long as this new phenomonen continues. The use of 
Commonwealth Connect has also been valuable in both recording where issues have been found 
as well as directing resources in the most efficient way.        
 
Our hope is that as the environment returns to normal these occurrences will also return to a 
normal cycles.  In the meantime, we will monitor areas such as Columbia Street through the 
remainder of the year to assure that they are kept in a clean and safe condition, and we will also 
re-evaluate the need for any additional services through the fall and winter and indeed into the 
spring of 2021.

Response on Library Distributing Physical Materials   
 
Council Order O-2 June 29, 2020 states that the City Manager be and hereby is requested to 
confer with Director of Cambridge Public Libraries and the Cambridge Library Staff Association 
to develop new and expanded ways to distribute physical library materials to Cambridge youth 
over the summer, including possible mobile checkout sites.  
 
The Library circulated physical materials for children and teens through both the Contactless 
Holds Pickup service and Kids Books to Go events. We hosted end-of-summer children’s book 
giveaways at Cambridge Summer Food Program mobile sites near branch libraries. The 
Library also worked in partnership with Cambridge Book Bike, My Brother’s Keeper and the 
Mayor’s Office to both plan events and provide books for mobile distribution.  
 
During July and August, the Cambridge Public Library circulated physical 49,381 books for 
children and teens. We developed visual guides specifically for children and caregivers and 
ensured that children’s librarians and staff were available via phone and email to provide 
guidance. 
  
Kids Books to Go  
Branch and youth services staff developed “Kids Books to Go” (KBTG) as a new way for kids and 
teens to borrow physical library books during COVID-19. We held KBTG events at all 
neighborhood library branches to serve as much of the Cambridge community as possible. At 
these events, attendees could choose from our menu of bags for kids and teens. We had a 
range of materials available, from picture books for young children to fiction and graphic novels 
for teens. Youth Services staff from each branch took the lead in curating the selections for 
their events, reflecting their neighborhood's "flavor" and preferences (e.g., preparing more 
bags with board books for neighborhoods with lots of very young patrons). At the event, Library 
staff matched participants with a bag of pre-selected books curated by Cambridge Public 
Library youth services librarians.  

Staff and patron safety was of utmost importance so Kids Books to Go events used best practices 
evolving from our Contactless Holds Pickup service. This included clear event signage, tables and 
stanchions to create traffic flow, markers on the ground to promote social distancing and “grab and 
go” bagged selections. Additionally, no library cards were necessary for transaction. In order to 
make this a contactless pickup, books were checked out in advance to a general library staff 
account. Participants are trusted to return the books when they are finished with them. KBTG was 
financially supported by the Cambridge Public Library Foundation.  

These events, which are continuing this fall, have provided an important opportunity for branch 
staff to reconnect with their neighborhood patrons. As of 9/24, we have had 12 KBTG events 
total and have hosted events at every neighborhood branch. We served 2,052 people, gave out 
1,317 bags containing 5,904 books.

Summer Reading Book Giveaways  
The Library hosted end-of-summer children’s book giveaways, delivering another reading boost 
to kids during this difficult summer. Children and families picking up lunch at Cambridge 
Summer Food Program sites near our branch libraries were offered a book of their own to take 
home to keep. Books were paid for by the Cambridge Public Library Foundation.  
 
•  The Valente Branch Library had books available at the King Open School lunch site on 

Monday, August 10 and Thursday, August 13.  

•  The O’Neill Branch Library had books available at the Peabody School lunch site on Tuesday, 

August 11 and Friday, August 14.  

 
We welcomed 212 people during the week and gave away 196 books.  
In addition, 126 children who completed Summer Reading challenges received e-gift cards to 
Porter Square Books.  
 
Partnership Efforts during the Pandemic  
In addition, serving youth in Cambridge is always stronger and more impactful when we work 
together with our partners. Partnership efforts this summer include:  
 
Cambridge Book Bike (July/early August)  
With our partners at the Agenda for Children Literacy Initiative and the Center for Families (and 
Summer Food and Food for Free), the Cambridge Public Library helped with the planning and 
development of this year’s Book Bike events including virtual story times and book giveaways.   
 
My Brother’s Keeper – 100 Families Reading Initiative (July)  
The Library provided 220 giveaway books for events sponsored by My Brother’s Keeper.  
 
The Mayor’s Office, the Vice-Mayor and with special coordination efforts by school librarian Liz 
Phipps-Soeiro, and additional assistance from citizen volunteers and Find It Cambridge (April)  
Together with these partners, the Library provided 60 boxes of outreach giveaway books 
distributed to students through meal distribution sites.     
 
Conclusion  
As the impacts of COVID-19 continue to create ever-evolving challenges and barriers to access 
for our most vulnerable populations, with minors being some of the most vulnerable of all, the 
Library is committed to using its resources to the best of its ability to find new and safe ways to 
create methods of access.

Response on Liberation Libraries 
 
Council Order O-4 June 22, 2020 states that the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with 
Director of Cambridge Public Libraries to determine providing the initial books and resources that will be 
in these little free libraries; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager report back to the Council 
on the feasibility of placing the four little free libraries in the above locations in a timely manner.  
 
As the United States confronts a host of challenges as they relate to race, racism, and the growing divide 
in this country, The MBK, Cambridge team has taken the proactive stance to leverage any real or 
perceived divide through a universal love, the love for reading. The Liberation Libraries program is an 
initiative to promote reading and literacy while building and strengthening an intergenerational racial 
and cultural toolkit for all members and visitors of the Cambridge community.  
 
With an understanding that the libraries are being erected and will be installed under the backdrop of 
Covid-19, all books in the libraries will be donated to the community. In addition, we will host quarterly 
book discussions that will be topical ranging from joy to love to create a learning space for the members 
of our community. While the construction, packaging, and marketing of the materials will begin this fall, 
programming that is directly connected to the libraries speaker series and book discussions will start in 
earnest in Spring 2021.    
 
Planning to-date:  
 
On July 1, 2020, the Director of Libraries and her staff met with Tony Clark and Dr. Carolyn Hunter of My 
Brother’s Keeper (MBK Cambridge) to discuss the City Council’s June order calling for anti-racism mini 
libraries across the City. During this meeting, they discussed:   
  
•  Mission  
To provide the Cambridge community with the resources and the space to humanize the individuals, the 
stories, and the experiences of black and brown people. Liberation Libraries is committed to creating a 
space to foster and to lift intergenerational learning by and from the various people and stories that live 
amongst us.  
  
•  Curation and Procurement of Library Materials  
The Director of Libraries confirmed that the Library’s central role in this community-based project will be 
to collaborate on curating & procuring a list of books for Liberation Libraries and will also work to secure 
funding for books for the Liberation Libraries. For the first iteration, six books will be selected for the 
Liberation Libraries on the theme of Black Joy. The selection will span a range of ages—titles that will 
appeal to children, teens and adults. In the future, the group will also consider including books in foreign 
languages to accommodate non-English language speakers.

•  Framework for Lending – Lend to Keep versus Lend to Return  
Participants evaluated the costs and benefits associated with “lending to keep” versus “lending to 
return” books from the liberation libraries. The group concluded that the lending to keep was safest 
option considering the public health emergency. Lend to keep will also leave patrons with a book that 
they can refer to or share as they please.   
 
•  Locations of Liberation Libraries  
Attendees discussed possible locations for Liberation Libraries. Libraries are to be placed in accessible 
locations, such as in the major squares in Cambridge. The Department of Public Works has been involved 
in planning and the Commission for Persons with Disabilities has been invited to participate in the 
discussion. Sites proposed include:   
 

o  Corner of Cherry Street and Eaton Street  
o  Moses Youth Center  
o  Corner of Wester Ave and Jay Street  
o  Corner of Cedar Street and Rindge Ave  
Note: the group is also exploring possibility of installing a library next to CRLS.  
  

•  Restocking of Liberation Libraries  
Planners explored how the supply of books in Liberation Libraries will be replenished. Options floated 
included youth from the Mayor’s Summer Youth Employment Program or the possibility of MBK 
Cambridge finding volunteers to replenish liberation libraries. MBK Cambridge is also in discussion with 
the Public Health Department about safety practices to restock libraries.   
  
On September 18, 2020, another meeting to discuss the Liberation Libraries occurred. The meeting was 
attended by representatives of the Mayor’s Office, Cambridge Public Schools Department, MBK 
Cambridge and the Cambridge Public Library. The group discussed:  
  
•  Materials Funding  
The Director of Libraries confirmed that the Cambridge Public Library Foundation will provide $15,000 
for the cost of books and other materials for the Liberation Libraries.  
  
•  Book Discussions  
Through a robust community centered process that lifts the diverse voices and stories of the community 
we will identify and create a curricula and a circle of teaching practice that is aligned with the selection 
of the books that will be placed and discussed in the liberation libraries. Community members and 
librarians who represent the racial, ethnic, language, socio-economic, age, sexual and gender diversity of 
the community will serve as the stewards of book selection and lead with community conversations 
regarding the selected works. We envision that the Mayor will lead one of these discussions.  
  
•  Library Construction and Additional Funding:  

o  Cambridge-based carpenter, Kamala Harrington, will construct the libraries.  
o  The Mayor’s and City Manager’s Offices will provide $10,000 to build and promote Liberation Libraries.  

Additionally, sub-committees have also met to plan this effort. The whole group agreed to meet again in 
late October or early November.

October 5, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-47, regarding a report on heat lamps and 
outdoor dining during the COVID-19 public health crisis, DPW Commissioner Owen 
O’Riordan, Fire Chief Gerard Mahoney, Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob, and Assistant 
to the City Manager Matthew Nelson report the following:  
 
Since early June when the City began accepting Temporary Outdoor Seating applications, the 
City has processed 103 permits for extended outdoor seating., These are in addition to the patios 
that were approved with no additional expansion.  
 
In anticipation of the need to extend outdoor dining into colder months, the Fire Department 
expanded its heat lamp Pilot Patio Heater Pilot Project from Harvard Square to citywide. To date 
the Fire Department has permitted thirty-eight heat lamp permits throughout Cambridge. This is 
up from just two restaurants having permits for heat lamps when this program was piloted in 
Harvard Square in 2018. The Fire Department has set up a simple online permitting portal to 
make the process as efficient as possible.  
 
Since outdoor dining was allowed to operate as part of Phase II of the State’s reopening plan in 
June, Cambridge Restaurants have been following the State’s Safety Standards for Restaurants 
The exception in Cambridge is that restaurants are only permitted to allow six patrons to be 
seated per table, and that as the guidelines state: Tables must be positioned so to maintain at least 
a 6 foot distance from all other tables and any high foot traffic areas (e.g., routes to bathrooms, 
entrances, exits); tables may be positioned closer if separated by protective / non-porous barriers 
(e.g., structural walls or plexiglass dividers) not less than 6 feet high installed between tables and 
high foot traffic areas.  
 
The City, working with the Central Square BID and the other business associations, has 
coordinated with the BID for the BID’s procurement, storage and distribution of propane heaters 

1.9

to those businesses who have expressed an interest in purchasing propane heaters, so as to allow 
them to continue outdoor dining through the fall into the winter months. It is expected that these 
heaters will be available to be picked up from an MIT storage facility during the next week. 
 
The City continues to explore options on ways to make it easier for restaurants to operate in the 
colder months, including but not limited to: providing notification to restaurants in advance of 
winter storms, and helping to facilitate access to outdoor heaters and propane.

Re: 

City Council Order (POR 2020 #149) dated June 29, 2020  

ORDERED: That the City Manager confer with the Cambridge Police Department, Emergency 
Communications Department, Department of Public Health, Department of Human Services and 
other relevant departments to determine the feasibility of  an alternative Public Safety Crisis 
Response System, which department would be responsible for it, and how it would be funded and 
implemented in FY2022, and report back to the Council by September 14th; and be it further  

This communication is in response to Council Order (POR 2020#149) which requests information 
pertaining to the feasibility of creating an alternative public safety crisis response system:  

 

Background: 

In concert with City Administration and relevant City Departments, the Cambridge Police Department 
(CPD) has taken great care over the last decade to adopt a community policing philosophy that values the 
sanctity of human life above all else and to adopt strategies that focus on Prevention, Intervention, and 
Diversion over traditional law enforcement outcomes. As a department, it is recognized that far more 
individuals would be better served through a “Social Justice” approach rather than a “Criminal Justice” 
approach. The resulting paradigm shift led to:  

• 

Increased documentation of calls for service involving mental health and homelessness issues, as 
well as increased documenting of both involuntary and voluntary psychiatric admissions. Doing so 
has permitted for a better understanding of service needs among these vulnerable populations. The 
Department also increased its mandatory training for all officers to receive 40 hours of Crisis 
Intervention Training (CIT).  

•  Enhanced partnerships and coordination with area service agencies supporting these vulnerable 

populations; including but not limited to: (A) other City departments, such as Health and Human 
Service Programs and Public Health, (B) area healthcare systems such as the entire CHA network 
and the largest area hospitals, and (C) other community stakeholders such as clergy, courts, 
businesses, and various advocates for homelessness and for those suffering from mental health and 
substance use issues.

• 

In 2018, CPD formed the Family and Social Justice Section (FSJS), in order to bring all services 
designed to protect vulnerable populations (homeless, juveniles, elders, and those suffering from 
mental health and substance use issues) under one umbrella.  The FSJS is overseen by a Deputy 
Superintendent and is comprised of three (3) units: The Social Justice Unit, Family Justice Unit and 
Clinical Support Unit (staffed with a Child Psychologist, Licensed Clinical Social workers, and 
Domestic Violence Advocates). The desired outcomes of the FSJS are to reduce the incarceration 
of vulnerable populations, reduce the need for emergency service utilization (e.g., frequent ER 
trips) and improve access to outpatient and community-based supports and services. The FSJS is 
home to the City’s renowned Safety Net Collaborative; a partnership between the Police, Human 
Service Programs, School, and Public Health Departments, which has been empirically recognized 
for its successes in reducing juvenile arrests and recidivism, while also increasing access to 
behavioral health services.  

The work that the City of Cambridge has done toward implementing these protective strategies is in 
accordance with best practices and heavily influenced by guidance from authorities such as The Council of 
State Governments Justice Center and the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), 
which for more than 30 years has emphasized the need for a co-responder model and pioneered Police-
Mental Health Collaboration Programs (PMHC). The BJA has produced a useful PMHC toolkit. PMHC 
emphasizes five types of programs; however, according to the BJA “There is no one ‘right’ type. Agencies 
need to first assess their community’s needs and resources to determine which type of PMHC is most 
appropriate…the five approaches are not mutually exclusive…”. The five types of programs are:  

•  Crisis Intervention Teams: After completing a 40-hour training course, CIT officers are 

dispatched to mental health calls or utilized to assist non-CIT qualified officers. CIT officers rely 
upon their expertise to work with mental health providers and reach an appropriate [socially just] 
disposition (currently used by CPD). 

•  Co-Responder Teams: Specially trained officers and mental health crisis workers respond together 

to mental health calls for service. By drawing upon the combined expertise of the officer and 
mental health professional, the team is able to link people with mental illnesses to appropriate 
services or provide other effective and efficient responses. The most common approach is for the 
officer and crisis worker to ride together in the same vehicle for an entire shift, while in other 
agencies the crisis worker meets officers at the scene, and they handle the call together. Co-
responder teams can respond throughout the entire jurisdiction, or they work in areas with the 
greatest number of mental health calls. 

•  Mobile Crisis Teams: Utilizes a group of mental health professionals who are available to respond 
to calls for service at the request of law enforcement officers. The mobile crisis team’s goal is to 
divert individuals from unnecessary jail bookings and/or emergency rooms. These crisis workers 
are skilled at helping to stabilize encounters and assume responsibility for securing mental health 
services for persons, including those in crisis who may need further evaluation and treatment. 
Mobile crisis teams are not necessarily dedicated to assisting only law enforcement officers but 
respond to requests directly from community members or their families and friends. 

•  Case Management Teams: A proactive team approach in which behavioral health professionals 
and officers provide outreach and follow-up to repeat callers and high utilizers of emergency 
services. Officers do not treat or diagnose the individuals, but work with behavioral health 
professionals to develop specific solutions to reduce repeat interactions. This approach strives to 
keep people connected to mental health services and community resources, abide by treatment 
plans, and meet other responsibilities such as work, school and training. Case management is used 
in agencies in conjunction with other police-mental health collaboration strategies. (currently used 
by CPD)

•  Tailored Approach: A tailored approach is one in which an agency intentionally selects various 
response options from multiple PMHC programs to build a comprehensive and robust program. 
This allows the agency to adhere to a consistent policing philosophy while being responsive to 
community needs. Other factors agencies consider when choosing this approach can include the 
size of the jurisdiction and the number of officers on a given shift. When using the tailored 
approach, a law enforcement agency begins with the expectation that every patrol officer must be 
able to respond effectively to mental health calls. Agencies enhance their patrol force with officers 
or detectives whose primary responsibilities are to liaise with stakeholders to coordinate criminal 
justice and mental health resources. (currently used by CPD).  

Discussion:  

In making recommendations for non-police responses it is crucial to begin with the understanding that it is 
sometimes difficult and at other times impossible to begin with a non-police response even when a non-
police response is most desirable. This will be true for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to: 

•  Vulnerable populations are at increased risk of being reported for potential criminal offenses and 

behaviors. These incidents will come in as “crimes in progress” and require a police response. The 
purpose of the highly specialized Social Justice and Community Outreach teams at CPD is to, 
whenever possible, divert these vulnerable individuals (when they are reported for offenses) to 
services or specialized rehabilitative court programs and away from incarceration.  

•  Calls for service rarely fall neatly into a taxonomy and will not simply present as “a person 

experiencing a mental health crisis”.  The Emergency Communications Center (ECC) screens calls 
for service and determines the response plan based on the report from the caller.  Even after 
thorough screening, the call may appear to be a disturbance or a fight, etc. and it is rarely clear 
whether there is a safety risk or if there is an individual experiencing a mental health crisis. In some 
instances, callers are reporting what they have observed and are no longer in the area to provide 
additional information that would be useful when screening.  Additionally, any calls for a section 
12 or “Pink Slip” involving involuntary hospitalization requires a police presence as that person is 
mandated to be transported and evaluated in an emergency room.    

•  Any non-police response teams must be heavily integrated with Emergency Communications. Any 
non-police response will require additional effort by dispatchers to identify behavioral health calls, 
triage calls to ensure that they are non-violent, and dispatch the Mobile Crisis Teams. Since these 
teams respond without the Police Department, dispatching and managing them will require added 
resources and attention during call screening. These teams must be in close contact with dispatchers 
to ensure that they can call for police back-up if needed, which may likely require further dispatch 
resources and communication equipment. 

However, there are many non-emergency, non-crisis calls in the City that fall on CPD to respond to that 
could be served with a non-police response. Some examples include someone with a mental illness who is 
upset but not in crisis, neighbor complaints, nuisance issues, etc.  A non-police/EMS response would be 
appropriate in these situations and could take some burden off police and the emergency response system. 

Prior to entering a discussion as to potential non-police response models the following should be noted: In 
2018, the CPD participated in the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Strategic Planning for Law 
Enforcement and Mental Health Collaboration funded by the U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice 
Assistance (BJA). The completed planning guide revealed that the major gap in response for vulnerable 
populations in the City of Cambridge was [the lack of] a “restoration or sobering center.” Such a center is 
meant to provide a physical location where people in crisis can be transported for short-term stabilization 
and management that is not an emergency room or criminal justice facility. The data on 911 calls for

service for “high-utilizers” of emergency services indicates that patients are sent to ERs and often 
discharged or held for very short in-patient stays. Hospitals will play a vital role in the model as there is 
simply a dearth of places for the most vulnerable to go to for care when they are in acute crisis.  

Recommendation:  

In order to suggest a non-police response several models were reviewed including the CAHOOTS model 
suggested in the Policy Order and others such as, 23-hour crisis stabilization/observation beds, Short-term 
crisis residential services and crisis stabilization, Mobile Crisis Services, 24/7 crisis hotlines, Warm lines, 
Psychiatric Advance Directive Statements and Peer Crisis Services as highlighted by the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) (2014).  

The primary recommendation is that the City of Cambridge add a Mobile Crisis Response component that 
is detached from CPD and operates independently or within another City Department or affiliated agency 
such as Cambridge Health Alliance. While continuing with the tailored approach currently utilized by CPD 
which relies on Crisis Intervention Trained officers, trained social workers and clinicians engaging in Case 
Management—the tailored approach is key in supporting the Safety Net Collaborative and CPD’s support 
of survivors of domestic violence.  It is also recommended that the City of Cambridge support Persons 
Assisting The Homeless (PATH) (Item #2 below) workers as proposed by the Central Square Business 
Improvement District (BID) as a one (1) year pilot program. The City is currently working with the 
leadership of the BID on proposed funding for this fall. That program should begin as soon as practicable.  
The CCRT, (Item #1 below) should be considered for implementation by the City of Cambridge for FY22 
and funded through normal budgeting measures.  Below options Item #3 and Item #4 were considered but 
determined to be less viable options at this time.  

1.  Community Crisis Response Team (CCRT): utilizing a previous model within Cambridge Health 

Alliance, the CCRT, City or CHA could hire 4 to 6 clinicians to provide a mobile response within the 
model to enhance mental health services to the City of Cambridge. Although CCRT has not been in 
operation since 2009, CHA has continued to deliver mental health services and programs recognized for 
supporting mental health patients and individuals in crisis.  These support services are currently offered 
through Integrated Behavioral Health Services, Specialty Mental Health Clinics and Psychiatry 
Department. Reestablishing CCRT would result in immediate information & referral services, 
psychiatric evaluations, crisis interventions and treatment (including psychopharmacology), short-term 
community crisis stabilization programs and referral for ongoing treatment. The enhanced CCRT with a 
mobile unit would respond as an alternate mental health response. In addition to staffing costs, a 
space(s) to operate from and vehicles would be additional budgetary concerns. 

2.  Person Assisting The Homeless (PATH): This proposal from the Central Square BID would provide 
outreach workers to operate within Central Square who would provide outreach, field based case 
management and referrals for individuals who are unhoused. Under this model, the BID would hire 3 
outreach workers with specialized training around mental health and addiction. The outreach team will 
provide services within Central Square and connect individuals to existing local and regional services. 
A one-year pilot of this program could provide valuable data on the effectiveness of adding outreach 
responders trained in mental health response and harm reduction to the Central Square area. That 
evaluation could inform the best path forward for a city-wide approach to providing an alternative 
Public Safety Crisis Response System and/or enhanced stabilization options such as a “restoration or 
sobering center”. 

3.  Cambridge BEST Team: utilizing the existing infrastructure of the Boston Emergency Service Team, 
Cambridge could hire 4 to 6 clinicians to provide a mobile response within the City of Cambridge. 
BEST teams offer a highly integrated system of crisis evaluation and treatment services to the greater 
Boston area; BEST offers immediate information & referrals, psychiatric evaluation, crisis intervention

4.  Additional Mental Health Professionals: Cambridge can onboard a group of mental health 

professionals who are available to respond to calls for service at the request of emergency dispatch 
(after screening), or on-scene law enforcement officers who determine a non-police response is 
appropriate, or via a non-emergency number. If this option is selected, the additional mental health 
professionals should be embedded in an existing department or affiliated agency, such as CHA. As 
mentioned earlier, this type of mobile response would need to be heavily integrated with Emergency 
Communications and therefore may require additional supervision, personnel and infrastructure within 
that department.  

It is critical that whichever model (or amalgamation of models) the City selects as a non-police response to 
mental health crises has some empirical evidence of its potential efficacy in serving the most vulnerable in 
the City of Cambridge and complements existing resources and work that is currently underway.  It is also 
essential the model be integrated with the established agencies and services in the City that have established 
relationships, outreach and work with vulnerable populations. These agencies include but are not limited to: 
First Step, Eliot PATH and DMH Homeless Outreach Team, Vinfen, Bay Cove, the Cambridge 
Multidisciplinary Outreach Team, Cambridge Multi-Service Center, BEST, Bridge Over Troubled Waters 
and the Needle Exchange. There should be consideration for incorporating additional existing resources to 
the model such as Cambridge Community Response Network (CCRN) and Riverside Trauma Center.  

Currently, CPD is working in collaboration with the Health Equity Research Lab (CHA/Harvard Medical 
School) for a large-scale evaluation of City’s efforts with the adult homeless and mentally ill population 
that will combine CPD, Cambridge Health Alliance and Middlesex Jail data to examine rates of arrest, 
recidivism, incarceration and service utilization for vulnerable populations.  This evaluation will provide 
additional information to continue the work in the city of Cambridge based on our community needs. 

Moving Forward:  

It is critical that the City of Cambridge continue to lead reformatory efforts of delivery of services to its 
citizens; this includes Public Safety and all of its apparatus, particularly how Police Services are delivered. 
It is recommended that a Guiding Coalition (or Task Force) be created to examine future possibilities. The 
Task Force would begin with a loose vision, “to examine ways to limit the Police Response to calls for 
service without diminishing Public Safety or Community Safety, while increasing Community Cohesion to 
include restorative processes…”. To accomplish this vision, the Task Force would work with Cambridge 
Residents, the City Manager, the Police Commissioner and other City Department leaders to access overall 
needs and desires, as well as implementation strategies. Because of the need for widespread engagement, it 
is recommended that a City Manager appointed Task Force work collaboratively with the City Council’s 
Civic Unity Committee and the Human Services and Veterans Committee. It is anticipated that the 
recommendations coming from this Task Force will help to shape the future of Public Safety, not just in 
Cambridge, but becomes the prevailing model of Public Safety in the Nation.  

We hope that you find this response satisfactory; as always, City Departments will be available to answer 
questions that may require advanced expertise.

Supervising Engineer 
Cambridge Department of Public Works 
147 Hampshire Street 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
RE:  Curb Cut Application 
10 Acorn Park Drive 
 
 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 
 
 
Dear Mr. Niranjan: 
 
On behalf of SXC Alewife Hotel, LLC, BSC Group has completed the City of Cambridge’s 
online application for a curb cut at 10 Acorn Park Drive to service the AC Marriott Hotel.  
The AC Hotel is located within the Cambridge Discovery Park development and currently 
has access from Discovery Way, a private way, running parallel to Acorn Park Drive. 
 
The proposed curb cut and driveway have been designed to provide one-way only access 
from Acorn Park Drive in accordance with the City of Cambridge requirements and the 
comments communicated at our site meetings in order to improve site access for hotel guests 
and deliveries, and to provide improved emergency vehicle access to the Hotel.   
 
Visitors to the Hotel exiting Route 2 via the Alewife Station Access Road currently travel 
along Acorn Park Drive to Discovery Way in order to access the Hotel.  The proposed drive 
will have improved wayfinding and access to the Hotel by providing direct access to the 
Hotel from Acorn Park Drive, including for ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency 
vehicles.   
 
We are available to discuss further at your convenience anytime.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact our office with any questions or inquiries you may have.  I can be reached at 
dbiancavilla@bscgroup.com or at 617-896-4347 or my cell phone:  978-857-0513. 
 
 
Very truly yours, 
BSC Group, Inc.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 

C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound. 

If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 

D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and 
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 

If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of 
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager 
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and 
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be 
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement 
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane 
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (c) and (d) shall result in a one-
year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C. 

On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality 
along 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or 
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between  Beech Street and Dudley Street, 

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the 
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick- 
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain 
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate 
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council 
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation 
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three 
years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 

F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 

G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, 
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street, 
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and 

(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street from 
Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities. 

By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager

shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 

 

 

 

 

H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G. 

I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and 
H shall be shown on a publicly accessible website. Such website shall also track exactly where 
those Bicycle Lane Miles were installed, and the distance of each contiguous segment of 
Bicycle Lane Miles installed. Such website shall be established by no later than May 31, 2021 
and updated twice yearly thereafter. All other reports and updates required by this Ordinance 
shall also be uploaded to such website. 

J. Until July 1, 2022, if the City Manager determines that revenue shortfalls due to the 
coronavirus pandemic make any deadlines contained in subsections C through I financially 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadlines. For any such 
proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the City Council to 
be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City Council shall 
vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take place by July 
1, 2022. 

K. Until July 1, 2022 if the City Manager determines that unavoidable delays in public outreach 
activities due to the coronavirus pandemic make the deadline contained in subsection C 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadline by up to four months. 
For any such proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the 
City Council to be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City 
Council shall vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take 
place by July 1, 2022.

Cambridge, by inserting a new section 11.207, AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
OVERLAY, to read as follows: 
11.207.1        Purpose and Intent  
The  purpose  of  this  Section  is  to  promote  the  public  good  by 
supporting  the  development  of  housing  that  is  affordable  to 
households earning up to 100% of area median income. The intent 
of this Section is to allow incremental increases in density, limited

limitations for residential developments in which all units are made 
permanently affordable to households earning up to 100% of area 
median  income  (referred  to  as  “AHO  Projects,”  as  defined  in 
Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance); to incentivize the reuse of 
existing  buildings  in  order  to  create  AHO  Projects  that  are  more 
compatible  with  established  neighborhood  character;  to  promote 
the city’s urban design objectives in Section 19.30 of this Zoning 
Ordinance  while  enabling  AHO  Projects  to  be  permitted  as-of-
right,  subject 
to  non-binding  advisory  design  consultation 
procedures  that  follow  all  design  objectives  set  forth  within  this 
Zoning  Ordinance  and  the  results  of  the  design  review  process 
shall be provided to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust; and 
to  apply  such  standards  throughout  the  City,  to  promote  city 
planning goals of achieving greater socioeconomic diversity and a 
more equitable distribution of affordable housing citywide.

An  AHO  Project  shall  be  permitted  as-of-right  if  it  meets 
all  of  the  standards  set  forth  in  this  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay  in  place  of  the  requirements  otherwise  applicable 
in the zoning district. Any development not meeting all of 
the standards set  forth in this Affordable Housing Overlay 
shall be subject to the requirements otherwise applicable in 
the  zoning  district,  including  any  requirements  for  special 
permits. 

11.207.3

income exceeds the eligibility limits set forth above, 
but  may  not  exceed  one  hundred  twenty  percent 
(120%)  of  AMI  for  more  than  one  year  after  that 
Eligible  Household’s  gross  household  income  has 
been  verified  to  exceed  such  percentage,  unless 
otherwise  restricted  pursuant 
to  an  applicable 
housing subsidy program which has been approved 
by CDD. 

(vi)  Notwithstanding  the  requirements  set  forth  in  (i) 
through (v) above, an owner may voluntarily choose

Advisory Design Consultation Procedure 

11.207.8 
Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO 
Project  shall  comply  with  the  following  procedure,  which  is 
intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and 
staff input into the design of the project. 
(a) 

to  guide 

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance 
the  City’s  desired  outcomes  for  the  form  and  character  of 
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable  housing  units,  AHO  Projects  are  permitted  to 
have  a  greater  height,  scale,  and  density  than  other 
developments  permitted  by the zoning  for a given district. 
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that 
are  compatible  with  the  existing  neighborhood  context  or 
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 
The  City’s  “Design  Guidelines  for  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay,” along with other design objectives and guidelines 
established  for  the  part  of  the  city  in  which  the  AHO 
Project  is  located,  are  intended  to  inform  the  design  of 
AHO  Projects  and 
the  Planning  Board’s 
consultation  and  report  as  set  forth  below.  It  is  intended 
that  designers  of  AHO  Projects,  City  staff,  the  Planning 
Board,  and  the  general  public  will  be  open  to  creative 
variations  from  any  detailed  provisions  set  forth  in  such 
objectives  and  guidelines  as  long  as  the  core  values 
expressed are being served. 
At  least  two  community  meetings  shall  be  scheduled  at  a 
time  and  location  that  is  convenient  to  residents  in 
proximity to the project site. The Community Development 
Department  (CDD)  shall  be  notified  of  the  time  and 
location  of  such  meetings,  and  shall  give  notification  to 
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or 
private  street  or  way,  and  abutters  to  the  abutters  within 
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which 
the  AHO  Project  is  proposed  and  to  any  individual  or 
organization  who  each  year  files  with  CDD  a  written 
request  for  such  notification,  or  to  any  other  individual  or 
organization CDD may wish to notify. 
(i) 

The purpose of the first community meeting shall be 
for the developer to share the site and street context 
analysis  with  neighborhood  residents  and  other 
interested  parties  prior  to  building  design,  and 
receive feedback from community members.

households earning up to 100% of area median income. The intent 
of this Section is to allow incremental increases in density, limited 
increases  in  height,  and  relaxation  of  certain  other  zoning 
limitations for residential developments in which all units are made 
permanently affordable to households earning up to 100% of area 
median  income  (referred  to  as  “AHO  Projects,”  as  defined  in 
Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance); to incentivize the reuse of 
existing  buildings  in  order  to  create  AHO  Projects  that  are  more 
compatible  with  established  neighborhood  character;  to  promote 
the city’s urban design objectives in Section 19.30 of this Zoning 
Ordinance  while  enabling  AHO  Projects  to  be  permitted  as-of-
to  non-binding  advisory  design  consultation 
right,  subject 
procedures  that  follow  all  design  objectives  set  forth  within  this 
Zoning  Ordinance  and  the  results  of  the  design  review  process 
shall be provided to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust; and 
to  apply  such  standards  throughout  the  City,  to  promote  city 
planning goals of achieving greater socioeconomic diversity and a 
more equitable distribution of affordable housing citywide.

except for driveway access which shall be limited to a total 
of thirty (30) feet of width for any individual driveway for 
each one hundred (100) feet of lot frontage. 

Pedestrian  entrances  to  buildings  shall  be  visible  from  the 
street,  except  where  the  building  itself  is  not  visible  from 
the street due to its location. All pedestrian entrances shall 
be  accessible  by  way  of  access  routes  that  are  separated 
from motor vehicle access drives. 

A building footprint exceeding two hundred and fifty (250) 
feet in length, measured parallel to the street, shall contain 
a massing recess extending back at least fifteen (15) feet in 
depth measured from and perpendicular to the front lot line 
and  at  least fifteen  (15)  feet  in  width  measured  parallel to

Building  façades  shall  incorporate  architectural  elements 
that project or recess by at least two feet from the adjacent 
section of the façade. Such projecting or recessed elements 
shall  occur  on  an  average  interval  of  40  linear  horizontal 
feet  or  less  for  portions  of  the  façade  directly  facing  a

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance 
the  City’s  desired  outcomes  for  the  form  and  character  of 
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable  housing  units,  AHO  Projects  are  permitted  to 
have  a  greater  height,  scale,  and  density  than  other 
developments permitted  by the zoning for a given district. 
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that 
are  compatible  with  the  existing  neighborhood  context  or 
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 

The  City’s  “Design  Guidelines  for  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay,” along with other design objectives and guidelines 
established  for  the  part  of  the  city  in  which  the  AHO 
Project  is  located,  are  intended  to  inform  the  design  of 
AHO  Projects  and 
the  Planning  Board’s 
consultation  and  report  as  set  forth  below.  It  is  intended 
that  designers  of  AHO  Projects,  City  staff,  the  Planning 
Board,  and  the  general  public  will  be  open  to  creative 
variations  from  any  detailed  provisions  set  forth  in  such 
objectives  and  guidelines  as  long  as  the  core  values 
expressed are being served. 

to  guide 

At  least  two  community  meetings  shall  be  scheduled  at  a 
time  and  location  that  is  convenient  to  residents  in 
proximity to the project site. The Community Development 
Department  (CDD)  shall  be  notified  of  the  time  and 
location  of  such  meetings,  and  shall  give  notification  to 
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or 
private  street  or  way,  and  abutters  to  the  abutters  within 
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which 
the  AHO  Project  is  proposed  and  to  any  individual  or 
organization  who  each  year  files  with  CDD  a  written 
request  for  such  notification,  or  to  any  other  individual  or 
organization CDD may wish to notify. 

(i) 

(ii) 

The purpose of the first community meeting shall be 
for the developer to share the site and street context 
analysis  with  neighborhood  residents  and  other 
interested  parties  prior  to  building  design,  and 
receive feedback from community members.

questions or seek additional information from the developer 
or from City staff. 

The Planning Board shall evaluate the proposal for general 
compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  Section,  for 
consistency with City development guidelines prepared for 
the  “Design  Guidelines  for 
the  proposal  area  and

of  other  planned  or  programmed  public  or  private 
development  activities  in  the  vicinity,  and  for  consistency 
with  the  Citywide  Urban  Design  Objectives  set  forth  in 
Section 19.30. The Board may also suggest specific project 
adjustments  and  alterations  to  further  the  purposes  of  this 
Ordinance.  The  Board  shall  communicate  its  findings  in  a 
written report provided to the developer and to CDD within 
20 days of the design consultation. 

The  developer  may  then  make  revisions  to  the  design,  in 
consultation with CDD staff, and shall submit a revised set 
of  documents  along  with  a  narrative  summary  of  the 
Planning Board’s comments and changes made in response 
to those comments. 

The  Planning  Board  shall  review  and  discuss  the  revised 
documents at a second design consultation meeting, which 
shall  proceed  in  accordance  with  Paragraphs  (c)  and  (d) 
above.  Following  the  second  design  consultation,  the 
Planning Board may submit a revised report and either the 
revised report or if there are no revisions the initial report 
shall  become  the  final  report  (the  “Final  Report”).  Any 
additional  design  consultations  to  review  further  revisions 
may occur only at the discretion and on the request of the 
developer or the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it 

Packet Pg. 168

 
ORDERED:

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours,

33 Bristol Street - Curb Cut Application - Certiﬁ ed Mail Receipts for Abuttors

RE: 33 Bristol Street – Introductions and Curb Cut Modification 
 
 
Dear Mr. Pereira, 

We are writing to you to introduce ourselves as the new owners of 33 Bristol Street, 
next door to your building at 8-10 Berkshire Street. As you might imagine. We are 
very happy to be moving into your neighborhood.  Dave and Deb, the previous 
owners, told us many good things about all of their neighbors and life in your 
neighborhood. Those stories were a big part of what made us so excited about 33 
Bristol Street. 

There will be two of us living in the building. We are architects and teachers. We 
recently returned to Cambridge after having been away for about 15 years. We have 
two cats, one car, and like to cook. 

We are also writing to let you know a bit about our plans. Here are some of the 
things that we hope to do: 

•  Relocation of the roll-up door and curb cut (the City has asked us to send you 
the attached “Abuttor’s Form” as part of their approval process. We would

RE: 33 Bristol Street – Introductions and Curb Cut Modification 
 
 
Dear Maria and Liberta Pereira, 

We are writing to you to introduce ourselves as the new owners of 33 Bristol Street, 
near your building at 15 Berkshire Street. As you might imagine. We are very happy 
to be moving into your neighborhood.  Dave and Deb, the previous owners, told us 
many good things about all of their neighbors and life in your neighborhood. Those 
stories were a big part of what made us so excited about 33 Bristol Street. 

There will be two of us living in the building. We are architects and teachers. We 
recently returned to Cambridge after having been away for about 15 years. We have 
two cats, one car, and like to cook. 

We are also writing to let you know a bit about our plans. Here are some of the 
things that we hope to do: 

•  Relocation of the roll-up door and curb cut (the City has asked us to send you 
the attached “Abuttor’s Form” as part of their approval process. We would 
much appreciate your taking a moment to fill this form out, sign it, and return 
it to us in the enclosed envelope). 

•  Replacement of windows to make them energy efficient. We are also enlarging 
two windows to get more light into the building and adding a skylight in the 
upper roof. 

•  A new door into the side yard facing 8-10 Berkshire Street.

RE: 33 Bristol Street – Introductions and Curb Cut Modification 
 
 
Dear Mr. Chuang and Ms. Kuan, 

We are writing to you to introduce ourselves as the new owners of 33 Bristol Street, 
near your building at 36 Bristol Street. As you might imagine. We are very happy to 
be moving into your neighborhood.  Dave and Deb, the previous owners, told us 
many good things about all of their neighbors and life in your neighborhood. Those 
stories were a big part of what made us so excited about 33 Bristol Street. 

There will be two of us living in the building. We are architects and teachers. We 
recently returned to Cambridge after having been away for about 15 years. We have 
two cats, one car, and like to cook. 

We are also writing to let you know a bit about our plans. Here are some of the 
things that we hope to do: 

•  Relocation of the roll-up door and curb cut (the City has asked us to send you 
the attached “Abuttor’s Form” as part of their approval process. We would 
much appreciate your taking a moment to fill this form out, sign it, and return 
it to us in the enclosed envelope). 

•  Replacement of windows to make them energy efficient. We are also enlarging 
two windows to get more light into the building and adding a skylight in the 
upper roof. 

•  A new door into the side yard facing 8-10 Berkshire Street. 
•  Reopening the original 1920s garage doors on Bristol Street to make them 

windows. 

•  A roof deck on the one-story area of the building along Bristol Street. 
•  A new door onto the roof deck. 
•  A solar energy system on the upper roof. 

The contractor for this work will be Jay Fishlin of Fishlin Construction. We have 
spoken with Jay about wanting to make sure that construction does not interfere 
with your property and lives. He is mindful of those issues and will be aware of your

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours,

     City Clerk 

 

 

 

 

 
      

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

hereby _______ approve      _______ disapprove of said driveway petition.

Dear City Council:

City Council; Clerk; City Manager

Bayer; Ashley Herring
Regarding Policy Order #149

Demonstrations over the past few months have called for reform, defunding or complete abolition of police 
departments. In response to the national movement, City of Cambridge elected officials have heeded the calls for real 
structural police reform right here in Cambridge. Since June 2020, the City Council has submitted and/or passed several 
policy orders such as Policy Order # 133. One order that is up for serious consideration is Policy Order # 149 to 
implement a CAHOOTS-like program in Cambridge.

CAHOOTS stands for Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets. The first CAHOOTS program was founded in Eugene, 
OR in 1989 as a partnership between the Eugene Police Department and the White Bird Clinic, a nonprofit mental health 
crisis intervention initiative. Its primary purpose has been to respond to Eugene's mental health 911 calls with crisis 
response teams trained in de-escalation, harm-reduction strategies, and mental health support. While we believe a 
community-based safety response program is an important next step in moving toward a more just Cambridge, we do 
not fully endorse this CAHOOTs model because it is a program that collaborates with police. Cahoots is defined in the 
Merriam Webster Dictionary as “colluding or conspiring together secretly”. Any community safety initiatives should 
operate openly, transparently, and independent of the Cambridge Police Department (CPD).

So far, the city’s efforts to develop an alternative public safety crisis response system have only involved city agencies --
Department of Human Service Programs, Cambridge Public Health Department, Emergency Communications, the City 
Manager’s Office-- and includes the Cambridge Police Department. As far as we know, in these efforts to develop 
alternatives, the City has not engaged the communities and community-based organizations that are most harmed by 
policing in its current form. In particular, the Black and Brown communities, which are the most heavily policed have not 
been at the table. Policing in Cambridge, as elsewhere in the United States, continues to uphold and enforce structural 
racism, classism and ableism. We are deeply concerned that grassroots and community based organizations have not 
been part of the process in designing, implementing, and assessing alternative safety systems.

In response to this lack of community-based process, we propose that:

•

•

•

In creating and implementing a community safety response program, the City Council include input from Black 
and Brown led community groups such as Goree House, The Black Students Union at CRLS, YWCA Cambridge, 
Adbar Ethiopian Women's Alliance, The Haiti Initiative (SUD) , Community For Us By Us, Black Yard, M4BL 
Cambridge and others.

The City hires an autonomous group of Black and Brown young people to facilitate focus groups in public 
housing and other community spaces that will determine the needs of the communities most impacted by 
policing.

The City ensures that any community based model for safety and crisis response is rooted in frameworks that 
center the self-determination and needs of those most impacted and does not engage carceral systems as 
solutions to address harm.

We, the undersigned, suggest that any Cambridge Community-based safety response program:

•

First and foremost, operate autonomously from the Police Department; and NO first responders should be 
mandated reporters. 

Second, domestic response teams should be curated to include a support system for those involved in the 
domestic situation. Specifically, rather than police investigators, detectives, and armed officers, there should be 
survivor advocates. Responders to domestic situations where armed violence is not an immediate threat should 
not include armed police officers. The first response team should include crisis counselors who are trained in 
suicide prevention, assessment, and intervention. This team should also include community street workers who 
are trained in conflict resolution, mediation, and substance abuse related disorders; and should be trained in de-
escalation, mental health support, and should be grounded in non-punitive practices.

Lastly, this, and every program, under the budget-line item of ‘community safety’ should be subject to extensive 
and transparent assessment. The aim of all community safety programs should be to decrease the number of 
arrests and citations each year and ensure the safety and well being of all Cambridge residents.

We know that with a recession comes poverty and desperation. The city needs to be prepared to support our 
economically vulnerable populations by finding alternatives to arrests and incarceration. We call for immediate and 
direct reallocation of funds to support POC/minority-owned businesses in Cambridge, job training and support for 
young people (up to age 35), and community-based counseling services. We also call for increased funding for universal 
affordable childcare and all-day day camps (from 8:00am - 6:30pm); we recommend collaboration with existing 
programs such as the Summer Urban Program to achieve this goal.  

As current and former Cambridge residents, we know that Cambridge is a vibrant city filled with community centers, 
organizations and programs that work to build systems of safety through trust and care rather than punishment. It is 
these programs should be funded and supported rather than institutions like the CPD, that neither address the root 
causes of harm nor ensure safety and wellbeing for our most vulnerable populations. This is an opportunity for the city 
of Cambridge to move away from top down policy practices and to move toward ground up community based solutions 
to our most pressing problems.

In Struggle and Solidarity,

The Black Response

My Comments at City Charter Council Meeting
CityCouncilComments20200923.pdf

Hello City Councilors and Clerk, 

Attached are the comments I presented at the meeting today. The committee I requested is not 
necessarily an elected Charter Commission, but rather could be an advisory panel, but I'd prefer that the 
City Manager's Office doesn't take charge of the entire committee selection process. 

thank you,

Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors, 

Thank you for finally convening a discussion about our city charter. To get directly to the point… 

While I believe our recent city managers have done well in many areas, and I believe they have done 
what they feel is best for the city, they have had extraordinary power to decide what issues to address 
and how to address them with very little ability for residents, or even you, our representatives, to 
influence city policy, other than through polite requests.  It’s like Fidel Castro in Cuba – some things 
worked out great for the citizens, other things not so much, but nobody had a say. 

We have lots of boards, commisions, task forces, and working groups, but they are all through 
appointment by the city manager’s office, so the discussions are – naturally - biased by the selection of 
participants.  For example, anyone who’s been paying attention over the past couple decades realizes I 
probably know more than almost everyone in the city about Alewife flooding, wetlands, and wetlands 
regulations, but my applications to the Conservation Commission are repeatedly rejected, even with 
long open vacancies.  It’s common among the people who have been vocal about their concern and 
active in the city to be excluded from the conversation because they might bring up inconvenient truths 
to consider. 

So we come up with plans and policy without the full range of discussion, that gets further skewed in the 
final reports.  For example, the final Alewife Plan excluded a pedestrian bridge over the commuter rail 
tracks, something that was extensively discussed.  It took an extraordinary effort by the resident 
members of the working group to unanimously present a letter of support for the bridge, which was 
brought back in the presentation as handsketched, similar to how our President took a Sharpie to a 
hurricane map. 

A couple other examples… This Monday, you discussed a city manager report responding to your policy 
order to have specific resident stakeholders discuss future plans with the new owners of Jerry’s Pond.  
Since the city manager did not address the main point of the policy order, you had to set up your own 
discussion in committee.  Also, a while back, the Climate Safety Petition was presented to you as 
emergency considerations for zoning to require climate resiliency.  It was agreed that the issues needed 
rapid attention with all the development occurring without climate safety rules in place, and it was 
decided to instead order the city manager to address the issues within 3 months. We are still scheduling 
meetings through the end of this year, and it will be 3 years before we might see zoning enacted vs. the 
3 months for a response in the policy order. 

We need more ability to influence the things that matter to residents that may not matter as much to 
the singular leader, who does many good things, but has his own vision for the city for which the 
residents have little ability to direct. 

I think the council should set up its own independent review committee of the city charter made up of 
residents, as has been done in other communities, and to have a stated time period for future reviews.

Special meeting comment

We have seen city manager DePasquale shrug off requests from the democratically elected City Council to explain his 
failure to do things he was asked to do, most obviously when he was asked to start on a municipal broadband plan for 
Cambridge. These actions make him a de facto mayor that was never elected.

I want this reconsideration of the city charter, ultimately, to ensure this kind of problem never recurs.

There may be a way to do this besides moving to a traditional mayor system. Councillors should explain concrete legal 
barriers that keep them from directing the city manager and getting him to produce information about his work and 
knowledge.

If there is no way to smash these barriers under the-city council system, then we must leave it. The chain of rule from 
the citizens to the elected representatives to the actions of the city government must be reestablished.

Jim Kang, resident

Peace Be Unto You

Let’s Review the Rev. Dr. Bennett situation! It looks like Criminal Conspiracy to us!
Please circulate this to everyone you know. To every law enforcement agency you can reach. To everyone you think should 
know about this with letters to Middlesex Probate and Family Court, 121 Third Street, Cambridge, MA. 617 768 5808 to let them
know your thoughts about how they function. letters to fax number 617 225 0781.

We need lawyers, legal researchers, people skilled in IT, those in PR, everyone who can help. Let us know who you are and 
how you can support what we are doing. This is clearly headed to a substantial law suit with side issues – like medical 
malpractice, legal malpractice and more.

Clearly, this is going through the legal system in a huge way. We are getting prepared so we can do our bit and the research will 
continue. This is a lawyers dream – this ‘incident’ in the ‘elder law’ area. The money lawyers can and are making in this area – it 
is unbelievably foul, especially when you think of the suffering and destruction of the end of life of so many elderly people, most 
of whom cannot take this on to fight and object to what is happening to them. The Donaldson/Bennett’s are rare. He is 87, she is 
82. We guess the folks pushing to take their assets thought they would be a push-over.

This is an area the press refuses to cover and so the people who have perpetrated this on others evade scrutiny. This is what
happened with the media pre-1960’s. The horrible things the KKK, the White Supremacist, the Nazi’s and those supporting them 
did escaped notice because racism and all other forms of bigotry were routinely not covered in the press. Ms Donaldson comes 
from a journalists family because her grandfather co-founded the Louisiana Weekly and worked extensively with the Pittsburgh 
Courier (the first office in NOLA of the Pittsburgh Courier was in her family’s living room) and other African American 
publications. His goal was to have these very racist, sexist, extreme bigoted actions be journalistically researched and published 
so they would be known and not done under the cover of silence. Sorrowfully, that is what is happening in this society today.

As more is uncovered this gets uglier. Some of what follows is repetitive – much is new to the blog. If you have additional 
information, please contact us.

We very much appreciate the person who put the papers through the mail slot at the Donaldson/Bennett home. We wanted to 
know the genesis of the charge against Marceline Donaldson of “elder abuse”. We found all kind of possibilities, but found the 
real genesis in those papers turned over to us so we could move ahead with investigating what happened, how, who, when. It 
made us sick to our stomachs when we found so many lawyers involved in previous cases. It looked as though the goal is to 
drain the assets of this quite, shy, lovely man so their estates can benefit.

Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services made the charge backed up by the attorney they ‘appointed’ for Rev. Dr. 
Bennett while making sure he would not be able to have an attorney of his or his family’s choosing.

The CPCS in Boston saw to it that Cheri Myette would be paid even when they were contacted by Ms. Donaldson who wanted 
to know why an attorney was appointed for her husband calling him “indigent” when he was not. This state agency was 
cooperating with a conspiracy to take away Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett’s ability to function in this life – to walk, talk, think, etc. by 
funding a lie.

As we looked closer, Ms. Donaldson hired attorneys for herself and her husband. She paid their requested retainer which 
amounted to several thousands of dollars and they could not do their job because the state was paying attorneys, as requested, 
by one of the State of Massachusetts Agencies – Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services is funded – either in 
whole or partially by the State of Massachusetts and they also have Federal support. That support is used to keep assets from
one generation of African Americans, Jews, Latina’s LGBTQ people and other minorities from passing to the next generation. 
Instead those assets are going into the pockets of the descendants of white northern european attorneys and their supporting 
staff.

A family, which hired attorneys, paid the retainers, called “indigent” because of the greed of those pushing this action. It is one of 
the most disgusting things we have come across. It is certainly a way to drain the minority community of many assets and very
quickly. It is a way to reduce the number of minorities able to succeed in this society and to keep them as the “bottom” – making 
the least amount of money while taking the largest risks – something which is showing clearly in this COVID-19 pandemic.

We believe this was and is a conspiracy to destroy a black family – to destroy a black marriage and so much more. One thing 
that happened with the motion Attorney Myette filed was to separate a husband and wife of 37 years. Against their wishes and 
without their knowledge they were legally separated. We understand jokes were made about Ms. Donaldson after they had 
clearly seen her as a very negative stereotype of black females. None of them had even met Ms. Donaldson or Rev. Dr. 
Bennett.

Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services instituted with MGH’s help and compliance a “rule” that Ms. Donaldson 
could not visit her husband without an MGH Security Guard and a Policeman present. On her first visit, she noticed the ward in 
which he was kept was locked and there were Security Guards in the hallway. Others stood close to her during her visit –
apparently to make sure they heard everything said between Rev. Dr. Bennett and his wife.

During these five weeks, Ms. Donaldson was able to visit her husband only three times. An MGH Security Guard threatened to 
physically throw her out of MGH if she didn’t leave – on a day when she arrived, having made an appointment for the visit and 
was denied with the Security Guard telling her she could not see her husband because he had filed a complaint against her for 
abuse and she would not be allowed to go to White 10th Floor at MGH where he was being kept. That happened several times 
when she arrived – one excuse after another was used by MGH Security personnel to keep her from visiting. That happened 
under whose orders?

We have reproduced here a letter to the attorneys involved sent by Attorney O’Sullivan and it makes your stomach churn.

In it, Attorney O’Sullivan actually describes the process by which one is “incapacitated”.. It starts in the hospital – in this case 
MGH, a hospital that needs to investigate what is happening within its confines when one department does a great job and 
another does everything to destroy a patients’ ability to function.

We also have a letter hand written by an employee of the Post Office who saw Rev. Dr. Bennett frequently as he went to the 
post office daily over many years. The letter is copied here and says what great shape Dr. Bennett was in on March 5th, the day 
he was seen with his wife in the post officer laughing and talking to a friend X.C. who commented on how great he looked. The 
very next day white Cambridge policemen arrived at his house to force him into MGH. That even after the section 12 filed 
against him had been lifted and he was sent home with “no medicines prescribed.”

4.4.a

When he was discharged from MGH on April 13th he did not look so good. He looked like a man who had just come out of a 
concentration camp. He could not walk without extreme help – even with a walker. He was confused as to where he was. He 
was clearly terrified until he saw his wife.

He was sent home from MGH with no shoes on his feet because they were so swollen none of his shoes fit. I could go on to 
what was done to this African American man in a medical action started and carried forward by Dr. Rebecca Warner who is 
apparently the medical person who gave the diagnosis of “incapacitated” after she filled him full of hallucinatory drugs, anti-
psychotics and so much more which no one before her had prescribed. In fact psychiatrists before her deemed no medicines 
were necessary and Dr. Bennett should not have been brought to MGH to be sectioned.

When he did not turn up at Mount Auburn Hospital, which is the hospital Dr. Rebecca Warner wanted Rev. Dr. Bennett sent to –
she followed him to MGH to do what they were prepared to do at Mount Auburn Hospital – treat Dr. Bennett in such a way that 
he would be quickly “incapacitated” and ready to be forced into a nursing home. Especially after having his wife was declared
“abusive” so a Guardianship would be necessary to make decisions about the drawing down of his assets, among other 
decisions that needed to be made. Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services was right there to make sure the person 
and Guardianship Corporation so chosen would benefit them – and probably the future career of those young women making 
such horrendous decisions over the life of this African American family.

To what can we compare this? SLAVE HOLDERS – ripped slaves from their families. They separated families with deception 
and with speed. Clearly, speed was one of the motivating factors here.

They deceived the enslaved by not telling them what was happening and transported them quickly using – in many cases – the 
then police, the group established to hunt, capture, intimidate, take away the liberty of human beings who happened to be 
Africans. They were transported quickly to avert what the law might dictate is given a chance and given the truth. they were 
removed from being able to contact attorneys or other witnesses. Relevant and important papers were hidden and/or destroyed.

Ms. Donaldson contacted Ms. Paulette Marie with the CPCS to talk about what was happening with her husband and to make a 
complaint against Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services and Attorney Cheri Myette. Ms. Marie explained to Ms. 
Donaldson how one could have assets and still be considered “indigent” qualifying for the state support. She did not ask Ms. 
Donaldson for any information that might be used to investigate or move Ms. Myette out of the way by taking away the State 
monies paying for her to do a job which should have been done by the private attorneys Ms. Donaldson hired. She did say 
several times how the attorney chosen was the next on the list. That was not true, but Ms. Marie would not counter such a 
suggestion. She also had no comment when Ms. Donaldson wanted to know how Rev. Dr. Bennett could be considered 
‘indigent” when his family paid several thousands of dollars to hire attorneys to represent him and they could not because the 
state sponsored attorney was court appointed and was not going to be replaced by anyone.

We could go on for pages, but we will stop here and hope for more feedback from you. Please pass this on to as many people 
as possible. We are most grateful to those who passed this on so we were able to get a copy of the motion which started all of 
this.

God keep you safe in all that you do and may you and your family never experience anything even close to this.

All of us at Bettina’s

Sept 21, 2020 
To the City Council and Manager 
 
Dear Council, 
There are several items I am interested in. 

#188- I support the reconfiguration of Harvard Square to be more pedestrian- friendly while 
finding compromises in invigorating its streets and businesses.  
 
#  129-  I  hope  in  the  second  reading  of  the  AHO-  you  identify  the  lack  of  intent,  design 
guidelines  and  actionable  legislative  language  missing  in  this  document  as  mentioned  by  
Councilor Carlone.  Without them, developers will not be held accountable and indeed benefit 
from  their  own  nebulous  interpretation.      There  is  no  specific  standard  to  measure  either 
success  or  failure  and  I  highly  doubt  that  those  proponents  involved  would  confess  to 
something not working. An independent review board is crucial as is city planning.  This could 
have been better.  
    
#198- I support Councilor Nolan’s reconsideration of the Manager’s contract. While several 
councilors advocated for a one-yr extension, the lead Councilor negotiated an 18 month 
contract with a generous 2.5% living increase on a truncated agreement bigger than other 
officials. Whether by design or not, some of the most important decisions fall to the late hours 
past reasonable comprehension.   
 
It is usually coupled with the false choice, “if we don’t vote now, pass something now, give in 
now, we will lose and they will walk away”. I heard this tactic with the Mass & Main tower in 
Central Square. “If we don’t give the developers what they want, they will walk”, which 
wouldn’t have happened.  This particular councilor’s fast and fearful arguments have pushed 
through many an un-cooked policy and protégés are doing the same thing seen in passing the 
AHO out of the Ordinance Committee.  Indeed, this IS about PROCESS AND PROCEDURE.    
 
That one councilor can negotiate solely and then use scare tactics to get the vote is 
manipulative, confusing and depriving fellow councilors their arguments.  This is old school 
politics.  This also illustrates what Lawrence Lessig calls “Institutional Corruption”, not the 
people themselves- but what becomes normal procedure which is anti-democratic. It is a 
slippery slope when procedure gets sloppy.  The manager contract may have the same result, 
but it should be reconsidered if for nothing else then a formality and procedure.

City Council; Clerk
CM contract

I was incredulous that all but 2 city council members, Mr Zondrvan and Mr Sobrino-Wheeler, voted to extend the CM's 
contract with its totally unjustified salary and benefits terms. His performance in no way supports his contract being 
renewed at all, much less at a higher salary. It is a mystery to me and I'm sure to others why the council has tolerated his 
stonewalling of municipal broadband. If there is no self-serving motive for his objection even to a study, why is he unable 
to offer a credible explanation or justification?

In my opinion, he should be replaced immediately on expiration of his current contract. I doubt the city government would 
descend into chaos if there were a manager-less period of time during a search for a new manager. 

I would be interested in an explanation of their votes from Councillors Carlone, Siddiqui, McGovern, Mallon, Toomey and 
Simmons. Patty Nolan explained her vote in a neighborhood online forum and admitted it was ill-considered. She reports 
that she has filed for a reconsideration of the vote. I hope all the councilors will support that action and reconsider their 
votes.

Bike lanes

I'm writing to express my support of the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current state without any changes.I 
love Cambridge and I want to see protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the network, including Cambridge Street.

As an avid bicyclist, I have seen firsthand that protected bike lanes can mean the difference between life and death. I am 
an extremely cautious rider and yet I have had too many instances where I was nearly hit by a car, truck, or bus. It is 
terrifying and traumatizing. Cambridge residents should be encouraged to ride their bikes more, but without protected 
bike lanes, we often feel that we are putting our lives on the line every day that we ride around our beloved city. Every 
time I hear about another bicyclist's death, I am so angry that we don't yet have enough protected bike lanes and I 
wonder if I will be next. I also drive a car and I am absolutely terrified that I might accidentally hit a bicyclist because so 
many of our roads cannot safely accommodate cars and bikes.

Many thanks to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and 
Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Rebecca Ferber
48 Standish Street, Cambridge

Opposing 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Amendment - Oct. 5, 2020 Final Vote
AHO Potential Project 56 Cedar St.pptx

Dear Honorable Mayor and City Councilors,

I trust this email finds you and all your loved ones safe and healthy during this COVID-19 pandemic.

I am writing to beg you to carefully consider the unintended consequences of the 100% Affordable Housing 
Overlay Amendment (AHOA) before you cast your final vote on Oct. 5, 2020.

Throughout last year's debate on AHOA, I voiced my concerns over for-profit developers taking advantage of 
AHOA to shoehorn in projects that do not fit into family-friendly neighborhoods with very little regards to the 
rights and needs of the abutters. This fear was redoubled Tuesday night, and the reason for this plea, when I 
watched the presentation by the for-profit developers Capstone Communities LLC (Jason Korb) and Hope Real 
Estate Enterprises LLC (Sean Hope) of their plans for 100% affordable housing development (AHD) at 2072 
Massachusetts Avenue, currently the site of one-story, free-standing Darul Kabab restaurant, and flush against 
Cambridge Housing Authority’s Russell Apartments.

The developers have already proven that their business model of 100% AHD is financially viable with their 20 
affordable apartment homes at Port Landing in 2016, long before the AHOA. They are now testing the 
repeatability of their model with the Frost Terrace project, a larger 40 100% AHD, with their next project at 
2072 Mass Avenue pushing the height limits in Porter Square area even higher.

The developers were so confident of their business model that even before the first phase of construction at 
the Frost Terrace kicked off in July 2019, they purchased the property in April 2018, using a $3.8-million-dollar 
loan from the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust, And they plan to file a comprehensive permit zoning 
application to the BZA to build an 8 story building with 49 units of publicly subsidized 100% affordable housing 
on this site with Floor Area Ratio of 6.74 and height of 89 feet to the top of parapet (~99 feet to the roof of the 
mechanical room!). This is well beyond 6 stories and 70 feet the proposed AHOA would allow according to Mr. 
Korb. Contrast this to the 6 story Russell Apt next door and 5 story Henderson Carriage building across the 
street at this very busy intersection of Walden Street and Mass. Ave! The building will cover practically the 
entire lot of 8,515 sq. ft.

Before you vote to adopt AHOA at Monday’s City Council meeting, I beg you to consider this: With already 
proven financial viability of 100% AHDs through comprehensive permit process, it will be much easier for other 
for-profit developers, with less altruistic motives than Capstone Communities LLC and Hope Real Estate 
Enterprises LLC, to shoehorn AHDs into residential neighborhoods (as in 56 Cedar Street; please see my 
attached rendering extracted from last year's submittal) that will destroy the fabric of the neighborhood but will 
be profitable one way or another to the developers. My house is on 8,050 sq. ft. lot, slightly smaller than 2072 
Mass Avenue lot, and I hate to think what could be built on this property under AHOA if it gets ordained with your 
votes.

Thank you very much for your careful consideration, Please stay safe and healthy.

Respectfully yours,

Walden Street (once a KFC fast-food outlet, then briefly Banjo's Roast 
Beef).

The property abuts both an open-air resident-only parking lot owned by the city and the 
Cambridge Housing Authority's recently renovated Leonard J. Russell Apartments for 
elderly and disabled persons with limited income.

At 7 pm on Tuesday, September 29 (before the 9 pm Biden-Trump presidential 
candidates debate), the developers will conduct a virtual community meeting to present 
their plans to build a publicly subsidized "100% affordable housing" project on the site 
once the city grants a comprehensive permit waiving zoning restrictions and other local 
regulations.

To obtain the Zoom platform meeting link and password needed to 
access the online event, RSVP in advance to Jennifer Tamarkin

Support for the Cycling Safety Ordinance on Cambridge Street

I am writing to state my support for the Cycling Safety Ordinance in its current form without any changes.

As a resident of East Cambridge for many years, I believe that bicycle lanes on all streets in the entire network, and 
especially Cambridge St, is imperative to reach the safety and accessibility goals for our city.

In June of 2018, as I was biking (with a helmet in broad daylight), a parked driver opened his door into the painted 
bike lane, right into me, resulting in a concussion, neck hemorrhage, and pain that lasted for three months. This also 
left me with $3000 in medical expenses. After I was able to resume commuting by bicycle, I witnessed two close 
calls to other cyclists involving double-parked vehicles blocking the bike lane and careless turning. I am particularly 
disappointed that this dangerous and congested section of Cambridge Street is potentially being considered for 
exemption from the Ordinance.

Lastly, I would like to echo others' thanks to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, 
McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance.

Thank you, and best regards,
Zhang
32 5th St, Cambridge

Cannabis Delivery and AHO

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors: 

•

•

•

•

On Cannabis Delivery: Please support the P.O. by Councillors Nolan and McGovern to establish cannabis delivery centers 
outside of the main commercial areas. 

• When the cannabis store opened in Brookline over 2500 people came in each day, snarling traffic etc: 
https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/03/16/neta-brookline-recreational-sales-coronavirus
The impacts on traffic in our commercial squares – Central, Inman, Porter, Harvard potentially can be huge as 
well. 

•

• During the era of COVID it is especially important that we find productive ways to not impact negatively the 

health of citizens – so delivery makes sense.
I hope these delivery centers will also allow customer pick-up both to save costs for people who can’t afford 
delivery fees and to provide greater access. (Please limit the fee amounts also).

On the AHO: This will pass, and it is painful to see this happen in a city like Cambridge that should be passing better 
zoning. No one seems to know the outcome – and that apparently is the intention. 

There are (at present) no criteria that will be used to evaluate the AHO’s  success or lack of success. Please add 
this Monday night – maybe to the design criteria document (which is separate from zoning).
There were no studies done of the impacts of such a city-wide up-zoning ordinance based on one done 
elsewhere in the country or world (because it has never been tried). 
The purported aims of this ordinance  are  to end the legacy of racism, but the actual cause today is not redlining 
by ongoing gentrification and condo conversions that force out renters 

• Does the AHO  comport with good urban planning guidelines – No!!  because massive 2.0 AHO projects are not 

just limited to major corridors where people can get transportation, buy food etc. 

• Will the AHO  bring down housing prices in Cambridge – No! We have too many local, national and international 

real estate investors buying up properties here. Have we attempted to stop this? No.

• Will the AHO make a dent in the 20K people on the affordable housing list (7K in Cambridge or working here) –

NO! That list will keep growing especially with the economic situation with COVID. 

• Has Cambridge been effective in building affordable housing through other means? Yes! We have surpassed 

•

state guidelines for a number of years. 
Are there other, better ways to do this? Yes. And there is a real need to provide the means for people to buy 
their own homes. We are now a city of rich and poor with no middle.

• Do the non-profit affordable developers (represented heavily on the affordable housing governing body here) 

actually NEED this zoning ordinance to survive and thrive? No! Look at Sean Hope and Jason Korb They are doing 
their work (as are other for profit affordable housing developers), under the current system where neighbors 
have a voice in what goes up near them. And their designs tend to be better. 

Do I support Affordable Housing?  Yes – as does most everyone else in Cambridge. But it is important that it be effective, 
done well, and studied carefully as to its results, impacts, and cost benefits.

• Unfortunately the AHO has no mechanism to assure good design since abutters and the Planning Board have 

•

been removed from the decision making process. Cost benefits will be the only “bottom line.”
All of the completed AHO examples shown to us by CDD were completed under the present design review and 
oversight guidelines. This will no longer be the case once this passes.

• What is my view on good design? Each building and site is different. But I happen to think (based on the 

rendering) that the Capstone (Korb and Hope) for-profit affordable housing proposal for 2072 is very nice. It is 
good design for this site, at once classy and classical, and they have chosen NOT to take up every inch of ground 
surface but have given it back by opening up parts of  the ground floor with setbacks  in a way that also 
welcomes the public. And the ground floor will have businesses, which the AHO chose not to require even in 
commercial areas.

Tree canopy and the AHO

Dear City Councilors
FYI: Our city’s tree canopy has been diminishing over the decades, and thus the less affluent, more densely populated 
neighborhoods are those worse affected as they currently have fewer trees. 
Tree shade helps cool neighborhoods in extreme heat, which is ever more important as we face global warming. 
Therefore, I urge you to make provision for increasing the planting and watering of trees in Cambridge as you work on 
increasing affordable housing, or our city will simply become unliveable for those who must live in densely populated 
urban areas, defeating the purpose of AHO (which needs careful revision).
Sincerely,
Shelagh Hadley, long-time resident and voter

POR 2020 #216 The City of Cambridge and Collaboration with Cuba on Covid 19

To the City Councillors of Cambridge: 

My name is Merriam Ansara, former longtime resident of Cambridge 

and currently living in both Western Massachusetts and Havana Cuba.

I am delighted that my home town is considering a Policy Order on 
Medical and Scientific Collaboration with Cuba. Cuba and the United States 
have a lot to offer each other, especially Massachusetts and Cambridge: 
many Cambridge based researchers, doctors and scientists have a history 
of working with their counterparts in Cuba.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, 
there were many ongoing exchanges between our local institutions and 
Cuba.  

This year, I was in Cuba from January through July and experienced 
the first 5 months of the Covid 19 epidemic in Cuba.
I saw first hand how 
the Cuban public health system and Cubans at every level and walk of life 
treated control of the virus and of everybody’s health as a collective 
responsibility. No one was left out; no one was left behind.  

Cuba also worked ceaselessly those first months and still is to develop 

a range of medical approaches and protocols that have had tremendous 
In Cuba I gathered, 
success in treating the disease and reducing mortality.
translated, and in some cases wrote about these protocols, treatments and 
approaches to make sure that this information reached people in the United 
States. Some of these are attached to the Policy Order that is being 
considered.  

Cuba has seen the threat of Covid-19 as a universal threat to 

humanity. Hundreds of nurses and doctors have volunteered to go to 
whatever countries have asked for their assistance.

I know doctors and

particular threat but previously, to fight Ebola and H1N1 and others of the 
new diseases.  

4.16.a

SARS-cov-2, Covid-19, is an international threat to humanity.

lead the way.  

In 2014, following his visit to Cuba as part of a delegation of US 
scientists, Dr. Gerald Fink of Cambridge’s Whitehead Institute wrote:
It is 
time for both governments [the United States and Cuba], to reconsider the 
rules that stand in the way of scientific collaboration, before a potentially 
deadly outbreak spreads through both countries and beyond.

With passage of this Policy Order, the City of Cambridge can support, 

encourage and lead the way in re-establishing the long held relationships 
between Cambridge based scientists, doctors and researchers to work 
together at first virtually, and then -- if we can move the State leadership 
and US Congress to get on board -- physically, sharing labs and ideas to 
arrive at solutions to save humanity.  

Thank you.

Good evening council members,

I’m Marcus Johnson Smith.

marcus johnson-smith <mjohnsonsmith@gmail.com>
Monday, October 5, 2020 5:06 PM
Clerk
Public comments for tonight’s meeting (agenda items #4 and #8)

Business address 541 mass ave Cambridge. Home address 90 fawcett st Cambridge.

I’m writing to submit comments for the meeting this evening in regards to agenda items #4 and #8.

For item #4 I support the amendments to include home delivery in the cannabis business permitting ordinance.

For item #8 as it pertains to the ordaining of the Cannabis home delivery law, I want to raise some important 
critiques/recommendations of the current law.

For one, the law needs to be passed expeditiously, immediately after the CCC passes its regulations at the end of the 
month. The reason it needs to be passed expeditiously is because the voters of Massachusetts voted for legal cannabis 
in 2016 and in 2020 we still don’t have any retail adult use shops open in the city and for the handful of equity 
applicants  that have special permits in Cambridge for adult use (some having permits for almost 12 months now) we 
need the city to move to allow businesses to open. Equity applicants have invested thousands of dollars over the last 
few years at just a chance to do business. We can’t wait any longer for more “process” to get open and applicants for 
home delivery shouldn’t have to either.

I also think the recommendation that home delivery businesses be tied to limited zones b1 and b2 are restrictive, 
limiting, and really don’t make too much sense. I recommend opening the businesses to all zones with some strict zoning 
in areas that are more residential. Possibly adding a restriction for spaces in proximity to residential to limit activity 
during certain hours, etc.

Lastly, and most importantly, the council needs to consider protections for small equity businesses from larger entities 
that might seek to monopolize the industry here in Cambridge. Most specifically companies like Drizzly who deliver 
alcohol, and are likely to seek market domination and monopoly if given an opportunity to. They have reportedly raised 
over $25 million just on cannabis delivery in Massachusetts. There’s no way small business people can compete with 
these amounts of resources.

I urge the council to take these matter, recommendations, thoughts into strong consideration as they will have direct 
impacts on the industry as a whole and a detrimental impact to equity business owners like myself.

--
Best, Marcus

100% Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning Petition 2020

Dear Honorable Mayor Saddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Cambridge City Councillors

RE: 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning Petition 2020

As I have stated time and time again, the AHO is a faulty policy that scratches the surface and does not go 
deep enough in addressing some of the rooted problems of housing in Cambridge. Very few housing units will 
come from this policy--one that has fractured our community in so many ways. I wish the same level of effort 
was spent on developing policies that uproot the underlying issues such as the vast inequities that exist within 
our housing policies. The fact that this flawed cookie cutter policy was lobbied by some of the very people who 
sit at the table where they will decide on the funding for potential AHO projects, baffles me.

I am deeply committed to affordable housing—housing that is diverse, inclusive, and comprehensive; housing 
that is not segregated, and housing that offers pathways for transitioning low, moderate and middle income 
residents whose income adjusts upwards or downwards. Far too long, the City’s housing and economic 
development policies have ignored what it means to “develop a community.”  The City either has ignored or is 
incapable of addressing inequities that prevent many of our marginalized neighbors from building equity—true 
equity. Equity is not the same as equality—equality assumes everyone starts from the same place. Historically, 
we all know that is not true.

Here is my example of equity. Equity is when a single mom is in a position to accept a promotion when offered 
to her without risk of losing her affordable housing apartment. It means that the same single mom is given the 
best chance to improve her financial situation, and with the help from the City, she too can own a home—a 
place that she can pass down to her children. Instead, that single mom is having to worry about losing her 
housing because she might be making $200 more than the maximum allowed. Instead, she has to reject her 
job promotion and have little of hope of improving her family’s livelihood.

For decades, our affordable housing policies have kept poor people poor; and have not provided incentives for 
low and moderate income residents who want to improve their livelihoods to realize their fullest potential. The 
City’s HomeBridge program is so inadequate, no wonder people not enough people take advantage of it. The 
homes barely build equity, and you can't pass it down to your children when you die. Where is the equity in 
that? Where is the pride in that?

I believe that homeownership was removed from the Affordable Housing Overly policy, because the non-profit 
housing developers won’t make enough money on home ownership. They need low income residents to 
continue to rent from them for the rest of their lives. The 2015 Federal Reserve Study for the Greater Boston 
area (including Cambridge) on “The Color of Wealth,” clearly provided evidence of the inequities that exist 
amongst Black, Latinx, Cape Verdean and Caribbean residents compared to whites. Here are some pertinent 
revelations from the study:

•

“While white households have a median wealth of $247,500, Dominicans and U.S. blacks have a 
median wealth of close to zero” - $8.00 for Blacks to be specific.

4.18.a

• Whites and nonwhites also exhibit important differences in assets that are associated with 

homeownership, basic transportation, and retirement. Close to 80% of whites own a home, whereas 
only one-third of U.S. blacks, less than one-fifth of Dominicans and Puerto Ricans, and only half of 
Caribbean blacks are homeowners.

It has been 5 years since this wealth gap study—what has Cambridge leadership done to address the wealth 
gap inequities in this city—a city whose Black residents are being displaced faster than any other 
demographic? Has the Black Lives reckoning encouraged city staff and leaders to pay attention to the wealth 
gaps?

Moving forward, I can only hope and wish that our city leadership and staff pay as much attention to equitable 
housing and tackling the wealth gaps in Cambridge as they have to the AHO. We need to look into non-
traditional home ownership such as limited equity cooperatives controlled by the resident owners; we need to 
be offering larger down payments funded by the big corporations and institutions who are displacing many 
long-time residents; and we need to work on a regional housing strategy with our neighboring cities. 

I know all of you are committed to affordable housing and value our city's greatest assets--our people and its 
diversity. We need bold policies viewed through an equity lens and not through the lens of developers. Our City can 
afford to make such a difference. I implore every one of you to do so.

I remain,

policy order #3 -- cycling safety ordinance

I’m writing to voice support for the Amendment to the Cycling Safety Ordinance. 

I’m a safety-conscious biker who's been nervous biking on city streets, but the protected lanes have been a total game 
changer. That said, there are still big gaps in the network, which make it hard for me to get around the city by bike as 
much as I’d like to. (For instance, there isn’t a straightforward way for me to bike safely from my home in Cambridgeport 
to Inman Square.) 

More protected lanes will encourage more of us to bike rather than drive, and that’s good for our health, good for the 
planet, and good for reducing car congestion and the struggle for parking in Cambridge. Let’s move forward to build 
more protected lanes!

Unfinished Business #4
I am here tonight to thank you for all your hard work and persistence that has brought us to this vote tonight to pass the 
Affordable Housing Overlay. In my heart of hearts I thought the AHO was a slam dunk, kind of like Motherhood and 
Apple Pie. I was actually shocked that it took so much work to get us here. But we are finally here! And not only that, we 
are the trend setters. Many cities WILL follow us.  Thank you!!

Policy Order #9
Please vote to make sure that affordability impact is considered before a district is named a Historic Neighborhood 
Conservation District. This designation has been used as a tool to keep new housing out of neighborhoods and that is a 
disgrace.

Subject: Comments for City Council on the Policy Order on Medical & Scientific Collaboration with Cuba

I had signed up for public comments for today's meetings, but because of the schedule and delay of some public 
comments I was unable to stay on the zoom call after 7:30 because of other commitments.  Here is a brief summary of 
the comments I hoped to make.

Thank you,

Rena Leib

My name is Rena Leib and I live at 10 Arnold Circle in Cambridge. I am speaking in 
support of the  Policy Order on Medical & Scientific Collaboration with Cuba.  

I was one of two delegates from Cambridge to Cuba in 2002 whenwe were 
establishing a Sister City with Cienfuegos Cuba. Since both of us who were 
delegates were nurses, we made sure to visit health care facilities and meet with
many medical people. We were very impressed with the health care system there 
and we have continued to follow their policies and learn about what they are 
doing to stop Covid-19.

Cuba has a system of neighborhood health centers that provide primary care and 
are well equipped to do fast contact tracing when someone contracts 
Covid19.
 They have provided isolation facilities as needed and have put in place 
national policies to contain the virus.  This has led to a very low number of Covid 
cases and deaths.

Cuba also has an internationally respected biopharmaceutical industry and has 
developed many successful treatment regimens in previous outbreaks. As it says 
in the order, many countries are acquiring pharmaceutical products from Cuba, 
but none are available in the United States due to restrictions by our government.

Some of our local institutions, including Harvard, MIT and the Cambridge Health 
Alliance have a long history of exchanges with Cuba and collaboration on medical 
approaches and break though treatments.   It would be a benefit to the citizens of 
Cambridge and the country to share information and work together to develop 
safe and effective treatments, and vaccines, for Covid-19. I urge you all to join as 
sponsors and supporters of this Policy Order.

City Council; City Clerk
Cycling Safety Ordinance

Madam Mayor and Councilors,
I thought that I would forward my comments in case any of you wished to respond to any of these questions this 
evening before the CSO if ordained. Had there been more than a single ordinance committee hearing its possible that 
some of these could have been addressed.
As always, thank you for your service.
P

Madam Mayor and Councilors, 

I wanted to speak to you this evening about the Cycling Safety Ordinance. Rather than reiterate my arguments 
about why I think that it would be good to remove Cambridge Street from the CSO, I thought that I would use 
my time to ask some questions. I guess that it will be up to the nine of you to decide if you would like to speak 
to any of them before you ordain it this evening.

1)Do any of you know the total estimated parking loss, both residential and metered, that will result from this 
infrastructure project? Cambridge Street makes up about 2 miles of the 26 included. Joe Barr estimated the 
loss on Cambridge Street to be about 150 of the existing 250 spaces. Is it fair to estimate that the entire 
project will remove just under 2,000 spaces? Was any impact study done to obtain any of this information?

2)Given these numbers, have any of you reached out to your constituents who live and work along the other 
four streets included in this ordinance? I know that there was no attempt to reach out to the businesses and 
residents along Cambridge Street and I also know that most of the business owners who reached out to you as 
a Council, have not heard back from the proponents. As a constituent, I find this last piece really troubling.

3)At the Planning Board meeting on the AHO, which I support, a number of members, while supportive 
overall, voiced concern over the potential impacts of increased density, without any requirement to provide 
new parking. There also seemed to be a general acceptance that the majority of this development would be 
placed on the main commercial corridors throughout the city. Do you as Councilors think that the Planning 
Board should have been made aware of the CSO, especially as it relates to the reduction in parking, specifically 
along the commercial corridors. If not, why not?

4) Given the strategy used to expedite the writing and ordination of the CSO, which bypassed all real public 
process, are all of you who vote in favor of it willing to commit to attending all of the city run meetings as 
planning and implementation rolls out? Given the total lack of public engagement by the Council thus far, I 
would not be surprised if city staff is left to bear the brunt of the public outcry on their own, as they are forced 
to rush through the required buildouts. Constituents were upset and couldn’t agree with the shared streets 
initiative. How can you possibly imagine that this isn’t going to be worse?

5)Luckily, Councilor Toomey’s P.O. passed and a working group will be formed to look at the implementation 
of separated cycle facilities along Cambridge Street. If favorable solutions are agreed to by all concerned 
constituents, will you support amending this ordinance if necessary?

Lastly, given that there has been so much discussion of good governance recently, do you think that the way 
that this Council led initiative was handled is a good representation of how you all want to legislate moving 
forward? A single ordinance hearing, in the midst of a pandemic, that will roll out a 26-mile street 
infrastructure program which may remove about 2,000 parking spaces and potentially slow down bus routes, 
seems rushed to me.

Thank you.

The month of October has been designated as National Domestic Violence Awareness 
month since 1989; and 
1 in 4 women and 1 in 9 men experience severe intimate partner physical violence, 
intimate partner sexual violence, and/or intimate partner stalking with impacts such as 
injury, fearfulness, post-traumatic stress disorder, use of victim services, and 
contraction of sexually transmitted diseases; and 
 
The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the risk of homicide 
by 500% with intimate partner violence accounting for 15% of all violent crime; and 
The LGBTQ community is disproportionately affected by domestic and intimate 
partner violence, with 44% of lesbian women, 61% of bisexual women, 37% of 
bisexual men, 26% of gay men, and up to 50% of transgender people, report 
experiencing rape, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in 
their lives; and 
Domestic violence was already an epidemic before COVID-19, but the health crisis 
has caused a tremendous spike in incidents of abuse, and even as lockdown restrictions 
are lifted, the abuse may continue and remains a critical time for survivors, and greater 
awareness, education, and bystander intervention; now therefore be it 
That the City Council go on record in recognizing October 2020 as Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month and show its support for the organizations that have been literal life 
savers to survivors of domestic violence in Cambridge.

WHEREAS: 

In November of 2019, the City of Cambridge reduced the speed limit on most 
city-owned streets from 25 miles per hour to 20 miles per hour; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Reducing the speed limit is a key part of the city's Vision Zero strategy to 

 
WHEREAS: 
 
 

eliminate all crashes that result in serious or fatal injuries; and 
 
Despite the reduced speed limit, there are certain streets in Cambridge where 
residents feel that motorists continue to speed, such as: Kinnaird Street, from 
Western Avenue to Putnam Avenue; Hancock Street, from Massachusetts 
Avenue to Kinnaird Street; Green Street, from Pleasant Street to Putnam 
Avenue; and Franklin Street, from Putnam to Pleasant Street; and 
 
The  City  of  Cambridge  has  a  vested  interest  in  ensuring  the  safety  of 
pedestrians, bikers, and other motorists from speeding drivers; therefore be it  
 

WHEREAS: 
 
 
ORDERED:  That the City Manager work with the Department of Traffic and Parking to 

conduct an evaluation of speeding on Kinnaird Street, from Western Avenue to 
Putnam Avenue; Hancock Street, from Massachusetts Avenue to Kinnaird

ORDERED: 

The Allston Multimodal project is a vast, billion-dollar reconstruction that will have a 
long-lasting impact on the entire region, especially Cambridge and other surrounding 
communities; and 
 
Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack recently wrote, “A key decision point is 
coming this fall when MassDOT will decide on one of three proposals for the project

include any lane reduction in those three proposals; and 
 
Numerous community groups and stakeholders have been united in support of an all 
at-grade design with lane reductions from I-90; and 
 
In 2019, the City Manager signed a letter to the Transportation Secretary asking for the 
design to prioritize sustainable transit and provide additional parkland, and take the 
visual and noise impacts on Cambridge into account; and 
 
The decision making process on the final design was recently pushed back to provide 
more time for feedback and public comment; now therefore be it ordered 
 
That the Council go on record requesting the Secretary of Transportation Stephanie 
Pollack consider an I-90 lane reduction and at-grade design during the final decision-
making process; and

delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.

That the Cambridge City Council adopt the following amendments to Chapter 5.50 of 
the Municipal Ordinances of the City of Cambridge entitled “CANNABIS BUSINESS 
PERMITTING” 
 

Packet Pg. 397

 

Amend section 5.50.010 to read as follows: 

6.4

This Chapter is intended to create a separate local permitting requirement for   
Cannabis Retail Store, Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product Manufacturer, Cannabis 
Microbusiness, Cannabis Delivery-Only Retailer and/or Cannabis Transporter 
(collectively "Cannabis Business") applicants to certify compliance with certain 
conditions in the public interest prior to being permitted to operate a Cannabis 
Business in the City. The City deems it to be in the public interest to give initial 
permitting preferences for Cannabis Businesses to Priority Applicants, as defined 
herein. 

Amend the definition of “Cannabis Business” in section 5.50.020 to read as 
follows: 

"Cannabis Business." A Cannabis Retail Store, Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product 
Manufacturer, Cannabis Microbusiness, Cannabis Delivery-Only Retailer and/or 
Cannabis Transporter. 

Amend section 5.50.020 to insert the following definitions: 

“Cannabis Delivery-Only Retailer.” An entity licensed by the Massachusetts Cannabis 
Control Commission to deliver directly to Consumers from a Cannabis or Marijuana 
Retailer licensed by the Cannabis Control Commission or Registered Qualifying 
Patients or Caregivers from a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center licensed by the 
Cannabis Control Commission and that does not provide a retail location accessible to 
the public. 

“Cannabis Microbusiness.” A co‐located Cannabis or Marijuana Establishment that 
can be either a Tier 1 Marijuana Cultivator or a Product Manufacturer or both,  
pursuant to 935 CMR 500.00, in compliance with the operating procedures for each 
license and, if in receipt of a Delivery Endorsement issued by the Cannabis Control 
Commission, may deliver Cannabis or Cannabis Products produced at the licensed 
location directly to Consumers in compliance with established regulatory requirements 
for retail sale as it relates to delivery. A Microbusiness that is a Cannabis Marijuana 
Product Manufacturer may purchase no more than 2,000 pounds of marijuana per year 
from other Cannabis or Marijuana Establishments, pursuant to 935 CMR 500.000. 

Amend section 5.50.030 to read as follows: 

This Chapter shall apply to any proposed Cannabis Cultivator, Cannabis Product 
Manufacturer, Cannabis Retail Store, Cannabis Microbusiness, Cannabis Delivery-
Only Retailer or Cannabis Transporter that is seeking licensure from the Cannabis 
Control Commission on or after the effective date of this Chapter. This Chapter shall 
not apply to RMDs that have already been permitted in the City and are not seeking 
licensure as a Cannabis Retail Store for retail cannabis sales prior to the effective date 
of this Chapter ("Existing RMD"). 

Amend section 5.50.040 to read as follows: 

The City shall issue a Cannabis Business Permit pursuant to this Chapter only to 
Priority Applicants. For the first two years after the Effective Date of this Chapter as 
stated in Section 5.50.100 below, the City shall issue a Cannabis Business Permit to 
operate a Cannabis Retail Store or for a Cannabis Delivery-Only Retailer only to 
Group A Priority Applicants who are Economic Empowerment Applicants certified as 
such by the Commonwealth's Cannabis Control Commission.

WHEREAS:  While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently enacted a national

eviction moratorium, gaps and ambiguities in the order are leading to evictions

Cambridge has enacted its own local “Moratorium on Eviction Enforcement” order,

due to the pandemic could lose their housing, exposing themselves and the community 
to greater risk of transmitting COVID-19; now therefore be it

Department and the Law Department to amend Cambridge’s Moratorium on Eviction 
Enforcement to make clear that it remains in effect after October 17 and until at least 
the end of the state of emergency is declared; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to widely publicize to residents, 
property owners, and community groups that Cambridge’s Moratorium on Eviction 
Enforcement remains in effect and how its provisions overlap and differ with the 
protections that have been provided by the Massachusetts Eviction Moratorium, which 
is expiring on October 17; and be it further 

 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council as soon as possible and before 
the expiration of the statewide eviction moratorium on October 17, 2020.

ORDERED: 

The City of Cambridge’s Participatory Budgeting process is a democratic initiative that 
gives Cambridge community members the power to decide how to spend funds each 
fiscal year to improve the Cambridge community; and 
 
This is the 7th year that Cambridge has initiated the Participatory Budgeting process, 
with past projects including laundry access in schools, solar panels for the Main 
Library roof, bike repair stations, a freezer van for prepared food rescue, street trees, 
water bottle fill stations and more; and 
 
One of the winning projects from the fourth year of the Participatory Budgeting 
process was the “flashing crosswalks for safer streets” project – a project to increase 
pedestrian safety by funding rapid flashing beacons at 10 high pedestrian risk 
crosswalks; and 
 
These beacons would increase the visibility of pedestrians, especially at night, by 
alerting drivers to crossing pedestrians, thereby preventing crashes; and 
 
The “flashing crosswalks for safer streets” project has not been implemented or 
provided with updates since winning approval from the City 3 years ago; and 
 
Two of the proposed intersections in the “flashing crosswalks for safer streets” project 
are the intersection of Broadway and Norfolk Street and Elm and Hampshire Street, 
which was outlined in the project as 2 of the 10 intersections that drivers speed 
through, creating risk if injury or even death; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager provide an update as to the progress of the 10 approved flashing 
crosswalks as outlined in the PB4 by October 26, 2020; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Budget Office and other relevant departments to 
discuss the feasibility of installing the remaining flashing crosswalks as outlined in the 
PB4 proposal, particularly on Broadway and Norfolk Street and provide an update to 
this Council by October 26, 2020.

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

The United States has the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world; and; 
 
Cuba with a population of almost double that of Massachusetts has had 4,459 cases 
compared to Massachusetts’ 123,181, as of September 10, 2020 with just over 1% the 
number of Commonwealth deaths; and 
 
In the face of the worldwide menace of SARS-Cov-2 Covid-19, the situation calls for 
the utmost international cooperation and solidarity; and 
 
The City of Cambridge is home to some of the most nationally prestigious and 
successful medical, public health, pharmaceutical and life sciences research and 
teaching institutions; and 
 
Cuba has developed in its own internationally respected biopharmaceutical industry 
and successfully used at home and abroad treatment regimens in previous outbreaks of 
Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya and other of the novel virus; and 
 
Cuba has used several successful treatment protocols in controlling COVID-19 
developed by its biopharmaceutical industry, affording that country an extremely 
favorable fatality and recovery rate; and that these treatment protocols include the 
Cuba produced drugs of Biomodulina T , Heberon Interferon Alfa 2B human 
recombinant , Itolizumab , and Jusvinza (CIGB 258) ; and 
 
Although more than 42 countries are in the process of acquiring or have already 
acquired pharmaceutical products such as these from Cuba, none are available in the 
United States due to ongoing and increased restrictions against collaboration with and 
imports from Cuba; and 
 
The City of Cambridge and its institutions including Harvard, MIT, and Cambridge 
Hospital have a long history of direct medical and scientific faculty and student 
exchanges as well as direct collaboration with Cuba, working together for many years 
on breakthrough treatments and medical approaches, such as the search for a vaccine 
for Dengue Fever and the development of treatments for drug resistant infections; and

There is an ongoing national awareness and work towards similar Cuban collaborative 
initiatives in other cities and states, such as recent resolutions passed by the City of 
Cleveland, the City of Richmond, and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, calling 
also for lifting of the U.S. embargo on Cuba that has severely restricted collaboration 
on scientific and medical research; and 
 
The people of Cambridge, the rest of the country and the world would benefit from 
U.S.- Cuban biopharmaceutical, medical and public health collaboration and exchange; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City of Cambridge actively explore collaboration with Cuba to jointly face the 
Covid-19 pandemic, including re-initiating knowledge transfer and joint collaboration 
in public health prevention methods; methods for preventing infection of health 
workers; innovative treatments; and development of new treatments, vaccines and 
protocols, between Cambridge and Cuban institutions; and 
 
That the Cambridge City Council actively calls upon the Massachusetts State 
Legislature and the Governor of the Commonwealth to actively pursue such 
exchanges, knowledge transfers, and collaboration, including but not limited to 
collaboration on further and joint development of drugs and treatment protocols in 
pursuit of control of the COVID-19 virus; and 
 
That the City of Cambridge calls on the Congress and President of the United States, 
with the support of the Governor of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts State 
Legislature, with the active support of the State’s U.S. Senators and Representatives, to 
lift restrictions on access to Cuban medical and biopharmaceutical expertise, in order 
to more effectively combat the COVID-19 pandemic, by suspending relevant US 
economic and travel sanctions against Cuba.

ORDERED: 

During a public hearing on October 3rd, 2019, the Cambridge Historical Commission 
voted to initiate a Neighborhood Conservation District (NCD) Study for a portion of 
East Cambridge; and  
 
On September 10th, 2020, The Historical Commission voted to extend the Study for 
another year due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
The City Council has a vested interest in ensuring that all stakeholders are given equal 
opportunity to attend and give input at East Cambridge NCD Study Meetings, as 
expanding and deepening community engagement is one of the City Council’s stated 
goals; and 
 
The City Council has also affirmed that its first priority and goal is promoting housing 
affordability across Cambridge; and 
 
Academic and professional research overwhelmingly suggests that Neighborhood 
Conservation Districts and other such historical preservation districting have a 
secondary effect of generally increasing home prices within and even beyond their 
borders; and 
 

also lead to rent increases and displacement for other residents who do not own 
property; and 
 
Residents who rent should have the same rights and access to participate in public 
policy and decision making as property-owning residents, as overlooking the 68% of 
East Cambridge households who rent and the 56.9% of City-wide households who rent 
leaves out the majority of Cambridge residents; now therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge Historical Commission remain mindful that housing affordability 
is a regional issue, and that a new Neighborhood Conservation District anywhere in the 
City will likely result in higher housing prices elsewhere in the City; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with the Cambridge 
Historical Commission, other relevant City Departments and community partners to 
develop strategies to expand residents’ access to and participation in the East 
Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee Meetings so that 
participation reflects the demographics of the neighborhood, particularly as it pertains 
to property owners and tenants; and be it further

outreach efforts, or opportunities to engage with the Neighborhood Conservation 
District Study process made available to homeowners be equal to those available to 
renters; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Cambridge 
Historical Commission and other relevant City Departments to ensure that any report 
or recommendation for a new Neighborhood Conservation District in Cambridge 
presented to the City Council include an analysis of the potential effects on City 
housing affordability based on current research, as well as any mitigations that the 
Cambridge Historical Commission recommends, so that the City Council may 
holistically evaluate the matter. 
 
That the City Solicitor provide a legal opinion by October 19th on the legal 
implications of the Historical Commission’s decision to extend the study beyond one 
year following the acceptance of the designation petition as listed in Article 3, section I 
of the enabling legislation, as it relates to the approval of building permits by the 
Historical Commission past October 3, 2020

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade, which recognized the 
fundamental principle that women’s bodies are their own and guaranteed all people the 
right to safe and legal abortion; and 
 
An individual’s freedom to make reproductive decisions is vital to their safety, well-
being, economic opportunity, and ability to participate equally in society; and 
 
The constitutional right to abortion does not translate into equitable access to care as 
barriers to access are entrenched in discrimination, stigma, and political interference to 
keep safe, legal abortion out of reach and unaffordable for many people; and 
 
Nearly 1 in 4 women will have an abortion, but when denied abortion due to these 
barriers, women and their families suffer from well-being and economic opportunity, 
where studies have shown that a person denied access to abortion is more likely to fall 
into poverty than a person who can receive abortion; and 
 
Since 2011, politicians have passed over 400 new laws in 33 states to shame, pressure, 
and punish people seeking abortion; and 
 
These attacks have been bolstered by the current administration’s assault on health care 
access and reproductive rights; and 
 
Even in Massachusetts, access to safe, legal abortion is still dictated by a person’s 
income, insurance status, and whether a young person’s household supports their right 
to make their own, private medical decisions; and 
 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:  With a U.S. Supreme Court ripely poised to further erode or eliminate Roe v. Wade, 
Massachusetts must strengthen its commitment to reproductive rights and modernize 
its laws so every person has access to safe, legal abortion and can decide for 
themselves if and when to become a parent; and 
 
Senator Harriette L. Chandler and Representatives Patricia A. Haddad and Jay D. 
Livingstone have introduced the Roe Act (S. 1209, H. 3320) to address these 
inequalities and ensure safe abortion access in Massachusetts; and 
 
The Roe Act will improve access to affordable abortion by removing unnecessary, 
burdensome provisions that delay and deny care by:  
 

 
WHEREAS: 

•  Eliminating the burdensome judicial bypass process teenagers must navigate to 

Packet Pg. 411

6.10

access safe, legal abortion, aligning young people’s ability to access abortion 
with their ability to access all other pregnancy-related care;  

•  Bolstering access to safety-net coverage for abortion regardless of a resident’s 
income or legal status, which already exists for all other pregnancy-related 
care; 

•  Expanding access to abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases of fatal 

fetal anomalies; 

•  Eliminating unwarranted government intrusions and criminal penalties; 
•  Ending intrusive reporting requirements that jeopardize physician safety and 

•  Reforming state laws and language to codify principles of reproductive 

patient privacy; and 

freedom; now therefore be it 

 
That the City Council go on record supporting the Roe Act and restate its commitment 
to the protection of abortion rights, reproductive health care rights, and individuals’ 
rights to make reproductive decisions about their own bodies; and be it further; 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of 
this Resolution to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey, 
Senator Harriette L. Chandler, Representatives Patricia A. Haddad and Jay D. 
Livingstone and Massachusetts Governor Charles Baker.

RESOLVED: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed an explosion of anti-Asian racism in the 
United States, ranging from derogatory slurs, to blaming the outbreak on Chinese 
people, to violent physical attacks; and 
 
On September 21, 2020, a coalition of Asian American students submitted an open 
letter to school educators and superintendents in Boston, Malden and Quincy urging 
them to address the surge of anti-Asian racism that followed the COVID-19 outbreak; 
and 
 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, Stop AAPI Hate has recorded about 2,500 
incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States, with 61 such incidents 
in Massachusetts; and 
 
Stop AAPI Hate released a report that looks at 341 incidents reported by youth, with 
24 involving physical assault. In 56% of these cases, perpetrators employed anti-
Chinese hate speech, including blaming China and Chinese as the source of the virus 
and mocking Chinese dietary habits; and 
 
As our students return to school, it is important to protect and keep our students safe 
from both the spread of COVID-19 and racist attacks; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record supporting the high school students’ open letter 
requesting leadership to protect Asian American students from this onslaught of racial 
bullying and abuse; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of 
this Resolution to Stop AAPI Hate, the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center and 
the Superintendents of the School Districts in Boston, Malden and Quincy.

Cambridge has a Net Zero Action Plan and has taken a number of steps to address the 
climate crisis, take climate mitigation steps and adopt resiliency efforts; and 
 
Cambridge understands the need for taking action in a more urgent timeframe and 
include frontline communities in all efforts to address the climate crisis; and 
 
On December 21, 2009, the Cambridge City Council voted to adopt the Stretch Energy 
Code, one of the first municipalities in the state to adopt the Stretch Energy Code, which 
has been an important part of the city’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Mass Climate Action Network (MCAN), 350 Mass, and other climate organizations are 

encouraging municipal officials to go on record supporting the passage of S.2500 and 
H.4933; and 
 
Having the state allow municipalities the option of adopting a net zero stretch code is a 
necessary tool for Cambridge to use in meeting its sustainability goals; and would 
establish one uniform building code for all communities that want to exceed the base 
Massachusetts building code with a specialized stretch energy code they can adopt; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the Council go on record supporting the passage of S.2500 and H.4933 and to

2) The consideration of geographically diverse communities, including low-income

(Revising STIR Approved on February 24, 2020) 
 

Emergency Communications  
Emergency Communications Center 

Christina Giacobbe 
 
RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System – Enhancement 
(RapidSOS Ready) 

Department: 
Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System (RapidSOS) is a web platform that 
provides life-saving data directly to 911 and first responders in an emergency, 
providing faster, more effective responses. Callers who contact 911 do so voluntarily 
seeking emergency services.  RapidSOS integrates data from: personal devices such 
as smartphones and smartwatches, motor vehicles’ GPS and crash-detection systems, 
and home security systems, to provide real-time emergency data that supplements 
information provided during an individual 911 call. 

 

•  RapidSOS is deployed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ State 911 

Department, which manages and oversees the Next Generation 911 system.  This 
state system delivers 911 calls to the appropriate jurisdiction and RapidSOS 
technology functions as a clearinghouse to present the call to the Public Safety 
Answering Point (PSAP), or call center, for emergency response.  ECC serves as a 
PSAP and is therefore required to access RapidSOS through the State 911 system. 

• 

 
In Cambridge, when callers contact 911 their call is directed to Emergency 
Communications on the state’s Next Generation 911 platform and RapidSOS 
provides secondary, data-based location information to ECC through the RapidSOS 
clearinghouse The data that is collected at the time of the call is the caller location 
and phone number.  All 911 calls and caller information are required to be recorded.  
These records are kept according to record retention policies through the 
administrative portal of the Next General 911 System.

•  The State 911 Department is required by law to review and assess all technological 

and operational capability of wireless 911 calls being routed and handled directly by 
the PSAP in which the caller is located.  The State 911 Department is responsible for 
ensuring such capability exists and they establish the standards, by which our PSAP 
receives wireless calls.  

 
•  RapidSOS has enhanced their platform to include the capacity to present emergency 
profiles of 911 callers.  Through collaboration with the American Heart Association 
(AHA), American Red Cross and Direct Relief, RapidSOS has developed emergency 
response data platform, RapidSOS Ready that securely links life-saving data from 
connected devices or profiles to 911 and first responders duirng an emergency . 
through RapidSOS Data Integration System. 

 

 
 
•  Residents can now create an Emergency Health Profile, providing first responders 
with the critical information they need to care for individuals in the field during a 
medical emergency.   

o  Signing up is voluntary and free of charge.  
o  During an emergency call, the emergency profile will be presented through 
the RapidSOS platform to Call Takers which will provide life saving 
informaiton to first responders. 

•o  Information is protected by the Emergency Health Profile Associaition and 

will only be sent to the jurisdication handling the 911 call duirng an 
emergency through the registered phone number provided via the existing 
RapidSOS platform. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

 

 

•  The purpose of this technology is to provide ECC Call Takers and Dispatchers with 
an accurate phone number and location information of wireless callers who contact 
911 in our jurisdiction.  This is necessary to provide aid to the caller, dispatch 
emergency personnel and provide emergency services.   This information also allows 
Call Takers and Dispatchers to contact the caller if the call gets disconnected or for 
additional follow up.  

 
•  This technology supports our ability to maintain the safety and security of City 

employees, students, and residents when experiencing an emergency situation.  In 
addition, this technology allows us to communicate life saving information to first 
reponsders.

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The RapidSOS technology is deployed by the State 911 Department to all PSAPs in 
the Commonwealth as part of the Next Generation 911 System.  The RapidSOS 
technology is housed on the State 911 system located in Middleboro and a local 
server for our PSAP is located at 125 Sixth Street. 

 
•  This technology was implemented in 2018. 

 
•  This enhancement to the RapidSOS platform will provide first responders with 
additional lifesaving information for those who create an Emergency Profile. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The privacy impact of this technology is consistent with federal, state and local 

government policies for the purposes of law enforcement and public safety efforts.  
Records of 911 calls received through traditional call processing have previously 
included location and phone information provided by cellular carriers, and RapidSOS 
provides the same information.  However, with the rapid advancement of location-
based technology, our reliance on cellular carriers’ location information has 
decreased.  The RapidSOS technology provides more accurate location information.  
The Next Generation 911 System administered by the State provides also provides 
subscriber information, i.e., the name of the person to whom the phone is registered, 
as well as the phone address and number.  Currently, all callers that contact 911 are 
informed that the call is being recorded as required by law.    

 
•  The State 911 Department provides role-based access to the data to ensure protection 
of caller information.  In ECC/our PSAP, Call Takers and Dispatchers have access to 
caller information during the call and for thirty minutes after the call has been 
disconnected. Authorized users will have access for performing their duties in 
accordance with their role during call processing, quality assurance and investigative 
matters.  

 
•  Because this technology provides an opportunity for citizens and business to access 
emergency services, there may be a greater impact on privacy of the individuals or 
businesses who voluntarily provide information to law enforcement officials during 
emergencies.  The Emergency Communications Department will address these

privacy impacts by limiting access to the information to assigned investigators and/or 
authorized users, similarly to current department policy.   

 
•  All access to the RapidSOS administrative portal is limited to managers of the ECD 

and is password protected.    

•  The State 911 Department reviews and assesses new communications technologies 
that may serve as Next Generation 911 technology platforms, consistent with FCC 
decisions and federal law.  RapidSOS technology has been thoroughly vetted by the 
State to provide life-saving information during emergencies. 

 
•  RapidSOS enhanced platform will provide lifesaving information through the 

Emergency Profile.  It is voluntary and participants can provide as much information 
as they are comfortable with.  However, callers who contact 911 will have their 
privacy impacted due to requesting emergency services. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  There are no associated costs with RapidSOS technology as it is deployed by the 

State 911 Department as part of the State Next Generation 911 system. 

•  There is no additional cost to the City or residents in utilizing the Emergency Profile 

created by RapidSOS.
