ORDINANCE COMMITTEE 
 

COMMITTTEE MEETING 

~ MINUTES ~ 

  Thursday, November 19, 2020 

5:30 PM 

Sullivan Chamber 

 

The Ordinance Committee will conduct a public hearing  on the KSURP Zoning Ordinance 
Amendment. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  called the meeting to order and opened the floor to the petitioner. 
 
Thomas Evans, Executive Director of the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, explained that the 
petition is a result of conversations to find an alternative location for a potential Eversource substation. 
The petition was approved by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority board on September 16, 2020.  
He made a PowerPoint presentation to the committee which is attached to these minutes. After 
conversations between the city manager, Bob Bearden and Boston properties, the north parcel on the blue 
garage was identified as a potential opportunity. The petition proposes to add an additional 800,000 
square feet of commercial development mixture of office and lab; to increase the height limit by 50 feet 
and  revise the phasing of the housing program. The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority is proposing to 
rename the Kendall Square urban renewal plan to the Kendall Square urban redevelopment plan. The 
petition would place the affordable housing in one building, that would be 420,000 square feet, on the 
Broadway edge of the parcel.  
 
Anthony Markese, Design Principle at Pickard Chilton,  explained that the idea is to create a wonderful 
open space, accessible to the public and fully integrated into the fabric of the city. He explained how the 
project will connect various neighborhood and open space areas.  The Eversource substation will be 
located between existing utilities easements that allow for transmission lines.  He described a residential 
tower, two commercial buildings and below grade parking. 
 
Ian Hatch, Project Manager at Boston Properties, explained that the blue garage would be demolished.  
The first phase of the project would build the Eversource infrastructure.  Due to regulatory timelines for 
Eversource certain city permits must be obtained by early 2021. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor McGovern the change in residential building from the current 
plan, Mr. Evans explained that square footage of residential space is the same.  He further explained that 
the CRA could instruct the building on the types of residential units. 
 
In  response to a question from Councillor McGovern about removal of home ownership from the plan, 
Mr. Evans stated that due to the complexity of the project home ownership would just add an additional 
layer of complexity. 
 
Michael Tilford explained that just to start the project costs $381 million. Adding condo that could be 
owned adds substantial complexity to the project. 
. 
Councillor McGovern was disappointed by the response. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor McGovern about amenities, Mr. Evans explained that the CRA 
was having discussions with other developers in the area about what amenities will be appropriate.  The 
CRA wants to ensure that they are not replicating any other amenities that are already coming to the area

current site and build the Eversource substation.

In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Evans stated that there are several existing 
service roads which will be enhanced.

commercial construction or happen simultaneously.

forward and that the service street should become open space.  Mr. Evan stated that there will be taxi drop 
off on the perimeter of the project. 
 
Councillor Nolan asked about the impact of the excavation on groundwater and the possibility of flooding 
from climate change.   
 
Mr. Tilford explained that the project would use slurry walls.  He stated that the 100-year flood surge is 
not up to this level. 
 
John M. Zicko, Director Capital Projects Engineering at Eversource Energy, stated that below grade 
substations are very prevalent in Asia. 
 
Councillor Carlone  opened the floor to public comment. 
 
Bjorn Poonen, 303 3rd Street,  questioned the removal of affordable home ownership units from the 
project. Hoping that the zoning proposal will go forward, while retaining the homeownership requirement 
and also providing ownership opportunities to retailers. 
 
Jim Gray, 2 Michael Way, president of the Linden Park neighborhood association, was impressed with 
the process.  He stated that the association is in favor and support this proposed zoning amendment.  
 
Janice StClair, 3 Michael Way, spoke in support of the zoning amendment.

enable construction of a new substation thereby meeting the public need for additional electricity without 
direct disruptions of settled resident neighborhoods.  She urged passage of the amendment.

Luis Mejias, 18 Plymouth Street, spoke in support of the zoning petition.

Lee Ferris, 269 Norfolk Street, representing the Cambridge residence Alliance. She stated that the project 
will cause more gentrification and displacement. Eliminating affordable homeownership opportunities 
here is particularly harmful to black and brown residents who have many barriers to homeownership. She 
asked that the city council negotiate a revised letter of commitment with the developer that requires the 
original amount of affordable homeownership in this project.  
 
Matthew Connolly, 13 Cornelius Way, spoke in support of the project. 
 
Conrad Crawform, 119 Spring Street, stated that the project has a lot of benefits. He supported the 
proposal.

Councillor Carlone opened the floor to city staff 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, explained that the purpose of this 
project was keep the Eversource substation out of the Fulkerson Street site.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, explained that the Planning Board voted to 
favorably recommend the petition to the city council. If the zoning amendment is adopted, the project 
would come back before the planning board for special permit approval of a development plan.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone about guidelines, Mr. Roberts, stated that whenever a 
development comes before the planning board, it is the practice of staff and planning board members to 
refer to whatever recent planning documents might be relevant for that particular proposal. 
 
Mr. Evans stated that in order to host the Eversource site housing cannot be built right now. The petition 
seeks to change the timing so that the housing would be the first or parallel development plan as soon as 
feasible once the substation is put in place.  
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about adding Bicycle lanes to Binney street, Mr. 
Evans explained that the petitioner been working with city departments and Boston properties to design 
and put in place bicycle lane.
