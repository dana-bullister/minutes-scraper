The Ordinance Committee will meet to conduct a public hearing on proposed amendments to the 
Cycling Safety Ordinance 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern called the meeting to order and explained that the governor's executive order 
issued on March 12 2020, has authorized the use of remote participation at meetings of the city’s public 
bodies in response to the threat posed to the public by the COVID-19 virus in issued guidelines for the 
city's use of remote participation 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler explained that this ordinance will help create a timeline to build a 
citywide protected bike network. He stated that the city has recorded more than 500 crashes between a car 
and the cyclist. A huge portion of those crashes could potentially have been avoided with a protected bike 
lane and occurred on parts of streets that are covered by this ordinance.  
 
Joseph Barr, Director of Traffic, Parking & Transportation gave a presentation the explained the changes 
that would occur if the proposed ordinance is adopted.  The basic premise of the ordinance is that requires 
the city to implement 22.6 miles of separated bicycle lanes (SBL) by May 1 of 2026. Importantly, projects 
that are built as a permanent or capital construction project only need to be begun prior to the deadline to 
qualify for that goal.  There are a few definitions that are added by the ordinance. One is a so called Quick 
built separated bicycle lane that are created with flex posts and other flexible or some sort of more easily 
installed delineators that need to be replaced year-round. The final key new definition is public 
transportation that is really focused on stops for the MBTA and other important public services and 
university and college shuttle buses that operate in Cambridge and acknowledging that in many cases, it is 
very difficult to build separate bicycle lanes through those stops.  The city manager does have discretion 
under the proposed amendments to extend that deadline by one year but needs to submit a report to the 
council a year in advance explaining why that extension will be necessary. The city manager has the right

to request some schedule adjustments in response to COVID-19 as long as that's done by the summer of 
2022. 
 
Susanne Rasmussen, Director of Environmental and Transportation Planning Director, explained that the 
Cambridge bicycle plan, which was first published five years ago in 2015, when fully realized will lay out 
100 plus mile network consisting of existing in progress and future facilities. The network of streets that's 
proposed for separation in the bicycle plan, are the subject of the cycling safety ordinance. Section k in 
the definitions, you'll see that the separated network shall mean the proposed set of separate facilities in 
the Cambridge's bicycle plan, or any plans superseding it. But a key task is to identify streets that are not 
currently planned for reconstruction but would be eligible for quick build implementation based on a high 
level of analysis and feasibility on such street segments. She further explained how the city will prioritize 
quick build and capital projects based on an analysis of the street and community input. 
 
Mr. Barr further explained that depending on the complexity of a project, usually it takes between nine to 
eleven; or eight months or a year to complete a quick build project. A construction projects is a whole 
different animal. It can take several years for a construction project, particularly if it involves utility work 
to be completed. Regardless of how it is implemented, the community outreach and design require time; 
for iteration, for discussion, coordination with businesses and local communities. These projects have 
significant impacts on the community, even if the implementation is relatively straightforward, project 
like adding separated bicycle lanes could take out something on the order of Have 150 parking spaces. 
 
Kathy Watkins, Assistant Commissioner for Engineering / City Engineer, briefly described the current 
separated bicycle lane projects in the five-year plan.  
 
Councillor McGovern opened the floor to public comment 
 
Laura McMurry, 334 Harvard Street, is in favor of the cycling safety ordinance as amended. It will 
provide rapid installation of many miles of safe protected bike lanes, some using the quick build method. 
The advantage of the quick build method is that it is faster to install and changed as necessary. 
 
With one other thing is that with COVID-19, bicycling offers less exposure than most modes of public 
transportation to COVID. I urge a vote of this ordinance out to the city council. Thank you. 
 
Kimberley Hunt, 10 Wendell street, stated that the world is accelerating bike infrastructure projects and 
believes that Cambridge should follow suit. 
 
James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, stated that he cannot traverse a simple crosswalk safely because 
of the way bicyclists in the city race through red lights and crosswalks. The city has ignored the safety of 
pedestrians. 
 
John Attanucci, 608 Huron Avenue, works at MIT in the transit lab and chairs the city's transit advisory 
committee. Generally, he supports the separated bicycle lane plan. He stated that he is concerned about 
the impact on public transit. The data show that if not done properly, separated bike lanes, slow buses, 
and this emphasis on putting fully separated bike lanes on all the major streets in Cambridge is going to

hurt transit and it is going to hurt transit riders. The city should be creating shared bike and bus lane 
priority lanes.  
 
Tina Lieu, 37 Huron Ave, stated that this ordinance, although well intentioned and going in the right 
direction, might not actually satisfy the transportation requirements that the city will need in the future. 
East Cambridge needs bicycle lanes. She would like to see more holistic approach to street infrastructure. 
 
Gavin Lund, 166 Charles Street, we need a dramatic mode shift away from fossil fuel powered vehicles, 
to more sustainable modes of transportation of which biking is one. And in particular, there's a huge 
untapped resource of people who are interested in biking but concerned about safety. And protected bike 
lanes have been shown to be the only way to really convince significant numbers of those people to bike.  
 
Galen Mook, executive director of the Massachusetts Bicycle Coalition. Spoke in support of the 
ordinance. Separated bicycle infrastructure is the safest bicycle infrastructure.  The city should encourage 
youth citizens to think about bicycling as an everyday mode of transportation. The council should take 
into mind the safety and comfort of pedestrians as well as the expediency of transit as well. Studies have 
shown that protected bicycle infrastructure actually make streets safer for all modes, especially 
pedestrians.  
 
Christopher Cassa, 103 Gore Street, stated that defining a place for cyclists to safely ride through our 
streets that will help improve the safety for cyclists, but also improve general safety on the streets. He 
supports moving forward on these issues. 
 
Amy Flax, 86 Normandy Avenue, spoke in support of this ordinance. Separated bike lanes, in fact, 
support many different modalities in terms of transportation, and pedestrians and bikers. If kids don't have 
safe alternatives for biking, then their lives are in danger.  
 
Itamar Turner-Trauring, 139 Oxford Street, is excited about this ordinance. because It is very important 
that we transition away from private cars towards things like bikes and buses and in many ways are very 
complementary, they serve different needs, so work well together. Shared bike bus lanes are actually not a 
good idea for either buses or bikes. Paris is moving away from them for example, and they're an 
extremely ambitious bike lane construction project. The real solution is to move more of the space away 
from private vehicles and storing private vehicles and parking and moving towards safer infrastructure 
and buses and using things like floating bus stops. 
 
Luis Mejias, 18 Plymouth street, strongly supports the approval of this ordinance to speed up the 
installation of protected bicycle infrastructure throughout Cambridge. If we're serious about tackling 
climate change, we must stop making driving the primary and easy choice. To do so we must do away 
with thinking that aligns with providing parking and road design that makes it more convenient or faster 
to drive then ride a bike walk or take transit. If people want to drive it should be in convenient. If they 
want to walk or bike, it should be easy and safe. There are countless people who would choose to ride a 
bicycle or tricycle and not try if the roads were designed so that they feel safe.

Marisa Carlos, 8 Kenwood Street, spoke in support of the ordinance. Cyclists sometimes race through red 
lights because of a lack of bicycle specific infrastructure. Adding bicycle specific infrastructure, like 
bicycle red lights, will help with that. Encouraged the committee to move the ordinance forward. 
 
Gleb Bahmutov, 19 Winslow Street, explained that the number one concern with biking is safety. He fully 
supports this ordinance.  
 
Sarah levy, 52 Pearl Street, cycling is a way that people can get around healthily and not cause emissions 
that cause health issues for others.

Councillor McGovern open the floor for discussion amongst the committee. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  stated he heard some negative comments from older folks and some retail 
restaurant people. He stated that the committee should consider their points of view but that means that 
we do not move forward.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan stated that he supports this compromise going forward. He stated that they 
have really come a long way in this effort to get transit justice in the city. He is disappointed that it is not 
going faster.  
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  acknowledged challenges with implementation but is supportive of this 
ordinance. She stated that Paris took seven or eight years to change from a car centric to a bicycle centric 
city. She asked why the Transit Advisory Committee has not reviewed the ordinance She also asked how 
other stakeholder were being consulted. 
 
Susanne Rasmussen, Director of Environmental and Transportation Planning Director, explained that no 
city committees have met due to COVID19.   
 
In respond to a question from Councillor Patricia Nolan, Mr. Barr explained the relationship between the 
Cycling Safety Ordinance and converting certain streets be one way.  He explained that he would have

some significant concerns about changing street direction in general, but the city would consider changing 
the operation of the street in a more fundamental way to allow for the bicycle facility to be implemented.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern stated that there needs to pe continuous public outreach thought this process. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Timothy Toomey, Kathy Watkins explained that the portion of 
Huron Avenue between Fresh Pond Parkway and Glacken field is in the Bike Plan.  The City evaluating 
how to add a protected bike facilities and a pedestrian connection to the section of Huron Avenue. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  expressed frustration with the lack of outreach to community members and 
small business owners who are struggling COVID-19 about this proposal that will directly impact them. 
 
Councillor Toomey moved the following amendments to the Cycling Safety Ordinance: 
 
Amend section 12.22.040(G)(b) to insert the following: 

i.  The Cycling Safety Ordinance proposes a scenario that would significantly impact the Cambridge 

St corridors ability to function as a healthy business district; and 

ii.  There are many complexities along Cambridge St corridor that deserve in depth consideration and 

a more robust planning process that may include additional investment beyond the baseline 
that this Ordinance proposes; and 

iii.  There is general agreement that a safer street for all is important, but this ordinance removes the 

opportunity for more thoughtful solutions that address the vital needs of a commercial district 
and denser residential areas; now therefore be it 

iv.  That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to convene a stakeholder group of City staff, 

business, resident, and bicycle representatives no later than spring 2021 to create a viable 
plan for Cambridge St to be implemented by 2026, and for this process to happen alongside 
of the process created by the ordinance. 

Amend “Section 12.22.040 Requirements” by adding the following the following new section “I” 
 

I.  Requirements of Cyclists. 

(a)  Upon passage of the ordinance Cambridge residents will be required to register bicycles with the 

appropriate department in the City of Cambridge.  

(b)  Upon passage of the ordinance use of bicycle safety helmets will be mandatory. 

(c)  Upon passage of the ordinance, bicycles are to be equipped with front and rear lights. 

(d)  Upon passage of the ordinance, bicycles are to be equipped with a horn or whistle.  

 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler expressed concerns about the proposed amendments.  He stated that 
regarding the requirements for whistles and horns there are serious racial equity component, giving police

another reason to pull over residents. He stated that he could not support this portion. He stated that he 
could support a stake holder meeting for Cambridge street but wanted additional clarifications. He stated 
that he wants to make sure Cambridge street is required as part of this ordinance.  
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon stated that in comparison to other neighboring communities Cambridge is far 
behind on creating safe cycling infrastructure around the city. She encouraged the city to continue to do 
virtual outreach in order to reach more people.  She supported having additional conversation and 
community outreach about separated bike lanes on Cambridge street.  She stated that she would like to 
see permanent facilities on Cambridge street.  She stated that she shared Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
concerns about racial equity. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan suggested rejecting the proposed amendment but that the committee 
should consider it as a policy order.  He stated that he shared Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler concerns 
about racial equity.  He stated that he did not support the idea of removing Cambridge Street from the 
ordinance. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that he supported bicycle registration.  He supported providing bicycle 
lights to individuals and providing bicycle safety classes. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  agreed that there a safety component that the council must address but he did 
not believe that it belonged in an ordinance about infrastructure. 
 
Susanne Rasmussen, Director of Environmental and Transportation Planning Director, explained that a 
large percentage of cyclists in Cambridge do not live in Cambridge.  She explained the department 
provided bicycle lights and helmets at various events. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui stated that this is an iterative process. She stated that aside from the stakeholder 
group, she would not support Councillor Toomey’s amendments. She stated that she supports the 
ordinance as written. The City and the Council will take the questions raised by businesses seriously.
