2:00 – 4:00 PM 

Virtual Meeting 

Overview 

This will be a working group meeting of the Community Benefits Advisory Committee. The Community 
Benefits Advisory Committee will meet to advance its purpose act on the Guiding Principles for Community 
Benefits Funding set forth in the Community Needs Assessment. 

I.  Introduction & Norms Review 
 

II.  Implementation Grants 

•  Acknowledge current reality is very different – a lot has changed, and so the Community Benefits Advisory 

Committee’s (CBAC’s) approach may need to look different 

•  Current status of implementation grant agreements 
•  Evaluation & HRiA’s summary of changes for the family level and partnership and systems level 
•  Next steps 
Discussion: 
•  To what degree do evaluation activities impose an undue burden on nonprofit organizations?  

o  Consider easing/ not adding to burden  
o  Be clear – what info are we trying to gather? What is the purpose/ what are we trying to get at? Is data 

pivotal/ important/ needed? 

III. COVID-19 Emergency & Recovery Funding 
 

DRAFT – What is fixed/ non-negotiable as part of this funding appropriation: 

•  Different considerations than other CBAC funding stream – including timeline, focus on innovation and 

• 

partnerships  
It is about supporting nonprofit organizations in their delivery of services to Cambridge residents affected by 
COVID-19 that respond to one or more of the 12 needs identified in the Needs Assessment  
It needs to support services to be delivered starting with contract start date 
It cannot be used for general operating funds 

• 
• 
•  Organizations need to have 501c3 status 
•  Organizations need to have a location in Cambridge dedicated to serving Cambridge residents 

Discussion:  

•  The world changed in March, and data compiled by Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition shows: 90% of nonprofit 
organizations are still active, 74% are experiencing or anticipating a decrease in revenue, a number of 
organizations have laid off staff, small number of nonprofits have applied and received PPP loans; seeing 
increase in food insecurity; often lean budgets and limited cash reserves 
“Grant agreements or contracts” – focus on maximizing flexibility for nonprofits  

• 

o  Does not impact speed of funding to nonprofits 
o  Grant agreements are exempt from MA procurement act 

City of Cambridge                                                                                                                                                                    cambridgema.gov

• 

“It cannot be used for general operating funds” – we can be broad with how we define service delivery  
o  Hearing from philanthropic organizations that many nonprofits have intermediate needs – 

technology, software platforms, consulting services, facilities retrofitting, etc.  

•  Do we need to clarify target population beyond “vulnerable residents”? 

DRAFT – What are the factors that may guide CBAC in this process:  

•  Different considerations than other CBAC funding stream – including timeline, focus on innovation and 

partnerships  

•  Application should be available by 7/6 (at the latest; 7/3 & 7/4 are City holidays) 
•  Applicants can submit online, with paper option if needed 
•  Prioritize simplicity throughout 
•  Prioritize expediency throughout 
•  Core team/ City staff will work to develop materials for review by CBAC 
•  Provide services that respond to COVID-19 through the lens of the Needs Assessment 
• 
• 
•  Cast a wide net in outreach to nonprofit organizations 

This will be competitive – won’t be able to fund all applicants 
The city and nonprofit organizations have a very good sense of need  

Discussion:  

•  Prioritize flexibility  
•  Outreach important – especially given need and HRiA findings about Planning Grant RFP outreach 

o  Get word out broadly – e.g., through Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition, Cambridge Community 

Foundation, Find It Cambridge, daily City Updates, City’s homepage  

•  With application process – we should not be asking for things that are not relevant  
•  Sense of urgency given pandemic and intensified focus on racial violence and injustice  
• 

“This will be competitive” – is this necessary?  

o  Depends on how much we want each grant to be for 
o  Decrease in revenue as a factor?  

•  How to prioritize equity 

o  Award first 100 organizations as long as they meet criteria?  

• 

 “Expediency” – 7/6 seems a lifetime away, and PPP is expiring soon for the few organizations that received 
it 

o  Consider these as emergency grants – we already know enough, be guided by trust in nonprofits  
o  Move quickly: advertise/outreach period to submission period to review to award 

DRAFT – What are the questions CBAC will need to address in the weeks ahead:  

•  Population: What is the population that we want to prioritize? Who do we consider most vulnerable?  
•  Duration: For how many months? (what is the contract length?) 
•  Funding: What is maximum $ to allow per organization?  
•  Assessment: What is evaluation criteria/ rubric to evaluate successful proposals?  
•  How do we consider organizations that have already received Community Benefits funding?  

Discussion: 

•  What does “vulnerable” mean in current context?  

o  Seniors? Below 100% of average monthly income? Addressing isolation? Underlying health 

conditions? Change in revenue/employment status? Immigration status?  

o  Keep definition broad 
o  Let applicants define why population they are serving is vulnerable, where areas of vulnerability are, 

how project is responding to needs  

o  Make link to Needs Assessment  
o  Can be defined in qualitative terms  

•  Duration – grants are for services to be provided, what is the period of services to be provided?  

o  Spend over whatever period is needed to do the work 
o  Give some estimate of timeline, and/or up to x months
