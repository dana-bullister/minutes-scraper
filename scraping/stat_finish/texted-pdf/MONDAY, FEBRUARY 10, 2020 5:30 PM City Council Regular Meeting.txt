To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the transfer of $301,785 in the General Fund between School Department 
statutory accounts as follows:  $301,785 from the Other Ordinary Maintenance account to the 
School Salaries & Wages account ($124,168) and to the Travel & Training Account ($177,617).  
 
During the course of the school year, the School Department allows principals and department 
administrators to move funds across statutory categories within their budgets to better meet their 
educational needs.  
 
The reallocations are for School Improvement Plan (SIP) and Professional Development Plan 
(PDP) for all schools as well as for schools and departments to support their programming.  The 
original budget included funds in statutory categories based on previous historical expenditure 
patterns, pending the submission of the detailed SIP and PDP budget plans from Principals and 
the Deputy and Assistant Superintendents for approval.   
 
The School Committee approved this transfer on February 4, 2020.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $1,200,000 from Free Cash, to the Public Investment 
Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account for expanded tree planting and 
continued implementation of the Urban Forestry Master Plan recommendations.  
 
Over the past three years the City has taken significant steps to address urban forestry program 
improvements, be it in increased operating and capital budget allocations, investment in 
management staff in the Forestry Division at Public Works, significant revisions in tree planting 
and maintenance specifications and in the development of the Master Planning process itself. 
This allocation further represents the City’s commitment to urban forestry and more broadly to 
addressing climate change preparedness and resiliency.     
 
The appropriation will supplement existing and anticipated budget allocations and enable the 
City to plant approximately 1,050 trees through FY21. Funds will also provide resources for 
technical services primarily associated with soils analysis and management, education, outreach 
and engagement, other work necessary to ensure the long-term health of the urban forest in order 
to ultimately reverse canopy decline in the city.

February 3, 2020 

Awaiting  Report 19-159  –  Safety  Concerns  at  the  intersection  of 
Walden Street and Saville Street 

 
 
This memo is in response to Order 4 from the November 25, 2019 City Council Meeting 
(Awaiting Report 19-159) to report on traffic safety concerns at the intersection of Walden 
Street and Saville Street, where multiple crashes have been reported in the past two years.  
  
In order to assess existing traffic conditions, staff from the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation 
and Police Departments have conducted multiple site visits to observe existing conditions, 
traffic operations, and parking conditions on Walden Street in the vicinity of Saville Street. 
Crash records for the past two years were also reviewed to identify any potential safety 
concerns. 
 
The intersection is controlled 
by STOP signs on the minor 
(Saville Street) approach. 
Saville Street serves local 
neighborhood traffic 
accessing homes in the 
immediate area, while 
Walden Street serves both 
local trips and through traffic, 
connecting Huron Avenue to 
Concord Avenue and Garden 
Street. Parking regulations 
on Walden Street include NO 
STOPPING zones on all four 
corners of Saville Street in 
order to provide safe 
intersection sight distance for 
drivers or bicyclists turning 
onto or crossing Walden 
Street.

driver to strike a parked car and roll over. 

•  September 2019: Angle crash - Police report indicates that the driver entered the 

intersection from Saville Street eastbound and struck a vehicle traveling through on 
Walden Street northbound. There were no noted sight distance obstructions, it appears 
that the Saville Street driver did not take proper care before entering the intersection. 
•  November 2019: Sideswipe crash – Police report indicates that a driver attempted to 

pass a vehicle making a u-turn on the left and sideswiped the turning vehicle. 

•  November 2019: Fixed object crash – Police report indicates that a driver swerved to 
avoid a vehicle entering the intersection from Saville Street, lost control, and struck a 
fence. Speed may have been a factor. 

The crash data do not indicate that there are any overarching patterns related to the 
configuration of the intersection, and that this group of crashes don’t appear to indicate a 
systemic problem. Speed may have been a factor in one or more of the crashes. Walden Street 
will be subject to a new 20 MPH safety zone regulation, with signs expected to be posted within 
the next month, including one just north of Saville Street. Given the observations and crash 
data review, the Traffic Department does not propose any changes to the intersection at this 
time.

c.  Role  of  Police  Department  in  immigration  enforcement.    The 
Cambridge Police Department will not initiate investigations or take 
law  enforcement  action  on  the  sole  basis  of  actual  or  perceived 
immigration status, including the initiation of a stop, an apprehension 
or arrest. The Cambridge Police Department shall not take part in or 
assist  with  federal  immigration  enforcement  operations,  except  as

detainer  or  ICE  administrative  warrant.  This  includes  extending the 
length  of detention  by  any  amount  of  time  once  an  individual  is  or 
would  otherwise  be  released  from  local  custody,  or  before  being 
transferred to court or admitted to bail.  

e.  Federal  requests  for  information.  No  officer  or  employee  of  the 
Cambridge  Police  Department  shall  provide  an  officer  or  employee 
of  ICE  with  the  following  information  relating  to  a  person  in  the

incarceration  status,  length  of  detention,  home  address,  work 
address,  personal  information  other  than  citizenship  or  immigration 
status,  hearing  information,  or  pending  release,  except  information 
that  is  available  through  the  Massachusetts  Public  Records  Laws, 
G.L,  c.  66,  section  10  and  G.L.  c.  4,  section  7  (twenty-sixth). 
Nothing  in  this  section  shall  prohibit  or  restrain  an  officer  or 
employee  of  the  Cambridge  Police  Department  from  sending  to,  or 
receiving  from,  any  local,  state,  or  federal  agency,  information 
regarding citizenship or immigration status, consistent with 8 U.S.C. 
§1373. 

f.  Encountering  persons  driving  without  a  license.  When  taking 
action  against  a  person  who  is  found  to  be  driving  without  a  valid 
driver’s license, officers of the Cambridge Police Department shall, 
whenever  possible    in  the  officer’s  discretion  and  if  there  are  no 
other violations causing the person to be arrested, issue a summons 
to  court  instead  of  taking  the  person  into  custody.  In  such 
circumstances,  the  law  enforcement  officer  taking  action  shall

employee of the Cambridge Police Department may participate in an 
operation  led  by  a  federal  agency  to  detain  persons  for  deportation 
purposes,  except  in  response  to  a  request  to  assist  with  support 
services  deemed  necessary  to  ensure  officer  safety  or  to  prevent  a 
breach  of  the  peace  during  a  federal  operation,  such  as  requests  to 
establish traffic perimeters, control traffic or provide police escort.   

k.  Deputizing  of  local  officials.  No  officer  or  employee  of  the

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the

The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on

The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments;

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

Cambridge’s tree canopy has shrunk by nearly 20% over the last decade; and 
 
Amendments made to the Tree Protection Ordinance (TPO) last year which restrict the 
removal of “significant trees” on private property will expire on March 11, 2020 if no 
action is taken; and 
 
On November 12, 2019, the city and consultants presented a thorough and impressive 
report to the Health & Environment Committee on a long term approach to reversing 
the canopy decline, rooted in recommendations from the Urban Forest Master Plan 
Task Force which met 13 times between June 2018 and April 2019; and 
 
The report, which contains numerous recommendations on lasting changes that should 
be made to the TPO, was originally scheduled to be released in June 2019 but was 
delayed; and 
 
The report is excellent and deserves careful deliberation and discussion by the city 
council, and it would be a great disservice to rush this conversation in an attempt to 
overhaul the ordinance ahead of the March 11, 2020 expiration date; and 
 
At the same time, it would be a travesty to let the temporary amendments to the TPO 
expire without any new language, as doing so would almost certainly result in a 
massive citywide cutting spree, worsening our canopy decline and erasing any positive 
impact the temporary amendments might have had; now therefore be it

ORDERED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

That section 8.66.055 of the municipal ordinances of the City of Cambridge, entitled 
“Procedure for Other Significant Tree Removals” be amend by substitution to read as 
follows: 
 
“For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050, a permit will be required 
from the City Arborist. In all cases, the City Arborist shall keep a record of the type 
and size of tree removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the tree 
documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractor(s) involved, and the name 
and address of the property owner. No such permits will be issued until December 31, 
2020 or sooner by further amendment to this section, except for emergency 
circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects undertaken pursuant to State or 
Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, or where a tree poses 
significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or for dead or dangerous 
trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the removal of certain 
significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree canopy. Any tree 
removed in violation of this section, prior to December 31, 2020, shall require a 
payment into the tree replacement fund as per section 8.66.070 according to a schedule 
as follows:  10% of the replacement value for property owners who qualify for the City 
of Cambridge residential real property tax exemption, no fee for property owners that 
receive established forms of financial assistance, and the full replacement cost in all 
other circumstances. The value to be paid into the tree replacement fund shall be 
equivalent to the cost of purchasing, planting, watering and maintaining said 
Replacement Trees for a period of not less than five years.” 
 
 
 
That the City Council go on record expressing a clear intent to pass comprehensive 
amendments to the TPO, based off the recommendations of the task force, well ahead 
the new proposed deadline of December 2020.

ORDERED 

On May 6, 2019 the Cambridge City Council introduced the Welcoming City Ordinance 
and referred it to the Ordinance Committee; and 
On Oct. 2, 2019, the Ordinance Committee met but were unable to deliberate because the 
City Solicitor was not prepared to discuss said ordinance; and  
The Welcoming City Ordinance was placed on file due to the end of the 2018-2019 
legislative session, requiring reintroduction; and 
The City of Cambridge is a proud supporter of our Sanctuary City status, but there is no 
codified ordinance establishing itself as such; now therefore be it 
That the Cambridge City Council amend the Municipal Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to insert a new Chapter 2.129, entitled WELCOMING COMMUNITY 
ORDINANCE, to read as follows: 
2.129.010 - PURPOSE.  
 
The  purpose  of  this  Ordinance  is  to  establish  the  City  of 
Cambridge as a Welcoming City, to declare that all are welcome

government by establishing standards associated with the City’s 
voluntary involvement in federal immigration enforcement.   
 
2.129.020 - PREAMBLE 
 
It  is  not  within  the  purview  nor  mandate  of  the  City  of 
Cambridge  to  enforce  federal  immigration  law  or  seek  the 
detention,  transfer  or  deportation  of  Cambridge  residents  for 
civil  immigration  purposes,  nor  should  the  City’s  resources  be 
expended toward that end.  
 
The City of Cambridge will equally enforce the law and serve the 
public  without  consideration  of  immigration  status,  citizenship, 
national origin, race, or ethnicity.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL 

 

January 23, 2020 

To the City Council: 

I am resubmitting the Welcoming City Ordinance, complete with amendments that the Cambridge Police 
and Massachusetts American Civil Liberties Union agreed on. I did not include proposed changes that 
the Police and ACLU did not agree on, nor did I include amendments that require more information from 
the Cambridge Police.  Below is a summary of the proposed changes that we will discuss in committee. 

In Section D, federal requests for information, the Police Department representative stated that the police wish 
to cooperate with federal agencies outside of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.  The ACLU 
representative Laura Rotoldo did not object to this change, provided the police state the agencies they want to 
work with for criminal enforcement, and only cooperate when they are able to show probable cause. 
 
Section E, encountering persons driving without a license, the police requested we strike this section. The ACLU 
believes this section is integral to the purpose of the Welcoming City Ordinance and should not be taken out.  I 
agree with the ACLU. 
 
In Section F, notice to individuals subject to ICE interventions, the police believe this section is too broad.  The 
ACLU asked for clarification on what paperwork the police would not want shared with a person issued a 
summons or arrested. 
 
I also received a public inquiry on Section I, raids and other immigrant enforcement actions. A resident was 
concerned that this section enables Cambridge Police to support ICE during raids, even if in a supporting 
function.   
 
I am willing to consider amendments to the ordinance, provided we pass the strongest laws protecting our 
immigrant population possible  
 
Sincerely, 

 

 

Dennis Carlone 

Cambridge City Council.

law violation.  

 

2.129.040 - ORDER  

 
a.  Equal treatment. Cambridge will treat all persons equally, enforce 
laws, and serve the public without consideration of immigration status. 
Citizenship,  immigration  status,  national  origin,  race,  and  ethnicity 
shall  have  no bearing  on  an  individual's  treatment by  employees  or 
officers  of  Cambridge  agencies  or  departments.  Inquiries  about 
immigration  status.  Officers  and  employees  of  the  city  may  not 
inquire about the immigration status of any victim, suspect, arrestee, 
911  caller,  or  other  member  of  the  public  with  whom  they  have 
contact, except as required to provide a public benefit.  
 

b.  Role  of  police  in  immigration  enforcement.    The  city’s  police 
department  will  not  initiate  investigations  or  take  law  enforcement 
action  on  the  sole  basis  of  actual  or  perceived  immigration  status, 
including  the  initiation  of  a  stop,  an  apprehension  or  arrest.  The 
Cambridge  Police  Department  shall  not  take  part  in  or  assist  with 
federal immigration enforcement operations, with the exception that 
the  Department  will  actively  assist  in  Federal  human  trafficking 
operations. 

c.  ICE  detainers  and  administrative  warrants.  Consistent  with 
Massachusetts law, no officer or employee of the Cambridge Police 
Department may arrest or detain an individual solely on the basis of 
an  ICE  detainer  or  ICE  administrative  warrant.  This  includes 
extending  the  length  of  detention  by  any  amount  of  time  once  an 
individual is released from local custody, or before being transferred 
to court or admitted to bail.  

d.  Federal requests for information. No officer or employee of a the 
Cambridge Police Department shall provide a federal officer with the 
following  information  relating  to  a  person  in  the    custody  of  the 
Department:  information  about  an  individual’s  incarceration  status, 
length of detention, home address, work address, personal information 
other than citizenship or immigration status, hearing information, or 
pending  release,  except  information  that  is  available  through  the 
Massachusetts Public Records Laws, G.L, c. 66, section 10 and G.L. 
c. 4, section 7 (twenty-sixth).  

e.  Encountering  persons  driving  without  a  license.  When  acting 
against a person who is found to be driving without a valid driver’s 
license, officers of the Cambridge Police Department shall, whenever 
possible and if there are no other violations causing the person to be 
arrested, issue a summons to court instead of taking the person into 
custody.  In  such  circumstances,  the  law  enforcement  officer  taking 
action shall endeavor to provide the driver a reasonable opportunity to 
arrange  for  a  properly  licensed  operator  to  drive  the  vehicle  before 
seeking to impound the vehicle.

f.  Notice  to  individuals  subject  to  ICE  interventions.  If  the 
Cambridge  Police  Department  receives  an  immigration  detainer  or 
ICE administrative warrant for a person in its custody, the Department 
shall  provide  the  person  with  a  copy  of  such  detainer  request  or 
administrative  warrant,  and  any  other  documentation  it  possesses 
pertaining to the person’s immigration case.   

g.  ICE access to facilities. Except in response to a judicial warrant or 
other court order, ICE agents shall not be allowed access to individuals

peace during a federal operation, such as requests to establish traffic 
perimeters, control traffic or provide police escort.   

j.  Deputizing  of  local  officials.  No  officer  or  employee  of  the 
Cambridge  Police  Department  shall  perform  the  functions  of  an

any other law, regulation, or policy, whether formal or informal. 

k.  School  records  and  enrollment.    No  employee  of  the  Cambridge 
Public Schools shall require a student or parent to provide information 
regarding  their  immigration  or  citizenship  status  to  establish  the 
student’s  residency  in  the  district  for  enrollment  purposes.  If  such

for a properly licensed operator to drive the vehicle before seeking to 
impound the vehicle, unless the violation is one subject to a statutory 
or regulatory requirement of vehicle impoundment.  

g.  Notice  to  individuals  subject  to  ICE  interventions.  If  the 
Cambridge  Police  Department  receives  an  immigration  detainer  or 
ICE  administrative  warrant  for  a  person  in  its  custody,  the  Police

by VAWA if an individual (i) is the victim of a qualifying crime, and 
(ii)  has  been, 
the 
investigation/prosecution of that crime, or is the victim of domestic 
violence and removal will place them in immediate danger.

j.  Raids  and  other immigration  enforcement  actions.  No  officer  or 
employee of the Cambridge Police Department may participate in an 
operation  led  by  a  federal  agency  to  detain  persons  for  deportation 
purposes,  except  in  response  to  a  request  to  assist  with  support 
services  deemed  necessary  to  ensure  officer  safety  or  to  prevent  a 
breach  of  the  peace  during  a  federal  operation,  such  as  requests  to 
establish traffic perimeters, control traffic or provide police escort.   

k.  Deputizing  of  local  officials.  No  officer  or  employee  of  the 
Cambridge  Police  Department  shall  perform  the  functions  of  an 
immigration officer, whether pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1357(g) or any 
other law, regulation, or policy, whether formal or informal, except 
as required by federal or state law or regulations. 

l.  School  records  and  enrollment.    No  employee  of  the  Cambridge 
School  Department  shall  require  a  student  or  parent  to  provide 
information  regarding  their  immigration  or  citizenship  status  to 
establish  the  student’s  residency  in  the  district  for  enrollment 
purposes. If such information becomes known to an employee of the 
Cambridge School Department, such information shall not be kept or 
distributed, except as required by federal or state law or regulations, 
and  shall  have  no  bearing  of  the  student’s  ability  to  register  for 
school  or  the  school’s  treatment  of  that  student.  Information 
collected  regarding  place  of  birth  for  the  purpose  of  providing 
appropriate  services  to  any  student  shall  be  used  only  for  that 
purpose and not distributed further, except as required by federal or 
state law or regulation.

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation.

A Neighborhood Organization for the Betterment of East Cambridge 

 

February 3, 2020 

Cambridge City Council 
Cambridge City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Avenue, 2nd Floor 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
      RE: Proposed Curb Cut at 147 Otis Street (Application 54799)  
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-
Wheeler, Toomey, and Zondervan: 
 
The East Cambridge Planning Team (ECPT) reviewed the package for the proposed curb cut at 147 Otis 
Street at its January 22, 2020, general meeting. The Applicant, Greg Leppert, presented the plan to ECPT 
and answered questions from the members in attendance. The property is located at the corner of Otis and 
Sixth Streets, so it has frontage on both streets. The curb cut, as we understand it, would be 9 feet long 
and be located on Sixth Street through an existing tree well containing a stump.  It is not known to ECPT 
when and why the mature tree was removed, but it appears in Google Maps street view dated September 
2018 (see attached picture). 
 
General Policy 
ECPT has adopted a general position of not supporting curb cuts for a single parking space as they: 

  Encourage car use, which city policy discourages 
  Privatize public space, the related sidewalk and street space 
  Remove public street parking 
  Frequently reduce private open/green space, which is at a premium in our very dense 

neighborhood, by turning it into paved space for a driveway and parking  

  Pose threats to public and private trees, by cutting them down to make way for driveways and/or 

parking spaces or by severely damaging their roots, which often results in the tree being razed for 
public safety  
 
Specific Objections 
ECPT has specific objections to the 147 Otis St curb cut request including: 

  Traffic. There is heavy traffic on Sixth Street, including that generated by the Cambridge Police 

Station a few blocks away at 125 Sixth St. 

  Funeral Home Parking. The funeral home diagonally across the intersection regularly draws 
significant numbers of cars, which are often double-parked, making a curb cut this close to the 
corner even more dangerous. 

  Frontage. The home is located on the corner, giving the home owner substantially more adjacent 

street frontage for convenient parking than most homes in the neighborhood. 

  Tree Well. The City would have to move an existing tree well to an inferior location closer to other 

trees. 
 

We have also received several letters and e-mails from abutters saying they were not notified and do 
oppose this curb cut, as well one claiming the curb cut is several feet less than the 15’2” shown on their 
plan and the 15’ required by law. We have asked those abutters to send their comments directly to the 
Council for their consideration.

only 5ft

Dear City Councilors and Neighbors, 
 
Thank you for your consideration of a curb cut at our home at 147 Otis Street, in East 
Cambridge. As a family with a young child, and plans for more, a curb cut would do wonders to 
increase our safety while loading kids into and out of their carseats (which we currently do while 
cars squeeze past us on narrow East Cambridge streets) and allow us to charge an electric 
vehicle to replace our gasoline powered car. 
 
Our home is at a unique intersection, where a funeral home and church often bring an influx of 
parked cars, and after reviewing the plans I hope you’ll find that they not only improve on-street 
 of existing on-street parking space to remove a 
parking for others in the area — using 
roughly 15ft car from the road — they also increase the safety of the intersection by improving 
visibility for pedestrians at the crosswalk. 
 
We look forward to the future possibility of a car-free Cambridge and welcome initiatives to, for 
instance, remove all cars from East Cambridge streets as New York City (among others) has 
done in select areas; we would love to see a day when our children have the freedom to play in 
the streets in front of our home. Until then, I hope you’ll join the overwhelming support of our 
abutters and grant us the opportunity to improve not only our living situation but the intersection 
as a whole. 
 
We know you may have additional questions, as does the East Cambridge Planning Team, so 
we’ve included answers to the most common ones and look forward to answering any others in 
person when we meet before the council. 
 
Thanks, 
Greg and Kate (and Ben)

space? 
A:
 The city codes require curb cuts be placed 15ft from a crosswalk while limiting on-street 
parking to at least 20ft from a crosswalk (see our note below about safety). With our proposed 
curb cut, this places 5ft in a zone where on-street parking is already prohibited, with the 
remaining falling outside of this zone. 
 
Q: How does this curb cut improve the safety of the crosswalk at this intersection? 
A:
 The Cambridge parking code requires vehicles to park at least 20ft away from a crosswalk so 
that drivers can see pedestrians waiting to cross the street, but this setback is routinely violated 
at this corner. Our proposed curb cut would set the closest parkable space at 25ft from the 
crosswalk, helping to prevent drivers from blocking this safe zone. 
 
Q: I know there was once a tree near this spot, what happened to it and will it be 
replanted? 
A:
 As tree lovers ourselves, we wondered the same and reached out to city arborist, David 
Lefcourt, for answers. His response was that he called for the tree to be removed on October 
18th, 2018 (before we owned our home) due to health issues and, though he had initially hoped 
to replant this tree, circumstances prevent it regardless of whether a curb cut is installed. 
 
From David: 

“I had our tree contractor remove the tree in front of 33 [Sixth] Street on October 18th, 2018 
due to the tree being in significant decline.” 
 
“Unfortunately, we are unable to install a new street tree where the old one was removed. 
The existing tree well is too close (within 15'--20' feet) to the stop sign which presents a 
potential safety issue. We cannot move the tree well further right (away from the stop sign) 
due to the underground utilities. The tree well will be closed in conjunction with the Chapter 
90 Sixth Street project.” 

 
Q: Will there be any issues with traffic on Sixth Street? 
A:
 As is required for all curb cuts, the Cambridge Traffic and Parking Department, who is our 
best authority on the effects of traffic in the area, has reviewed the plans and approved them. 
 
Q: Does the curb cut meet the required setbacks, including a 15ft distance from the 
intersection? 
A:
 As part of approving the plans, the Department of Public Works made an on-site visit where 
Superintendent of Streets TJ Shea, city engineer Emily Paulson, and the contractor overseeing 
the Sixth Street Reconstruction Project, Carl Howard verified that all safe and required 
distances will be met. Since the street, sidewalks, and crosswalks will be updated as part of the 
Sixth Street Reconstruction Project, their measurements accounted for these planned updates.

 The sidewalks and curbs of Sixth Street are set to be completely rebuilt, this Spring, as part 

Q: When would the work be completed and what impact will the construction have? 
A:
of the Sixth Street Reconstruction Project. This curb cut would be added as part of that work 
and would have no additional impact on the street or city resources, beyond what was already 
planned for that reconstruction. 
 
Q: Since you’re on the corner, don’t you have plenty of space near your home where you 
could park? 
A:
 While we do have frontage on both Sixth and Otis Streets, Charlie’s funeral home and 
Sacred Heart Catholic Church (both of which we love) are also at this corner and each one 
regularly draws significant numbers of cars. As one neighbor, whose family has lived at our 
corner for three generations, said in support of our curb cut: “Our parking situation is 
exacerbated by the funeral home and the church. I’m resigned to the fact that I can not park 
near my house ever.” 
 
Q: Will this impact any open or green space? 
A: 
When we bought 147 Otis Street, the area where the Board of Zoning Appeals granted us 
space to place a car was entirely covered in old, nonpermeable cement pavers. We’ve removed 
those and, whether we have a curb cut or not, will be rebuilding this area with fully permeable 
pavers tailormade to allow grass and other greenery to grow through. 
 
Q: What are your plans for Mabel’s old store and why did you put big windows there? 
A:
 That will be our living room! We restored the look of the old store windows because we love 
our corner and wanted both the light and the connection with the community that windows like 
those bring.

To the BZA Board / BZA-017191-2019: 
 
My name is Harry Fullerton and I’m writing in regards to the condos at 31 and 33 
Sixth Street, situated immediately behind 147 Otis Street. The former 
owners/occupants of the Sixth Street condos were dear friends of mine and, 
when they passed this year, they left a will asking that I oversee their estate and 
associated properties. Consequently, the units are vacant for the time being and 
we’re currently working to resolve their estate. 
 
The owners of 147 Otis shared their plans for the parking spot near the shared 
property line and, as someone who worked as a contractor for many years, I think 
it’s a smart addition that’s designed with the neighboring condos in mind, one 
that will have little to no impact on 31-33 Sixth Street or the neighborhood. The 
driveway is short and the fence they’re constructing will hide the car from both 
the view from the condos and the view from the street. Given that there are no 
bedrooms on the first floor of the Sixth Street condos, it would hardly be noticed 
anyway. 
 
As for the proposed dormer facing the backyard of the condos, along with the 
proposed deck above the old store, it’s clear they’ve worked to tastefully 
integrate these elements into the historic building and I think the end result will 
be a home that brightens the street, including the condos nextdoor. I hope you’ll 
grant them the variances they’ve requested and help them build a home for their 
family. 
 
Regards, 
Harry Fullerton

RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

Cayla Marvil and Andrew Jones were recently named on the Forbes’ 30 Under 30 List 
in the Food & Drink category; and 
 
In 2016, Ms. Marvil and Mr. Jones opened Lamplighter Brewing in Cambridge; and 
 
This was a bold and brave step for the duo, who switched career paths only a few years 
before Lamplighter Brewing’s opening, and who earned brewing technology degrees 
from the Siebel Institute of Technology; and 
 
The pair have enjoyed tremendous success, with Lamplighter Brewing attracting 
75,000 on-site customers a year, and tripling production of their craft brews; and 
 
Lamplighter Brewing has earned over seven figures worth of revenue in each year of 
operation, an impressive feat given the difficulty of starting a new business in 
Cambridge; and 
 
Given their success, Ms. Marvil and Mr. Jones plan on opening a new business, 
Luminati Spirits, this year; and 
 
By starting and expanding their business in Cambridge, Ms. Marvil and Mr. Jones have 
demonstrated an admirable dedication to our City and our local small business 
community; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record congratulating Cayla Marvil and Andrew Jones on 
being named on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 List in the Food & Drink Category; and be it 
further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of

City of Cambridge 

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
MAYOR SIDDIQUI 
 
WHEREAS: 

On April 8, 2019, the City Council passed a policy order asking the City Manager to 
direct City staff to compile a full accounting of streets, schools, and public buildings 
that may be named in honor of those who have ties to the American slave trade with a 
view toward renaming these; and 
 
The intent behind this endeavor was and is not to erase the sometimes complicated 
history of our city – certainly, we must acknowledge that even some of 
our country’s most celebrated historical figures engaged in acts that 
would surely earn them condemnation in contemporary society – but to force us 
to more honestly confront our history and the questions of whom we choose to 
celebrate, how we understand the fullness of their lives and their actions, and 
whether there are other, lesser-known but no-less-important figures we ought to be 
lifting up and celebrating in the ongoing desire to more fully understand our city’s 
history; and 
 
On June 10, 2019, the City Council passed a related policy order asking the City 
Manager to establish a working committee to review the monuments, memorials, and 
markers throughout Cambridge to determine whether any of these commemorate those 
who were linked to the slave trade or engaged in other similarly shameful acts, to 
determine which individuals – particularly women, people of color, and those from 
other historically marginalized communities – should be newly recognized with a 
monument, memorial, or marker; and 
 
Related to this larger, ongoing discussion, a meeting of the Agassiz Neighborhood 
Council on January 14, 2020 featured a discussion amongst neighborhood residents 
who feel that the time has come for this neighborhood to be renamed from one that 
honors Louis Agassiz – whose work has been used by white supremacists since the 
1800s to justify their shameful and misguided positions – to one that honors someone 
the neighborhood can be rightfully proud of, such as Maria L. Baldwin or another 
lesser-known light from our city’s rich past; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to 
work with the residents of the Agassiz neighborhood in furthering this important 
neighborhood conversation and in helping make a determination as to how to arrive at 
an appropriate, official name change for this neighborhood; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter in a timely manner.

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY 
 
WHEREAS: 

Sydney Cox worked for the City of Cambridge’s Department of Public Works for 45 
years, 35 of which were spent as Master Mechanic in charge of the Department’s fleet 
of vehicles, and throughout his years of service, he displayed extraordinary dedication 
to his city, his colleagues, and his job; and  
 
Born, raised, and educated in Cambridge, Sydney oversaw the municipal garage during 
a time of extraordinary change, as mechanical systems modernized, trucks and cars 
saw increasingly complex computerization, hybrid and battery/electric vehicles became 
more widespread, and the development of diagnostic tools, fleet management systems, 
and other systems assisting in the efficient repair and maintenance of a large fleet of 
diverse vehicle types were all adopted; and  
 
Throughout all those changes and the ensuing new challenges they brought, Sydney 
never lost a beat, never stopped working hard, and continued to shine as a truly 
wonderful individual who has been greatly loved by his colleagues throughout the 
Department of Public Works, and across the entire City; and  
 
In honoring his dedication, loyalty to his home city, and years of exemplary service to 
that city, it would be only fitting for the City to commemorate Sydney’s decades of 
service with a lasting tribute; now therefore be it   
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to rename the maintenance area 
within the Ryan Garage at 147 Hampshire Street in honor of Sydney Cox, with this 
becoming known as the “Sydney James Cox Maintenance Facility;” and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back on this matter to the 
City Council in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge committed in the 2015 Cambridge Bicycle Plan 
<https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Projects/Transportation/2020bikeplanupdate> to 
encourage bike ridership amongst its citizens by expanding bike facilities; and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

WHEREAS: 

Parking facilities appropriate for bicycles are often lacking or inadequate, especially in 
the City’s most urban areas; and 

WHEREAS: 

The 2015 Cambridge Bicycle Plan stated, “Providing bicycle parking also encourages 
people to use their bicycles as transportation; people are more likely to use a bicycle if 
they are confident that they will find convenient and secure parking at their 
destination”; and 

WHEREAS: 

The 2015 Cambridge Bicycle Plan stated a goal of 10% of all trips in Cambridge will 
be by bicycle by 2020, with an increase to 20% of all trips by 2030; and 

WHEREAS: 

Other cities use parking meters <http://www.somervillezoning.com/wp-
content/uploads/sites/2/2018/01/Article-11-%E2%80%93-Parking-Mobility-
20180109.pdf> to expand bicycle parking options by installing a ring which makes it 
easier for two bicycles to be locked to a single meter without limiting access of drivers 
to pay for parking; and 

WHEREAS: 

Installing a ring on parking meters will be significantly less expensive and less 
intrusive than installing separate bicycle parking rings; now therefore be it 

ORDERED: 

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with relevant City 
departments on the feasibility of instituting a program to install rings on parking 
meters, where they would be most needed, and how quickly it might be implemented; 
and be it further 

ORDERED: 

That the City Manager report back to the City Council in a timely manner.

WHEREAS:  The City of Cambridge believes that the culture of Indigenous peoples is one to be 

promoted, that the history is rich, diverse, and worthy of celebration, and that the actions 
and policies of European colonizers of the Americas destroyed a part of that culture, and 
inhibited the promulgation of it for generations to come; and 

WHEREAS:  The City of Cambridge understands the moral imperative of condemnation of these 

actions, as we now know them to be violations of justice in the eyes of international, 
domestic, and moral laws; and 

WHEREAS:  The Cambridge Rindge and Latin School decided in 1989 to change its mascot from the 

Warriors to the Falcons due to the offensive nature of Indigenous mascots and the 
stereotypes they perpetuate; and 

WHEREAS:  The City Council adopted 

<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=2762&highlightTerms
=indigenous> a policy order on June 6, 2016, stating that the second Monday of October 
henceforth be commemorated as Indigenous Peoples' Day in Cambridge, in recognition of 
the Indigenous people’s position as native to these lands, and the suffering they faced 
following European conquest of their land; and 

WHEREAS:  The City Council adopted 

<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=9657&highlightTerms
=massachusetts%20flag> a policy order on June 24, 2019, to find suitable location other 
than the Sullivan Chamber where the state flag may be displayed in compliance with state 
law, recognizing that the symbolism on the state flag is a painful reminder of the history 
of oppression and genocide indigenous peoples suffered at the hands of the colonists; and 

WHEREAS:  The Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts, and Celebrations 

Committee will continue to discuss ways to establish a more robust celebration of 
Indigenous Peoples Day in Cambridge; now therefore be it

the education of Native American residents of the commonwealth, and protecting Native 
American Heritage (S.1811/H.2948) by ensuring that Native American objects of cultural 
patrimony held in governmental, municipal or non-profit collections are not sold for 
profit; and be it further 

ORDERED:

The City of Cambridge believes that the culture of Indigenous peoples is one to be 
promoted, that the history is rich, diverse, and worthy of celebration, and that the actions 
and policies of European colonizers of the Americas destroyed a part of that culture, and 
inhibited the promulgation of it for generations to come; and

WHEREAS:

The City of Cambridge understands the moral imperative of condemnation of these 
actions, as we now know them to be violations of justice in the eyes of international, 
domestic, and moral laws; and

WHEREAS:

The Cambridge Rindge and Latin School decided in 1989 to change its mascot from the 
Warriors to the Falcons due to the offensive nature of Indigenous mascots and the 
stereotypes they perpetuate; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council adopted 
<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=2762&highlightTerms
=indigenous> a policy order on June 6, 2016, stating that the second Monday of October 
henceforth be commemorated as Indigenous Peoples' Day in Cambridge, in recognition of 
the Indigenous people’s position as native to these lands, and the suffering they faced 
following European conquest of their land; and

WHEREAS:

The City Council adopted 
<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=9657&highlightTerms
=massachusetts%20flag> a policy order on June 24, 2019, to find suitable location other 
than the Sullivan Chamber where the state flag may be displayed in compliance with state 
law, recognizing that the symbolism on the state flag is a painful reminder of the history 
of oppression and genocide indigenous peoples suffered at the hands of the colonists; and

WHEREAS:

The Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts, and Celebrations 
Committee will continue to discuss ways to establish a more robust celebration of 
Indigenous Peoples Day in Cambridge; now therefore be it

WHEREAS: 

In February 2014, former Cambridge City Manager Richard Rossi appointed an Early 
Childhood Task Force and charged it with developing a set of recommendations for 
how the City could better ensure that all children receive high quality early education 
and care, beginning with prenatal care and extending through third grade; and 
 
For many Cambridge families, finding high quality, full-day, year-round, affordable 
early childhood services is difficult and presents considerable financial hardships; and 
 
At the City Council and School Committee’s Joint Roundtable Meeting on Early 
Childhood on December 2, 2019, the key findings and recommendations from the 
Universal Pre-Kindergarten Program Study Report were discussed; and 
 
This included discussing what ongoing support the City could provide to Cambridge 
families while the development process for a universal pre-kindergarten program 
remains underway; and 
 
The current, limited hours offered by the Cambridge Head Start program present a 
barrier to many Cambridge families who would otherwise wish to participate in its 
programs; and 
 
Fifty-four children in the city have received scholarships to high-quality preschools to-
date; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with the Department of 
Human Services and other relevant departments to determine the feasibility of both 
expanding the Head Start program hours and adding additional scholarships to improve 
access to high-quality, early childhood educational resources for children and families 
in Cambridge; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter in time for 
consideration in the FY21 budget process.

WHEREAS: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that on December 11, 2019, the Indian 
parliament passed the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which for the first time 
uses religion as a criterion for Indian citizenship; and 
 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:  While the far-right Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of Indian Prime Minister 
Narendra Modi claims this policy will help refugees fleeing religious persecution from 
neighboring countries, it blatantly discriminates against citizenship based on religion, 
favoring Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian immigrants, while excluding 
Muslim people; and 
 
In August 2019, Modi’s right-wing government forced nearly two million people in the 
northeastern state of Assam to prove with documentary evidence their Indian 
citizenship or face detention at mass prisons and detention camps that the Indian 
government has begun to build and fill; and 
 
A nationwide expansion of this policy could strip hundreds of millions of people 
(disproportionately Muslim, oppressed castes, women, indigenous and LGBTQ+ 
communities) of their citizenship rights with no option to be re-naturalized; and 
 
Protests in India against this policy have faced repression including reports that in the 
state of Uttar Pradesh, police fatally fired live ammunition at demonstrators and 
arrested thousands, and reports that police destroyed Muslim homes in several cities; 
and 
 
In September 2019, President Trump hosted a “Howdy Modi” rally in Houston 
alongside Prime Minister Modi, in what the Washington Post ominously reported was, 
“the largest-ever gathering with a foreign political leader in the United States,” 
demonstrating the growing threat of far-right racist politicians building solidarity 
around the world; and 
 
Harvard graduate students and other activists recently staged a 24-hour protest in 
Harvard Square in condemnation of these actions; and 
 
The Modi regime’s repressive and racist policies are inconsistent with Cambridge’s 
values as a city that welcomes South Asian communities of all castes and religions; 
now therefore be it

the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship Amendment Act in India; and be 
it further 
 
That the City Council go on record calling for the Parliament of India to uphold the 
Indian constitution by repealing the Citizenship Amendment Act, stopping the 
National Register of Citizens, and taking steps towards helping refugees by ratifying 
various UN treaties on refugees; and be it further 
 
That the City Council go on record urging our congressional delegation to support 
legislation censuring the Republic of India for adopting these policies; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy to 
Cambridge’s Congressional Delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

As part of the Tobin Montessori/Vassal Lane Upper Schools Reconstruction Project, 
conceptual designs have been released; and 
 
There has been a concerted effort to find space for Elementary and Upper School 
enrollment expansion, additional much-needed programmatic elements and increased 
capacity for preschool enrollment, while at the same time preserving the need for open 
space, ensuring adequate traffic flow and appropriate site circulation has been 
challenging; and 
 
The National Guard Armory of Cambridge, located at 450 Concord Avenue, adjacent 
to the Tobin Montessori/Vassal Lane Upper Schools campus, presents a potential 
opportunity for the City to resolve community concerns that the proposed 
reconstruction designs would negatively impact the amount of available green space, 
and the flow of school traffic; and 
 
The Armory site, which is owned by the state (purchased from Cambridge in 1957), is 
currently underutilized; and 
 
A 2018 assessment of the Armory site by the state shows the need for significant 
investment to keep the site up to code; and 
 
The City Manager has sent a letter to the State Quartermaster expressing Cambridge’s 
strong interest in acquiring the Armory site; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record strongly supporting the City Manager’s request to 
purchase the National Guard Armory of Cambridge, and go on record as urging the 
City’s Delegation in the State Legislature to work to determine if the state will take the 
steps necessary to allow the City to purchase the entire site, to be for permanent public 
use in perpetuity by the City to address community driven needs; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of 
this policy order to the City’s Delegation in the State Legislature on behalf of the entire 
City Council.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  01:14 
Welcome everyone. The call of the meeting is as follows: We are meeting today discuss a 
proposed revised amendment to the zoning ordinance by creating the Grand Junction pathway 
overlay district. We do have a quorum today. We are joined by Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor 
Zondervan, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui and I am the co-chair of the ordinance 
committee. I'm Councillor Dennis Carlone. There, this hearing is being privately copied. And 
we're also joined by Mayor McGovern. This meeting is being audio and video recorded both by 
the city and privately. There is an attendee and speaker signup sheet right behind the railing 
near the entry to the room. If a member of the public does not wish to speak, please indicate by 
stating no on the speaker signup sheet, otherwise, I will ask you and call out your name. If you 
have a written comment, please, we ask to leave it in the basket right next to the podium or to 
email it to us before midnight tonight. Now you will notice in the package there is an attachment. 
There is one letter from Pamela Van Door. But if you sent an email the emails were not received 
in time to include in this package. But they will be included in the meeting notes. There are 
approximately five emails that will be included that were not received in time. The format of the 
meeting is as follows: the petitioner at the front table, Alexandria, will be giving a presentation. 
We will then hear from city staff comments. We know there was a recent Planning Board 
presentation and response with the Planning board Recommendation. Then we'll have a 
clarifying question period where the fellow councillors can ask questions to understand if 
something isn't unclear or make sure they fully understand the petition. After that we will have 
public comment. And following public comment, we will then open it up to the council to discuss, 
to discuss... it sounds like it's going in and out. Is it? All right, I'll start screaming. Going out 
again? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  05:18 
Councillor Simmons join us. She is recovering from an operation and it's unclear whether or not 
she will join us. Do I need to read this now? So, in case she does join us, I will read what the 
mayor normally reads. The city manager has authorized the use of remote participation at 
meetings of the city's public bodies and transmitted to the city council on May 13, 2012. The

7.1

Open Meeting Law regulations revised by the Attorney General on October 6, 2017. 940 CMR 
29.10 to be used as guidelines for the city's use of remote participation. The chair announces 
that Councillor Simmons will not be attending the meeting and will be participating remotely in 
the meeting. The chair requests that the absent Councillor Simmons to state for the record, 
when she comes on the phone, if she comes on, that the proceedings are clearly audible to her. 
We will ask Councillor Simmons to confirm the meeting is audible. The chair announces that 
Councillor Simmons is clearly audible to both the City Council and the public. And I'll confirm 
that. The chair of the meeting, that's me, announces that all votes taken at the meeting must be 
by roll call vote. So, we're not 100% sure she'll call in. If she feels she can, she will. But this 
way, I don't have to read that statement. So today, Alexandria Real Estate equities is back 
again. And they have made presentations in the past. And I understand that a lot of the 
presentation that we've been given, has been presented before. So, with that in mind, I'll turn it 
over to the team at the petitions desk. Sorry, I will get back to you. I apologize. But before that, 
Mayor McGovern. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  07:35 
Thank you, and I'm sorry to interrupt the proceedings. I need to leave to go to a School 
Committee meeting, to chair that meeting. So, I just wanted to say that, you know, so I won't be 
here for any vote on actions to be taken. So, I just wanted to say in general, my, my hope is that 
we see a positive outcome to this project and that the project moves forward. However, given 
that this doesn't expire until February or March, and we are very close to a resolution on the 
Eversource issue. But I don't feel that I could vote to support this until the Eversource issue is 
resolved. So, given that we are close to that, and that we are not up against the, our backs to 
the wall in terms of a timeline. I just wanted to make that if, you know, I would support it being 
kept in committee to allow that Eversource issue to be resolved, which I'm hoping will happen 
within the next couple weeks. And then, you know, I, I do think that the project is a worthwhile 
project and, and I'm open to it moving forward. But I think until that, until we get a resolution to 
the Eversource project we can't. So that's just my two cents. I need to take my leave, but I didn't 
want to walk out in the middle of the presentation. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  08:54 
Thank you...  
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  08:54 
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  08:54 
For telling us that and you look rather sharp tonight and we hope you have a good meeting. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  09:00 
Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  09:00 
Yes, Councillor. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey 09:02 
I don't have a school committee meeting, but I scheduled a personal commitment event for this 
evening before this meeting was scheduled. So, I also have to leave a little bit early, but I'll echo 
the comments of the mayor and hopefully that we can continue to work on this zoning issue, but 
I apologize, I do have to leave.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  09:24 
Thank you, Councillor Toomey. We understand. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  09:38 
The..Anthony Wilson is reminding me that there is also an email from Councillor Kelley with his 
recommendations that should be on your desk. He has personal family reasons why he couldn't 
be here tonight. So, with all that, we welcome you back. And I will turn it over to you and have 
you introduce your full team even though we know you very well by now. Welcome. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  10:13 
Thank you very much Councillor Carlone and thank you to all the Councillors, Vice Mayor, all 
the neighbors and all the city staff that we've worked on with this for quite a while at this point in 
time. This is our third refiling. Myself, I'm Michelle Lower, Vice President of Real Estate 
Development and Community Relations at Alexandria Real Estate Equities. I'm joined by Joe 
McGuire, Senior Vice President of Real Estate Development at Alexandria Real Estate Equities 
and counsel James Rafferty of Adams and Rafferty, is our team we have here. So, as Councillor 
Carlone mentioned, this is the same presentation we gave November 19th at the Planning 
Board. It is also essentially the same presentation we gave back on September 10. Here in this 
chamber at the Ordinance Committee, the only changes that have been made are to highlight 
the commitments that are within this refiled petition in the commitment letter. So, in, I am happy 
to run through the presentation very quickly. I am happy to abbreviate it. I am happy to have a 
discussion. So, I realize I can leave it up to, leave it up to councillors and the co-chair, as far as 
that goes. I'm happy to run through it. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  11:29 
I understand the presentation at the Planning Board was rather Swift. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  11:34 
Correct. It was it was rather swift. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  11:39 
I heard it broke the 15-minute record. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  11:42 
I think it might have Yes, I consider that a badge of honor. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  11:46 
So yes, councillors, your preference?

Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  11:52 
 Yes, Councillor Mallon. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  11:55 
As much as I would love to skip the presentation that I've seen many, many times. I am 
cognizant and aware that we have two new members who, one of them is at a school committee 
meeting tonight, and another member who is not here, who might want to review this tape and 
the presentation, unless they want to go back to the Planning Board [sic]. That might be a good

idea just to briefly run through the presentation, to have it on record in case those two members, 
the new members want to review that. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  12:25 
That's a very good suggestion councillor. So, if you don't mind, sorry, if this is echoing, I think 
the mayor must have pushed the button. Okay, thank you. Please. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  12:39 
I’m certainly happy to and I will, I'll run through quickly but can certainly stop at any time or 
answer any other questions. If you have them, please interrupt and stop me. So, this is our third 
refiled petition for the Grand Junction overlay district. Here we go. Highlighted first in this slide is 
just the changes that we've had through significant discussions with the neighborhood, 
councillors and other city staff. From the changes that we've made from our first initial petition, 
which, if you remember correctly, was more of two buildings at both at 120 feet. We have come 
down now to a building along the street side at 90 feet, a building on the northern side of the site 
of 60 feet and we have also limited the mechanical penthouse heights on the Binney Street side 
to 25 feet in height, in addition to the 90 feet. This is what I mentioned earlier the changes that 
have that have occurred since this third filing, we have accelerated a number of the 
commitments including the conveyance of the Grand Junction path to 90 days after the granting 
of special permit which was originally in the commitment letter for after our certificate of 
occupancy. So, this is a significant acceleration of the conveyance of land to the city, as well as 
bifurcating the payment of the, for the design and construction of the Grand Junction pathway. 
Similar to what we did in a previous zoning petition nine or 10 years ago, we have accelerated 
the payment of design funds of a million dollars to be paid at the same time as the Grand 
Junction pathway conveyance, which is 90 minutes, nine, excuse me 90 days after the special 
permit and approval. As you can see, other commitments are similar to what we've had in 
previous versions of the petition.  
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  14:43 
Very quickly, the highlight of our petition and our community benefit is really, put it, is really 
conveying 1,800 linear feet, making the connection of the Grand Junction pathway between the 
Binney Street connection and the Cambridge Street connection. It is 1,800 linear feet along 
there. Through a previous zoning petition, a section of land was conveyed but please note that 
we will be widening that to the city preferred 14 feet width, in that, all along the 1,800 linear feet 
connecting Binney Street to Cambridge street here. You can see here, it really is a key section 
of, that will be an off street, multimodal, non-vehicular connection of the Grand Junction 
pathway. You can see it includes this 686 Cambridge Street, a little building on Cambridge 
street, you can see directly to the left side of the photo is the Loyal Nine cafe. This building we 
envision would likely come down. It's nothing special, I think is probably optimistic to say about 
it. So, we envision it being some sort of entry pocket park here along Cambridge Street. Similar 
to Linear Park up on Mass Ave. You can see outlining here that our site, it's about four and a 
half acres, it's divided into the front section IA-1 and the back section to the right-hand side of 
the blue line, which the C-1 district. This is our zoning map that's included in the petition just in 
how it fits through the, within the neighborhood. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  16:32 
Quick outline of just the overall general community benefits that we have here. We envision 
there will be anywhere from three to 400 Union construction jobs on this site, for the period that 
it will be constructed. More than 1000 permanent jobs added and more than six and a half 
million dollars of, through the incentive zoning fee, based on the up-zone square footage that 
we're asking for in this petition. I think as everyone knows here, we, we really do appreciate all

the efforts that the neighbors in particular, as well as a number of councillors, have really put 
into this effort. It has been quite a community effort, quite a joint effort. I think we've, we've truly 
come into it and tried to be good neighbors and good listeners, I think our project is better 
because of it. We were challenged initially at the beginning of the process to come up with a 
building that was appropriate for the site by the Planning Board. And I really do think we've done 
that. I think the massing that we've come up with now is, is appropriate for the site and is an 
exciting opportunity. And this is what you can see here in the light gray labeled 90 feet and 60 
feet is the current massing that we're proposing in this refiled petition. The darker gray shows 
the commitment of the reduced height and mechanical space. So, you have 25 feet along 
Binney street, 20 Feet along the northern portion of the building. You can see a shaded in light 
red is how far we've come down. That was our original petition there. Also showing the 
traditional height penthouse which was between 35 and 40 feet both on the Binney street side 
and the northern side.  
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  18:20 
You can see here this highlights the different zones. This came out of, initially in our first 
petition, some of the initial feedback we got was that we really felt that we needed a transition 
zone on the site and in, after further design and looking at further plans. We agree, so I think 
this has been, this is just a depiction of showing the Binney Street zone with the higher heights 
at 90 feet, the transition zone at 60 feet and the C-1 zone and shown in the light blue or gray 
color is a site primarily filled with the C-1 district that will have no development on it. This is our 
contact, context image, which we really used. We did a lot of testing of different models. I think 
we're up to north of 35 different masses and heights and all sorts of things on the site. It was a 
fun process. And I think this is really the image that we used. You can see highlighted on all of 
the surrounding structures, we have the height of the tallest occupiable floor, which per zoning 
is the height of the building, as well, as we've also noted the penthouse heights here. So, we 
feel that this building truly is in context with the buildings to the east and west of it, as well as it's 
an appropriate addition to the overall Kendall Square neighborhood. Here we have, what you 
can see how we've taken care of with the massing of the building, to pull it back in areas that we 
can to really make sure that we're not impacting the views or with shadow of the surrounding 
neighbors. So, the tallest 90-foot portion of the building is more than 400 feet away from the 
nearest residence. Whereas the 60-foot portion of the building is nearly 300 feet, exactly 287 
feet away. This is the transition zone graphic overlaid over the mass of our building. You can 
see how it makes sense here and the deeper purple the 90 feet with a 20-foot mechanical pen... 
Excuse me. 25-foot mechanical penthouse on the Binney street side. 60 feet in the lighter blue, 
the grayish light blue color on the right with the base zoning no build district. Here quickly we 
just have the sun studies, we have done countless number of studies of these, these have 
evolved from suggestions from councillors and neighbors. So, you can see the new shadow that 
would be casted by our new mass is in blue whereas all of the other existing shadows from 
other buildings are in the gray. So, you can see this is in the winter solstice from nine to two 
o'clock I believe. We actually do not touch the nearest house and I believe I don't know if I got in 
under my 15 minutes but that is what we have our presentation.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  21:33 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would look to go over the commitment letter. So, for the conveyance of 
the land, I am concerned about any delays in, in the construction of the Grand Junction path. 
And so, I would prefer to see a different commitment here that transfers the land as soon as the

city is ready to receive it. So that if that were to happen before the special permit, then it would 
be transferred and if it were to happen after then it would be transferred at that point. But the 
way it is right now, it's, it's not really connected to when the city's ready to move forward. And 
similarly, on the, on the payment. Certainly, appreciate the design payment up front. The 
construction payment again, I think, I would like to see some way, maybe it's through an escrow 
or some way to say that the money's there as soon as the city's ready to begin construction. 
And if that happens sooner than the money is transferred sooner, and if it happens later, then 
it's done at that time. And also, I appreciate the community process. I was told, however, that 
there were no meetings with the East Cambridge Planning Team, or at least no recent 
meetings. Is that true? 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  23:30 
This... James Rafferty. This petition, which is a refiled petition with no text changes. We have 
not yet met again on this petition, but we have kept them advised of our status. Our principal 
[sic], our principal meetings have occurred with the working group from Linden Park. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  23:49 
Thank you, and through you, Mr. Chairman. I certainly appreciate that. I think they would 
appreciate a, an updated presentation maybe earlier, earlier in the... 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  23:59 
Yeah and it's an ongoing relationship and Alexandria goes there a lot. So happy to do so. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  24:06 
Thank you.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  24:07 
Based on Councillor Zondervan's comment on when money and land is transferred. Could you 
explain why you said 90 days after special permit? 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  24:26 
Well, the 90-day buffer was created because of the structure of our acquisition contracts. Land 
that we will be purchasing from the church, for instance, if the special permit were not granted, 
we're not going to be buying that land. So, we put in a 90-day window to allow us to complete 
the due diligence in conveyancing work associated with acquiring the church parcel, principally. 
We're also informed in our timeline proposals with the experience we had in both conveying the 
Roger Street Park, as well as the foundry building. Both of which took an extended period of 
time on the receiving end, as opposed to the selling end. So, we tried to be realistic and create 
that. So, some of this land, particularly the land, in particularly significant portion of the land 
includes land that we don't own, but we have a contractual opportunity to purchase. We wouldn't 
close on that land until we knew we had the special permit. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  25:45 
Did you want to respond Councillor? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  25:48 
Thanks. Yeah, I mean, I think you know, again, that timing will probably work out okay. But, But 
I am concerned that if there are delays on your end for a special permit, let's say for, you know, 
reasons outside of the city's control, then that could delay the moving forward with the Grand 
Junction and, you know, that's really not acceptable to us. So, I think, you know, if there's some 
way to restructure that agreement so that we know that the Grand Junction will move forward.

Regardless, I mean, it's almost like holding the city hostage, you know, if we approve the 
zoning, then there's no real risk to your, to your project, at that point. That would warrant, you 
know, not moving forward with the Grand Junction and if, if... The Grand Junction essentially in 
this particular situation is kind of the, you know, the big gift to the city that, that's compensating 
for this huge development. And so, for us not to have a guarantee that, that will move forward 
as quickly as it possibly could. Is, is not, it's not good enough for me. I want to, I want to be able 
to say to our constituents that if we approve the zoning, the Grand Junction will move forward as 
quickly as it possibly can. And if, if the delay is on the city side, then you know, that's on us. But 
I don't want to have the risk that the delay is on your side, and then, you know, we have to wait 
years for the completion of that project. 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  27:44 
Well, I think there's a couple of ways in which that can be addressed. We can certainly 
contemplate adding best efforts type language to pursue a special permit application. The other 
language you have, frankly councillor, I think that will be more dispositive of the timing is the 
phrase, the very critical and important phrase, about when the city is ready to accept this. This 
land is going to need to be remediated environmentally. We cannot, the city will not take the 
land with remediation, as I'm sure you can appreciate, we can't even begin to remediate the 
land until we own it. So, the likelihood is that the remediation needs to take place. We've 
already done some preliminary understanding based on soil conditions in the general area of 
the scope of that kind of remediation. So, our experience at Rogers Street in with the foundry 
building was that we had to deliver land in a quality that was acceptable to the city, and that 
includes significant remediation as well as environmental insurance. We would anticipate all of 
those steps would probably take the amount of time that would be within that 45-day window. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  28:57 
Thanks, I certainly appreciate that that takes time. You know, that's not, I'm not concerned 
about that. What I'm concerned about is, you know, that if there's some other delay in, on your 
part to getting a special permit, and then only after you've received your special permit, then you 
start the remediation and, you know, then there's possibilities here for a very long delay and we, 
we are being asked to vote on the zoning now and in exchange for the Grand Junction. So, I 
think we deserve to know that it's going to happen as fast as it possibly can. And you know, 
accepting that that includes time to remediate land and so forth, but, but if all of that is 
dependent on special permit... I mean, if I if I read this correctly, you will transfer 90 days after 
special permit. So, so that wouldn't work if, if you have to remediate it unless you can remediate 
in less than 90 days. Right? So, so then that doesn't even comport with, with this language 
because you would have to initiate the remediation before you could get your special permit, if 
you were to transfer the land 90 days after you got your special permit. 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  30:25 
Right. I think the commitment letter that does also contain the language about, we be prepared 
to convey subject to acceptance by the city. I have to say that Alexandria has been at this for 
two years now. We have a prior history with the city on the conveyance and delivery of land and 
funds. And at some point, in this process, I think that track record as well as these commitments 
would be binding. So, I believe we could probably look at some language that perhaps had an 
outside date or perhaps at a best efforts. But when this occurs, I think the council needs to be 
aware that you're a little bit now in the development game. And there are some uncertainties 
associated with that. I would only say that this move here would represent, however long it 
takes, this would be the most significant advancement of this plan in 20 years. So, the fact that 
we're at this point, I think, is deserving of some recognition.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  31:37 
Thank you. And I do acknowledge that, and I thank you for that, for that effort. And I'm in no way 
doubting your commitment nor, or ability to deliver. And I'm just concerned about potential 
delays. So, I appreciate you looking at some ways that we can mitigate that risk. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:00 
Thank you, Councillor. I have Councillor Mallon first, and then the vice mayor. Councillor you're 
up. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  32:07 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Through you. And thank you to Ms. Lower for indulging us and presenting 
that one more time to this committee. I appreciate it. I just want to stay on the commitment letter 
for a minute. And item number three, where we talk about Alexandria having a commitment for 
the period of three years after the adoption of this zoning to purchase the piece of land that's 
currently owned by Eversource for close to $13 million. If all goes well, as the mayor alluded to 
earlier, we are hopefully very close to some sort of resolution on that and that Eversource would 
in the best-case scenario, sell the land to Alexandria. Within three years, this is all the best-case 
scenario, but there are other options there. There are other like, you know, different scenarios 
that might come up. Eversource might sit on the land for four years, land bank it. There might be 
another buyer that could come forward. And then this 13 million that I thought all along, maybe 
lots of us thought all along with part of the community benefits package goes away. So, I'm 
wondering if there's a way to talk about and think about this 13 million. If that best-case scenario 
doesn't come to fruition, if there is a way to, for us to write into the zoning or talk about perhaps 
an alternate, in case at the end of three years this land is not able to be conveyed to Alexandria 
for another purpose. Whether that's goes into the Affordable Housing Trust or into the 
community benefits fund to be rented out for another, in another round of funding. If there's a 
way that we can think about that, that $13 million, what happens to that at the expiration date, if 
Eversource is just not willing or able to come to the table to sell that land. 
 
Joseph McGuire, Senior Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities  34:12 
My name is Joseph McGuire, from Alexander real estate equities. And to answer a constable 
Mallon, we are prepared to have that be a community benefit. And we'd have to talk about what 
the structure would be for that. It could go to any number of city type benefit funds. So, we're 
open to have that discussion. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  34:40 
Thank you. I'm glad to hear that. I think you know, as a city, we have identified affordable 
housing as one of our number one priorities and there's also community needs through the 
community benefits fund that we've identified through the community needs assessment. So I 
think if we could think about for the next meeting, how to reword that so that it’s a little bit more 
clear what happens at the end of those three years should Eversource not have the best case 
scenario, where they decided to find another location and that that parcel doesn't get sold to you 
for this, up to this amount. So, if that's something that we could do for the next meeting, that 
would be, that would be great. 
 
Joseph McGuire, Senior Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities  35:20 
We'd like, we'd like to discuss it more with one or more councillors. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  35:24 
Great. Thank you.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  35:26 
Thank you, Councillor Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  35:29 
Thank you. Thanks for going back over the material and refreshing our memories. I'm having a 
hard time understanding Councillor Zondervan point, because if I heard you correctly, you don't 
own the path land. So, you can't convey something to the city that you don't own. And you 
wouldn't purchase all of the land. Yeah, go ahead.  
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  35:50 
There are three components to the land. There's the portion out on Cambridge Street that we do 
own. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  35:55 
Yeah. 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  35:55 
There's the portion along at standing at Binney Street that we do on. And there's a portion in the 
middle owned by the church, which we have under contract to purchase. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  36:03 
But you're saying. I think I heard you say that you wouldn't execute that purchase until you had 
a special permit [sic]. So, I mean, I guess I don't understand how you can convey something 
that you don't own. So, it seems, I guess I'm, I'm not that worried about a delay in your seeking 
a special permit unless something cataclysmic happens and I don't know, but I was just trying to 
clarify that. So, um, and on the Eversource. Yeah, go ahead. 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  36:38 
I'm not following your question. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  36:40 
Well, I guess I guess my question was really more to Councillor Zondervan. Because it, I 
thought I heard him saying that he wanted you all to convey it to the city before the special 
permit or if the special permit for some reason was delayed, to still convey it. And I didn't see 
how that would be possible if it was if your acquisition of that the final piece, you wouldn't be 
doing that. Unless... So, I'm really, I think I'm really asking him and not you. But you know. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  37:10 
Councillor Zondervan. Why don't you respond? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  37:13 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Through you. Yes, I agree that that's the problem. And so, what I'm 
asking is for a different arrangement, so that the possibility exists to convey the land 
nonetheless, I mean, things happen, you know, there could be a recession, there could be a 
hiccup in, in their financing or their process for moving forward. And that could cause a lengthy 
delay, if they, if they've created this dependency. Also, even if they weren't willing or able to do 
that. The way this is currently structured, if, if it's going to take significant amount of time to 
remediate the land after purchasing it, before handing it off to the city, then this 90 days after 
special permit, it wouldn't be enough time to do all that. So, you know I'm, I'm just highlighting 
that dependency and asking for some creative thinking about how we could do it otherwise. I

mean, the other components they already own so there's no inherent reason why they couldn't 
buy the other the missing piece now if they wanted to.  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  38:27 
Okay, all right, I guess... 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  38:28 
Well the reality is that the project doesn't go forward if the special permit isn't issued. So, a 
scenario where an application for a special permit was denied would then not involve the 
conveyance of the church land which we, which we wouldn't own. So, it's not a unique construct 
in a community benefit contract situation like this, is upon certain action happening, the 
conveyance occurs. So, as I said earlier, we'd be happy to explore language that places a best 
efforts requirement and maybe even an outside date requirement that would, I fully understand 
the notion of well, we want it to happen sooner rather than later. My client to the right is 
struggling with the notion that we've done this once before, and the delay wasn't on our side 
about what happened here. So happy to look at language that, that gets you more comfortable 
and provides for scenarios other than what is setup here. I think, I think my immediate sense or 
reaction is that best efforts requirements, I can tell you that architects are at the ready, the 
market seems in a strong position. We'd like to get the zoning adopted sooner rather than later 
as you well know from our position. So, the sooner we get the zoning, the sooner we get the 
special permit. So maybe we've got a shared interest at some point here about moving this 
petition forward in a way that gets us that much quicker to a special permit and that much 
quicker to a conveyance. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  40:17 
Vice Mayor, I think you still have the floor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  40:20 
Yeah, thanks I... Okay. So, I guess we've settled that part or at least we've clarified each other's 
position there on the Eversource land. Without knowing what's being discussed with the other 
property owners for an alternative site, is it not possible in that agreement to require or, or 
whatever Eversource to sell to you as part of that agreement? I had always assumed that once 
an agreement for an alternative location was struck, there wasn't really a possibility that 
Eversource would say, oh, we'll just hold onto this land for a rainy day or shop it around or land 
bank it and try to get more. So is there a way that we can put that promise from Eversource 
that... You know, because you guys have spent a lot of time and money. And the city is 
spending a lot of time and money trying to find this alternative location. But it hadn't occurred to 
me that Eversource wouldn't be motivated to sell the land. 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  41:30 
Mr. Chair, I would say it's a highly unlikely scenario. And my expectation, and... 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  41:37 
That they would hold it you mean. it just, which is unlikely that they would decide... 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  41:40 
Unlikely that Eversource would not sell it. In fact, I would anticipate that whatever 
documentation arises out of the Eversource conversations that are ongoing now, will in fact 
create obligations on the part of Alexandria to buy that land. Because from the conversations... 
We've had limited engagement.  The alternative location that Eversource is exploring, their 
reporting will cost them more than the Fulkerson Street location. And they have cited their need

to recover their real estate costs there, which is well above market costs. So, I think the 
likelihood that someone will come along and look to spend more money than $13 million on a 
parcel that you recall sold for $6 million in the morning, which was the fair market value, one 
would say, and then a buyer stepped in a few hours later. So, I mean, we could spend a lot of 
time on scenarios that are really very unlikely. So, I think the more likely scenario, and we won't 
see it until we see the documentation on that, but I would say that's the place where you would 
see memorialized obligations around the disposition of the Eversource Fulkerson Street parcel. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  42:56 
Good, because that's what I had had thought, but it was only Councillor Mallon introducing the 
possibility that that might not happen that, it hadn't occurred to me that it wouldn't happen. So, 
I'm hearing you say that, I know that, you know, right, nothing so sure yet, but you think it is 
highly unlikely. 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  43:12 
In my world Councillor Mallon is doing what's called good lawyering. Calling for a highly unlikely 
scenario but providing for it. And given the fact that that is highly unlikely, but, you know, 
perhaps not impossible. I don't think... 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  43:33 
I thought the suggestion made sense, it's in that highly unlikely scenario, but I think creating 
additional obligations in the commitment letter is probably not the right vehicle. I think you'll see 
it in the in the documents around the relocation. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  43:48 
Okay, good. Thank you. I guess it's just good to hear you say it's highly unlikely and... 
 
James Rafferty, Esq., Adams and Rafferty  43:52 
Once again, we'd love to see that document sooner than later, obviously, right. So, but we're 
not, we're really not the driving seat on that one. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  44:01 
Well, well clearly whatever is done, and then I'll welcome Councillor Simmons is going to be 
negotiated with the city, the legal department, whatever agreement you're offering, so that will 
be considered and will be worked on and we'll hear about it. At this point, I want to welcome 
Councillor Simmons. I need to ask Councillor Simmons, can you hear us? Finally? Finally, can 
you hear us? Councillor Simmons, can you hear us? Are we audible?  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  44:38 
Yes, I can.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  44:39 
Thank you and we can hear you as well. Thank you very much. So, councillors... 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  44:44 
Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  44:45 
 Yes, Councillor Toomey, please.

Councillor Timothy Toomey  44:47 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, I apologize for having to leave. But hopefully that scenario works 
out that Alexandria purchases the Eversource sites on Fulkerson Street and I'm sure everybody 
will anticipate and appreciate that that site be converted to open space somehow to convert, to 
connect with the open space across the street. So, I hope that's on the top of everyone's radar 
screen. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  45:18 
Other council comments, Councillor Siddiqui, do you have any quick questions? I believe the 
city will indeed be involved in a decision of what happens on that property. Open Space is one 
that I've heard, I've also heard housing. We're not in that position right now. So, I'm going to ask 
city staff to come forward and ask the development team to just move back a few feet. And 
perhaps Mr. Goldberg could also address some of the issues that have been brought up, at 
least from his perspective. And, and Mr. Roberts, welcome, Ms. Farooq welcome. Perhaps, Jeff, 
you could start off or Iram with an overview of the Planning Board hearing and any issues that 
you see before us. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  46:29 
Good evening, Mr. Chair, and I think the Planning Board's hearing, as was alluded to earlier 
was fairly brief on this. And I would say that they have made a positive recommendation. There 
were nine members at the meeting and eight of them voted in favor, there was one abstention. 
But they generally felt very supportive and were positively disposed towards this petition. 
Principally because they felt that so much progress had been made in, in each of the iterations 
since the initial filing. And they particularly felt that Alexandria had been very responsive to the 
comments that had been raised by them, as well as by the community. They particularly felt that 
the reductions in height, and especially of the commitments to having lower mechanical 
equipment was a positive action in this latest iteration. And they also, I would say, felt pretty, 
very positive about the community conversations that Alexandria had been, has been engaging 
in over the course of the various, the evolution of the, evolution of the petition. So, so they, I 
would say those were the key issues. They did not again go into all of the issues related to the 
Grand Junction and so forth at this hearing. But clearly those are priorities for the city. And also, 
you know, the Grand Junction is a priority for the city from a planning perspective for a long 
time. And the board also has recognized that in in earlier discussions related to this petition. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  48:27 
Just a quick follow up question. When MIT transferred land for Volpe, assuming they have, they 
haven't yet, they would have to clean up their land, first, before the city would accept it? Just as 
we heard from Alexandria. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  48:46 
Yes, Mr. Chair, the MIT rezoning also has similar provisions to what are being discussed here, 
and so the land would be transferred at a later time. Certainly, the city has established 
standards, standards for how the land has to be cleaned up per what the future use would be, 
before we would accept the transfer of land. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  49:17 
And is there any estimate what a cleaning up period would be? I know it depends on what's 
there. And, yeah.

Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  49:27 
We don't know ahead of time how long that process would take. But usually, developers have 
been, you know, Alexandria, for instance, has transferred land, it's been, it's not been terribly 
long. But it's the, the discussion about what level it needs to be cleaned up to, the investigations 
of what is actually on the site and then what needs to be done to remediate it and to what level. 
Those are really the pieces that working those out in the past have taken, that's the piece that 
takes time and then the cleanup can begin soon thereafter. I would say the one distinction 
between this particular instance, you know the Grand Junction versus other pieces that were 
alluded to in the presentation like Roger Street park or the foundry is that the city had not done 
planning for those parcels ahead of time. Whereas in this case, we have done years of planning 
for Grand Junction and are getting pretty detailed into the design process already. And so, I 
would say that the city would be better positioned to move faster in this instance than in other in 
other instances where we had to begin a planning process once we received a parcel of land, 
so that would not be the case here. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  50:53 
Thank you. Mr. Roberts, do you wish to add anything from the Planning Board or otherwise? 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  51:00 
No, thank you, Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  51:01 
Well done. Mr. Goldberg, as far as the agreement on time period, I assume this is correct that 
you negotiate that, and you make sure the agreement is up to the city's satisfaction legally and 
time wise. 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  51:23 
Yes, as a matter of course, we would negotiate that agreement, and we would do that as quickly 
as we can. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  51:32 
So, if I might say, what you've heard sounds reasonable from the applicant, reasonable and 
typical of projects in this general area where pollution is likely. Ballpark. 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  51:53 
Yes, I think, in general. Sure. And I think we are to commitment by the applicant to try to figure 
out how to maybe speed up the transfer and maybe change a little bit of that language currently 
in the commitment letter to speed up the process. So, I think that's certainly possible for them to 
do and we're happy to look at that. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  52:22 
Great. Thank you. Any clarifying questions? Councillors? Okay, I don't see any. So, thank you 
and we are going to open up public...Oh, Councillor Simmons, did you... Sorry, did you have 
any questions of the city staff? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  52:44 
Thank you. No thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  52:45 
Thank you. Okay, so we will open up public comment. And it looks like Pamela Van Dort might 
be first person. Welcome Pamela followed by Matthew Connolly.

7.1

 
53:11 
Good evening, Pamela Van Dort from 13 Cornelius Way. Thank you for the opportunity to 
provide comment on this petition in the third iteration. I also want to start by acknowledging all of 
the efforts, Alexandria has gone to with this petition to work with the neighbors. As they 
mentioned, we've had numerous meetings and we really appreciate that, and I want the council 
to know. Our position generally on this petition is the same as it was in the last filing, that this is 
just too big of a building without the mitigation of moving the Eversource substation from right 
next door. That just immediately abutting our houses that are 25 feet high in Linden Park, 
having 160 foot, potentially, high substation right next to a very tall building is just too much for a 
neighborhood. Hopefully, all this will be resolved with Eversource. But unfortunately, hopes and 
dreams are not what concrete things are built on. As Jim Rafferty mentioned earlier, we could 
spend a lot of time talking about the different possibilities of how this specifically could play out. 
But instead of doing that, I would ask the council instead, wait until we have the facts before us 
of what's actually happening there. Which we've been told by the mayor and hopefully others 
that are involved will be happening soon. So that we're not we're making an informed judgment. 
That you guys can make an informed vote knowing all of the facts that are at play regarding the 
Eversource solution and what's happening with that parcel of land which immediately abuts the 
Grand Junction land. That's the subject part of this proposal. As mentioned earlier, there's still 
time, the petition does not expire until March of 2020. So even with a new council coming in, we 
anticipate asking that council to prioritize naming an Ordinance Committee chair so that this can 
be considered at that time. Hopefully by then there will be news that we can discuss with 
concrete facts, and everybody can make an informed decision. So, we ask that you please vote 
tonight to keep this in committee. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  55:08 
Thank you. Matthew Connolly is next followed by Jason Alves. Welcome, Matthew. 
 
55:18 
Thank you. Good evening, Matthew Connelly at 13 Cornelius Way. I want to build on what 
Pamela said and I know that the Cambridge Residents Alliance submitted an email yesterday 
that they specifically asked that I mention. But to build on those concepts. I guess the problem 
that I have at least is that the benefit to the developer is immediate once this up-zoning is 
passed. Once you pass the ordinance, Alexandria gets 163,000 new square feet to their 
property which adds immediate value to them. The problem to the city and I think to the 
neighborhood is that the benefits are contingent, the Grand Junction pathway is contingent on a 
special permit some point down the road that may or may not happen, and may, or may not 
happen at some other point in time. But more importantly, the bigger issue to us is Eversource. 
And there are a lot of issues that still need to be resolved. And for us, Eversource is mission 
critical. If it doesn't move, we cannot live with two large buildings near us. We appreciate 
everything Alexandria has done to work with us. But it is a building that we think is too big. And 
it has a major impact on us. That the reason why we're willing to accept it is because of 
Eversource. And at this moment, it's entirely contingent. It depends on a number of things that 
haven't resolved themselves. And the timing wasn't one of our making. It was one of. frankly, 
Alexandria's they knew that Eversource wasn't resolved yet. They could have waited for it to be 
resolved before refiling their petition, but for a number of reasons they chose now. And with that 
in mind, I mean, frankly, I would, I hope it stays in committee. I hope Eversource, that we get the 
best-case scenario. But until that happens, I, I just don't think it can move forward. And if that 
means, ultimately that the petition doesn't pass this cycle, and I don't think that will be the case, 
but if that worst case scenario happened, I would frankly rather live with a building under current

zoning than risk both a large building from Alexandria and an incredibly large tower from 
Eversource. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  57:31 
Thank you, Jason Alves, followed by Lee Ferris, but I believe she left. Welcome, Jason.  
 
57:38 
Hi. Jason Alves, Director of the East Cambridge Business Association, 877 Cambridge Street. 
Here again to offer our support for the petition by Alexandria. I think this petition's come a long 
way as they've kind of demonstrated, thanks to the work of the community and the developers. 
Again, the benefit of the Grand Junction shouldn't be understated. This is the third time that 
they've refiled the petition. There's an opportunity before you, I hope that the new council and 
the new mayor is very mindful of the expiration date of this. You can really deliver a long coming 
benefits to the community if you folks can act quickly. And it would be great if we could get an 
update on the Eversource. I think it would put a lot of folks’ minds at ease on where this stands. 
I think we keep hearing that there's good news coming, but there's not really a lot of information 
out there about it. And I'm also a member of the Grand Junction Design Working Group. It's, the 
path really shouldn't be understated. I think at the last meeting, they explained that they did 
some studies and they think that the path is going to be more, it's going to be... there's a higher 
use than there currently is on the, the Minuteman trail that runs through Ellington and Lexington. 
So, it's a good project for the city. It's been a long time coming, supportive of the petition moving 
forward. Thank you very much. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  57:53 
Thank you. So, no one else has signed up. But I have noticed a few other people are here. If 
you wish to speak, just raise your hand if not also, you do not want to speak. No one seems to 
have raised their hands. So, I'm going to close public comment. Thank you very much. So 
councillors, here we are. Councillor Siddiqui. Oh, please, why don't you read that? 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  59:34 
I can bring it up for you. Okay. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  59:40 
I had it but I misplaced it. So, this Councillor Siddiqui reminded me that Councillor Kelley, who is 
away for family reasons, asked me to read this short note. Dear ordinance committee members, 
I'm sorry to miss today's meeting on the Alexandria real estate zoning proposal, but I have 
unavoidable family obligations. My understanding is that for Alexandria, the third time is either 
the charm for this proposal or it's not and if it is the latter, there will not be a fourth refiling. If this 
current zoning proposal does not pass, I understand Alexandria will be planning to simply move 
forward on a project that meets the existing zoning to allow the next council to more easily vote 
on this proposal, to include issues around both the Eversource siting and the multimodal 
pathway. I urge the Ordinance Committee to move the proposed zoning change back to the full 
council at Tuesday. That is today's meeting. That way regardless of how quickly a mayor is 
elected, and committees appointed, the council as a body will be more easily able to decide how 
to move forward or not. Before the petition expires, he wrote February but it's in March. The new 
council may not feel what Alexandria has proposed is worthy of support. But at least they'd be 
able to look at it without the added complication of a committee related clock. Signed, Craig. So, 
we do have other letters of Pamela Van Dort, sent a letter and she pretty much follow the 
content of that letter. So here we are, what do the committee members wish to say? Councillor 
Mallon.

Councillor Alanna Mallon  62:02 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to mention in terms of Councillor Kelly's letter, he does 
mention that the expiration date is in February when in fact it's March 9. So, I do think that we 
have a little bit more time in here than he was maybe thinking of. And in terms of, I know that 
this is a hard time and a transitional time because we have a new council coming in and there's 
always a little bit of a lag time. But Councillor Siddiqui and I were looking earlier on other 
transitional times and when the first ordinance committee hearing was held in that January, and 
in January 2018, we heard the Crohn petition on January 24. So, it can be done. I know a lot 
hinges on who is the mayor and one that is chosen and decided. We can't know that today. But 
I do think if we as a body are willing to prioritize this petition and ensure that it gets, it does get 
heard in the ordinance committee. Well in time for the march 9 expiration date, I think that we all 
have a commitment here. I know that Councillor Toomey and, and, and that Mayor McGovern 
both expressed that they wanted to prioritize this petition because it is a good one. It's a good 
project. I think it has gone through; this is the third refiling. And I think Alexandria has done an 
amazing job working with the community and the neighborhood to make sure that it's a project 
that feels right is going to deliver a critical transportation and community need in East 
Cambridge by providing a piece of the Grand Junction path that we've identified as a city, that is 
a need and I think if we let this opportunity to go we, it is going to be a mistake.  
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  63:54 
However, the specter out there is Eversource on Fulkerson street, and I think we've all said 
Here very publicly that the issue of Eversource on Fulkerson street needs to be worked on. And 
it is currently being worked on in a committee. I know that the mayor said that it was very close. 
I know we're all very anxious to get to a resolution on this. But I'm being told that it's not going to 
be happening. We're not going to hear anything until after the first of the year. So, I would have 
a very hard time moving this out of the Ordinance Committee tonight, not because I don't think it 
is a great project, not because I don't think that Alexandria really put in the time with the 
community and with this body. I want to really make sure that I'm expressing that to all of you, 
thank you for working with the community. And thank you to Pamela and Matt for always coming 
and telling us exactly, you know the, how things are going. I, but I would, I would have a really 
hard time moving this out of committee, given that we do have the time, before the expiration 
and we have some breathing room. So, I guess those are my thoughts. Those are my feelings. 
And I will yield the floor. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  65:07 
Councillors? Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  65:10 
Yeah, if I, I agree with all you said about, you know, in general supporting the petition and 
appreciating the effort that has gone into getting it to this point I, I would note that, the whoever 
is new mayor, the, the ordinance committee is a committee of the whole so we know that every 
member of the new council is going to be a member. Appointing a chair could be done, or chairs 
could be done prior to figuring out all of the other committee formations and I believe the mayor 
is ex officio. Well, the mayor is on all the committees. But couldn't the mayor simply schedule an 
ordinance committee meeting regarding, even before a chair was settled? We could get it on the 
calendar. So, I don't, I really don't think there's any great obstacle in waiting until the new 
council and Mayor are chosen, probably on January 6. And then there are even with the two 
holidays, even with Martin Luther King Day and the President's Day holiday there are still you 
know, six, seven council meetings between the 13th and March ninth. So, I just I just feel like 
there's time and as soon as the Eversource decision is known, whoever is Mayor can schedule 
an Ordinance Committee meeting.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  66:36 
Councillor Zondervan, or Councillor Siddiqui, comments? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  66:41 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm in favor of keeping it in committee. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  66:45 
Councillor Siddiqui? 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  66:47 
I concur with my colleagues.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  66:49 
Okay. Well, I think we've all said previously that we need Eversource to be settled, but I do want 
to say that having worked... Yes Councillor Simmons, please. Excuse me, I forgot your 
presence. Please comment. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  67:15 
[sic] It's difficult to participate this way because I can't read the room but from hearing my 
colleagues speak. I certainly appreciate their thoughts. I do disagree. I lean more toward 
Councillor Kelley's perspective about moving this to the whole committee for a number of 
reasons. I do understand what people are saying that the petition doesn't expire until March, I 
believe. I guess my concerns are. If we did everything on a timely fashion, the mayor's picked in 
a timely way and committees are appointed in a timely way. There are things that you can't 
control for like, bad weather, people not being able to attend. And so, I believe that the petition 
is a good one. We've been talking about the Grand Junction pathway. It seems like to me for 
time immemorial, and I don't necessarily see a problem with moving it to the whole committee. It 
says a couple of things ever... excuse me, the petitioner has shown good faith. This is their third 
time before the council. And it's not because they just wanted to drag this out. It's because it 
seems to me, the petitioner has worked really hard to engage the community and work with the 
community about what is going to be good for the community at large. And I, it feels to me like 
we're making Eversource the bridge that they have to make right when it's really Eversource, in 
my opinion, that we should be negotiating with. That being said, I would really like to see this 
moved to the to the whole Council. Maybe we move it without a recommendation. It's past the 
Planning Board. I would respectfully ask to move it without a recommendation to the full council. 
The new council can weigh in on it. But it takes us out of that place of the unknown. What if a 
mayor is not chosen? I suspect the mayor will be chosen. But what if the mayor is not chosen? 
What if meetings are postponed and they don't happen? And then we will have taken one step 
that we could have moved forward and we did not do it. So, I respectfully ask that we move this 
to the full city council. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  69:49 
Thank you. The question is, is that a motion. I haven't spoken yet. So, I would like to speak, 
even if it was a motion. We have almost three months. Now I grant true there are holidays, the 
mayor selection and everything else was literally 90 days from today. And we all made a 
promise. Now, on the other hand, I have said this privately, I don't know if I've said it publicly, 
this development team, the neighborhood group, have worked better together than any other 
project that I've been affiliated with over the last 40 years. And, but the major hindrance is not 
the project, which I think today has been an excellent evolution. It's the problem in the room, 
which is Eversource. And I concur with my, most of my fellow councillors that we, we could not

move this forward at this time. And that if I'm head of one of the chairs of the Ordinance 
Committee and I don't, will not determine that. Although, I've been the head, one of the heads 
for the last three terms. I will make this the first Ordinance hearing and conjunction, planning it 
with the mayor. That's my commitment. So, I think we all appreciate what's been done. 
Alexandria, community development, the neighborhood and the Council for that matter. So, the 
question is, Councillor Simmons was that an actual motion? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  71:54 
Yes, I would like to present that as a motion without sending it without a 
recommendation. [sic] 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  72:11 
So, the motion is a by Councillor Simmons is to move this petition forward to the full City 
Council. I will say for the moment without a recommendation since you offered that, it's less of a, 
less of a bar to get over. So, we will do this, individual votes. City Clerk 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  72:49 
On the motion, Mayor McGovern?  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  72:53 
Absent. Vice Mayor Devereux?  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  72:55 
No. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  72:56 
No. Councillor Kelley?  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  72:58 
Absent. Councillor Mallon?  
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  73:00 
No.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  73:01 
No. Councillor Siddiqui? 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  73:02 
 No.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  73:03 
No. Councillor Simmons? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  73:06 
Yes. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  73:07 
Yes. Councillor Toomey?  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  73:08

7.1

 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  73:11 
No.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  73:12 
No. Councillor Carlone?  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  73:14 
No. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  73:15 
No. Motion fails. One in favor, five against and three absent. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  73:25 
So, the next motion I'll make is to leave the subject the petition in committee. I don't need to 
make a motion. Well, in that case, are there any other questions, comments? The petitioner’s 
comments that we need to state? No. So thank you all for coming. Hopefully the next meeting 
will be moving forward. And, and I propose a motion to adjourn. So, we all have to say yes. 
Thank you.

Ordinance Committee 
Cambridge City Council 
City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Ave 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
December 9, 2019 
 
RE:  Alexandria Upzoning Petition (APP 2019 # 82) 
 
Dear Councillors, 
 
We write to ask that you please vote to keep Alexandria’s latest re-filed upzoning petition  
(APP 2019 #82) in committee when it comes up for discussion during tomorrow’s Ordinance 
Committee meeting since there has been no public announcement regarding Eversource. 
 
The Linden Park neighbors' position has not changed: we do not support the petition as filed 
unless and until there is a resolution to move the proposed Eversource substation off of 
Fulkerson Street. While we understand and appreciate that Alexandria has continued to meet 
with the City Manager, Eversource, and other developers in the intervening months since the 
petition was last before the council, the fact remains that there has been no firm resolution 
regarding the Eversource site. 
 
A big tower next to a big electrical substation right next to our 25' high houses and an elementary 
school is too much and threatens the character of our neighborhood.  
 
The re-filed petition does not expire until March of 2020.  There is still time in the new year, 
even with the new council, to move this forward if and when an Eversource solution is 
announced.  We ask that the new council prioritize naming an Ordinance Committee Chair so 
that this matter can be addressed next year when more facts are available regarding the 
likelihood and viability of an Eversource solution. To move this forward before an Eversource 
solution has been publicly announced is premature.   
 
Sincerely, 
 
Pamela Van Dort and Jose Luis Rojas 
Linden Park Residents Association

City Council; Clerk
Ordinance Comm. and Alexandria Petition

To the Members of the Ordinance Committee/City Council: 

I am writing to ask that you keep the Alexandria petition in the Ordinance Committee and refer it for 
continued consideration to the new Ordinance Committee that will start up next year. 

Many neighbors have expressed opposition to the Alexandria petition, including me. The Alexandria 
upzoning does not seem to be offset by all the so-called community sweeteners being proposed. 
Please keep this in committee until the Eversource substation issue is finally resolved away from the 
Fulkerson site.

Ordinance Committee: Grand Junction Pathway Overlay

Dear Mr. Wilson,
I am Lino Becerra from 6 Cornelius Way, Cambridge, MA 02141.

I’m requesting that my following message is made available to the Ordinance Committee as they review the "Grand 
Junction Pathway Overlay” petition.

Dear Ordinance Committee,

I am one of the neighbors that have actively negotiated with the developer, Alexandra Real Estate (ARE), to achieve a 
compromise with respect to the size of the building proposed in this petition.  The neighborhood believes we can live 
with the achieved compromise.

However, the petition cannot be evaluated without considering the fact that Eversource is planning to build a very large 
substation yards away from the proposed building.  Until Eversource substation is re-located it is important that petition 
remains within the Ordinance Committee.

Best regards,

Lino Becerra

Dear Ordinance Committee members:

I am sorry to miss today's meeting on the ARE zoning proposal but I have unavoidable family obligations. 

My understanding is that, for ARE, the third time is either the charm for this proposal or it's not and if it is the latter, there 
will not be a 4th refiling. If this current zoning proposal is not passed, I understand ARE to be planning to simply move 
forward on a project that meets the existing zoning. 

To allow the next Council to more easily vote on this proposal, to include issues around both the Eversource siting and the 
multimodal pathway,I urge the Ordinance Committee to move the proposed zoning change back to the full Council at 
Tuesday's meeting. That way, regardless of how quickly a Mayor is elected and committees appointed, the Council as a 
body will be more easily able to decide how to move forward, or not, before the petition expires in February. 

The new Council may not feel what ARE has proposed is worthy of support, but at least they'd be able to look at it without 
the added complication of a committee-related clock.

Clerk
Upzoning in East Cambridge

Dear Council Members,
I want to register my agreement with the position of the East Cambridge Planning Team, the Linden Park neighborhood, 
and the Cambridge Residents Alliance that the Alexandria upzoning petition should not be voted on until Eversource has 
identified a new location for its proposed Fulkerson substation.
I ask that you postpone the City Council vote until the new council is seated in January by voting to keep the petition in 
committee.
Best regards,
Jeanne Koopman

Councillor Dennis Carlone  07:09 
So, the format of the hearing will be as follows: the petitioner will be heard first, followed by city 
staff, public comment. And then the Ordinance Committee will go into some detail discussing 
the merits of the petition and as to its movement forward or staying in committee. There will be a 
period of time for the council to ask some clarifying questions. But we won't be doing it in the 
order that we've done before. Since I began the introduction, we've also joined by Councillor 
Toomey on my right and we welcome him at the conclusion of the hearing. We will make a 
decision as we vote on it, so whether to refer this to the full Council, or keeping it in committee, 
as I said earlier. So, I want to thank everyone for being here. We're going to begin with the 
petitioner with their update. Please come to the table. Mr. McGuire and please introduce your 
whole team although by now we probably know their middle names, not only their full names. 
Welcome. 
 
Joseph McGuire, Senior Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities  08:45 
Good evening or afternoon Chairman Carlone and Mark McGovern Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and 
fellow councillors. We're here tonight with Michelle Lower, who’s going to do a presentation after 
I give an introduction, Tom Andrews, as well, the regional leader, and Robert Fitzpatrick, our 
attorney. This is the third time that Alexandria has filed this zoning petition. Our first petition for 
325 Binney Street was filed in December of 2018. Since that time, we've had more than 35 
public meetings, we've spent numerous meetings with, with both Linden pack residents and the 
East Cambridge Planning Team to craft a better petition. I would like to thank Pamela Van Dort, 
Jose Luis Rojas and Lena Procera for taking the time and effort to meet with us to forge a better 
project by shaping the proposed architecture. We've also had at least five meetings with the 
Planning Board on this proposed zoning petition. I am pleased to state that on the November 
19th meeting, that the majority of the board members with one abstaining member agreed that 
the proposal at improved from the original iteration due to the reductions in the proposed height 
and scale the development that would be enabled. The board appreciated the petitions 
concerted discuss, discussions with, with a neighboring residents as well as the petition, 
petitioner is ongoing effort to resolve issues related to abutting property. Some of the concerns 
previously expressed by the board members were, were addressed by a detailed commitment 
letter describing community, community benefits and resources but developing the planned to 
Grand Junction pathway. I would like to remind all that that due to the holiday in February and 
the March council schedule, that to enable this zoning petition. We're asking the Ordinance 
committee to forward the petition to its February 10th meeting for a reading. At the council's 
pleasure, the zoning petition, you would need to have a second reading. And that could occur 
either on February 24 or March 2 based on the council's schedule. I thank you and I want to 
now yield to Michelle Lower who will present our proposal for the zoning petition. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  11:22 
Thanks, Joe, and Good evening, everybody. Thank you to all the Councillors, Mayor Siddiqui, 
Co-Chair Carlone. Thank you everybody for having us here again tonight. My name is Michelle 
Lower. I'm a vice president of real estate development and Community Relations at Alexandria. 
Absolutely privileged to be working on this project for 12 to 15 months with the number of, as 
Joe mentioned, a number of the neighbors. A lot of people have put a lot of time into that and 
we really can't thank everyone enough for it. Since we have been here for so long, there are 
very few changes. I will point out the substantive changes in the presentation. There are a few 
changes here. So, I do recognize there are two new councillors, welcome. And so please feel 
free to interject at any time. Otherwise I am going to run through pretty quickly unless there are 
other questions or anything else from any of the councillors, so please feel free. Excuse me.

Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  12:22 
So, how have we gotten to where we are, as Joe mentioned, this is our third refiling here. We 
originally started with two buildings of 120 feet in height. We are now down to 90 feet along the 
Binney Street side and 60 feet along the back. We have also limited our rooftop mechanical 
penthouse to 25 feet in height as well. Commitment letter benefits. This is where we do have a 
new change in here. We discussed it at the December 10 Ordinance Committee meeting. And 
you can see on the third bullet, so not only are we committing for the $12.92 million for that 
purchase of the Eversource site. We are also saying if that does not happen, that money will go 
to the city for funds there for community benefits as well. So that is something that we have 
submitted language for in the, in the commitment letter. So, you can see the other changes. 
Excuse me the other benefits that we have here, we've moved the timing of the conveyance of 
the Grand Junction Grand Junction pathway land to 90 days after a special permit. And we also 
have committed for the One Kendall Square garage site to not exceed any new development 
there, the existing height and massing. Quickly reviewing what, why we call it the Grand 
Junction Greenway multi use path. This is something that the city has been talking about for 
more than 10 years. It's a very exciting opportunity that we have here, as our benefit would be 
1,800 linear feet making a connection of an off street multi use pathway between Binney Street 
and Cambridge street connecting Cambridge Street to Kendall Square off street.  
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  14:05 
You can see this is a view looking southward from Cambridge Street, where the yellow box is 
looking down towards Binney street just showing the actual area where it would be the yellow, 
excuse me, the yellow area is 14 feet wide, and that is the strip that we would be conveying to 
the city. This is a beautiful building that we are the proud owners of and can't wait to give it to 
the City or knock it down and then give it to the city. You can see just for orientation, Loyal Nine, 
the cafe is on the left. This is 686 Cambridge Street, which we can't wait until it looks like this, a 
real pocket Park opportunity here. A gateway into the Grand Junction pathway, think Linear 
Park up in North Cambridge. A nice area really to invite people into, excuse me, the multi-use 
path from Cambridge Street down moving southwards toward Kendall Square. Here you can 
see this is just an overview of what our actual parcel is. Excuse me, there, it is currently zoned 
to the left IA-1, industrial A one, the right is residential C-1. These are the attachments that went 
with our actual zoning petition. The hatched area in brown is, shows the site which it's hard to 
see because you can't really zoom in. But we have both what we like to call the Oklahoma 
shaped piece as well as the strip that goes all the way to, from Binney Street to Cambridge 
Street. I will also note the land area in the along the 1,800 linear feet is not included in our FAR 
calculations. Just a highlight here of the community, community benefits that we are proposing, 
highlighted by the land conveyance of the Grand Junction pathway, the design and construction 
funds of $11.25 million for the pathway. $13 million for a commitment to purchase the 
Eversource land or for funds to go to the city as well as more than 1000 permanent jobs, 
incentive zoning incentive, excuse me, incentive zoning funds, as well as substantial real estate 
taxes. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  16:17 
This we just like to we have updated this one. We have had 35 meetings; we've had two central 
last time we were here. As recently as yesterday morning at the East Cambridge Business 
Association. It has been a wonderfully collaborative process that a lot of people have put a lot of 
time into and we really can't thank people enough for that. This is a real depiction of where we 
started in the pink highlighted area to where we are now which is in the light gray and the darker 
gray. Just also as a note, as a reminder, when we have done all of our studies, whether they be 
view studies or shadow studies, we have always made a point to do it with the mechanical 
penthouse height that we are proposing. So originally, you can see the box on top of the, the

area that was originally at 120 feet. Included, what we assumed back then was a 40-foot 
penthouse. Whereas what we're showing now is a 25-foot penthouse on top of the 95-foot built 
in, excuse me, 90-foot building that we're showing on the southern portion of the site, that on, in 
that 60-foot building on the northern portion of the site. How did we get there? Both through a lot 
of meetings with a lot of community members, a lot of invested parties, but we also really did a 
did a thorough job of looking at the context of the site. Where it is both as well as the top of the 
occupied floor, which is by definition, the height of a building in zoning, as well as the top of all 
the penthouses in the immediate area. And we really feel we've developed a better building over 
these 12 to 15 months, but also a building that fits and really works for the site. You can see 
here the blue line running up and down in the, in the image shows that, denotes on the left-hand 
side is the industrial on A-1 zoned area to the right is the C-1 residential area. As you can see 
there will be no commercial development within the residential district. The entire building is in 
the industrial area. And we got there through zoning language. We have, excuse me, a 
transition zone, we have the Binney street zone, which is the taller area, the 90-foot height, the 
transition zone in the middle and then we've remained, we've kept the base stoning to the right 
in the C-1 district. And we just have these in here as well. These are sun studies. Others call 
them shadow studies of the building that we are proposing. You can see the shadow or shade 
of our building is in blue. It does not cast new shadows on any buildings in, at any time of year, 
this is the winter solstice. So, I don't know if I beat my 14-minute presentation from December 
10. But, um, if there are any questions, that's what we had. Thanks. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  19:16 
Council. Any questions on the presentation? Yes, Councillor Nolan, please. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  19:27 
Thank you. I may ask questions that are, those naive, and I should know the answer to? But  I 
don't. So, I'll ask them. This... I'm really glad to hear about the work with the neighbors. We have 
heard that too. So, I'm thrilled that you worked with them very closely. And we have gotten a 
number of letters of support. So, I want to thank you for that, especially as a new councillor, it's 
really good to be able to step into this feeling that there's been that kind of collaborative work. I 
think my question is, it looks great on the C-1, the current residential portion if after this is done, 
whether it be deed restricted that it will never be anything other than green space, because 
currently even in a C-1, you would be allowed a certain amount of .75 FAR and probably a, you 
know, 35 feet. So, I'm just curious as to how this works in the future, does this whole proposal 
end up meaning that that does not have the potential, if 10 years from now you decide to build it 
out. You will not be able to do that without coming back? If that makes sense. And maybe it's 
not even a question for you. Maybe it's a question for... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  20:31 
Perfectly fine, please respond. 
 
Michelle Lower, Vice President, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.  20:35 
Thank you. And so, it is the way that our current zoning proposal is written is the industrial A-1, 
130,697 square feet will be at a zoning of 2.5 and we will be taking the 60,839 square feet from 
the C-1 district and using that at the 1.25. So, we will be transferring that FAR for a total of just 
over 402,000 square feet. So, there will be no development rights left on the C-1 district. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   21:11 
That... I hope that would be the case. But that means it just because there's, these aren't joint 
parcels that cannot be separated in the future to... there's no development rights left on that, it 
has to be open and green.

Attorney Robert Fitzpatrick  21:26 
That's correct. I was just flipping through the zoning to locate the passage that notes that with 
the transfer of the development rights, the area in the residential zone will be utilized for open 
space. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  21:44 
Right? Because right now, obviously, the C-1 has, you're going up to 90 feet plus the 20. And 
it's currently at what otherwise your usual IA-1 is 45 feet. And this has now been increased 
partly because of the transfer from the residential. 
 
Attorney Robert Fitzpatrick  21:58 
Correct. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   22:01 
I think that was the only question I had for now. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  22:06 
You will have an opportunity to ask during the discussion. Councillor Zondervan let me just see 
if Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler has any questions for... Okay. Thank you, Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  22:20 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And through you, I was very heartened to see the change in the 
commitment letter to guarantee the 13 million if you're unable to purchase the Eversource land. 
So, thank you for that. And following on to Councillor Nolan's question. If you were able to 
purchase that land, then it wouldn't fall under this restriction that you just mentioned, because 
you're not currently... You don't have any development rights on it, obviously. So, are you 
prepared to make any guarantees about that portion if you were able to purchase it? 
 
Attorney Robert Fitzpatrick  23:00 
It's... Councillor. It's our intent that this land be given to the city. After that, once we have 
acquired it, so the city would do with it what it would like. That's, that's our intent. We'd like to 
see it be open space, open space if possible. I know some of the neighbors have talked about 
that being able to have a soccer field. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  23:27 
Thanks. That sounds great. I guess, if you could put that in your commitment letter in whatever 
is the appropriate language so that we know that. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  23:42 
Excuse me. Any other questions from council? No. Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  23:47 
I found my other question. And again, this may have already been gone over and I missed it. In 
the commitment letter. It states that there's a commitment, any new development on One 
Kendall Square garage site shall not exceed that again. Is that written into code? So, there was 
there's no possibility that any, in the future that could ever be changed.

Attorney Robert Fitzpatrick  24:08 
That commitment is not included in the zoning petition. It's contained in the commitment letter 
between Alexandria in the city and as an enforceable committed commitment by Alexandria, the 
petitioner. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  24:22 
Great, thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  24:25 
Vice Mayor, please. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  24:27 
Thank you, Mr. Chair through you. To the team. I just wanted to first of all say thanks for 
including my comment from the last Ordinance committee hearing around what happens to the 
$13 million should Alexander I fail to be able to purchase that piece of property from 
Eversource. I did notice that there is a, will contribute $12.292 million dollars to the city to insert 
purpose slash funding recipient here, will we need to determine what that is prior to us passing 
this finally or... I want to understand how... 
 
Attorney Robert Fitzpatrick  25:08 
Yes. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  25:08 
Okay, yes. So, we need to determine that before we pass this zoning and commitment letter. 
 
Attorney Robert Fitzpatrick  25:13 
That's correct. We left it, left it open, because it was an item that Alexandria had not yet 
discussed with the city, with the intention that the discussions would occur, and we could fill in 
the blank. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  25:26 
Okay. Hopefully we will not have to use this. But we, I guess we'll have discussions about what 
that would be just to be able to finalize this commitment letter and pass this zoning. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  25:38 
Thank you. So, we will move on to city staff’s presentation or comments on the petition. If there 
is anything new, there isn't anything new. I'm seeing, I'm seeing Mr. Robert, stand up. Welcome, 
Jeff. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  25:56 
Thank you all just very quickly, I don't think there's any update from us since the last meeting, 
but just a reminder that the Planning Board heard this and communicated a positive 
recommendation to the council. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  26:08 
Thank you. So, unless there are questions about the Planning Board's comments, I will now 
open up to public. No, we don't have public comment tonight because this is a continuation of a 
previous meeting. So, it's the Ordinance Committee is now opened to discuss the merits. Any 
further questions? Councillor Mallon.

Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  26:39 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think I have some burning questions regarding Eversource and the 
status of a potential move to another site. I understand and can see Mr. Reardon here. We 
received a letter from the city manager today talking about some process stuff and some 
outlines. I'm just curious is this now the part of me We'll talk about that. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  27:01 
Yes. And thank you for bringing that up. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  27:10 
Please continue. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  27:12 
Thank you. Welcome, Mr. Reardon, I would just like to you to briefly run through where we are 
with the Eversource potential move and what the challenges and roadblocks are. I think there 
was some language that I had questions about, which was that this move would happen if 
certain other milestones are met. And I was wondering if you could speak to what those 
milestones might be when they might happen and when will that be required? 
 
Robert Reardon  27:50 
Through you, Mr. Chair. The manager sent out that communication today to say that basically, 
we, there has been a site identified by Eversource. They've done the work preliminarily on the 
site to say that it would be potentially a site they could use for a substation. So, they could move 
it from the Fulkerson Street site to this site. Part of that agreement is between two private 
parties. They're still working out final discussion points on how this would happen, what would 
be necessary to do and we're hoping that within a very relatively short period, hopefully, by the 
end of the month, there'll be a further explanation of what this agreement would require from 
both parties to move forward. This will allow, again, Eversource has been very helpful in doing 
this the community, the business community in East Cambridge, the neighbors in East 
Cambridge have been very helpful. We've gathered a lot of data to try to find a site that we think 
will work for the best interest of the neighborhood, and that the business community again, 
feels, you know, will serve their needs, and they will be contributing to it to get this project done. 
 
Robert Reardon  29:13 
Because it's a degree to improve private parties. It's difficult to say exactly what's going on, 
because it's, again, negotiation. But we feel at this point that enough has been determined that 
this is a very viable process they're going through and it should not take much too much longer 
for them to finalize what they think is acceptable to both parties to move forward. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  29:39 
Thank you for that in Alexandria's original comment, opening comments today, Joe McGuire 
mentioned that he was hoping to have this passed by the Council on the 24th. I might be having 
my dates incorrectly, but you are saying, we may know in a relatively short period of time by the 
end of this month. Are we going to know before we are passing the zoning? I'm assuming that 
somebody isn't just giving us a piece of land or giving Eversource a piece of land. That 
somebody's not magnanimously giving a piece of land, there might be something that we might 
need to do. And so, I feel like we need to have as much information as possible. And I 
understand that this is a deal between two private parties and everything's very tenuous. I just 
want to make sure we were going to have all the information we need to actually make a final 
vote on this.

Robert Reardon  30:33 
The intent is to have outlined a the all the parameters that would be required to move this. So, 
you would have fully understood what would take place. One part is again the Alexandria buying 
the piece from Eversource of that land because again, as a public utility, they can't lose money 
on selling it. So, to make sure that, that would be made whole, that would be done... That 
money that would be contributed to the site, the new site going forward. So, everything that 
would be required as part of this arrangement to move it would be outlined at that point. So, 
you'd have a full understanding of what the benefits are. Now you are correct it, no one could 
afford to give that type of piece of land for nothing. And again, moving this has been very 
difficult. But again, the end of the day, you should have a full understanding of what's being 
passed, what would be required in order for this to move forward. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  31:32 
Just a quick update on that. A second reading would have to be approved by the dates that 
were mentioned. The petition concludes on March 9. Granted, it's only an extra week or two 
beyond the dates who said but there is ample time. There's a little more time to get what Mr. 
Reardon is suggesting we'll have by then. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  32:02 
Okay, thank you. And I just wanted to say the petition expires, on what date  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:09 
March 9th. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  32:09 
March 9th. Okay. Thank you. And thank you for all of your work in pulling together this 
tremendously difficult game of pulling people together and making sure that all the pieces fit 
together. I know, it has not been easy. I just want to express my fears that we won't know all of 
the information that we need to know, to pass this... 
 
Robert Reardon  32:34 
Through you, Mr. Chair. The whole intent of today was to announce that we thought we were 
very close because, again, not to surprise anyone at this point. It is our now intent is to work on 
a statement that would it be agreed on by legal counsel and both parties and so that it's clear 
what this transaction would be requiring to move forward. So again, you know, and they don't 
want to identify the site until they finally do all that. So, but we wouldn't have the city manager 
would not have made that announcement today, if we didn't feel we were very, very close to 
getting something to you in writing that you are going to review and, again, make sure it's in the 
best interest of all concerned that we move forward, if that's the ultimate desire the council. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  33:18 
Okay, thank you. I yield the floor.  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  33:20 
Mr. Chair? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  33:21 
Thank you, Councillor Zondervan.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  33:24 
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and through you. My gratitude as well to Mr. Rearden for all your efforts 
on making this happen. It's very hopeful, and I'm very optimistic that we will find the solution. 
And that being said, I'm also skeptical and concerned because short of having a signed 
purchase and sale agreement between Eversource and Alexandria for that site. We won't have 
a guarantee that this is going to move. And all the parties can be well intentioned and moving 
forward in good faith. Nonetheless, it's possible that we approve this up-zoning and March. And 
then a few months down the road, the deal falls apart for legitimate reasons. And Eversource 
says, Oh, well, we have to build it over there. So, I am concerned about that sequence of 
events. And I know you may not have a lot to say to that tonight, but I just want to make sure 
that, that, that's out there so that people understand that, you know, we do need a pretty high 
level of guarantee to be comfortable, at least I do, to be comfortable moving this petition 
forward. Not tonight but when we are ultimately voting on it. 
 
Robert Reardon  34:59 
To Councillor Zondervan through the Ordinance Chair.  That has been a very big concern of 
ours. We are working very closely to make sure that those questions are answered that 
anything that comes forward, there is as much guarantee as possible in any agreement that we 
could go forward. We were not taking this on. You know, we've asked their attorneys to sit 
down, negotiate and make sure that we've handled all those, and that's been part of the 
process. So fully understand your concern. And those are our concerns also, as we've gone 
through this process. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  35:33 
Great, thanks. I really appreciate that. And I also will add that I still want to see the land 
transferred sooner. And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, there should be some provision in 
the letter of commitment about transferring the Eversource land, if indeed that's the intent, and 
the purchase, succeed to the city. Because, you know, even as it's written now, we could still be 
waiting for several years before we could even begin planning, let alone construction of the 
Grand Junction pathway 
 
Robert Reardon  36:13 
Through the Ordinance chair to Councillor Zondervan. That has also been discussed about 
setting dates and making sure that we're moving as quickly as possible. And so, they're not 
waiting again to the future for some, you know, an occupancy permit or something like that to 
move it as quickly as possible. So, once this clarity in that it's been agreed upon. So those have 
the issues have been discussed, I can assure you and they're trying to work out logistically how 
that would happen and what's the easiest way for it to work. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  36:43 
Great, thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  36:44 
Thank you, Councillor Toomey. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  36:46 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. First, I just want to point of information to remind everyone that Monday 
March 9th meeting has been cancelled, so the councillors can attend the National League of 
Cities convention. So, we should keep that in mind that we're not going to be March 10. We can 
always hold a special meeting the week before. But I just want to remind people of the time 
sensitivity of this issue. But I will say that I do have a very high level of confidence that this

finally seems to be at a point where the city, the neighbors have really worked long and hard on 
this issue, and I do have a high level of confidence in Alexandria development. And, we have 
seen what they have done over the years in terms of the commitment and they're delivering on 
what they said they were going to do. And you know, when the process of seeing that now 
especially with the new park on Binney Street and the Foundry building. And so, I do think that 
they have really been negotiated quite a bit with the neighbors and Wellington harriton. One part 
is East  Cambridge Planning team. And especially I want to mention, you know, both Councillor 
Carlone and Councillor Kelley, former co-chair of the Ordinance, have really been, put a lot of 
time and effort into this process and wait to see what everybody feels. But I do think there's... 
and I think everybody knows that this Eversource has to be signed, sealed and delivered before 
hopefully before the end of the month, as you said even hopefully sooner. So that everyone's 
faces are allayed and that we can move this forward with, especially you know, the big benefit 
that certain [sic] present for many years the completion of Grand Junction multi use pathway 
which is such an environmental benefit in many regards But so, my level is risen, of confidence 
that this Eversource will not be built on Fulkerson Street and that land will be talked about quite 
a bit and what the future use. I know housing and open space is main topics that people have 
been talking about over the years. So. So, I hope we do move this out of committee to keep the 
process moving. I just want to remind people March 9th we're not here. So just we have to keep 
that in mind. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  39:24 
Thank you, Councillor Toomey. Very important subject. Thank you. Any other comments or 
questions? None at all. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  39:40 
Well, as Councillor Toomey said, this process has been very, neighborhood, developer, city 
oriented and discussions and I've been part of much of that and I've been impressed with all the 
sides including Mr. Reardon, who have helped get us to this point. And it's been a very unique 
process, but one, I think at critical sites that can be duplicated in the future. So, if I if there's no 
other discussion, I will move to forward this to the city council with a positive 
recommendation. All those... Any discussion? All those in favor say "aye"? Those 
against? So that is unanimously moved forward. Thank you all at the table and behind the 
table, and the neighbors, very much for your efforts. We realize a lot of work still needs to be 
done. But this has been tremendous progress and patience by all in this room, and so we all 
thank you. The meeting is, yes. Yes, I was going to say let's adjourn, but there is a motion. Is 
there a motion to adjourn? Thank you, Councillors. Thank you, Councillors. All in favor. 
Thank you. We are adjourned.

Ordinance Committee 
Cambridge City Council 
City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Ave 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
February 4, 2020 
 
RE:  Alexandria Upzoning Petition (APP 2019 # 82) 
 
Dear Councillors, 
 
We write to support moving Alexandria’s latest re-filed upzoning petition (APP 2019 #82) out of 
the Ordinance Committee at tomorrow’s meeting.  
 
We still want a public solution to the proposed Eversource substation on Fulkerson Street before 
Alexandria’s petition is passed.  We have heard, and sincerely hope, that such an announcement 
may be forthcoming soon.  In order to have a chance for the Alexandria petition to pass if a 
solution is announced in the next few weeks, we understand that the petition must be moved out 
of committee tomorrow so that there can be adequate time for two readings and a vote before its 
expiration date in early March. 
 
We will be watching this situation very closely in the coming weeks and appreciate your 
continued attention to the Eversource and Alexandria matters as things continue to develop going 
forward. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
Pamela Van Dort and Jose Luis Rojas 
Linden Park Residents Association

t

The Grand Junction Land shall be conveyed to the City per Section 20.1005 of the Grand
Junction Zoning no later than ninety (90) days after the Special Permits and approvals
required under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance are granted allowing Alexandria to
build the Project, and appeal periods for such Special Permits and approvals shall have
expired without any appeal having been made, or in the event that any appeal does occur,
the outcome of said appeal shall not result in a change in the validity, or reduction in the
development rights set forth in the Special Permits and approvals (“Special Permit
Condition”), subject to the City completing its land acceptance process (“City Land
Acceptance Condition”), and Alexandria completing any work required such that the
environmental condition of the Grand Junction Land poses No Significant Risk, as
defined in 310 CMR 40.0006, to future users of the land given its intended use as a
public pathway, per Section 20.1006 of the Grand Junction Zoning (“Cleanup
Condition”).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Special Permit Condition shall not include a
building permit.

Additional Conditions to Alexandria’s Commitments

For purposes of clarification, Alexandria’s commitments set forth above are offered if the
following additional conditions are met:

A
R
E

The amendments to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance set forth in Attachment A are duly
adopted in the form attached hereto as Attachment A, and no challenge to the validity of
the same shall have been made (or in the event of any challenge, such challenge shall
have been finally resolved in favor of such validity.)

 
 
(

 

All time periods specified in this Letter of Commitment shall be tolled during the
resolution of any appeal pertaining to the Grand Junction Zoning or the Project.  The time
period specified in Section A(1) also shall be tolled during the satisfaction of the City
Land Acceptance Condition and/or the Cleanup Condition.

 
:
 

 

So long as Alexandria, its successors and assigns, is proceeding with development and
until the Project is completed, the City shall not have initiated or supported any rezoning
or other ordinance changes that would have the effect of adversely affecting any of the
uses or development authorized by the Grand Junction Zoning.

C.

Conclusion

Alexandria is making these payments and providing the other mitigation referenced above in
order to provide resources to mitigate any impacts which might result from the Project as a result
of the rezoning and any Special Permits granted therefore.

As Alexandria’s duly authorized representative, I am pleased to commit to this significant
mitigation on Alexandria’s behalf.

FIRST PUBLICATION NO. 3531 
 
CITY OF CAMBRIDGE 
 
In the Year Two Thousand and Twenty 

 
 
That the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge be amended on a petition by Joseph T. Maguire on 
behalf of the Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc., to amend the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge as 
follows: 
 
By creating a new overlay zoning district entitled Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District in the area of 
the existing Grand Junction Railroad Right of Way between Cambridge Street and Binney Street, and to 
amend Article 20.000 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge by creating a Section 20.1000 
Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District. 
 
The stated purpose of the Grand Junction Pathway Overlay District would be to promote the 
development of a public pathway along the Grand Junction railroad right-of-way in connection with high 
quality development consistent with development along the Binney Street corridor. 
 
The provisions of Section 20.1000, which would be subject to special permit approval by the Planning 
Board, would require the conveyance to the City by fee or easement of a strip of land along the Grand 
Junction rail corridor to be used for a public pathway, and would allow development on other identified 
parcels of land referred to as 303 and 345 Binney Street for uses otherwise allowed in the base Industry 
A-1 district, with a maximum building height of 105 feet along Binney Street and 60 feet in the 
Transition Zone, a maximum floor area ratio of 2.5 multiplied by the area of the industrially zoned 
portion of the development parcel and 1.25 multiplied by the area of the balance of the development 
parcel, and provisions related to gross floor area exemptions, setbacks, parking, and other matters. 
 
 
 

                                         meeting held on February 10, 2020 and on or after 

Passed to a second reading at the City Council 

February 24, 2020 the question comes on passage to be 
ordained. 
 
Attest:- Anthony I. Wilson 
 
 
 
 

     City Clerk 

 
 
NOTE:  Pursuant to the provisions of General Laws, Chapter 40, Section 32A, Tercentenary Edition, the 
ordinance as aforesaid which exceeds in length eight octavo pages of ordinary book print may be 
summarized for publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city with the further provision 
that said Ordinance may be examined and obtained at the City Clerk’s Office during office hours and 
that any objection to its invalidity by reason of any defect in the procedure of adoption may only be 
made within ninety days after the posting or the second publication.
