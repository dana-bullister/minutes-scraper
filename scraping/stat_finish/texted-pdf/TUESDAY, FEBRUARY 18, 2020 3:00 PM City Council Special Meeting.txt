The Ordinance Committee will conduct a public hearing on the Harvard Square Zoning Petition. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  5:55   
Welcome everyone. Thank you, John, the meeting is adjourned. The call of the hearing is as follows. The 
Ordinance Committee will conduct a public hearing on the Harvard Square zoning petition, which 
consists of wording that was received from Suzanne Blier regarding the Harvard Square zoning. We also 
have a communication from the Community Development Department, which reviews the proposed 
petition and comments on that. Both documents are very well prepared. We will, we do have a sign-up 
sheet right by where, it looks like, Fritz is signing up now. If you're interested in speaking, please do sign 
up and notify us that indeed you do want to speak. If not please, write "No". This hearing, as you know, is 
being audio and video recorded. And if you have written comments, we welcome them. When you go to 
the podium, there's a basket right behind the petitioner, Patrick, or you can leave them. Now, Councillor 
Simmons is away, recovering from a recent operation. So, as you know, we've been doing this for a few 
weeks now. We have a process excuse me that we go through so please bear with me. It'll take a couple of 
minutes. The city manager has authorized the use of remote participation at meetings of the city's public 
bodies and transmitted to the city council on May 13, 2012. The Open Meeting Law regulate, regulations 
revised by the Attorney General on October 6, 2017, 940 CMR 29.10 to be used as guidelines for the 
city's use of remote participation. The chair, I'm the chair Dennis Carlone announces that Councillor 
Simmons will not be attending the meeting and we'll be participating remotely in the meeting. I request 
the absent Councillor Simmons to state for the record that the proceedings are clearly audible to her. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  8:32   
The proceedings are audible not so clearly but audible. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  8:36   
Okay, we will keep that in mind and get a little closer to the microphone. Councillor Simmons confirms 
they are audible, but not clear.  I announced that Councillor Simmons is clearly audible to us, to both the 
City Council and the public and the chair, that is me announces that all votes taken shall be by roll call 
voting. The format of the meeting will be as such as it is with every Ordinance meeting. We will hear

from the petitioner at the main desk who has a presentation tonight. We will have clarify, a session of 
clarifying questions by the Councillors who I will introduce in a moment and that is to just fully 
understand the petition intent. We will then have city staff come forward who are relevant to this process, 
specifically Harvard Square and hear their presentation and thoughts, again, have a clarifying question 
period which will then be followed by public comments. So, if you are interested either now or after the 
presentations, you can certainly sign up. So, I'm joined today by Councillor, I almost said Carlone, I'm 
reading the sign. Mayor McGovern, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Mallon, Vice Mayor Devereux, 
Councillor Zondervan. And in the audience, we are joined by soon to be Councillor, Sobrinho-Wheeler, 
and we welcome you. So, the floor is yours. Patrick, we welcome you and we look forward to your 
presentation. 
 
Patrick Barrett  10:35   
Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. My name is Patrick Barrett. I would like to begin by describing the 
process of this petition. Several, actually in 2017, I was approached by several groups in Harvard Square 
to begin work on what eventually would sort of transform into the Crohn petition. I did not have anything 
really to do with that, but it is the basis of that work on which this petition has been founded. The heads 
of the Harvard Square Business Association, John DiGiovanni, Denise Jillson, along with Suzanne Blier 
had approached me individually, to help bridge what I think were personal issues between the groups in 
terms of vision for set for Harvard Square. They had seen the work that was done by myself, George 
Metzger and the central square Business Association in Central Square and I think in some way were 
envious of the process that we had. Where we had brought groups together by doing a very [sic] 
something very similar that I did with Harvard Square. And bringing these groups together, finding out 
where there's commonality finding out where there's disagreement and trying to create a better 
foundational platform for Harvard Square. There's an invitation as before you, much like central square is 
a beginning step to correct a few things that we feel as though our incongruous with the current city 
guidelines and goals, especially as they comport to the Envision process. 
 
Patrick Barrett  12:28   
And to give Harvard Square much like central square received a morale boost. A point where you have, I 
think, as they've been referred to by Charlie Sullivan as the Hatfields and McCoys, the ability to come 
together agree on something that while may not be earth shattering in the sense of zoning. Is earth 
shattering in the sense that we have a commonality agreement and we have forward momentum for an 
area that I think we all can agree needs help. This was recognized at the Planning Board by several 
members in terms of the numerous vacancies, many closings. And while development is always a messy 
process, its effect in Harvard Square has been palpable. And it really, I think is more exemplified in the 
fact they have a slightly higher than 10% retail vacancy, which far exceeds any other place in the city. 
The, you know, in central square, we had vacancies and they were prominent ones, but we didn't have a 
vacancy rate above 5%. And just gave the appearance of it because we had some key vacancies. Harvard 
Square, on the other hand, has pockets of just dead spaces right now. The Harvard Square Neighborhood 
Association over last summer commissioned a study, you know, being part of a slide presentation to the 
zoning, that determined that the total facade coverage of financial institutions in Harvard Square was 
something like 44%. Yet the use itself was 6%, that vacancies were at 10.6%, at that time in the summer. 
Useful information for us, but I think much more useful for this for this body to understand why we're 
doing this. And the stated purpose of the petition itself is to help look at that ground floor retail, much like 
we did in Harvard Square. And to give it the tools that are required to give developers and property 
owners the opportunity to think outside normal parameters for buildings. Harvard Square suffers from 
something that is sort of systemic in the zoning.  
 
Patrick Barrett  14:44   
That it was the one area of the city really, that had a higher commercial FAR than any other place versus 
its residential FAR. FAR for commercial is a four, residential is a three. We address that, but that's been

in place for a long time it has really been the driving force of the growth in Harvard Square, which is why 
you haven't seen any residential development at all. But we can't go back and change all that, you have 
existing buildings. So how do you put together a zoning petition or zoning language that that respects the 
form of Harvard Square, but that also tries to prepare it for a future that's beyond a walking mall, which I 
think has was has been the current aspiration. It was only good fortune, that and great timing that Charlie 
Sullivan had been working with the Hatfields and McCoys for seven several years and revising the 
Conservation District guidelines. It seemed during this process, which really has come about because 
Charlie had been able to get all these groups to work together, that it made sense to take a look at some 
common sense zoning changes that would help alleviate some of the problems that people are having with 
retail spaces being vacant and being able to repurpose reutilize, adding some density that made sense for 
existing buildings. Much like central square, a lot of what's in here doesn't really do much for... to spur 
new construction. And if you really want to get new construction, we can talk about that in a second, but I 
will address that issue later on. But this was more about how do we take what we currently have and 
make the best use of it. In central square, we did a lot of the things that we were actually recommending 
here, and we've actually seen in two years some very positive results from it. And with that, I'm going to 
begin walking you through the presentation itself. In the zoning packet that I presented and filed 
originally there is a zoning key. It shows you the language that we've changed. It shows you what we've 
changed the language to, and it shows you why. 
 
Patrick Barrett  16:57   
It’s sort of becoming my zoning petition signature move. But I think it will help at least clarify, in the 
larger packet language, the first page of it looks like this, in case you're wondering. It's just a simple 
guide, because I've also presented language and its full form, which can be somewhat confusing to walk 
through. So, with that, I'm going to take you to the first slide. This describes the process that we went 
through the groups that we that we engaged and sort of what I had just given you in terms of the timeline 
of the events that we began in 2017. And that this process has been sort of ongoing through August of 
2019. And that the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, Harvard Square Business Association, 
Harvard University, and Harvard Square Conservation District Working Group have all been a part of this 
process. The first section that we take a look at is a very simple change when the conservation district was 
established, it wasn't clearly implemented in the actual zoning language. So that it was more of an 
unspoken but understood that the Conservation District language applied but was never explicitly stated 
in the guidelines in the overlay. This change simply corrects that omission. We add that there is a 
requirement to consider the Harvard Square Conservation guidelines when looking at zoning in the 
Harvard Square overlay. Much like in central square where the Central Square design guidelines are 
directly referenced. One thing I will point out in these slides at the very bottom I have a marker for 
stakeholders and objections. The reason why this has been put there is that I want the board to understand, 
the commission to understand that this whole entire process was a negotiation. Each individual part of this 
petition represents a give and take from either these groups and that no one piece on its own stands 
because much like with Central Square, this was a much, much thought through and bargained for 
agreement. But each group came at it with their own perspectives, their own desires. And that this is this 
represents the middle path between the two. So, in this particular instance, the stakeholders with the 
Harvard... Historical Commission, the conservation district, and so all groups really were on board with 
this when there were no objections. 
 
Patrick Barrett  19:24   
The second piece, which for some reason, has tiny language, deals with the Advisory Committee. This 
was a big point for the Harvard Square neighborhood group, much like the Crohn petition. This petition 
changes some of the dynamics of what comprises the advisory group. It requires that monthly meeting 
takes, monthly meetings take place, however, the board itself is able to, to waive such meetings should 
there not be something to discuss and the reason for that, primarily, is much like in central square, where 
we have a similar advisory group, these boards become stagnant for lack of use. And what tends to

happen, and I've had this experience myself as an attorney in Central Square, where it's very difficult to 
convene these boards because they're so often not meeting that they tend to stray away. And that even 
when you have a simple thing as a variance, that you would have to go through for the advisory board 
because it's 20,00 square feet or greater. I had two meetings, both of which were not attended. So, the 
both meetings were cancelled, and we moved on. The pushback on this provision has been that the 
requirement for monthly meetings may become arduous for members, but I think it's actually quite the 
opposite. That these areas Central Square and Harvard Square, especially, are hotbeds for activity. There's 
always something happening. There's always something to talk about. And there's no reason why these 
groups shouldn't have the ability to convene more regularly. I think through that regular use, these boards 
become more active, more engaged, and more Importantly, more knowledge about what's happening in 
Harvard Square. So that when a proposal comes before them, they're able to, they have the mental agility 
to actually adjudicate it on its merits as opposed to being a tabula rasa with someone showing off the 
project but they've got no real concept of what's been going on in the square. There were... This is really a 
sticking point for the Harvard Square neighborhood group. The last point of it, which is the necessity of a 
rotating chair, the board felt, feels that an Advisory Commission that, where the President sits on the 
board indefinitely, creates the appearance of a lack of equity amongst the group and that by putting 
provision requiring a rotation of that position, it gives the board, I think, a sense of more legitimacy. 
 
Patrick Barrett  21:47   
So, in the Harvard Square overlay, there's interesting language that's existing, dealing with retail and 
existing residential and office districts. As you may or may not know, in an office district ground floor 
retail is not allowed. It's an interesting aberration, I believe an antiquated in our zoning code. I have 
enumerated specific streets and the planning board had pointed out that Harvard Street was not a street 
they were interested in expanding this used to, and I embarrassingly had to admit that I forgot to put 
arrow straight. Arrow straight and Plimpton the street to a smaller degree need to be included into this 
petition. But the purpose of it I think, is quite clear. Already, just so the audience knows and that the 
board knows there is a special permit vehicle for some uses, very limited uses. What this is trying to do is 
trying to mitigate some of the restrictions we're placing on the BB district and allow for an expansion of 
retail uses where these retail uses already exist. So that these retailers which really only applied to non-
formula retailers are able to go into these spaces without the need for a variance for the use itself, or, as 
you'll see later in the, in the presentation, a special permit for a fast food order use. Given the vacancy rate 
in the Harvard Square, and the desire right now to achieve rents that are not necessarily achievable, but 
that's a more of a learning curve process I believe for landlords. That we want to be able to offer tenants, 
an expansion of the retail quarter. This is absolutely what any urbanist guy would tell you that it is 
absolutely a necessity to maintain retail and have it be, have it still exist in the form that we understand it. 
Retail is going through many, many changes but to prohibit the use somewhat arbitrarily on a 
thoroughfare where it already exists, does not seem like a very good, does not seem like it's achieving any 
goal that we set out to achieve. And this gives these smaller retailers who can't afford to pay $75 triple net 
or 150 triple net, as some retailers are getting into Harvard Square. These will naturally be lower rent 
areas, they already are. Just like in central square, we expanded on the side streets. Those are all lower 
rent areas. And some of those landlords are learning that lesson pretty quickly or slowly but they're 
learning it because that's what it is.  
 
Patrick Barrett  24:25   
This came from Harvard University initially in my discussions with them, there was no objections from 
anyone in the group. I think the blue bottle coffee shop was referenced as sort of example of both a fast 
food special permit and a variance for the use itself, where it seems unnecessary given that the space itself 
was commercial already. This was also something that we pointed out to the planning, to the Planning 
Board in terms of the incongruity or the seeming incongruity between commercial uses on the ground 
floor in an office district. That that somehow is prohibited. And we're just sort of cleaning that up a bit. 
As it pertains to the overlay only. The next provision is dealing primarily with parking. In Harvard Square

and in Central Square, largely thanks to the efforts of a couple years ago. The only two places in the city 
where there is a buyout option for parking, we are proposing to do away with this buyout option. This is 
part of what we discussed earlier in terms of a negotiated point between the groups. This has not been a 
wellspring of revenue for the for Harvard Square, although most recently Regency has had to pay in. This 
to us is, doesn't comport with any of the city go goals or guidelines. It is a duplicative tax on top of 
development, where there ought not to be one and that cost doesn't go necessarily to the developer, it 
always gets spread across the board to tenants, and whoever is buying the property. We look at this in 
terms of why are we tethering parking to a reduced FAR, we want density to a certain degree, we're not 
changing the height. We're not changing dimensional form whatsoever. But every other place in the city, 
we are being encouraged to get rid of parking. No other place in the city do we require a payment to do 
so. We already have linkage; we already have inclusionary. We have other things that we could be asking 
developers to do. That I would think would be money much well better spent for the special permitting 
process, then going through an arbitrary, arbitrary ritual where we require them to buy out of a parking 
space that they were never going to build in the first place. If we know Harvard Square, Harvard Square is 
100% built. If you're building in Harvard Square, you're looking at an existing structure. We do not want 
developers going down. We never intended them to do that. 
 
Patrick Barrett  26:55   
This according to the members of the group, who wanted this is a bargained for agreement between the 
groups. That they're willing, that the property owners are willing to give up something and the 
neighborhood group was too. And there were no objections to this piece, which I personally found to be 
surprising. But I think given the greater goal of what these groups are trying to achieve, it doesn't make 
sense to continue this practice further. As the person who introduced it into Central Square, to date, it has 
generated no funds. It doesn't, I have no anticipation of doing so. And ultimately, I believe it was a 
mistake that I made in introducing it. I had worked with the neighborhood groups and trying to rationalize 
the reduction of parking. But I think we could have been more creative. Okeydokey. I put a big warning 
up here. So, people understood there's always been a sort of a confusion between groups from what FAR 
means and what height means. I will just reiterate for the folks at home, we aren't changing the height, the 
height stays the same in Harvard Square. I have something to say about height in other squares and in 
Harvard, then if you truly want to boost housing construction, that height is something that you're going 
to have to think about. But Harvard Square may not be the best place for it. As I stated earlier, it is 99% 
built out, and that it does have a historical component that very few other places in Cambridge have. This 
provision mirrors in some way, the mechanism by which density was added to the affordable housing 
overlay. It allows for the ability to add density into spaces that are pre-existing. And it's almost 
indeterminant with how much you can almost sense you could add, but we're looking in terms of form 
and not function. So, it's more of a hybrid than it is really form zoning or Euclidean zoning. It's taking the 
existing footprint and saying that we have a building that is a 2.7 or 4.0 for commercial use, we have, but 
it's four stories, we added another story to it.  
 
Patrick Barrett  29:15   
The way that ISD calculates FAR it's becomes problematic if you're maxed out to one use, you're maxed 
out to the other. This allows for groups to present their case as to why density might be added. And unlike 
any other square in the city, Harvard Square has sort of three flaming hoops that one must jump through 
that no one other square has, in order to get approval. You have Conservation District guidelines, you 
have historical districts, you also have the zoning itself and you also have the advisory board. All working 
in tandem, you do not get passed go unless you get a certificate of appropriateness and it was mentioned 
at the planning board level that that ought to be included in the language in terms of approval. My zoning 
does not include this provision but that a certificate of appropriateness by Historical Commission might 
be something we look at in terms of determining whether something is appropriate or not given the 
density. Again, the stakeholders in this all agree this is not a significant change. I would add that we're 
different from the AHO, is that this is all special permit. It's based on 10.43. There is a review process for

it. There's designed for it. Which is where a lot of the confidence that I have in this petition comes from. 
We spent two years redoing the Conservation District guidelines. And we have design guidelines for the 
square unlike any other square in the city, but this will be managed very well. This is something that we 
did in central square and so far, it's been working like gangbusters. Some landlords have cried a little bit, 
but I don't care about that.  
 
Patrick Barrett  30:55   
A provision that exempts the ground floor retail at 1,500 square feet. This was done in central Square it 
was done from the Mass and Main overlay district. To date, I've seen three developers use it, four if you 
include myself in central square, and it does exactly what I intended to do. The Chevron group has 
presented a project for the gas and light building which is where Bank of America is, to get the build that 
they need their exempting ground floor retail, they're making three 1500 square foot spaces. And the 
reason why I chose 1500 square feet is that oftentimes when you look for a national tenant, especially 
when they come from a corporation, or a larger group or a franchisee, they have guidelines for how 
they're supposed to be built. Those guidelines typically request across the board that 2000 square feet or 
the greater be used for the construction of their spaces. There is no waiver you can get, there's no 
committee. You can't go to Dunkin Donuts... Dunkin Donuts does not have that. You can't go to Wendy's 
and say no please give me relief. It will automatically exclude a good portion of retail tenants which the 
market central district people are, are facing that right now. They've come to CDD. They've cried to us at 
the BID. Oh, we can't populate our spaces with our triple net tenants that we want. And we say yeah, 
that's the point. You made a commitment to putting in local retailers or small retailers. By local I don't 
necessarily mean they live in Cambridge. I mean, you know, they're just mom and pops, and that's the 
tradeoff. You take the GFA which had a dollar, per square foot cost, 400 to build 800 value, and put it 
somewhere else in your building. On the ground floor you make the commitment to having smaller 
footprint, smaller footprint retail, which will undoubtedly lead to taking on smaller tenants. 
 
Patrick Barrett  32:46   
Slowly market central is getting the idea but other people have adopted this very easily. At my location on 
Main Street in central square. I found a tenant right away that was ready to take over 10... 1,050 square 
feet that I exempted to build a fifth story on my building, or a portion of that at least. And the rent is 
lower than market at $40 a square foot. Gross, it's a very different animal than the 65-triple net plus CAM 
fees, if you know what CAM fees are those are common area maintenance fees that are tacked on to rent. 
So that when you say it's $65 a foot, what I'm really saying it's actually closer to 100 bucks a foot when 
you tack on taxes, insurance, the maintenance piece, and then the common area maintenance. So, this 
provision in my opinion has been successful in Central Square. I don't think it will be as successful in 
Harvard Square only because there's a historical component to that, not all buildings can be sliced up this 
way. But it will make a difference it will be used, there will be developers who are building their spaces 
out that will specifically looked at this provision to find more of what I call paint in the bucket in terms of 
how they design their buildings. This whole entire petition is premised on the idea that by cramping down 
FAR, by putting obtuse regulations into place and sort of letting them idle. We turn architects into 
contortionists. We turn developers into people who are looking to maximize GFA. Height is what will 
stop that, height is what your bottleneck is. And if your bottlenecked for height, you know what form 
you're going to get, if you give them a 10 million FAR and a height of 20 feet, that building will never be 
more than 20 feet. That's the point. 
 
Patrick Barrett  34:35   
Okay, this is the only provision so far from which we've received some negative feedback from the 
community. This is very similar to what was introduced into Central Square, however, it's a bit more 
stringent. We are taking the footprint of banks, financial institutions and cannabis retail, a use which 
didn't exist at the time of the central square petition and reducing it to a 20-foot maximum. And can you 
take over no more than 30% of the facade of a building. In Central Square, we made it 25 feet. But we

also made it a special permit to, to get around in. The reason for that was in Central Square, we did not 
have the market penetration that banks have in Harvard Square. As I mentioned earlier, the Harvard 
Square neighborhood group had conducted a study where in it was discovered that 44% of the entire 
facade space of Harvard Square was all financial institutions, yet financial institutions were 6% of the 
uses. So, if Harvard Square seems boring and dull, yes, it is. And this is largely why. I don't think banks 
are a bad use. I think banks are important to some degree. I think the point of sale bank becomes less 
useful in this more modern age of digital, but I don't believe they should be taking over almost half of the 
entire facade space of Harvard Square. And a more restrictive measure is what was looked at in terms of 
how do we curb this use. I will point out that we've had two property owners come and present counter 
arguments to this at the Planning Board as well. And I have left it to the neighborhood group and the 
business association. The two real petitioners before you're not, I am the vessel, so to speak, to determine 
for themselves what they're willing to give up or willing to negotiate on. I had recommended that they not 
negotiate at all, and that we leave it to the board we leave it to the Planning Board to determine what's the 
best course of action. The Planning Board had made the recommendation that had been expanded to 25 
feet and a special permit likewise in Central Square. I, from my personal and professional opinion, I 
believe that we, we did the right thing initially.  
 
Patrick Barrett  37:04   
The other piece of this is the cannabis retail use. The Planning Board did have an issue, several members 
brought up an equity issue in terms of, of reducing the footprint to the point where they felt as though that 
the ability to open up a cannabis shop in Harvard Square may be impossible. And while I am, I respect 
their opinion, and while I am eternally an optimist and believe nothing is impossible. I don't believe that 
this actually is as restrictive as they, as they took it to be in Central Square we have, we will have four 
cannabis, three cannabis retail stores, opening up over the course of the next year. We have one medical 
that's trying to figure it out. Of those two, of those three retail spaces, two of them would comply with this 
ordinance, if was passed tomorrow in Central Square. So again, they do have the ability to open up. It's 
just they don't have the ability to command the amount of frontage that other users do. And the reason for 
that is not because we don't like cannabis, it's not because we don't like the use. It's just as I think, as you 
all well know, the state regulations require that these buildings be completely fogged up in their facades, 
in our opinion, they provide nothing more of interest than a bank would. Granted there may be slightly 
more usage out of the space though most of these retailers are looking at an appointment model where 
you get a fob and you, you're to walk around the city until your buzzer goes off and you can go to the 
store. But I think in general, it doesn't really add to the streetscape, and when you consider that 44% of 
the bank facade space is already, facade space is already taken up by banks, and that this use, cannabis 
retail, commands almost the same amount of rent per square foot that a bank would, that the logical shift 
will be towards the cannabis retail uses. Which again, I have nothing... I'm a, I'm an evil capitalist as well 
like, please landlords should go make money but if the whole purpose of this petition is to help revitalize 
Harvard Square and to bring back that streetscape, the cannabis retail spaces we felt did not fit the bill. 
And that there's probably other things we can look at, the Planning Board had mentioned that they found 
the buffer, the lack of a buffer between stories to be particularly problematic, in terms of being able to 
regulate how that forms out. So maybe through a different process. You can look at that buffer or how 
you really want this used to lay out.  
 
Patrick Barrett  39:36   
As I said before, we had almost, we had unanimous approval amongst the groups, but two property 
owners, I believe Regency and Mr. Donda who's with us tonight, were in opposition. This is my favorite 
one. So fast food special permit if you don't know it, now, you know.  This is been somewhat of a thorn in 
the side small businesses for quite some time. In Central Square, we remove the fast food provision cap, 
but we didn't remove the requirement for a special permit across the city. If you are familiar with the 
licensing process for this, I highlighted the most egregious point of the provision of 75% of the seating in 
the premises be at freestanding tables, blah, blah, blah. There's also a sort of an unspoken of the non-

disposable plates, cups and utensils, which all sounds good, but this was done primarily to limit 
McDonald's from opening up in spaces and in neighborhoods. This was, is, is having an unintended 
consequence of being prohibited for small businesses. Now CDD had reported that 18 special permits 
were granted last year, nine for formula business, nine for non, what they cannot tell us how many people 
have not even bothered to apply because of these regulations. Now, we had some testimony at the 
Planning Board from the woman who owns Black Sheep Bagels, who did come to testify that she was 
looking for spaces in Harvard Square. She only, she could not find one that comported with this 
ordinance. And she almost didn't open up her shop, but for the fact that she found a below grade space 
that gave her enough seating, so she fit the requirement. Now, the reason for the autograph and I have an 
image of Thomas Bow getting their special permit for usage. There's no real way to audit this. You can 
ask a business owner at the beginning of their, of their licensing commission hearing, you know what is 
the seating, what is the, what utensils you be using? It's almost arbitrary and how it's being adjudicated. 
And I think it's having a disproportionate, negative effect on smaller businesses, who are the exact people 
we're all trying to help out right now, not to mention the amount of legwork that ISD and the BZA have to 
go through to adjudicate these. Now we've lifted it for non-formula so that at least you have some sense 
of what use, what you can expect to happen. But ultimately, we feel as though that this provision ought to 
be applied elsewhere in the city. And the planning board spoke very favorably of this. Understanding that 
this is more of a bureaucratic hoop and that fast food itself has changed dramatically, from what we 
understand it to be. So, in my opinion, I didn't know what the best course of action was. Do we rewrite the 
definition of fast food order use? Or do we simply remove the special permit, deal with it as it is? We feel 
as though for Harvard Square and given the limited scope of this petition that was better to alleviate that, 
that restriction for some kinds of businesses and leave it intact for others? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  42:43   
Patrick, let me just ask how much longer is the presentation? Normally we have half hour presentations. 
 
Patrick Barrett  42:51   
How am I doing? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  42:53   
You're an hour. 
 
Patrick Barrett  42:54   
Holy crap.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  42:55   
And we never go past 45 but because I'm interested in this... 
 
Patrick Barrett  43:00   
40 minutes? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  43:04   
Well, that's true. You started at 5:30 you're approaching 45 minutes. 
 
Patrick Barrett  43:09   
I'm going to finish with one slide. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  43:10   
No, you can finish. I'm just asking.

Patrick Barrett  43:13   
Oh, yeah, you got about five minutes left me talking. So, this last slide was added after my Planning 
Board hearing. The one question that I was asked by two Planning Board members, that I didn't have a 
response to at the time, was how does this affect the affordable overlay. I was a little bit confused by that 
because the overlay itself is not before the council, but I dug through CDDs own work and I have an 
answer. You know, the AR 11 tax district, which, if you can see it good for you it's a little bit blurry even 
from my, my distance, but it's the one area of the city that comprises the majority of the Harvard Square 
Overlay and there is an NA where it says potentially competitive sales under the AHO. And, then 
percentage of potentially competitive properties is zero. The Harvard Square, you know, right or wrong 
has had a higher commercial FAR of it over the past few decades. And it is built out in that in that way, 
the AHO doesn't really do much, do anything in Harvard Square, unless you change the height. That's a 
different story, a different topic for a different day. That if you were looking for any kind of conflicts in 
passing the zoning with any future zoning that before this passes, it didn't work, the overlay did not apply, 
after this passes overlay still will not apply. Only through a different kind of change in whatever the 
overlay form it takes will it actually be applicable to any of these districts. I think if you look at the 
financial piece of that Harvard Square was never the intended location for this. In fact, the purpose of the 
overlay was to put it in neighborhoods that didn't currently have affordable housing components. That's 
all I got. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  44:58   
So, what you're telling me is, I should of bit my tongue and just waited an extra two minutes. So, this is 
clarifying question time. The mayor has a clarifying question and then we'll go around the room. 
Councillor Zondervan after. Mayor please. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  45:18   
A couple questions through you, Mr. Chair. First of all, thank you for the presentation. Thank you also, 
the Sullivan and for everyone, for the groups coming together to find some common ground. I don't know 
if I'm more impressed with that or the fact they got you in a suit Mr. Barrett, but couple questions. First, 
I'm going to start with the explanation around banks and cannabis. I totally get it on banks and your 
statistics.... You know, I was amazed when you told me that, that they're only 6% of, you know, of the 
occupancy but 40, over 40% fan of the frontage. Shouldn't have been surprised by that but it, but it 
seemed I was.  And I understand the explanation that there's some concern and I have the same concern 
that the, around the state regulations in terms of window, windows and the cannabis recreational 
businesses have to be frosted or what have you. I think that's a little overkill, but I understand that's the, 
the regulation but if I'm reading the section correctly 20.54.9, it basically says that there is no, there is no 
provision for a variance or a special permit or whatever mechanism is to, to ask for relief on this. It would 
just be as it just would be a ban and... 
 
Patrick Barrett  46:48   
So, when it’s a ban the default mechanism is a variance. So, you would have to seek a variance. Very 
difficult threshold, a use of especially. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  47:00   
So, I would just like, some maybe to think about either separating... I get it for banks. I, you know, I, 
when we did the cannabis zoning, I'm not talking about all the municipal stuff around EE applicants, but 
the actual zoning, we made a decision to expand the zoning and expand zones where cannabis shops 
could open to allow them to open in more areas of the city. And I think, I think Harvard Square should be, 
shouldn't be exempt from that responsibility. And I think if this is potentially going to make it more 
challenging than I don't think it belongs there or I think there should be some other mechanism to separate 
banks from cannabis. I think I do see this as a way of trying to not have cannabis shops open or at least

make it more difficult for them to do so. And I don't think that's... I don't agree with that. So, I have one... 
is there a way to do that like ... 
 
Patrick Barrett  47:58   
So, certainly. The recommendation, this was concerned the Planning Board as well. And the 
recommendation the Planning Board, while comprehensive for banks was to expand it to 25 feet and to 
allow it to be a special permit. You said you could simply make it; we can really make it whatever you 
want it to or have it be not even be a part of this provision. And, you can solve it that way. I think the 
more elegant solution may be to remove that provision in its entirety and leave banks and just leave 
banks. The issue that you're always going to face, If I told you it's going to be 25 feet, you're going to 
want 27, if I tell you it's 27, you're going to want something else. It never works out quite right especially 
with existing buildings. Banks is more of a hammer. It really is. But because it is response to the existing 
condition, cannabis is unknown. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  49:01   
Through you, Mr. Chair. You mentioned a couple times about, that this petition doesn't change the height 
and also, you'd mentioned that, you know, if we wanted to encourage more residential that height could 
help with that. So how was that discussed? Why was it decided? I mean, I, you know, I'll say this about, 
you know, you know, I think the one of the ways to help the businesses of Harvard Square, particularly 
the small businesses of Harvard Square, or any square is to have more people living there, who are, you 
know, going to need, who are going to buy a pizza once a week, they're going to need to go to the you 
know, go to the market or what have you. So, I think having more residents helps businesses. So why 
was, was increasing the height, and I'm not talking 20 stories, but was increasing the height even 
discussed and why was it decided not... 
 
Patrick Barrett  49:53   
So, when we talked about the form and what the goals this petition were. Height was mentioned by me 
and I was talking twenty stories because I believe that's where you'd have to probably go to make it viable 
in a district like this. Harvard Square, unlike any other square in the city, is a very deeply Historic 
District. I don't think it's wise to go into a district like this, with massive height increases, only because 
what, you know, as I always say, there's lots of land in Cambridge, there just happens to be things on it. 
Harvard Square, there's lots of things on it. And there's lots of things that are, you really do want to 
preserve. That's the whole reason why this group got together for two years to revise the Conservation 
District guidelines. There are plenty of other places in the city, Central Square, where you could add 
height and build a ton of housing. I just, with this group in particular, the goal was to find common 
ground. When it came to height that was a nonstarter for both groups.  
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  50:54   
Okay. Maybe not 20 stories, but we probably could have gone a little higher, but I accept that they agreed 
on this. And then, you know, many of the vacancies that are in the square now, you know, a lot of the 
property is owned by a small handful, if not one individual. And, a lot of the vacancies, a lot of, I think 
everyone knows it's been vacant for God knows how long. And you know, the theater, but that's been that 
that's a different story, and there are plans for that. So how does this you know, some people will say that 
it's that some property owners are just holding on to their property because it increases in value. Some 
people call it land banking; some people will call it an unwillingness to lower their rents to get somebody 
in there. How is this going to help or does it with what's already there? Because I think isn't a lot of this is 
about... 
 
Patrick Barrett  51:48   
So unlike Central Square, Harvard Square has much larger real estate groups at play. There are several 
local landlords that do own a good portion of the property in Harvard Square. All of whom were

consulted in this process and feel as though that this is like removing the, the duplicative tax on parking 
and allowing for different forms of retail gives them more flexibility in what they're able to accomplish. 
The biggest difficulty in this entire process was training, teaching landlords, what the world looks like 
today. The aspiration for the longest time for these groups was to turn Harvard Square into something like 
Faneuil Hall, well in 2019, Faneuil Hall is not fun. It's not exciting. It doesn't produce the kind of things 
that they want to, they want to see. A lot of what this petition really is, is about as a cultural change, 
which we saw happen in Central Square and we're still seeing happen. Can I guarantee you that Asana 
will wake up tomorrow and their heart will be four times bigger than it is today? Absolutely not. I can tell 
you though, that their aspiration for putting things like a Ray Ban store and commanding hundreds of 
dollars a square foot is going to quickly be dashed. And they will learn from a distance what's going to 
happen, but this changes the landscape in terms of what they can do. And in doing so will make them 
look at it like it did in Central Square.  They will [sic] people who would normally not have thought to do 
what some developers are currently proposing to do in terms of breaking up those retail facades and 
putting value on the upper floors. You know, if you have a two-story building in Harvard Square, you're 
making all of your money on the ground floor.  
 
Patrick Barrett  53:32   
So in order to change that economic model, which you have to change it because the world is looked like 
that anymore, you have to be able to give them the ability to go add a few more stories and for existing 
structures that's all you're going to get no one's building more than three stories on an existing structure it 
is impossible. Without tripling your costs in steel and all sorts of nonsense but... And getting around 
energy issues as we discussed earlier, which are significant. So, to answer your question, I believe that 
this gives the ability for landlords to change the economics of their building. So, they see them doing the 
decision, making the decisions that look more favorable to us, even though economically they make more 
sense to them. And that's the whole gist of this petition is not, you know it's difficult to get these kinds of 
groups together to agree on things even more so to agree to do things that are not necessarily in their 
financial best interest. But you put them all together, and then things start to turn and they have ideas to 
how to use their buildings that no longer are based in getting a 3000 square foot space for an apple store 
or bank or canvas retail and if  we take those things off the table, which we're doing. They have to start 
thinking differently. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  54:44   
And last question Mr. Chair. Sorry. Does this make it easier for permitting and for businesses to happen? 
I think of you know; my favorite example is Ann pizza. You know which the pizza is growing on me. But 
you know, even after they wanted to come in here, that process took forever, for a lot of reasons, 
including the debate over what color their awning was going to be. And I just, you know that that place 
sat vacant for a long time, however you feel about whether it should have been pizza or anything else. It's 
sat vacant. And, you know, I would like to see things move more quickly so that when a business is ready 
to come in, that there's less red tape for them to go through so that they can actually open and we can fill 
those vacancies. So, does this help with that? 
 
Patrick Barrett  55:30   
As I was trying to train the landlords and property owners that they're going to have to think differently 
on their ground floor. I also implored the neighborhood group to consider the regulatory hoops these 
businesses have to go through to exist. And part of the reason why this provision is in there, it addresses 
exactly that. While it is not a slam dunk that any of these businesses are able to go into this space, the red 
tape is significantly slashed in terms of their ability to operate and go from permitting to actually opening 
the doors. And more importantly, I added a caveat to section 11.  [sic] fast food, there's two special 
permits, there's the ability to operate and then when you actually want to sell your business, there's a 
special permit on the transfer the license. Gone. So, for a lot of these businesses, it's and I think we had 
compelling testimony at the Planning Board, that this is a lifesaver for some of these local businesses.

Mayor Marc McGovern  56:26   
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  56:27   
Thank you, Mayor. Councillor Zondervan followed by whoever raises their hand next. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  56:35   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And also, let's not forget Councillor Simmons on the phone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  56:43   
You're willing to give up your time? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  56:45   
 Sure. If she has... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  56:47   
 Please do and then we will go to Councillor Simmons. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  56:47   
Just want to make sure she's not forgotten. So, thank you for this petition, and for being the peacemaker in 
Harvard Square. This very impressive achievement. So, on the, on the cannabis stores, I agree with the 
mayor on that, I would propose that we just amend that out of the of the petition. On housing, I'm also 
concerned about whether this petition adds the possibility of more housing and I hear and agree, and I 
think I understand what you're saying in terms of the limitations, but I look at the map. And I see a big 
parking lot on Church Street that's inside this, the zoning area. So is there some way that we can say, you 
know, if the, if the lot is vacant or a certain amount vacant then you have to build a certain amount of 
housing on it. 
 
Patrick Barrett  57:58   
So, the thing that stuck out to me the most when I was reviewing the Harvard Square overlay district 
language in its original form is that again, it's the only area of the city that had the higher FAR component 
for commercial than residential. That's been in place for a long time. The first thing I suggested to the 
group is that we correct that and make it a four. The biggest, the biggest obstacle to housing creation in 
Harvard Square is going to come from the lack of the ability to go out. I believe that if that's what the goal 
of the council is to add a provision that would incentivize housing, you're going to have to create a 
mechanism for residential construction to go above the existing height and no other use. The Crohn 
petition, I believe, in part got a negative recommendation for the Planning Board because it sort of forced 
the issue within the, within the exact frame. We studied the Crohn petition significantly more [sic], the 
Crohn petition itself but the recommendations from CDD and the Planning Board from that process, so 
we were making sure we weren't hitting the same notes. So, to answer your question, I fully believe that 
that's possible. However, much like in central square, I was looking at existing, not necessarily blank 
slate, I think if you want to create some mechanism for housing incentive, and I'm not saying this as 
anything other than somebody who's just done the math on it, it's a tough sell for housing in Harvard 
Square. And unless you're willing to put height in the table, and by height I don't think you, anything less 
than 12 stories would be acceptable. It's a tough thing unless you want to bring the hammer down so 
heavily on everything else that you bring the commercial use to a zil. But that's not what these, that's not 
what these, this group discussed. I think, in terms of the housing discussion, I believe we need to be a 
little bit more big picture. There are lots of softer sites in the city to develop housing, Harvard Square is 
like granite. It's just as difficult to penetrate with that use as it has been for the past few decades. Not 
much housing has been built at all. We give the opportunity for that. And there will be some developers

who lean that way. There's, we come in all shapes and sizes and all drives. I just don't see under the 
current form, for existing, adding a few stories where then you're now dealing with inclusionary 
regulations and other regulations that sort of, call it a tax or not, but for blank, for blank land, I think 
you're going to have to create a different mechanism. That may be where the AHO comes back. And 
that's how you address it by, you know, and this is a recommendation actually, by Hue Russell at the 
Planning Board that if you do want to incentivize affordable housing, that through another mechanism, 
not unlike the AHO, you could do that in Harvard Square, have it only apply to certain parts, or we only 
lend itself to that. That answer? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:00:57   
Thanks, yeah that is helpful. Then on the fast food provision, as you can imagine, I first of all, totally 
agree that, you know, we should simplify that, that process, it makes no sense. But as you can imagine, I 
did read the non-disposable plates, cup and utensils with some attachment to that idea. So, are we getting 
rid of that too? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:01:30   
So, we're not getting rid of the definition of fast food. So, what we're doing is not making this special 
permit apply to certain types of businesses, non-formula. The polystyrene ban that we have in place. I 
can't imagine we're going to go through another two years and not have something similar for straws. As a 
person who's opening up two restaurants that would, might be defined as Fast Food depending on how 
you look at it, and I think that's the one of the bigger issues in terms of usage. There's no way to audit 
online, there's no way to audit who's coming in and out really. So, like every restaurant in the city is fast 
food just about with a few exceptions, in terms of the use, because it's really not hitting one boxes hitting 
several. And I believe the cap was originally was put in place in Central Square because of trash, because 
everyone was using those polystyrene boxes. So, you know, this group, this is sort of outside the scope of 
what they're doing. But, you know, as a representative of the business community in Central Square, we 
are preparing all of our tenants for larger changes in terms of how they do things. In a lot of ways, It's 
really a selling point. If you look at Clover, you look at Life Alive and places like that. People go to those 
and patronize them more because they, there's, there's a conscious capitalism in the sense. But we don't 
intend to change any of the language the special, of what's in the current language for definition of fast 
food.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:03:00   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:03:01   
Thank you, Councilman Mallon. Before you begin, I'm going to ask Councillor Simmons. Councillor 
Simmons, do you have any clarifying questions for the Petitioner? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:03:14   
Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair. One of the things that I was pleased to see in the petition... First of all, thank 
you Mr. Barrett. It's nice to see you in a suit and without a beard. So, you must be made, he might work 
on more petitions. I was very glad to see but I want to be sure I understand this. The reduction of formula-
based businesses, my clarifying question is, I want to be sure formula-based business means we will have 
fewer chains or fast food type restaurants is that is that correct? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:03:49   
So, in theory, this special permit would exist for chains where it would not exist for non-formula. You 
could still have chain restaurants; they would just have to go through a different process.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:04:07   
Okay, what I was hoping... I certainly appreciate what's happening in Harvard Square and a lot of our 
squares that we do have a lot of vacant storefronts around. I see this petition is opening the doors for 
smaller independently owned establishments and I just want to be sure... And my clarifying question is 
that, that is what this is changing language, zoning language seeks to do? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:04:38   
Absolutely. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:04:42   
Thank you. And then lastly, I do concur with my colleagues, particularly with Marc, around the 
affordable housing and the proliferation of that in the city and that this does not provide a conflict 
between the two. It sounds like you're saying it might, or are you saying you can do that but maybe not 
right in Harvard Square. Now, I know the HAO. Okay, I always get the initials wrong, but I know that's 
not before us right now, I hope that it will become, it will come before us and I just want to make sure 
that they can, they can work together and not be in opposition with one another. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:05:31   
So, the Affordable Housing overlay, the language that was before the council was language, I used to 
work with in terms of there being a potential conflict. The affordable overlay in its original form was 
never going to make any impact in Harvard Square. And the recommendation of the Planning Board was 
that if the overlay were to come back the way to, the real way to get affordable housing in a Harvard 
Square was to address the high and do it through the AHO. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:06:06   
And then lastly, I am pleased to see or support the moving 20 feet to 25 feet and allowing more through 
special permit. So, if I'm to understand that that would be, it would favor let's say cannabis or EEO... EE 
applicants. It would not favor a bank. I wouldn't be correct about that. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:06:34   
So, you support the 25 feet for cannabis retail not for banks, yeah? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:06:41   
Okay, can you speak... I can't hear you. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:06:43   
I'm... I just want, I didn't sure if I understood correctly in terms of the, the, are you parsing out cannabis 
retail from banks. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:06:52   
Yeah. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:06:53   
Okay.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:06:53   
Is that what you were saying that you were doing?  
 
Patrick Barrett  1:06:56   
Yes.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:06:58   
Nod your head because I cannot hear you. I've lost audio all together. Thank you. Mr. Chair Thank you. I 
yield the floor. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:07:13   
Thank you, Councillor Mallon. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  1:07:15   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you Mr. Barrett for the four-hour long presentation of this particular 
zoning petition. I wanted to say I really liked the spirit and the creativity of activating the non-arterial 
streets in Harvard Square like we did in Central Square. So those streets like Bow street, Arrow Street, 
Mount Auburn, not Harvard. I mean, I'm curious, the Planning Board mentioned that many of the retail 
locations there are non-conforming right now and this would bring them into conformity. Is there an 
advantage to that like in terms of them expanding or changing uses? Is that, what would be the advantage 
to bring those places into conformity? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:07:57   
The advantage is they no longer have to seek variances? 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  1:08:00   
For anything that they needed to do? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:08:02   
Well, I can't predict for anything. But the idea is that the use itself is no longer a variance. And that was 
the big concern of mine. The, there may be other relief that they have to seek through other provisions of 
the ordinance, but the variance for the use itself was the big one. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  1:08:19   
Okay. And this is something that small retailers have expressed as a huge issue.  
 
Patrick Barrett  1:08:23   
It's a, well, this was expressed by Harvard University and their ability to lease out these retail spaces, as 
being a big issue. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  1:08:31   
Okay, so that was one question. And then the next question I had was around the fast food formula 
business. And in the Planning Board, they mentioned that this approach around the special permit criteria 
is different than what we had done in Central Square. I'm just curious why that approach was different? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:08:49   
The approach is different because I screwed up. I looked at the cap on fast food and not the actual use 
itself. We got rid of the cap it originally was 14 allowed use of fast food places. But then you'd have to 
the License Commission and do the song and dance and explain how you were not fast food. For Harvard 
Square, I corrected the mistake and actually having spoken with members of ISD. And people who 
actually adjudicate these issues that they were sort of the silent voice in saying please fix this. I believe 
this has been on the radar of CDD for quite some time, as well as the Planning Board had made mention. 
We also didn't have a formula business ordinance in place at all, which I think its sort of questionable as 
to where and how it applies. But that was the only way I could even get past go in Central Square was to 
at least create a different channel for chains. In Harvard Square, I made it so that these non-arterial streets, 
arterial streets would go specifically to non-formula businesses, as it seemed the most logical place for 
people who can't afford those larger triple net rents to go.

Councillor Alanna Mallon  1:09:56   
So, you're learning and growing as you go? Okay. Does that mean that you will, this is outside the scope 
of this conversation, but I hope that means that you will go back to Central Square and... 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:10:06   
In January 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  1:10:07   
And seek to... Okay. And then my last question as more of a statement around supporting the idea of the 
marijuana locations and quite honestly banks. I think for consistency 25 feet makes more sense. And in 
terms of marijuana, sorry, cannabis locations. These should be in our squares, we get a lot of concerns 
from residents who feel like when they are too close into the neighborhoods, it's not a good use. It's too 
far from public transit. This Harvard Square is the perfect location for cannabis locations. And so, I want 
to make sure that, actually, they happen there, as the mayor mentioned, and as Councillor Zondervan 
mentioned, we, we do need to consider that Harvard Square is a great location for the cannabis location. 
So those were my clarifying questions and comments but thank you again for your presentation and all of 
your work on this and everybody here who I know worked so hard bringing this together. The Hatfields 
and the McCoys, I haven't heard that expression so many times and one night. So, thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:11:13   
Councillor Siddiqui, please. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:11:16   
Thank you, Mr. Chair through you. I wanted to ask the petitioner; you've mentioned the amount of 
vacancies in the square. Do you have data on, on the exact number of vacancies? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:11:29   
I do. I did not include it in this presentation. But I can certainly email it to you. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:11:33   
No, I just wanted to ask because I've had, I've been looking into just vacancies in general and how many 
there are, and the Harvard Business Association did share some of those numbers with me. And the 
number that I last had was around 20. So, I'm curious when... 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:11:53   
20 vacancies or 20%?   
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:11:55   
20 vacancies. So, I think there's about, I think occupied businesses, it's around 300. And then there's 
around 294 occupied businesses. And so, the number that they had given it was 20. Which I think, 
thinking about individual vacancies, and why they're vacant this, this city has done some analysis on it. 
And I think some vacancies, no matter what zoning we put into place, it'll go back to the owner and who's 
behind it. We have some examples of that. And so that's something that I think, just as a matter of public 
policy, we have to think about in general, there are those vacancies that will have to, we've done 
somewhat of a job to get more information and push but the zoning not, I don't think necessarily will help 
all the vacancies, in my opinion, so that I just wanted to say that. And then on the marijuana, the cannabis 
business piece I think I definitely concur with my colleagues. And I think you made a statement about the 
facades being fogged up. I think the facades of the marijuana, of the cannabis businesses stores I've seen, 
I don't think I'd classify them as fogged up. I think there are a lot of different models out there. And 
there's very specific advertising things that the businesses have to follow. And some have even put really

nice art in the window. So, I think I wanted to just say that, and then I think most of my questions my 
colleagues brought up, but I do have questions for city staff. So, thank you.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:13:48   
Thank you, Vice Mayor, do you have any questions? 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:13:55   
Well, I mean, I don't know if there's specific to Patrick or to staff. I guess I still would like to understand 
how we can potentially use development to get improvements to the public realm, particularly around 
traffic safety. We've just got an email to the council saying that there was a pedestrian struck in Harvard 
Square as we're talking about it. Mass Ave and Plympton, and I don't know any details but more people in 
Harvard Square, more vehicles doing deliveries, you know, delivering food from restaurants that aren't 
fast food restaurants. I mean, it's, it's, it's a real problem. So, I hate to give up a source of money. I realize 
it hasn't been, this in lieu of parking fee hasn't been used very much. There hasn't been triggered, I guess, 
particularly. So, I'm hoping that maybe not as part of this petition but as part of some other effort we can, 
we can get some money out of that or some... Yes. You can speak, of course. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:15:02   
So, as I had mentioned in the presentation that this is all sort of a negotiated piece. One thing that we 
discussed at the Planning Board level was that when projects trigger Article 19, or they are subject to 
special permit relief, there is that window of opportunity to attach or create criteria, whether either 
through this petition or another to force the outcomes that you're looking for in terms of infrastructure 
improvements. Eversource is already doing this to most of us, not through any process that you guys have 
invented, but because they need the infrastructure themselves. So, I do think that there is a way to do that. 
And while I do concede that this petition doesn't do that, and it's certainly within the power of the 
Planning Board through the special partnering process to attach these kinds of goals, should the council 
wish to make it known. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:15:53   
Okay, well, then I guess that's maybe something to, to address with staff. And just to say, like a clarifying 
question about, so there's that the new Bluestone lane that replaced Crema, which is a formula business 
because it's a chain but did it, did it get a fast food license because I gather it's more sit down than it is 
actual fast food so I wonder if they did that. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:16:17   
They needed a variance for the use 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:16:19   
But they did not... Okay, so they aren't class... they are not a fast food use in essence because I think 
they're more restaurant-y than crema was. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:16:30   
If we went to the Licensing Commission into ISD 10 different times with the exact same business and 
slightly different criteria we'd come out with nine different results as to what is a form, fast food business 
and what is not. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:16:43   
Okay. All right, thanks. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:16:46   
Councillor Kelley, do you have any questions?

Councillor Craig Kelley  1:16:50   
I don't have any questions, but it did come up as a comment which, we just should get rid of parking 
requirements throughout the city. And I don't know that that's Something to be expanded here but there 
are some artifacts that you are correcting, that are artifacts elsewhere as well. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:17:08   
Attorney Rafferty showed up at the Planning Board, reminded the board that I am a non-paid attorney for 
these kinds of things happy to be put on staff to correct further issues. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:17:20   
Thank you. I have two quick questions. We're at an hour and 15 minutes now. First one is if the 1,500, I 
agree with the goal of smaller storefronts, so don't misinterpret this but if 1,500 square foot storefronts... 
Why would you do that if you can do a max FAR? Why would you do [sic] and I want to do 1,500 square 
foot storefronts, but part of the rezoning is well we can max out the FAR as longer within height and a 
rear yard setback I imagine. And so why then would you even consider that? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:18:09   
Because some buildings, they'll be the ability to add additional density to, other buildings less. So, I think 
for a building, that's two stories or three stories, you may have the ability to add a single floor. If you have 
a larger facade, you're not really getting your bang for your buck in the GFA. And what I really wanted to 
do is to create a way to fill the hole so that if there's a 0.8  or a 0.9 or 1.2, or whatever it was, that we are 
taking ourselves out of variance territory into special permit based on the density. We would still make 
that smaller footprint retail but the trade on the upper floors are the trade in GFA but if you are maxed out 
to FAR already, you're still going to need a special permit to add that density. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:18:51   
Yes. But other than structurally and working with the historic commission, one with this policy as stated, 
and I agree with almost all what you're proposing, I don't, I think one negates the other. That if you can 
add three stories on top and go to within the rear yard setback, you're not gaining anything. There's no 
bonus for the 1,500 storefronts. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:19:23   
I don't disagree and there are scenarios where... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:19:26   
That you would only go that way.  
 
Patrick Barrett  1:19:27   
Correct.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:19:28   
Okay, that's number one. Number two, the 1,500 square foot storefronts, I assume that's permanent. if 
they're getting a bonus up top to... 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:19:41   
That's kind of the point. So, like, where, I think the Chevron group's proposal for that Mass Ave building 
is a good example. They bottleneck them... in Mass and Main really too if you look at it, they bottleneck 
themselves into those spaces. They can't adjust any of that. Otherwise they'd be a variance.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:19:59   
Okay, thank you. Those are my only questions. So why don't we bring city staff forward? You know, we 
can bring the whole team, so you all have a front row seat if you'd like. But that's up to you. You can stay 
back there. Well, I will ask. So, Iram and Jeff, we know the Planning Board met. We know you've written 
a good write up on the petition. Perhaps you can give us an overview, overview. Excuse me. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:20:34   
Thank you, Mr. Chair, Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, happy to be here at the last 
ordinance committee meeting of the year, I think. And I checked my calendar. This is the 30th Ordinance 
Committee hearing I attended this year. So, it's been, it's been quite a busy year. We did provide a memo 
with some analysis and information background related to the petition. I think you have copies of that, 
there's I think, in particularly particular some of the maps and charts might be handy as a reference. I'll 
just skip to the Planning Board's recommendation. They reviewed this at their hearing back on November 
19 and discussed the petition, heard from petitioners and many members of the public. They concluded 
with a positive recommendation. Board members were generally supportive of the petition. There were 
some particular items that they called out as items they recommend changing or looking at further. And 
I'll get to those a little bit later. I think the board for a long time has been as, as cases have come to them 
in Harvard Square, expressing their opinion that you know, Harvard Square really needs some help and 
supporting the continued growth of small businesses and, and, and maintaining that, that character and 
really looking towards how Harvard Square will evolve into the future, while acknowledging as the 
petitioner has as well, that zoning isn't necessarily going to be a cure all for these issues. There was one 
kind of broader point raised by some members of the board that some of the issues that are identified in 
the petition are  issues that are more generally applicable city wide and things that could be looked at, in 
more of a city-wide way. There was some concern as to whether just focusing on Harvard Square might 
impact, whether, the way the city might look at these issues in other places as well but ultimately decided 
that it made sense to support these changes at this time, given that it's, it's before the city and that other 
changes could be addressed at another time. So that was the sort of the overall thrust of the 
recommendation.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:22:58   
The, some of the specific changes is included some clarification on some, some pieces including the 
advisory committee language about the frequency of meetings. They suggested not changing the language 
about the, having a requirement that one member be affiliated with an institution, the petition suggest 
changing that to specify Harvard University and the board and think it was appropriate to call out a 
specific institution in that sense. Some other clarifying changes, some were reviewed by the petitioner in 
terms of the streets where, retail uses would be allowed, as of right. As many Councillors just discussed 
the board recommended removing cannabis retail stores from the, the frontage limitation requirements, 
because they felt strongly that the requirements for those users should be the same across, in districts 
where they're allowed across the city. All cannabis retail stores do need to come to the Planning Board 
anyway, unlike banks and some other retail businesses so they all undergo review for, for their facade 
treatments. In terms of banks, the Planning Board did recommend using the same provisions that 
currently exist in Central Square of having a 25-foot frontage limitation and allowing variation by special 
permit. The board finds that helpful to be able to deal with, with case by case scenarios and not end up in 
situations where a bank or a property owner might do something weird to try to squeeze into the 
requirement. I think we also heard, you know, from, some comments from the Historical Commission that 
some of the limitations on frontages or storefronts could, you know, potentially have an adverse impact 
on, if applied to existing buildings. So, the board felt that having some flexibility through the special 
permit process would be an appropriate way to deal with fat, and they have reviewed projects in the past 
where, you know, the, the, the just the circumstances of the site, it just made sense to have it be a little bit 
different.

Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:25:11   
And then, you know, clarifying the meaning of frontage in that particular instance was important and 
some people raise concerns about whether that would be only the ground floor also other parts of the 
building. So those are some specific changes, the board recommended some other issues the board 
pointed out which were not that they didn't necessarily make a recommendation on but though that the 
council should look at a little bit more. The required payment in lieu of parking. The board did not object 
to removing that provision but suggested looking at it a little bit more closely and what, what the intent 
and potential uses of those funds might be, acknowledging that the way it works now has been sometimes 
troublesome, sometimes hasn't worked. It hasn't been as effective as it might otherwise be. But there 
could be other approaches given some of the interest in, in meeting transportation and other mobility-
based needs. The issue with formula businesses, there are some board members who pointed out that 
formula businesses can in many cases be businesses that, that can provide important services to the 
community that can sometimes provide more affordable goods and services to community members. And 
so, some board members were a little bit hesitant to treat those in, in, in sort of more restrictive way. The 
board members did point out that because additional floor area ratio could be additional floor area could 
be granted by special permit for any kind of use. It could create the potential for, for significantly more 
development on some sites that could push up property values and building values and the proposal 
doesn't necessarily tie that additional FAR to any specific improvements. Instead it would have to make a 
finding of this generally in conformance with the with the areas, criteria and guidelines which any 
development coming to the planning board would have to meet. So the board talked about potentially, 
you know, what, what could be achieved, I think the petitioner talked about really the intent of that being 
to create more value on upper floors that could open up more economic possibilities on, on lower floors, 
but something some board members thought that something more specific might be called for.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:27:38   
And the members of the council already discussed some of the comments about the Affordable Housing 
Overlay, and how this might create any preemptive conflicts. I'll just note that from a technical 
standpoint, there is no preemptive conflict of zone... The zoning amendments don't preemptively conflict 
with other zoning amendments because it's an amendment to the zoning ordinance and a future 
amendment would also be an amendment to the zoning ordinance. So, you can always amend something 
and then amend it, amend it back or amend it to, to have a different impact from the previous amendment. 
I think from really from my point of view, the issue is more from a from policy standpoint, whether it 
could complicate the, any sort of future effort because the, and the petitioner, I think, fairly accurately 
pointed out that what, what this does is similar to what in this district, what the Affordable Housing 
Overlay would have done by allowing development within a specific height limit, but with without the 
density limitations. So it changes the economics of development in a way that would make the, be 
affordable if as it was proposed, initially, the Affordable Housing Overlay would, would not have as, as 
much of a would not affect much of a change to the zoning if this, if this provision were in place in in the 
current petition. So that summarizes the Planning Board recommendation, we're happy to answer 
questions. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:29:12   
So, we'll just first deal with Community Development then we'll go to the Historic Commission's input on 
their excellent study. Iram did you want to add anything to Jeff's? No, thank you. So Councillors any 
short clarifying questions? I don't see any. I have a couple. One is the BB, district business B, does not 
have any rear yard requirements. And if you, we need some guidance there whether it's 20 feet, the 
normal one or not, if we're building buildings 80 feet tall and you want to create a light well, if you can 
between buildings. I'm thinking of Church to Brattle block and other blocks so that's something that I 
hope you consider. And it might be part of the criteria instead of putting it in the zoning.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:30:23   
We in cannabis, we talked... why isn't there something... I thought we put something... didn't we not put 
something in the zoning with cannabis about storefronts, either having displays or active uses. So, we 
don't have frosted windows? Isn't that, I'm pretty sure there was something about changing art, changing 
displays. So, we shouldn't have frosted windows. It was mentioned by Patrick and it is an issue. Nobody 
wants that. And, and you know, I could, I could see Harvard or business district or the university or 
Cambridge Arts Council literally putting placards every two months of what's happening in the city in 
these. [sic] I'm hoping this round we get to that because the frosted glass solution is terrible. Let me just 
see here. I'll stop there. So, Mr. Sullivan, you and a group of about 20 people worked on some guidelines 
for the Conservation District. And perhaps you could talk about how these, the proposed petition in 
particular would intersect and any thoughts you have that you want to share with us on Harvard Square 
related to the to... 
 
Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission  1:31:56   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The City Council established Harvard Square Conservation District in 2000. That 
turned out to be at the end of a period of fairly intense development in Harvard Square. And then a long 
period of not much development. The Abbott building project came along, three or four years ago, started 
a whole new interest in the future of Harvard Square. And in 2017, the commission voted to initiate a 
study committee that would examine the goals and operation of the conservation district. And so this 
group that you mentioned, seven appointed members and about 15 regular attendees met for two years, 
every month more or less, and had sort of a continuing seminar on the character of Harvard Square and 
what, what it was what was valuable about it, what the opportunities were, how development should be 
guided and in Harvard Square to protect us commercial vitality, and it's historic character. And so, the 
result of that, committee is just wound up and made a report that you will see early in the new year. That 
recommends some changes to the goals and guidelines, but not, and a few changes to the jurisdiction of a 
conservation district, but mostly to the goals and guidelines of the Harvard Square conservation district 
that a statement that, as Patrick said, should have been incorporated, it was intended to be incorporated in 
the zoning in 2000 but was not and we recommend strongly that it be incorporated this time. The 
Historical Commission itself hasn't taken a position on this zoning but the Study Committee reviewed it 
with Patrick and the proponents and with Jeff from Community Development and voted unanimously to 
support, support this, and as do I, professionally, and in my role as Director, I certainly think this is a very 
valuable way of amending the very stringent regulation, onerous regulations on some aspects of use. In 
particular, the jurisdiction of the conservation district is such that we will continue to be more restrictive 
than zoning if necessary, for appropriateness, but with our goals, starting with our goal of preserving and 
promoting the commercial vitality of Harvard Square. It's a layer that I think is operated constructively 
over the years and will operate, continue to operate in partnership with the amended zoning in a way that I 
think will be very positive for the square. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:35:03   
Thank you. And thank you for the study. Councillors, any questions? Councillor Siddiqui. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:35:09   
Thank you, through you. I'm going to try to frame this question in the best way I know. But I, one thing 
that, Jeff, you mentioned was, the in your memo to the Planning Board the, the consideration that this 
change could significantly change how property owners view the value of their land. Which in the end 
could translate into greater market pressure to redevelop and there has been some major redevelopment in 
the square already. And as Councillors, as a city council, we hear a lot from folks about the recent Asana, 
recent... Some of the tenants that have gotten rent increases. They're paying presumably lower rent and to 
catch it up to market, there's a gap there. And so, all this to say I think I'm, it's hard to envision the future 
but I do feel that there's a somewhat of a tension that things are going to be much more valuable to do 
things in the square. And then I am having a hard time envisioning, I just, I, you know, I just don't want

there to be this... There be more factors where we then as Councillors, as city council, hear more and 
more that we're destroying the fabric of the square because tenants can't meet the rents that folks who are 
buying the buildings are essentially, maybe overpaying, but it's what the market can bear. And so, I don't 
know if you have thoughts on that. I mean, that's just a worry that I have as, going forward. And for me 
this petition it, you know, it sounds good. But it also with some of the things that you've mentioned, it 
also gives me some... it leaves me a little bit scratching my head of like, Huh if it's going to add more 
value doesn't this mean that it'll be harder for some, some types of tenants? I don't know maybe I'm 
missing something, but I think there is a potential if there's greater market pressure to redevelop and get 
more value, what happens? 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:37:35   
Through you Mr. Chair. So I'll, I'll try to start without maybe getting too deep in the weeds just sort of 
step back and explain a little bit just from our perspective, what the zoning position does so and it's 
helpful to understand the, the framework behind the existing zoning for Harvard Square and many other 
places in the city when it comes to density and height. So, in Harvard Square, you know, height is, as 
measured in feet, is limited to 60 feet as of right and 80 feet by special permit. And the overlay district 
also allows a waiver of setback requirements by special permit. So, in terms of building envelope, there's 
a great deal of flexibility with sort of that hard limit at 80 feet of, you know, basically seven, seven 
stories. But there's also the limit of FAR, which is currently limited to four. And you know, to visualize 
that, if you had no setback requirements, or if you provided no setback, building setbacks, a FAR of four 
could be a four-story building. Allowing that additional height to go up to 80 feet or potentially seven 
stories means you have some flexibility. You, within that amount of floor area, you have some flexibility 
for how it could be moved around and shaped within that. So, the so the zoning regime here now is one 
where there's a lot of dimensional flexibility. And the intent is to, you know, have buildings and additions 
that really fit into the historic character, established character, the area. But there's this limit that says, you 
know, you can have all this flexibility, but you can't build more than this amount of development.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:39:24   
And so, this, this sort of proposal turns things around a little bit by saying, well, we're going to allow you 
a lot of flexibility on, on, we're going to allow you some limited flexibility on height, flexibility on 
setbacks and we're going to grant flexibility on density. Which means that somebody looking at the site 
now might say, well, now height is really the limiting factor, not density. And that kind of prompts a 
recalculation of what, what can be done with this property and how would that affect things. And, and I 
think it's probably safe to say it will, as the petitioner said, it won't have the same effect on every 
property, every piece of land isn't going to be able to do the same things. But certainly, for some, it will 
mean that more can be done than can currently be done. And that could affect, that affects the economics 
of it. That could be, could be a good thing for the, in terms of the goals of the petition, if that economic 
change means someone, property owner can get more, you know, more value from sort of office 
development on, you know, six floors of office development, and can then do things on the ground floor 
that are more community focused and, you know, do more to contribute to the sort of the dynamic retail 
environment but they don't need to be making all of their, you know, value on that, that ground floor. But 
again, I think the point that was made by, by members of the Planning Board was that it's, it’s not it's not 
very clear and specific from the zoning how that would work. And it's, it's hard to fully anticipate the 
ways in which property owners might seek to use that special permit provision. And if they do seek to use 
it often, often the way it works is that the developer will or property owner or developer will say, I want 
to try to achieve this additional, get this additional density, that is allowed by special permit, and then will 
sort of ask or look to the city to say what, you know, what does it, what's required to, to enable that that 
special permit? So, some clarity on that, that point is often helpful as we, as we get to seeing actual 
development proposals.

Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:41:52   
I don't know if that directly answers your question, but I hope it gives a little bit more context to the... 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:41:56   
Yeah, it was helpful. Thank you. Oh, I'm good. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:42:09   
Okay. Any, any other... Councillor Kelley? 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley  1:42:14   
Thank you. I think following up on Councillor Siddiqui's comments. I see no way that things don't get 
more expensive in a Harvard Square that becomes denser and renovated. And it's not clear to me how 
buildings become renovated, if they don't generally get bigger, but I don't do that part for a living. So 
maybe there are ways. And it's not part of this petition, but from a thought experiment standpoint. If we 
want to bring in density and if we want buildings to be bigger, because it brings in that density and it 
helps, I guess bring more vitality to the square. What would happen if we got rid of the special permit 
application part? And just said you can do this as of right, the setback, add then at the 20 feet height on it, 
don't have to go to the Planning Board. If you could walk through what specifically will we get from that 
special permit application? 
 
Iram Farooq  1:43:22   
Through you Mr. Chair. I would say the special permit. You know, we, we adopted these special permit 
provisions principally to allow an opportunity for the community to weigh in, to be able to have a 
mechanism by which... In addition, you know, both the massing as well as the design could be evaluated. 
And then conformance with things like design guidelines could be... which are more subjective, can then 
be part of the discussion, as well as having the public hearings that are associated with it. So that's the 
principal purpose of special permits, I'd say in a district like Harvard Square, in fact, it has, you would 
think that even smaller changes, just given the nature of the district are typically, benefit from more 
attention. I don't think that the process is what holds people up from adding more density. It's just that it's 
not permitted right now. So even when there is height allowance, the density is becoming currently a 
constraining factor oftentimes, so the buildings cannot set the entire envelope that they might otherwise in 
terms of in terms of height. Does that help? 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley  1:44:51   
It does. I think my underlying point is we, we often look at special permits as something more of a, this 
won't happen because there's a special permit. And this might happen, because special permits are in 
theory simply to provide that review that you are talking about. So that otherwise permitted zoning stuff 
can move forward. As values increase, then I suspect we'll see more of this. And then there's still an FAR 
constraint if I'm not misunderstanding things. So, what would happen if we just tossed the whole FAR 
and GFA, and all that out the window and limited the height and setbacks? 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:45:35   
Through you, Mr. Chair, the, the, I think that's much of what the proposal does, the current proposal does. 
It would, and this is fairly unique, we point out this is unique in the zoning ordinance currently. That it 
would allow an increase in FAR by special permit with no with no upper limit. So, the places in the 
zoning ordinance where we say the FAR can be, limit can be, you know, one by, by right and couldn't be 
increased to two by special permit. But this is different because it says it is four as of right and you could 
seek a special permit to, to increase it. I think from a practical standpoint, a development in Harvard 
Square in order to achieve that increase in density would need special permits on height. And, it could 
potentially allow a building up to 60 feet as of right if it didn't require any other relief. But usually some 
special permit relief is needed for setbacks, for parking, or for height or for other things or for use. So,

the, it I think, is just echoing what Iram said, the special, the fact of it being a special permit is probably 
not as directly relevant as the fact that there's just no specific upper bound. So, it doesn't, it makes, it 
makes everything except the 80-foot height limit a flexible requirement that can be adjusted through the 
special permit process. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:47:20   
Charlie would like to respond to that as well. Please. 
 
Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission  1:47:24   
The constraint that stays in place is that the, any such application would have to receive a certificate of 
appropriateness under the Conservation District goals and guidelines. And the commission in exercising 
authority can be more restricted than zoning, doesn't have to allow that extra height or FAR if it's not 
appropriate in the context of the proposal. So that, that is unique to Harvard Square. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley  1:47:56   
Right. I understand. Thank you and you did a great job walking through me, Harvard, walking me 
through Harvard Square a while back and helping me understand the importance of the historical 
ramifications of different developments. I guess what I am edging around is, and we don't know what the 
future of retail is, we don't know what the future of labor is, we don't know what the future of building 
[sic]. We don't know a lot about what the future is going to look like. And at, the more flexible we get, 
and I understand we're looking at this special permit process as providing that special, sorry, that 
flexibility. The more flexible we can be, the more nimble we can [sic], more nimbly, we can respond to 
changes in everything from delivery to where things get manufactured as manufacturing takes on a whole 
new look with 3D printing and other types of things. And I don't think we'll ever stop talking about 
Harvard Square, but I appreciate the work that you've put in to getting us this far. 
 
Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission  1:49:03   
Chair, I'm sorry. I've been prompted to point out that section 20.51 of the proposed measures should say, 
it could, should add "goals and" to this statement and Harvard Square Conservation District guidelines for 
three goals and guidelines. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:49:25   
As long as Community Developing got that we're in good hands. So, Councillor Kelley, you're, you've 
completed your question. Thank you. Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:49:37   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I do appreciate the questions and concerns around property values, because 
that's, to a large extent, I think what's driving some of the issues that we're seeing in Harvard Square. And 
so, I share some of those concerns and I wonder, if there's an opportunity, maybe not through zoning, but 
to, to put some caps on, on how much rent can be charged. Because ultimately, we're trying to do some 
very indirect manipulation of the situation but as long as people can speculatively buy properties and, and 
crazy valuations because they believe that they might be able to collect crazy rents it’s just going to keep 
going up. And of course, eventually the market will correct itself, but we may not, we may not like that 
correction. So, I'm not sure if that's really part of zoning, but... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:50:44   
It isn't.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:50:46   
So, so maybe not appropriate for this conversation but some of you think about how do we more directly 
impact what's going on there because this petition while it certainly seems to make a whole bunch of 
things better could have unintended consequences that make other things worse. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:51:08   
Yes, Ms. Farooq. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  1:51:10   
Through you, Mr. Chair. The one thought that, I think this is just maybe a different way of saying what 
the Planning Board has, has suggested. That I think the, you know what, what you are all saying about 
changes in property values are, is inevitable when there's additional density that is added. The goal of the 
petition as Patrick spoke about is to, the intention is that there will be enough value on the upper floors, 
that then a property owner will feel comfortable about not deriving value from the say the ground floor 
and then allow it to be things that are more desired by the community. And the question that the Planning 
Board raised is, is there a way to make that more explicit, and perhaps have a set of desired uses for the 
ground floor that could then be connected to any special permit under this additional density provision, 
which might get to at least some of the concerns that you're raising, if not all, because the office space 
might, would still in that scenario, perhaps be more valuable than [sic] 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:52:31   
Excuse me. Couldn't that be part of the criteria given that you're getting a lot more as a developer 
potentially, than what you're giving up? And fact, it could be 2 to 1, 3 to 1, 5 to 1. As I understand it, now, 
I'm seeing the petitioner saying not quite five, but 4 to 1. And I see no reason why, to build on that even 
though it's not in the zoning, but in the next version that we couldn't do that. Just like with the 1,500 has 
to stay and it should be affordable. I don't know how you define affordable. But it seems to me it's a give 
and take. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  1:53:12   
Mr. Chair, the I think the affordability piece might be a challenge to define, but certainly the... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:53:19   
Half the normal rent or some percentage of the normal, average rent. I'm just throwing out an idea. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:53:28   
I like that idea. Any other questions? clarifying questions? I'll go with... let me ask Councillor Simmons. I 
miss your... 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  1:53:28   
Let us think about how about might, and we can talk to the proponents about whether there is potentially 
some definition that, that might work. But that gets to the rent and affordability point that you just 
mentioned is difficult to regulate through zoning. However, a set of uses could be identified, like for 
instance, on North Mass Ave, the corridor talks about active uses at the ground floor and then identifies 
what might be in that, within the scope of that. This could be a different set of, not just active, it might 
include some community focus, and it could have definition, I'm again making this up without having 
talked either, to the law department or to Jeff. So, one of them is likely to tell me that I maybe making up 
too much stuff, but certainly we can have that discussion with the proponent as well. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:54:37   
Thank you, no thank you.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:54:39   
I miss your face. I apologize. I'm sorry. Did you say you do or do not have questions? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:54:45   
I do not have questions. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:54:46   
 Thank you, and I apologize for not getting to you sooner. Councillor Kelley? 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley  1:54:51   
Thank you. And this may, may be a better question to ask the petitioner but, four point... and maybe I 
missed In the discussion, but 20.54.3, where they talk about the uses, the petition seems to strike out the 
preexisting "I", which is a much vaguer sort of if this thing works with the function of the square, then it's 
allowed, general definition. And I was wondering why that, because that at least partially addresses my 
flexibility question because we don't know what the future of all this different stuff is going to be. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:55:40   
Sorry, Mr. Chair. It sounded like a question to the petitioners to explain or was a question to staff? 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley  1:55:47   
It is a question to anyone who feels like answering it. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  1:55:51   
Well, it does. So yes, the petition does strike a paragraph which is in the, it's in this section. Which says 
that in an area otherwise zoned office or residential, that planning board can grant a special permit for, for 
a business. It is a fairly narrow provision. It doesn't apply to everything, everywhere in the district. And it 
just has some criteria that says that there's a demonstrated need for as, for, for that particular use to the 
adjacent residential communities or the academic community. And that can't be easily located in existing 
business or office districts where they use is permitted. I guess the petitioner can speak to the rationale for 
striking that. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:56:41   
One, I like striking things out. Two, the real reason for removing the section is because of exactly the 
flexibility that you're talking about. That by trying to prove something arbitrary, like there's a need for 
this, that and the other thing, that you don't really... The language itself I thought was too squishy in terms 
of what you're actually going to allow and why. So that all I really cared about was that we have a zone 
right now that these uses are not allowed in, where they use is currently already are to some degree. And 
then if you're talking about any kind of affordability component for retail, there's a natural occurring 
affordability by expanding these uses to these, these kinds of areas and not attaching caveats like a proven 
need for pizza, for example, or a proven need for Ray Ban or proven need for any one particular use over 
another. That the petitioner can look at the, the area itself and with some degree of certainty know 
whether or not their use is applicable. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley  1:57:50   
Through you, Mr. Chairman to Mr. Barrett. But that does keep someone from saying hey, this isn't 
covered in this list of things that are allowed. In fact, maybe it wasn't even invented when this was, was 
discussed, but boy would fit really well in what the square has become. 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:58:12   
So, a lot of the work that we done in this particular group is trying to solve the problems of today and 
maybe three or four hours into the future. I can't predict the uses that come. And quite frankly, I think

when we open the door to an ever-expanding use category, you run the risk of allowing things to happen 
that you wouldn't normally accept. I can set examples of like Airbnb and Uber, and all other kinds of 
technological advances that at the first seemed fantastic, but then become sort of invasive and non-
productive. That if a new use should present itself, it doesn't quite fit into the category. Well, then we 
should have a discussion about it, a controlled discussion as opposed to allowing something to enter into 
an area that we didn't really quite predict for. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley  1:59:00   
Okay, through you Mr. Chair to the petitioner. Then as I read it, this is an intentional attempt to provide 
more long-term predictability in a very unpredictable future. And if it turns out that something needs to be 
changed, it results in either a minor zoning change or be a variance or revisiting the zoning? 
 
Patrick Barrett  1:59:22   
Short answer, yes. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:59:26   
Vice Mayor, please. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:59:28   
Well, I would just add that the table of uses, I believe, is still under review. But I was also going to say it's 
almost 7:30. Are you going to have public comment? Because we do have people sitting there. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:59:39   
Yes, of course. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:59:41   
Well, I know but it's, it's almost, we've almost reached our time limit here.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:59:45   
If I could speed you all up, I would. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:59:48   
I'm happy to suspend our back and forth because it's, I don't know maybe... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:59:54   
 So, you don't have an important question?  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  1:59:56   
I don't and I'm encouraging you, I'm sorry to open it up the floor so these people can go home if they want 
to.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:00:02   
Yeah, I was just about to do that. In fact, I was going to say time is up, come back next time. No, I'm 
kidding. But first, did either other Councillor want to ask a quick question, no. Great. So, first of all, we 
have to extend the meeting. You can stay there if you wish or you could sit on the side tables. People will 
be speaking at the podium. We will have public comment, but first, we need a motion to extend that 
meeting.  
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  2:00:34   
Move to extend Mr. Chair.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:01:14   
Yes.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  2:01:14   
Motion passes. Eight in favor, one absent.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:01:16   
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:01:21   
Yes. So, each of you will have, there are six people who've signed up. Each of you will have three 
minutes. Those of you who've been here before, you know, you come to the podium. The first speaker is 
Robert LaTremouille. Second speaker is Elizabeth Gombosi. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:01:48   
Is the light on Robert? There you go. 
 
Robert LaTremouille  2:01:55   
I'm good. My name is Robert LaTremouille. I am the advancement of the three citizen initiative zoning 
petitions, which constitute said 85% of the zoning on Massachusetts Avenue from the former [sic] 
Harvard building to City Hall. Simultaneous with this meeting is a meeting of Mass DOT, directly 
overlapping the discussion for this meeting. They are discussing the Harvard properties in the massive 
area next to the Mass pike. Councillor Kelley's question was excellent. And it's a key problem in that 
paragraph, there were two senators in that paragraph. The second sentence starts with the words for all 
other lots and you've got a page full of comments. But it’s for all other lots. The first sentence reads, any 
retail use allowed in the business B zoning districts, within the overlay, may also be allowed as of right. 
In any office residential zone within the overlay district, provided the structure contains the use has a 
main entrance from five stated streets. English translation, all office and residential zoning districts 
between Mass Ave and Memorial Drive, subject to a bunch of bootstrapping by letter, are trashed. They 
are not residential districts. They are not office districts. They are retail districts. Period. 
 
Robert LaTremouille  2:03:51   
By this provision in here, Harvard's overwhelmingly residential office properties have a payment from 
their city council encouraging Harvard to move those properties to that massive area next to the Mass 
pike. And this is not minor. You're giving them retail. They can destroy housing. They can destroy 
offices; they can destroy residence halls. You got a general claim saying that, throughout the district. 
You've got all these retail uses, it's nonsense. As my letter goes in on a point by point basis. These areas 
being destroyed. Our residential and office and hotel those are not commercial uses. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:04:50   
Thank you, Robert. That's three minutes. Elizabeth is next, followed appropriately by Fritz Donovan. 
 
Elizabeth Gombosi, 42 Irving Street 2:04:59   
I am Elizabeth Gombosi. I live at 42 Irving Street. I won't address the several sensible changes proposed, 
although I believe that they will help provide Harvard Square with the boost it needs to once again 
become a vibrant destination for residents as well as visitors. What I would like to note is that this is 
exactly the kind of collaboration of neighbors, business and institutions that will bring positive and 
productive change to our city, while preserving the unique qualities of our diverse neighborhoods. For the

various constituencies to sit down together and work out a mutually beneficial plan is exactly how we 
should be promoting new ideas in our changing city. Cambridge is full of innovative thinkers and this 
petition is the result of melding what all concerned parties brought to the table. I commend the authors for 
their efforts, and I hope you will support the Blier petition. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:06:06   
Thank you. Fritz is next, followed by Tom Lucey. 
 
Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street  2:06:14   
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor, Madam Vice Mayor, Councillors of the Ordinance committee, I'm Fritz 
Donovan, resident of 42 Irving Street, Cambridge. I'm here to record my enthusiastic support for the 
Harvard Square zoning petition on tonight's agenda. With the holidays thundering down on us just a few 
days away. I'm fondly reminded of the decades starting with my 1955 arrival, when I did almost all my 
Christmas shopping in Harvard Square. More than once I shamefully admit on December 24. But that 
doesn't happen anymore. And it hasn't happened recently for decades. Our famous Harvard Square has 
deteriorated to the point where local consumers have virtually no reason to go there. Other than for a 
quick bite with fast food. That is a shame. Part of the problem is worldwide with the internet challenge to 
brick and mortar retail. But a huge part of it is strictly local. And that is something we can remedy. Space 
has gone to the high bidder or simply sat empty for months, on end, until somebody finally comes up with 
the asking price. The exciting little shops you could always count on for something unique and delightful 
have almost all been driven out. The rest are hanging on by their fingernails. The high bidders of course 
include 10 banks already and we will soon have 11 or more. My own longtime Bank of America occupies 
90 feet of prime frontage opposite our famous Harvard Square kiosk and several others are almost as big. 
That's not exciting to shoppers. It's dull. It's sad. For years now, a whole lot of people have been griping 
about the situation, but at last somebody's doing something about it. Something really clever. This is 
exciting. The petition before you tonight is a result of an extraordinary collaboration to the neighborhood, 
Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, and the Business Association, Harvard Square Business 
Association, to return Harvard Square to the thriving, vibrant place it used to be. In which local 
businesses will once again have a better chance. It is a cleverly conceived balance of current heights with 
some added density, more residential units, elimination of parking fees and increased basement use. It 
will result in new affordable space for smaller retailers and a new sense of excitement and appeal for this 
very special corner of the world, we all treasure. Please give it your most supportive attention and help us 
bring Harvard Square back to the productive and enjoyable place at once was. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:08:47   
Thank you Fritz. Three minutes. Perfect. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:08:53   
Tom, you're ... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:08:54   
Good evening. I'm back, not talking about natural gas either. Tom Lucey for the record. On behalf of 
Harvard University, we want to, I submitted a letter of support that I encourage you to look, it outlines our 
support of what we think is a very strategic intervention for the square. Appreciate the City Council and 
the staff and the Historic Commission's work on this. We've gathered many, many times over the last 
decade talking about ways to improve Harvard Square. And I think that conversation will continue but 
this is worthy of your support. I also want to recognize the Business Association and Neighborhood 
Association for getting together, working together in a collaborative fashion. We, as a university, we 
encourage them to continue along those lines and we'd like to be part of that, working with both the city 
and those two groups for Harvard Square. Thank you.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:09:39   
Thank you, Tom. Next is Nicola Williams, followed by Robert Winters. Welcome Nicola. 
 
Nicola Williams, 8 Brewer Street 2:09:50   
Good evening, everyone. Councillor Simmons, to you as well. So, I really appreciate the dialogue and 
discussion and the opportunity today. I'm at 8 Brewer Street by the way. I'm a proud signer of the petition, 
the Blier petition, and I'm speaking on behalf as a Harvard Square business owner for 25 years, a resident 
in Harvard Square for 32 years, a member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, Harvard 
Square Business Association, Cambridge Local First and Sustainable Business Network, which founded 
Cambridge Local First. I'm really proud of the fact that this approach the zoning petition, was community 
led and involved all the stakeholders, residents, landowners, local businesses, Historical Commission, 
Harvard University, and Pebble Gifford. We all had to give and take for this petition. And I really 
appreciate Patrick's firm and understanding guidance. Patrick Barrett. As a locavore, I believe in this 
petition because I believe it will help local and independent businesses. It's a very good plan, and I hope 
you support it. This is just a beginning point; I don't see this as an endpoint for the economic 
revitalization of Harvard Square. I feel the city's retail strategy study that was done in 2017 addressed 
some of the problems that we have, and which is city wide it's not just for Harvard Square in terms of the 
demographics that are changing. The fact that we have online retail going on. So, it's just something that's 
relevant that we really need to pay attention to. Property values, of course, that's something that we 
should be concerned about, and the way people are shopping, and the displacement of middle-income 
folks, city wide has affected all retail. So, I appreciate the questions from Councillor Zondervan and 
Councillor Siddiqui. And particularly, as it addresses  diversity, small and local independent businesses. 
We have a lot more work to do. Out of the 470 plus restaurants in Cambridge, five are, about 1% are 
owned by black businesses. And there's only one black owned liquor license in Cambridge. So, I just 
don't want us to think that this is a Harvard Square is, is isolated. This is a city-wide issue. And some of 
the questions and issues that you raised are citywide and should be addressed. And later on, around how 
do we address some of these inequities and revitalize all local businesses in Cambridge. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:12:34   
Thank you, Nicola, Robert Winters. 
 
Robert Winters, 366 Broadway 2:12:39   
Robert Winters, 366 Broadway. And I just like to speak in enthusiastic support of the petition in general. 
But I'd like to make just a few specific statements. And these are statements that I could say just as well 
about Harvard Square, as Central Square and various other places. One of the terms that I Introduced 
when the K2C2 process was happening in the Central Square was the need to produce, promote retail 
diversity. In other words, how do you actually find places where they are a little bit more affordable, a 
little bit lower rent, so you can actually develop the kind of diversity that people want. And part of the, 
the calculus for doing that, that I've been speaking of for over 20 years, is the importance of promoting 
active uses on the side streets and the back streets. Harvard Square is sort of natural for it, but Central 
Square could do it too, as well. One of the things that I like about this is that it actually delineates 
mechanisms through which you can make it easier to open and easier to operate, less regulation on a 
much broader range of streets. Which will, going to create the opportunities, even some of the places that 
get forced out in some places, by high rents may be able to find places, you know, in, in some of these 
other locations. That would be certainly my hope. The other thing I want to mention here is you know is 
that I don't know that I would be so quick to chop out the cannabis retail aspect of this. The real issue isn't 
so much cannabis versus banks, but as much as it is about, you know, killing retail frontage, and just 
saying, well, we want to, we want to, you know, do a solid for the cannabis industry here. That's fine, but 
the thing is, is that if it's still going to be a retail, killing of the retail frontage, that's a net negative. There 
are better ways to address that other than sticking art in the window, which is something I find deplorable 
quite honestly. I love art, but that ain't retail, that's fake retail. What I think would be much nicer is, and if

there's some mechanism and I don't know if there is to actually, and I talked to some of the, the, like the 
Revolutionary clinic people about doing this in central square. He said, don't, find a way, work with the 
landlord to have, what you might call, maybe we call it micro-retail that actually does something small, 
real small, I mean micro small in some of those frontages. You know, maybe newspaper stands are on the 
on the way out, but a newsstand can be five-foot-deep, ten-foot-deep and the frontage. Use up that retail, 
retail frontage in a retail-oriented way, not depictions of what you want, but what you want. Right? It 
could be something like selling a hot, you know, hey, my own personal favorite wouldn't would it be 
great if a little hotdog stands off the sidewalks and things like that. If they were could be a way and 
maybe by restricting the frontage, and I'm not saying whether it should be 20-25, special permit or 
whatever. But to actually find a mechanism to encourage that type of micro-retail, right out of the 
sidewalk. I think that will be a positive thing. So, don't be too quick to throw out a mechanism that might 
actually be able to deliver something like that. Thank you.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:15:58   
Thank you for that suggestion. We actually We did that with non-medical, sorry, with medical in Inman 
Square and we proposed that elsewhere, but it didn't get incorporated to non-medical, unfortunately. So, is 
there anyone? We're done with the list. Is there an additional person? I see a hand; I see a face. Suzanne, 
please come up. And if your last name isn't Blier, please correct me. 
 
Suzanne Blier at 5 Fuller Place  2:16:30   
I go by anything. Thank you and I Live at 5 Fuller Place. And I want to thank everybody who has 
participated in this and I thought it would take this opportunity to just address a couple of the great 
questions that were raised by Council. The petition itself actually began a couple years back when we 
were trying to address the Abbot building, which we were hoping to landmark and out of our efforts on 
that we decided to look at the conservation district as a whole. And I'll say that the, that effort through the 
Cambridge Historical Commission and Charlie Sullivan was one of the most wonderful experiences I've 
had in the city. It was truly extraordinary from that vantage. I think there are many issues in Harvard 
Square, I think some, as have been stated are local to Harvard Square, some are citywide, and some are 
national and some it's simply a tsunami of problems. It related in part to the sale of the Dow Stearns 
properties which is Asana and Pizza and the Regency, concomitantly with a huge increase in property 
investment. So, if we can get it right now, before Asana and some of the others come into play, I think it 
will be important. And speaking of Asana and thinking about the impacts visually of this, if you've gone 
into the Harvard Square flower, floor, flower store, and you can look back and see all the way through it. 
It's a very thin building. So, if we keep the heights at 60 feet or 80 feet by special permit. And presumably 
these buildings, if it's a new one, would have to go through Historic Commission and special permit, you 
can see really how much space we're talking about or the Chan building. It's maximizing, it could 
maximize FAR by removing the atrium, but it's basically getting the height, roughly as it would be. And 
again, going through the Historical Commission. 
 
Suzanne Blier at 5 Fuller Place 2:18:23   
I should also add that Harvard Square, it's very unique, its owned principally by six property owners, 
three of whom are here, and the other two representing or owner of trinity, of a, Gerald Chan and then 
two out of state investment firms in part, why we are where we are. But to have three of the principal 
owners here, I think is really important. And on the cannabis, I would simply say, I want to two more 
quick points to cannabis and housing, that I do support the 20 feet. In part because Harvard Square is 
unique. We've got a lot of space in the basement areas, whether it's the garage, or other places or the 
second floor, such as Eastern Mountain Sports. And there many other places as well, where we want 
would welcome it and would welcome more. But again, I think as Robert Winter said we're really 
concerned about the facades of the ground floor buildings. Housing is a, is a really critical issue in in the 
Crohn petition that I had brought up, with, I've been involved with before, we were told, and I think 
rightly so. You can't put that on the second floor and third floor and higher criteria for property owners,

it's simply too expensive. And finally, finally on vacancies for Councillor Siddiqui. One of the things that 
we, our report found this summer is that the average vacancies have facade lengths of 44 feet. So, our 
hope is that by limiting the size of interior space to promote local businesses, that people would get the 
view also that this might help with vacancies. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:20:00   
Thank you. Are there any others who wish… please come forward. 
 
Raj Donda. property owner in Harvard Square  2:20:10   
My name is Raj Donda. I'm a property owner in Harvard Square. And my comment on the overall petition 
is very positive. I think it will make many things easier. Some of things I struggled through and in some 
of my development proposals. I would urge that the planning board recommendation on the bank, bank 
frontage, and, and special permit. And also, there's something, I didn't hear it mentioned, about what the 
definition of frontage is, those were items that were recommended by the Planning Board and I 
completely support that. One other final thought I would have is yes, there are lots of reasons why the 
retailing is not doing so well. In many parts of the retailing areas, it's on life support, if that. But perhaps 
the thing to do is have businesses which bring more people to this, to the square. In one of my own 
properties, I have six restaurants, and we get literally thousand to 1,200 people every day. And so, 
whatever can be done to make the restaurant process easier, that would help. Thank you.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:21:58   
Thank you. Any others? I only see Denise, please come forward. Welcome. 
 
Denise Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association  2:22:07   
Good evening. Thank you. Denise Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business 
Association. I'm not sure if I'm a Hatfield or McCoy. But in any case, here I am, and the proud second 
signer of the Blier petition. I want to thank all of the committee members and, you know, the Harvard 
Square Neighborhood Association and, and the Cambridge Historical Commission, as well as all of the 
members of the Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee that met for two years and have 
some 22 meetings over that period of time, sort of helping to develop this, this petition that's being 
presented tonight. A couple of points of clarification. As you all know, we keep a very tight survey of the 
Harvard Square overlay district. The area is about 44 acres. It's about a million square feet of space. And 
we pay attention to the retailers, the restaurateurs, the service organizations and keep a survey. So, we 
know, square footage. We know whether it's a national, international, regional, a local, and right now over 
70% of the businesses within the district are in fact locally owned independent. Something that they [sic] 
we're very proud of. Of the 20 vacancies that we talked about; we're also extremely pleased that so many 
of them, probably about 14 have something in the pipeline. So very soon, we are going to see just to name 
a few, Patagonia is coming, Spice, Dig, Wachusetts’ Brewery, the Smokehouse, Charles River remedies, 
as of last night at the Planning Board, they received their certificate of, whatever it was, appropriateness 
maybe, and moving forward with the, with, with 31 Church Street. Looking forward to the 10 Church 
Street development. One of the things that you in fact, Mr. Chair recommended and we're going to add to 
what we survey is the store frontage. So I'm actually going to get out on the street in each store frontage, 
we will take your recommendation, and make sure that we have that, that number also, several years ago 
when we were giving these numbers to our board, somebody mentioned, Yes, but if you take the number 
of locally owned independents and you convert that to square footage, what does that represent? And 
according to our, our calculations, over 60% of the businesses, the occupied businesses within that 
million square feet, is actually, 66% is locally owned and independent. So, we have a little bit of work to 
do. But overall, I just want to thank you. And also thank you for probably the most important piece, 
which is the investment that the City of Cambridge is making in the public domain. That's probably the 
most critical thing that we can do. And as Mr. Donda said, you know, there are some businesses that, that 
are, in fact on life support. And even in the past couple of weeks, I've had several, several come to me and

tell me that they're down 20%. So, we have a lot of work to do. And I think getting foot traffic in the 
square will make the difference. Thank you very much. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:25:20   
Thank you. Any... Yes, John? I think you might be the last person that hasn't spoken. Welcome. 
 
John DiGiovanni, Trinity properties  2:25:30   
Thank you. Good evening, John DiGiovanni. I'm with Trinity properties. And also, president of the 
association.  I primarily just want to thank a number of folks, you know, Patrick's work, but truly, when 
this council, I believe, suggested that there be a review of the Conservation District guidelines. Which I 
was a part of 20 years ago, and I think there was some 40 odd meetings, if I'm right Charlie, back prior to 
the inception of the conservation guidelines in 2000. And this review, I was an observer, I was not part of 
the committee. But really, and I mean, this genuinely the patience of Charlie and Sarah through the past 
two years in reviewing, painstakingly this 90-page report that you have. And I think that's probably the 
most important thing to think about is this zoning is subject to these 90 pages that breaks a fairly small 
district into six sub districts. And it's done thoughtfully. So, I really want to thank, and I think, really, the 
Hatfields and McCoys got together at these two years of meetings, and that's why this happens. So, I 
really do think the staff of the historic commission deserve a lot of credit for their patience in helping us 
get to this point. I think we recognized that some zoning needed to be updated as well. And I don't want to 
try to do this here. I here number of the questions and concerns. I've been leasing in Harvard Square for 
32 years, and we've seen changes, and we don't operate in a, in a way that's not subject to the rest of the 
world, what's happening around us. So we're impacted there, and what I would say to you, we do think, 
and the vast majority of the businesses in our buildings are local, they want more people walking by their 
store, they want more people coming into the square, and our collaboration with the city. And creating 
space like that and activities in Harvard Square is what is most desperately needed. And I'm hoping that in 
a short while be coming in with some more ideas to actually do that. I think this is a good first step. But it 
alone does not solve all the problems that we face in this urban district. But I think you see people here 
that really care about it, as well as the members of the council that we hope this is a good first step. So, 
thank you, and thank you for your time.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:27:49   
Thank you. So, I believe we're going to wrap this up, but if there's... I have some final comments, but... 
Who are you pointing to? Oh? Welcome. 
 
Marilyn Meyer, 10 Dana Street 2:28:09   
Hi, Marilyn Meyer, 10 Dana Street. I don't know how... What I can actually add, and I apologize if I'm 
belaboring. But this whole idea of zoning is slightly outside my wheelhouse. There's a lot of details I have 
a hard time kind of grasping some of the things, but some, some points that jumped out at me. I was also 
part of the Conservation District study group for the past two years. And preservation and brick and 
mortar are very important to me. The character, all that kind of identity for the, for Harvard Square. What 
I like is that the Conservation District, the conservation, the Historic Commission has priority. And this, 
this zoning is, is in conjunction with this. It was only mentioned but also part of this zoning is the 
resurrection and maybe even more formalizing the Harvard Square advisory board made up of 
stakeholders to look at projects to oversee maybe lighting and, and signage and make recommendations 
before projects get moved on to the Historical Commission or Planning Board or whatever, but that is 
also part of looking at this, paying attention. And at the Planning Board itself, the, the one dissenting vote 
was based on the fear that this zoning would interfere with the over, of the Affordable Housing Overlay 
and which is not even written yet, which is, doesn't even, I mean it's a, it's a thought at this point. So, with 
the ability to have permits and, and even amendments, one should not preclude the other. And if this 
works in the square, and there are some good things out of this, then this is kind of incremental changes 
and incremental zoning that might be appropriate in looking at how we look at the rest of the city instead

of blankets, zoning and heavy handedness to see what, what is important in all the other areas of 
Cambridge and maybe even tailor something for a better response to what we're looking for. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:30:58   
Thank you, Marilyn . All right. I'll ask one last time. Anybody else would like to speak? I don't see any. 
So, I'm going to close public comment. Any closing comments? 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  2:31:10   
Mr. Chair.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:31:11   
Yes, Mr. Mayor. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  2:31:12   
Just, Just really quickly. And I, you know, I kid you not about this. You know, there was there were some 
comments at public comment. And I think we've all made comments. I just want people to keep some 
things in mind. I know Harvard Square has changed a lot. And I know that there are a lot of issues that 
we're trying to address. And this petition is going to take some time to address those issues. And I just 
worry, I want us to just be a little careful when we talk about the square as this horrible, desolate place 
that nobody would want to go to because that's not going to help the businesses that are there. And I say 
this because, and I know it's changed and is different, but I.... my... I kid you not, and I swear, I am 
picking up my 18-year-old son, who's in Atlanta for, for college next week. Who's coming home for the 
holiday. And I said, we'll all pick you up at the airport and we'll go out to eat. And his response was I'm 
meeting my friends in Harvard Square, I don't want to go to dinner with you. Which broke my heart, but 
shows that, like, as much as Harvard Square has changed for those of us that are a little bit older, he's 
going to tasty burger for dinner where I went to the tasty. And I just think I just want us to be a little 
careful how we talk about it because, you know, yes, it's changed. And yes, there are issues, but saying 
things like, Oh, this is a terrible place is not going to draw people into the square to support the businesses 
that are there now. So, let's just be a little more supportive of the square. We all care about it deeply. The 
Business Association is trying to do a lot of work to bring people in. And despite all the construction and 
the mess, I encourage people to visit Harvard Square, buy Christmas presents and spend a lot of money. 
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:31:49   
I don't recall anybody saying it was a horrible place. But there are issues that we need to address. There's 
no question. Any other closing comments, I would just suggest that, that we think about zoning, urban 
design guidelines for the back of these new expanded buildings. You probably don't want an 80-foot wall, 
which doesn't allow any light or minimal air to get in... We're basically going to create courtyards, with 
bigger buildings. So, what is that profile? And the other thing I would say is, I think this, especially when 
it's a two-tier wedding cake, three tier, I'm sorry two setbacks. The building in Harvard Square that has 
that fails urbanisticly. And I think there are key places, such as corners, where we might not want a 
setback. Could be, I'm going to be romantic for a moment. It could be a clock, but it could be an entry, the 
main entry below a pediment. That comes forward to add some urban interest instead of this constant 
setback. There are exceptions and very few, but there are some and, and that's beyond the zoning, but I 
hope we get into that. I do, I share everybody's enthusiasm for the effort for the result. And if we have 
questions or requests about the rent or whatever, don't take that as a super negative. It's just refining it.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:34:35   
Mr. Chair?

Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:34:36   
Yes, madam. Go ahead, Councillor. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:34:39   
Procedural question. Could you just, just for me, and perhaps my colleagues and those that are listening; 
procedurally, where are we at? We've had this meeting, what will be the next step? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:34:52   
Well, I was just going to talk about that. My own gut is there are, as much as we support it, there are still 
questions. And I would recommend keeping it in committee, getting the questions answered and then 
approving it earlier in the year, early in the year, but I'm open to other considerations. That would be my 
recommendation. I don't hear anybody else.  
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  2:35:22   
Are the question, Mr. Chair...I mean, I'm fine with, I mean, I have my questions about the cannabis piece 
and what, and what have you and that could be amended in Council [sic]. I do think the questions are 
significant. And I think there's a lot of agreement to the people, feel pretty positive. I'd be fine either way 
to move it out of committee tonight, but I'll, I'll go to, I'll yield to you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:35:41   
Council? So, there's two proposals, not motions, move it forward or leave it in committee. Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  2:35:52   
Well, we certainly asked a lot of questions and CDD asked some questions and Planning Board made 
some suggestions. So, it's not clear to me how you guys would figure out what the, what questions you're 
trying to answer and how you would change the draft. So, are you going to? Are you personally? Or is 
somebody going to work with staff to figure out how to. which things... I don't know. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:36:17   
Well, I think we want all the questions answered. And any inquiry? 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  2:36:24   
Well, then, or is somebody going to... Do you know what questions need to be answered? Because we 
asked a lot of questions. And a lot of them were sort of answered, but it's like, I don't know what... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:36:41   
We're going to get an answer from city staff, and then I'll go right to you, Councillor Simmons.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  2:36:47   
Thank you... I'm sorry. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would just say, there, there were some questions and 
we're happy to, I think we've done our best to provide answers to the questions that were asked this 
evening and if there's additional information, we can provide, we're always happy to do that. There are 
some matters raised in the Planning Board recommendation that I think were, should be taken as 
suggestions for the council to consider how, really as questions for the council to answer in terms of what 
direction they might want to take on, on certain aspects of, specific aspects of the petition. In, there were 
some changes also suggested by the Planning Board, which unless, and I think there was some discussion 
on some of them, but if the, if the council was in agreement, those could be could be drafted as 
amendments of the petition and then submitted back to the council. So there so there are some specific 
items that the Planning Board I think if could be endorsed in the Planning Board recommendation, and 
then we could work on drafting them. And then there are some other just general issues that are posed, I 
think for the council to consider and provide direction on.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:37:57   
Well, I would suggest set the meeting is G]going on to too long, I would suggest that you do it as a draft 
with a different color on it. And that's one of the things we would look at including the responses to the 
questions, or even the petitioner or the petition or team. petition team wanting to alter something. That's 
my recommendation. But you know, guys, I know it's late, but that's just my opinion. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:38:29   
Very quickly, Mr. Chair.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:38:31   
Yes. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:38:32   
I certainly do want to honor the work that has happened. I forgot what the term is, the Hatfields and 
McCoys. I don't quite get that. But I'm sure I will.  Two groups have come together and have worked over 
a long period of time to bring this forward. And so, I want to hear what the argument would be for not to 
move it forward. It sounds like it may be, I'm misunderstanding the CDD is saying, if it moves forward, 
we can still make the needed amendments and changes and still before the entire committee because the 
Ordinance committee like Council can meet as a whole. So, I don't know if [sic] of the Councillors, but I 
don't see anything wrong with moving it forward with a favorable recommendation because it's been so 
well vetted. And I don't think there are that many pieces that need to be made better, if you will. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:39:36   
Well, that's your opinion, and you're certainly allowed to offer that opinion. I would say this is not 
complete, and its zoning. And we just started the round. And we could have the meeting as early as we 
have our committee set. I don't Like moving zoning, personally, as someone who's worked on zoning and 
urban design and architecture, I don't like moving something forward to a meeting where there's 20 other 
items on the agenda, and then it never gets the full attention. This is what this committee is about, to get 
the full attention. And this has so many good things going for it, that if we can make it even better, and 
get responses to the planning Board comments, which we've only done, hit and miss, and get questions 
answered. It seems like a pretty quick meeting next time. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:40:43   
Mr. Chair, I'll yield to your planning and development expertise. I just want to be sure that we, just 
because we have a lot of time, we don't take it right down to the belt. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:40:56   
Okay, we just started the 90 days. Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  2:41:01   
I think, although I certainly understand that there's general agreement and that the questions seem not 
substantial enough to really hold it up. I think we should keep it in committee because we do have two 
new members. And I think for them, it would be probably better, as you say, to be discussing these things 
in the ordinance format, so that it's not part of a larger agenda and if they have additional questions 
about... because some of the questions are really policy decisions, we kind of, we have clarity on what 
things mean now, but now it's about like, well, what do we want to do? And I think they should have a 
voice on that. So, I think, when is the expiration date of this? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:41:45   
90 days from today.

Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  2:41:48   
Okay, that's January, February, sometime in March, mid-March. Okay, well, then I guess I would support 
leaving it in committee. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:41:59   
Yes, Ms. Farooq. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:42:02   
Mister... This does not illuminate the discussion but just a procedural cleanup thing. It would be very 
helpful for us if the committee would just officially ask CDD and law department to work with the 
petitioner to make the changes, to draft the changes based on the Planning Board's recommendations and 
the issues that were raised by the, the Ordinance committee today.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:42:30   
Mr. Chair?  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:42:33   
Pardon me. So, moved? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:42:36   
So, moved. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  2:42:37   
Yes, I do think it's interesting that we have to do that, but I get it. So, the motion is before us to have 
Community Development and the petitioner work together on answering the questions, making 
possible changes that incorporate the Planning Board comments. All those in favor say "aye". Oh, 
roll call. Roll Call.

Re: 

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition 

Overview 

This zoning petition by Suzanne P. Blier, et al., proposes several changes to the 
requirements of the Harvard Square Overlay District in Section 20.500. The stated intent 
of the proposed changes is to “gently increase density, reduce parking, increase housing 
viability, foster a balance between local and formula retail, and give renewed vibrancy 
to a retail destination that has been steadily declining.” The zoning petition stems from 
discussions by the Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee, which has 
been meeting over the past couple of years at the convening of the Cambridge Historical 
Commission (CHC). The petition is also supported by members of the Harvard Square 
Business Association and Harvard Square Neighborhood Association.  

The proposed changes fall into four overall topic areas: 

Changes related to development review procedures 

•  Revising the composition of the Harvard Square Advisory Committee and the 

conduct of its meetings. (Section 20.54.1) 

Changes related to parking and loading requirements 

•  Deleting the required payment for waiving required parking spaces when the 

Gross Floor Area (GFA) is the maximum allowed. (Section 20.54.4) 

Changes related to height and density 

• 

Increasing the maximum Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for residential uses in the 
Business B district from 3.0 to 4.0. (Section 20.54.6) 

•  Allowing further increases in FAR by Planning Board special permit. (new Section 

20.54.7) 

•  Allowing GFA exemptions for ground floor retail establishments of 1,500 square 

feet or less. (new Section 20.54.8) 

Changes related to retail and other ground-floor commercial establishments 

•  Expanding the range of retail uses allowed as-of-right or by special permit in 

• 

certain areas, subject to restrictions. (Sections 20.54.3 and 20.54.9) 
Limiting the street frontage allowed for banks, financial institutions, and 
cannabis retail stores. (new Section 20.54.9) 

This memo provides background information relevant to these proposals and discusses 
some issues to be considered in the Board’s deliberations.

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 
Harvard Square Overlay District 

Planning and Zoning Background 

The Harvard Square Overlay District (HSOD) was created in 1986 following a planning study that 
established development goals and guidelines for the area. As shown in the attached map, the HSOD 
encompasses several different base districts, which include higher-density business, office and 
residential districts within the core of Harvard Square as well as some moderate-density districts along 
the edges. As with all overlay zoning, the HSOD modifies the base zoning in specific ways to enable 
desired outcomes, providing more flexibility in some ways, and imposing additional limitations in others.   

In 2000, another study of Harvard Square was completed with the ultimate outcome of establishing a 
Neighborhood Conservation District (NCD), within which building permits for new buildings or 
alterations to existing buildings are subject to review by the CHC. While the NCD is jurisdictionally 
separate from the Zoning Ordinance, the 2000 study considered some zoning issues and resulted in 
amendments to the HSOD provisions. The boundaries of the NCD and HSOD are nearly the same, with 
some variations (see attached map). The aforementioned Harvard Square Conservation District Study 
Committee is in the process of completing an update to the 2000 study, discussed further below.  

The HSOD includes the following specific provisions and modifications to the base zoning. Most of the 
following provisions were included in the original zoning; provisions that were created in the 2000 
zoning amendment are noted. 

•  Development consultation by a Harvard Square Advisory Committee consisting of community 

members with a specified range of backgrounds and expertise. (Section 20.54.1) 

•  Building heights limited to 60 feet as-of-right or 80 feet by special permit, except where the base 

zoning has a lower height limit. (Section 20.54.2) 

•  Allowances for limited retail, business, and consumer service uses in office or residential base 

zoning districts. (Section 20.54.3) 

•  Allowed waiver of parking and loading requirements for uses in existing buildings, or otherwise 
by special permit from the Planning Board, in some cases requiring a payment in lieu of parking 
to a Harvard Square Improvement Fund. (Section 20.54.4) 

•  Allowed waiver of required yard setbacks for existing buildings, or for new buildings by special 

permit from the Planning Board. (Section 20.54.5) 

•  Modifications to the FAR limits in various base districts. (Section 20.54.6, created in the 2000 

amendment and summarized further in this memo) 

•  Some permitted variations from the signage requirements of Article 7.000. (Section 20.55.1, 

created in the 2000 amendment with the understanding that signage would be subject to NCD 
review procedures) 

Development guidelines for Harvard Square were established in 1986 after the creation of the HSOD and 
updated in 2002 following the creation of the NCD. These guidelines, which are referenced both in the 
zoning and the NCD bylaws, are intended to help guide growth and change in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District, both as new buildings are constructed and as old buildings are adapted to 
accommodate new uses.

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 
The HSOD is designated as an “Area of Special Planning Concern,” where development is subject to 
additional scrutiny. When the HSOD was adopted, few development projects were subject to review 
procedures. In the 1980s and 1990s, planning studies and special zoning resulted in the establishment of 
Areas of Special Planning Concern in which all projects above a certain size threshold would be subject 
to non-binding “Development Consultation” procedures. Harvard Square and Central Square have 
standing advisory committees for the purpose of conducting Large Project Review consultations as well 
as receiving, reviewing, and commenting on applications for special permits and variances to be heard 
by the Planning Board or Board of Zoning Appeal (BZA). 

In recent years, the role of the Harvard Square Advisory Committee (HSAC) has mostly involved review 
of Planning Board and BZA applications rather than conducting Large Project Review consultations. This 
is partly due to the Project Review Special Permit procedures adopted in 2001, requiring Planning Board 
approval of any development of at least 50,000 square feet. In addition, of the handful of major 
development projects reviewed in Harvard Square over the past decade or so, most have needed some 
form of zoning relief from either the Planning Board or BZA. The HSAC has also reviewed many 
applications for conditional use special permits or use variances for retail establishments (a major topic 
addressed by this petition and discussed further in this report). 

Another task assigned to the HSAC is to comment on the use of funding contributions made where 
parking requirements are reduced or waived by special permit. These contributions are relatively rare, 
as they are required only when new construction is proposed (existing buildings are exempt from 
parking as-of-right) that utilizes over 80% of the allowed development on a lot. Over the past 20 years 
only a handful of contributions have been required, which were used for streetscape and other 
improvements. The Harvard Square Improvement Fund currently contains $1,978,250 due to a recent 
payment made as a condition of the Abbot Building special permit. 

Recent Area Planning 

Beginning in 2017, the CHC has led a study committee for the Harvard Square NCD that is tasked with 
examining the goals, jurisdiction, and administration of the district. The study committee has drafted a 
report with its findings, which include revised goals, guidelines, and standards for review. The CHC 
hopes to submit a draft report to the Planning Board for comment early next year. As with the past NCD 
study, this report may lead to suggested zoning amendments and updates to the development 
guidelines referenced in zoning.  

Around the same time that the Conservation District study began, a group of Cambridge residents filed a 
zoning petition called the Kroon, et al., petition, that proposed amending some of the provisions in the 
Harvard Square Overlay District. The Planning Board endorsed the goals expressed by the petitioners but 
was concerned that the petition would not effectively achieve these goals. The Board recommended 
adopting some, but not all, provisions of the petition related to special permit review criteria, 
composition of the HSAC, uses of funds in lieu of parking, formula business regulations, standards for 
ground floor bank and office frontage, and exemption of below-grade GFA. The petition was placed on 
file in February 2018 with no action by the City Council.

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 
Envision Cambridge 

Unlike Central Square and Kendall Square, there has not been a recent comprehensive area planning 
study for Harvard Square. However, the recently completed Envision Cambridge citywide 
comprehensive plan includes many recommendations and actions that are relevant to Harvard Square 
and other mixed-use urban centers in Cambridge. The following is a summary of some of those relevant 
recommendations: 

• 

• 

• 

Incentivize the creation and preservation of affordable commercial space, including requiring 
small ground-floor commercial spaces that are aligned with business needs; 

•  Encourage a business climate that prioritizes local, independent businesses and enables 

inclusive entrepreneurship, including increasing density and use mix in targeted areas along 
Massachusetts Avenue to build the customer base for retail; 
Increase overall housing production, including changing zoning to enable more housing along 
major corridors and squares with good transit access; 

•  Adjust regulatory incentives and pricing of public assets like space for parking to limit 
unnecessary car trips and parking and to allocate public space effectively, including 
development impact fees proportional to a project’s trip generation to support multimodal 
infrastructure and safety improvements; 

•  Adjust land use policy to support sustainable transportation choices, including reducing 

maximum parking requirements in key squares like Harvard and lowering parking requirements 
citywide; 
Increase density near transit nodes while accommodating the unique character of our squares 
and areas along the corridors, including eliminating minimum parking requirements for 
development along corridors and allowing greater density near transit nodes; 

•  Preserve the historical integrity and diversity of Cambridge’s neighborhoods by adjusting zoning 
in residential districts to be compatible with prevailing patterns of development and protecting 
buildings in neighborhood conservation districts, and by ensuring new development reinforces 
and enhances the complex urban aspects of Cambridge as it has developed historically. 

Envision Cambridge also includes specific actions meant to encourage activity on the ground floors 
of new buildings, particularly along mixed-use corridors, including the following: 

•  Allowing the maximum height of mixed-use projects with active ground floor uses to be 
increased in order to achieve taller ground floor spaces that better support active uses; 
•  Establishing development standards to promote a continuous street wall on commercial 

corridors; 

•  Establishing development standards to promote street-activating uses (such as retail) on ground 
floors (e.g., minimum ground-floor heights, limitations on the frontage length occupied by 
lobbies and other non-active uses, standards for the frontage length of individual storefronts, 
requirements for smaller-sized commercial or community spaces in larger buildings); 

•  Prohibiting parking and vehicular loading and service between buildings and the street along 

mixed-use corridors and in major squares;

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 

•  Requiring primary building entrances to be located on the mixed-use corridors to create visual 
variety and to encourage the mixing of building residents, shoppers, and passers-by on the 
sidewalk; and 

•  Establishing design guidelines for all mixed-use corridors that include provisions for activating 
design elements along the street wall, such as signage, awnings, frequency of entrances, and 
breaks in the building façade. 

Envision Cambridge also recommends revising the development review process to be more transparent 
to developers and the public while striving for high-quality design. This includes updating area- and 
neighborhood-specific design guidelines to ensure that the urban design outcomes of new development 
complement the neighborhood context while also creating a more predictable review process for 
stakeholders and developers. 

Comments on Proposed Changes 

The petition proposes changes throughout Section 20.500, including modifications of existing provisions 
as well as the addition of new provisions. These provisions are detailed below and are grouped in the 
four categories identified above. 

Development Review Procedures 

The first change proposed by the petition is to include supporting local businesses as one of the 
purposes of the HSAC, which reflects community objectives and concerns raised in recent years. 
Specifically, the petition proposes a goal of achieving “a seventy percent local and non-formula retail 
experience throughout the district,” which roughly represents the current proportion of local businesses 
within the Harvard Square commercial area. Articulating district objectives in zoning is always helpful; 
however, in this case, it is complicated by the fact that zoning does not regulate businesses based on 
their owner/operator, but can regulate the characteristics of the land use and the design and 
development of buildings. It may be better to approach this objective by articulating a desire for a 
diverse and dynamic retail environment that promotes the unique historic character of Harvard Square 
and avoids creating a generic retail experience.  

The petition also proposes requiring the HSAC to meet on a monthly basis “or with as much frequency as 
is deemed required.” The HSAC currently meets on an as-needed basis and has met four times in 2019, 
three times in 2018, and nine times in 2017. On average, one to two cases are reviewed at each 
meeting. Requiring monthly meetings may not be necessary to carry out the purpose of the HSAC and 
could impose a burden on members. 

Other proposed changes largely focus on the HSAC membership, which is reduced to 11 members from 
13. These changes both broaden and specify the types of members to include specific groups like non-
formula business owners (the HSAC membership currently has some retail business owners) and 
commercial property owners (also currently represented) as well as subject-area experts like attorneys, 
urban planners, and architectural historians. Instead of referring to an institutional property owner, the 
petition specifically identifies a member from Harvard University.

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 
The zoning petition would also change the qualifying criteria for residents on the committee. The 
current membership is structured so that there is one resident from each of the five surrounding 
neighborhoods; the proposed petition would allow four residents from within half a mile of the HSOD 
without other limitations, with an additional member associated with the Harvard Square Neighborhood 
Association or a registered neighborhood group. It should be noted that there is no official registration 
process for neighborhood groups; such groups are usually independent from the City, and CDD only 
posts contact information on its web site for any group that requests such recognition. One recent issue 
with the HSAC is that it has been difficult to fill some positions based on the strict requirements for 
neighborhood distribution. Making the requirements more flexible could make it easier to fill positions 
but given the differences in resident demographics and population density, these changes could lead to 
uneven neighborhood representation.  

Overall, changes to the makeup and procedures of the HSAC can be made if desired, but it is worth 
remembering that the role of the HSAC is to provide advisory opinions and it is important for volunteers 
to feel that participation is worth their time. The challenge with advisory committees is to provide 
enough guidance to achieve the desired representation, but also not to be so inflexible or burdensome 
that potential members are unlikely to volunteer – an effect that can unintentionally lead to less 
diversity. 

Parking and Loading Requirements 

The petition proposes a significant change to parking and loading provisions in Section 20.54.4, which 
allow the Planning Board to waive parking and loading requirements through a special permit if 
development meets certain criteria. Under current zoning, to receive such a waiver the development 
must utilize less than 80% of the allowed development on a lot, or else the developer is required to 
make a cash contribution to the Harvard Square Improvement Fund equivalent to 50% of the 
construction cost of the off-street parking spaces that are waived. The Fund is used by the City to pay for 
capital projects related to public parking, open space, historic preservation, and transit-related public 
realm improvements. In 2018, the City conducted an analysis and estimated an average construction 
cost of $96,500 per parking space, so the required payment is $48,250 per waived off-street parking 
space when this provision is in effect.  

The proposed zoning largely maintains the current provisions but eliminates the requirement for a 
financial contribution when more than 80% of allowed GFA is used. This change would bring the 
provisions closer to Section 6.35.1, which allows a citywide reduction or waiver of required parking by 
special permit based on an analysis of the anticipated parking demand and alternative parking options. 
No prescriptive payments are required, but special permits may include conditions recommended by the 
Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department to mitigate the impacts of parking demand, such as 
investment in transportation demand management (TDM) programs, securing off-site parking, or other 
requirements. While allowing flexibility in meeting parking and loading requirements is consistent with 
area and citywide planning objectives, the petition does not specify any transportation-related 
mitigation or alternative ways that applicants can offset their impacts on parking, street, and curb 
demand in Harvard Square. Also, the petition would retain existing base minimum parking requirements 
that are higher than in Kendall Square and Central Square, where they were reduced.

1 Inclusionary Housing provisions allow a 30% FAR increase for developments with at least 20% Affordable Units, which is 
required for developments of at least 10 units or 10,000 square feet of residential use.  
2 Applicants may request a Special Permit from the Planning Board to increase the height to 80 feet if there is a 10-foot setback 
and a 45-degree sky exposure plane above 60 feet. 
3 For the O-2 and BA districts, the first number is for non-residential uses, the second number is for residential uses. 
 
The petition would increase the maximum FAR for residential development in the Business B district 
from 3.00 to 4.00 to be consistent with the maximum FAR established for non-residential development. 
The maximum residential FAR in Central Square was similarly increased through a zoning petition in 
2017, and the FAR limit of 4.0 is comparable to the maximum residential FAR in higher-density areas 
such as Kendall Square. The base zoning for the Business B district is a FAR of 2.75 for non-residential 
uses and 3.00 for residential uses.  

One of the most substantial proposed changes would allow the FAR for any use to be increased, without 
any explicit limitation, by special permit from the Planning Board provided that the use and design 
comply with the area guidelines. In such cases, the development scale and density would only be limited 
by the existing height and setback controls, which can also be modified by special permit based on 
overall conformance with the development objectives for the area. This kind of unrestrictive FAR 
provision does not exist elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance, though there has been discussion of zoning 
approaches that would limit development primarily based on height rather than density. The result of 
this proposal is that within most of the HSOD, virtually any construction within a height limit of 80 feet 
(about 6-7 stories above grade for typical residential or commercial construction, not including

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 
basement space) could be permitted if it adheres to the step-back standards and is found by the 
Planning Board to be in conformance with the design objectives for the area. 

This change could have significant effects on the character of new development in Harvard Square. 
Under current zoning, FAR is the most limiting factor for development since setbacks and height can be 
adjusted by special permit to create a reasonable building envelope for the limited FAR. Developers are 
also able to exempt basement space from GFA calculations and waive parking and loading requirements 
to maximize the development potential of a lot. For example, the Abbot Building project (PB-334) 
sought a special permit to increase the height to about 65.5 feet in order to achieve the maximum FAR 
of 4.0, while also seeking a special permit to exempt the basement space from the GFA calculation. 
These waivers enabled a development that included the preservation of an historic building with a 
rooftop addition, as well as some demolition and new construction. The proposed redevelopment of 10 
Church Street (former Harvard Square movie theater), currently before the Cambridge Historical 
Commission, also plans to seek a special permit to increase the height to 66’-10” to achieve the 
maximum FAR of 4.0 while exempting the basement from GFA calculations. 

While there could be a compelling rationale to adopt a strategy that is more dimensionally-based, where 
the major limiting factor to development is height rather than density, it should be acknowledged that 
such a change could significantly change how property owners view the value of their land, particularly 
for high-market-value uses such as commercial office or even laboratory space. In the BB district, a 
change from an FAR limitation of 4.0 to only a height limitation of 80 feet could result in a roughly 50-
75% increase in the amount of commercial floor area permissible on a lot, which could translate to 
greater market pressure to redevelop. If such a change is desirable, it is worth considering how the 
increase in development value could be leveraged to advance the City’s policy goals beyond general 
conformance with area guidelines, which would be required for any development subject to review. If 
more sites become seen as potential redevelopment opportunities, it could also result in greater tension 
with preservation objectives, though the NCD process and other historic protections would remain in 
place.  

The attached maps show the approximate existing FAR and height conditions for buildings in the HSOD, 
which may be helpful in assessing the potential effects of the proposed changes. 

Retail Exemption 

The petition proposes a GFA exemption for retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or less. A similar 
exemption was added to the Central Square Overlay District in 2017, though it is restricted to the 
Business B district. The reason for encouraging smaller spaces is that they tend to be more desirable to 
local businesses, although that is not always the case as some types of national businesses (such as 
mobile phone stores) might work well in smaller spaces, and some local businesses (such as restaurants) 
might need larger spaces. Currently, retail basements in all base districts can be exempt from GFA by 
special permit as long as they support the character of the neighborhood or district. If the intention is to 
specifically support ground-floor retail, then that should be clearly stated in the zoning text. It is also not 
clear if 1,500 square feet is an ideal target, given that current rental inquiries from local businesses 
indicate that spaces closer to 2,000 square feet may be desirable.

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 
As with all new zoning provisions, there is a risk of unintended outcomes. Staff from the CHC have 
expressed concern that this provision could incentivize the division of buildings that are not in keeping 
with the historical character of Harvard Square. This type of provision may be more appropriate for new 
buildings than for existing buildings. This could be addressed by setting standards for storefront sizes in 
new buildings while preventing incompatible alterations of existing buildings. These standards could also 
reference any conditions placed on a project by the CHC through a Certificate of Appropriateness. 

Retail and Other Ground-Floor Commercial Establishments 

Expansion of Allowed Retail Uses 

The HSOD contains several base zoning districts, some of which allow a broad range of retail uses and 
some of which prohibit retail uses even though there may be existing retail uses in those parts of 
Harvard Square. The current HSOD zoning allows some retail uses by special permit from the Planning 
Board in those office and residential districts where they are not otherwise allowed, with many 
limitations and conditions. Because the regulations for retail in the HSOD are layered and complex, the 
attached table created by CDD staff summarizes the overall effect of those regulations as they apply in 
different base districts. Staff also produced a similar chart summarizing how the petition might affect 
the overall range or retail uses allowed in different districts within the HSOD. 

The petition proposes allowing all uses currently allowed in the Business B district as-of-right in any 
office or residential district in the HSOD, as long as the building has a main entrance on Massachusetts 
Avenue, Mt. Auburn Street, Harvard Street, or Bow Street. The effect of these changes would make 
some existing retail uses conforming where they are currently not, which would give them flexibility to 
expand or change their use of space. It would also incentivize the growth of existing retail areas and 
could provide more, potentially lower-cost options to tenants who cannot afford a location on a more 
prominent street. Most of these areas already contain non-conforming retail uses; however, Harvard 
Street is predominantly residential and institutional within the HSOD, so it is less clear whether as-of-
right retail use would be appropriate there. It is also somewhat unclear how uses that are allowed only 
by special permit in Business B – for example, Commercial Recreation – would be treated in these 
locations. 

In addition to allowing retail uses as-of-right along these streets, the petition proposes changes to the 
uses that can be allowed by Planning Board special permit in residence and office districts, authorizing 
uses such as restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues as well as authorizing retail uses in Office 2 
and Residence C-2B districts, which cover some portions of Massachusetts Ave. 

The petition would also make Fast Order Food Establishments an as-of-right use throughout the HSOD if 
they do not meet the definition of a Formula Business. Fast Order Food Establishments are currently 
allowed by special permit from the BZA in Business A and Business B base zoning districts but are 
prohibited from receiving a special permit to operate in base residential or office districts.  These 
restrictions have been a concern for some time, because they have constrained opportunities for local 
businesses and other food-based business types. The requirements have been difficult to change 
because the concept of “fast food” carries the connotation of being generic, unhealthy and low quality, 
while the zoning definition of “Fast Order Food” includes a range of businesses serving prepared food

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition – Memo to Planning Board 
 
for quick service or take-out, including many unique, local establishments providing a range of food and 
beverages. A review of BZA cases in Harvard Square from 2013 to early 2019 shows that out of 18 Fast 
Order Food Establishment special permit cases, 9 were locally-owned business. This summary does not 
account for local businesses that might desire a location in Harvard Square but are not able or willing to 
engage in a special permit review process that might last 3-6 months or more and have an unpredictable 
outcome. In the past, representatives from the Harvard Square Business Association have specifically 
requested that the Fast Order Food Establishment special permit be removed. 

Limitations on Certain Retail Uses 

While the petition would expand the range of retail uses allowed throughout the district and thus create 
more opportunities for a more diverse range of retailers, it creates some exceptions for “Formula 
Businesses” as they were defined during the most recent zoning amendment for the Central Square 
Overlay District. Zoning cannot prohibit specific businesses or business owners, but can regulate the 
design characteristics of a use, building or site. Therefore, formula business regulations focus on 
characteristics of the use and design that might be considered “generic” in a way that would impact the 
character of the district as a whole. These standardized characteristics include signage, colors or 
architecture that are applied at multiple locations in many different places. Although community 
members tend to express a desire for unique, independent businesses in general, a Formula Business 
might still serve important community needs, such as providing affordable clothing, food, or family 
dining options. 

The current petition does not prohibit Formula Businesses in the Harvard Square Overlay District; 
however, it would restrict them from seeking a special permit in base residential and office districts, and 
Fast Order Food Establishments that qualify as Formula Businesses would continue to require a special 
permit. This approach is different from the special permit requirement in Central Square, and it is 
difficult to anticipate what the overall effects would be.  

Street Frontage Limitations 

The petition proposes limiting bank and financial institutions as well as Cannabis Retail Stores from 
occupying more than 20 feet of building frontage and 30% of a lot’s aggregate building frontage. A 
similar provision exists in Central Square, except that the frontage limit is set at 25 feet and authority is 
given to the Planning Board to issue a special permit for applicants that seek to exceed these thresholds. 
Banks are often seen as less active and tend to occupy large stretches of storefronts in prominent 
locations. As a result, the rationale for limiting their frontage in retail corridors is to allow necessary 
banking functions to take place without dominating the overall character of the streetfront. Since 
cannabis retailers tend to have visually-opaque facades, the rationale for limiting their street frontage 
would be to mitigate the impact of large expanses of visually inaccessible storefronts. 

As with all new zoning provisions, there is a risk of unintended outcomes. Here, there is a chance that 
instead of leasing space elsewhere, these businesses would choose to modify existing buildings to meet 
the requirements. As with the retail exemption, the CHC is concerned that property owners would 
artificially divide buildings in order to meet the requirement and suggests allowing flexibility in use and 
design for existing, historic buildings.

Individual buildings are labeled with the estimated
height of  the roofline of  the building.  This single

on the building, and does not account for the heights
of  multiple varied rooflines on a single building. 
All values are approximate.

December 11, 2019 
 
The Honorable Dennis J. Carlone 
The Honorable Craig A. Kelley  
Co-Chairs 
Ordinance Committee 
Cambridge City Council 
City of Cambridge 
795 Massachusetts Avenue 
Cambridge, MA  02139 
 
Dear Co-Chairs Carlone and Kelley, 
 
We are writing on behalf of Harvard University to support the proposed Blier, et al., Harvard Square 
Overlay Zoning Petition to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance.  
 
Harvard University has been inextricably linked with Harvard Square for nearly four centuries and is   
deeply committed to ensuring that Harvard Square remains a welcoming, dynamic and vital place for all 
who live, work, study, and visit.  Harvard shares the community’s interest in maintaining a unique retail 
environment in Harvard Square. Working with city government, civic leaders, residents, and the 
business community, we have demonstrated this longtime commitment in numerous ways, including 
making significant financial investments in the public realm and both preserving and creating affordable 
housing units in neighborhoods across the city.  Efforts also include sustainability programs and 
transportation efforts such as contributing funding to the regional BlueBikes bike sharing system.  Many 
of the local vendors benefit greatly from Harvard purchasing as well as the support from Harvard 
students, faculty, staff and visitors.  
 
In addition, this commitment is manifested in leasing practices at Harvard-owned properties, including 
long-time independent retailers such as Harvard Book Store, Leavitt & Pierce, Grolier Poetry Shop, and 
Club Passim.  These leasing practices continue in the new commercial tenants in the Smith Campus 
Center. Careful thought was put into choosing distinctive, locally-owned food venues that engage in 
sustainable practices and complement the existing mix of businesses in Harvard Square. 
 
For the past two years, representatives from Harvard University have been actively involved in the 
Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee, working alongside the broad set of stakeholders 
on recommendations to strengthen the vitality of the Square. The petition under review proposes 
updates to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance that will help to renew the retail vibrancy of the Square, 
address existing provisions that no longer serve the public good, and provide a more thoughtful 
approach to development. As a major affected landowner, Harvard agrees with the Petitioners that 
these new provisions will support positive changes to Harvard Square, as a “hub of tourism, business, 
university, and character.” Harvard University is pleased to offer our support of this petition.

The Ordinance Committee will meet to reconvene its hearing on the Harvard Square Zoning 
Petition. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  04:13 
Good evening, everyone. A quorum of the Ordinance committee being president I call tonight's 
meeting of Thursday, January 30, 2020 to order. The call of the meeting is that the Ordinance 
committee will meet to reconvene its hearing on the Harvard Square zoning petition. The... we 
will conduct this meeting as all other Ordinance committee meetings. First, we will hear from the 
petitioner... Oh, we're being audio and video recorded. Right. So, we, so this is a, so this is a 
continuation of the previous meeting where we recessed and public comment was closed, so 
there will be no public comment at today's meeting.  We will first hear from Mr. Barrett and then 
have some clarifying questions from councillors, then hear from the city, followed by some 
clarifying questions and then city council discussion. So, without further ado. Yeah, so we will 
go... when we get to the point of... CDD has made some proposed amendments and there's 
other amendments. So, when we get to that section, we'll, we'll, we'll go section by section and 
go through those. But first, I'll turn it over to Mr. Barrett. 
 
Patrick Barrett  05:47 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. City council today was my understanding that we would be spending 
some time looking through amendments that were born out of the Planning Board hearings that 
we had last year, as well as some recommendations that came about for the last Ordinance 
committee hearing. While I am not going to be walking people through my presentation that I did 
the first go round, I think it's important to highlight what changes we've sort of arrived at why we 
arrived at them and what their impact is to the overall petition. First and foremost, the bank 
regulations restrictions in Harvard Square that we had asked for a 20-foot limitation on the 
planning board felt as though that that was too restrictive. And that a something very similar to 
what was done in central square where banks were limited to 25 feet of total all ground floor 
frontage. And a 30% of the overall build, the building seems more reasonable. I think as far as a 
petition, position of the petitioner, I believe on both sides of the fence, whether it be the Harvard

Square business associates Or the Harvard Square neighborhood group. There's differences of 
opinion and how that should be perceived. I think this is an unusual scenario where I'm 
representing multiple groups, not my own opinions necessarily. But in terms of their 
understanding of these amendments, I believe that both groups felt as though these, that 
alteration was amenable. However, I think just to understand the impact that once we allow it, 
something to go under a special permit versus a variance, it does give a broader opportunity for, 
for things to go by that they may wish to prevent.  
 
Patrick Barrett  07:48 
I think, given the fact, and I say this is an overarching theme to the entire petition, the fact that 
we have a conservation district with very significant guidelines and that projects are to receive 
something called a certificate of appropriateness for the district that those controls would 
probably be enough to eliminate the more egregious spaces. I will note that in our last meeting, 
we've had several, not several, had two property owners really come with opposition to this one 
piece in terms of it being a variance or a special permit. And that was predominantly because 
they have large frontages that they wish to put banks in which, again, this is kind of what we're 
trying to put the brakes on. And for the only real reason in this will, I'll pivot to cannabis retail in 
a second, to liven up the streetscape. I think the every time Harvard Square kind of pops up in 
the news. It's always about a closure. It's always about something, at least the past six months. 
I think the perception doesn't necessarily match with the reality I think Harvard Square still a 
vibrant, bustling district but banks are predominant presence in the landscape. And that was 
what this is trying to do. To... I think that there is consensus among the groups that willing to 
accept the amendment as proposed by CDD. But I believe that's at the pleasure of the council.  
 
Patrick Barrett  09:16 
Pivoting to cannabis retail. And this was something that the Planning Board felt very strongly 
about was somewhat of a step too far. And predominantly as it related to equity issues. It's 
unfortunate that the state guidelines are what they are. But it's the same that applies to 
everywhere else in the district. I think that, again, I can't speak for the Harvard Square 
neighborhood group and the Business Association even though I'm their conduit here. I think 
that the Harvard Square Business Association is somewhat agnostic in that, in this, in this 
provision of being stricken from the ordinance where the Harvard Square Neighborhood 
Association would prefer to remain intact. If to prevent the proliferation of basically dead spaces 
in the streetscape. The particularly egregious part of that, and I think, I think the real reason why 
I was comfortable in drafting it this way. The current guidelines for E applicants that don't have 
the restriction for buffer zones creates the possibility even the unlikely outcome because there's 
a host agreement, there's still a special permit that they're required to get for the use entirety, 
that multiple stores could take, you know, entire streets away from the ground floor. It seems an 
unlikely outcome and to me, but as the zoning is currently written, that's what would allow for, 
but that's a different issue and not addressed here. As it pertains to the amendment to strike this 
provision. We largely are, I think, we support it and we're against it.  
 
Patrick Barrett  10:52 
Other changes that have been made by the Planning Board and CDD has codified are more 
semantic. I had forgotten to put Arrow street for instance, as a street that was supposed to... I 
had forgotten. I had it in my presentation, but embarrassingly, it was not in my language when I 
presented. In [sic] they struck Harvard street from the expansion of commercial uses on the 
ground floor. We largely agree with all of that. I think the general provision has always been 
there, that it, by a special permit, those uses are allowed anyway, we just allow for some of 
these things to spread into the districts where they currently already are, without as much red 
tape and really only for non-formula businesses, which is really the key to this were trying to

expand the commercial footprint to allow for commercial uses. In areas that by definition will be 
less price per square foot will provide more opportunities for small and local retailers because 
the footprints are much smaller anyway. It doesn't change the character of the residential or 
office district they're already and so I think its kind of an interesting side note to say that res... 
commercial uses, retail uses are not currently allowed at the base of an office building which 
just seems to not make much sense. 
 
Patrick Barrett  12:15 
But you know, Cambridge zoning has evolved over time and a lots of things that are where they 
are for different reasons. And we've changed the zoning to the point where sometimes it's hard 
to trace back why, why things are that what they are. The last bit, I believe those are the biggest 
amendments they put forth. I think the rest of it is all more language to explain the desire of the 
council or desire at the Planning, desire the Planning Board in terms of what the 
recommendations were, I believe Councillor Carlone has some other recommendations he 
plans to bring forward. Which we're open to, I think by and large, this entire process has been 
one of communication and transparency, so we'd like to keep, maintain that. I'm happy to 
answer any questions about what's out there right now, if anyone has any. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  13:09 
Thank you. Pleasure of the committee. Any questions for Mr. Barrett? Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  13:15 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Just for clarification, Mr. Barrett. The proposal to go up to 80 feet and 
maxing out the density is truly subject to the guidelines. The package by the, for the 
Conservation District and subject to the Planning Board's overview with the Historical 
Commission is throughout the whole district, even where there is a lower density zone.  
 
Patrick Barrett  13:56 
So, where the base zoning says that there's a height limitation, you start with the base zoning 
districts height limitation. It's always the lesser number, a... the by right high in the BB district of 
Harvard Square 60 feet.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  14:10 
Yes.  
 
Patrick Barrett  14:11 
The special permit height, you need to get the extra 20 feet, you need a special permit for that 
as well. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  14:15 
Yes. 
 
Patrick Barrett  14:16 
So, to answer your question the height doesn't change by way of this petition. It's exactly as it 
currently is in the zoning. The ability to realize that height through a special permit of increased 
FAR is the only real adjustment. So, where the zoning height is 45 feet, you would still be at 45 
feet. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  14:35 
And additional height would be...

Patrick Barrett  14:39 
Only in that scenario. Actually, for a non, for a non-BB district property would be a variance. You 
wouldn't be... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  14:46 
Okay. Okay, that I just want to say that was not clear and that relieves some of my concern. A 
lot of my concern. 
 
Patrick Barrett  14:56 
Clarity is not where our ordinance excels. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  14:58 
Yes, I, I agree. But it might be a good idea that we summarize that. This is where I'm not saying 
you do, but in the city's efforts, this is what's existing. With the overlay doing... based on your 
proposal, these are of the new heights, and the ones. 
 
Patrick Barrett  15:18 
Well, I just took a point of clarification. I think that new height is not the correct way to describe 
that because... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  15:26 
Maximum heights. 
 
Patrick Barrett  15:27 
Okay, well, we're not really changing the height. Right? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  15:30 
That needs to be clear. That's all I'm getting at. It, when I read it, and I've actually asked other 
people their opinion, they thought, indeed, we could go up to 80 feet in the C-2 ,the C-1, 
whatever the districts are. And the fact that you can't, based on your opinion, and hopefully the 
city's, as I said, that makes me feel better about this proposal it That was my major concern. 
 
Patrick Barrett  16:03 
I would, I would offer even further that if it's just, if it's deemed that there is a loophole that I can't 
quite perceive that would allow for this. It is the intent of this petition this only to be realized in 
the BB district of the Harvard Square overlay. That was my understanding of the base height 
requirements in the zoning itself and that we revert back to the base for all the existing districts, 
that the BB alone allowed for the increased height. Similar to actually Central Square. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  16:35 
Just bear with me, Mr. Chair. [sic] I'll stop there. I think there was another question, but I can 
bring it up later. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  16:47 
Councillor Mallon. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  16:50 
Thank you, Mr. Chair through you to Mr. Barrett. I just want to clarify something on 20.54.3 at 
one of the uses that is not allowed is a cannabis retail store, is that correct?

Patrick Barrett  17:07 
This refers to the section of the ordinance that allows for the expansion of commercial uses in 
the non-business district, residential and office. Currently, as it is written that cannabis retail 
business would not be allowed in that district, based on this change. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  17:24 
And just to clarify, the entire district or just part of the district. 
 
Patrick Barrett  17:29 
Just, just the residential and office district. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  17:34 
And I'm looking at a zoning map. Is there something specific I should be looking for? When I'm 
looking? 
 
Patrick Barrett  17:40 
I don't know what map you're looking at. Is it in my packet here because I don't have a map with 
me? There's, there's a residential there's, the center... the Harvard Square overlay?  
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  17:53 
Yes. 
 
Patrick Barrett  17:53 
Is comprised of BB zones. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  17:55 
Correct.  
 
Patrick Barrett  17:55 
Residential zones and office zones. The expansion of commercial uses only applies to the 
residential and office district where they curr... not currently, not allowed. In the criteria of 
restricted uses in that section. There's a lot, there was a laundry list of things you can do. 
Ranging from... 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon  18:13 
I see them.  A massage establishment also. 
 
Patrick Barrett  18:15 
Yeah, yes, exactly. I think mortuary is one of them. And amongst those restrictions, we've 
included cannabis retail. The reason for that was the, the group's felt as though that opening up 
the ability to allow for retail in these districts presented an opportunity for small local retailers 
that otherwise wouldn't be able to pay a higher rental amount to get into. And that if we allowed 
for cannabis retail to enter these zones, they're able to pay almost the equivalent of what banks 
pay, in terms of price per square foot and that even an EE applicant or a group like that would 
still, would outmatch and outpace those kind of retail opportunities. And that given the likelihood 
that there's probably not going to be more than two or three cannabis retail spaces in Harvard 
Square, there's two now and maybe there's a third one on its way. That this seemed like a 
decent enough carve out for those other retailers that once, you know a [sic] closes or these 
other small places close that there are opportunities that are really exclusive to them.

Councillor Alanna Mallon  19:26 
So, thank you. So, okay, so in the BB districts, they will be allowed. I think we're in a very 
unchartered territory with cannabis locations since there's slated to be four in Central square at 
this moment.  
 
Patrick Barrett  19:39 
That is correct.  
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  19:39 
So, I think saying that two is probably the cap and Harvard Square, we don't know that. 
 
Patrick Barrett  19:44 
We don't know it. I'm just saying that I think there's two now there might be a third one in the 
way. I don't know the exact count. But what I do know is that when you're talking about the 
competitiveness between a, call it a hard retail use, versus a Cannabis retail or a bank, it's very 
difficult for them to compete for those kinds of spaces. And as a landlord, you will probably 
always try to grab the highest and best paying tenant in that by allowing for the residential and 
office zone to restrict cannabis retail, you open up the opportunity for smaller retailers to actually 
have enough to be able to not be out priced. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  20:26 
Okay, thank you. That's all for now. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  20:29 
Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  20:32 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Is this the amended language that's before us? 
 
Patrick Barrett  20:37 
So, what has been presented to you from the CDD is a memo that codifies by way of individual 
amendment, each section that the Planning Board and that the Ordinance committee, through 
our last discussion arrived at as potential changes to the ordinance. So, there is no complete 
document right now where you have a sort of like a selection of things that were highlighted as 
amendments to this zoning petition that everyone agreed on and the Planning Board or either 
everyone agreed on or the Planning Board recommended. And the position of both the Harvard 
Square neighborhood group and the Harvard Square Business Association, is that they will 
follow the will of the Planning Board. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  21:20 
So, you're planning to submit a new amended petition. 
 
Patrick Barrett  21:25 
This petition is currently in the hands of the Ordinance committee. And if the ordinance 
committee by way of a vote may amend it now. I am not able to amend the petition any further. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  21:37 
So let me, Clerk and I consulted. So, what we're going to do once we get through this round of 
questions here from the city, get through that we're going to go through section by section and 
adopt, or not, the amendments that are in this, in this document.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  21:53 
Right, so I guess, I guess there's a point of order. I'm still confused. What amendments? Do we 
have amendments before us? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  22:03 
So, the amendment in the, in the, in the documents page in the packet, I guess its page 24 
starts on, and this is the... from Ms. Farooq. What you see highlighted in gray are the changes. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  22:32 
Right. So, this is an amended petition? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  22:35 
Mr. Clerk. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  22:38 
Through the Chair. What you have before you in your agenda packets are, number one, the 
original petition and then starting on page 24 is the submission from CDD, a communication 
from the community development department regarding recommended changes of language 
from that department. My understanding of, from having discussed this with the chair is that at 
the conclusion of hearing from the petitioner, and then hearing from representatives of the city, 
the city council will then go through the documents starting on page 25 section by section, and 
then will be voting on whether or not to adopt those language changes.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  23:18 
Got it. Thank you. So, you mentioned the 20-foot frontage for banks, but that's still in here. 
 
Patrick Barrett  23:29 
So, the, I guess it... 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  23:33 
Into the mic. 
 
Patrick Barrett  23:34 
Yeah, I'm on the page. So, on page 233. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  24:02 
Right. 
 
Patrick Barrett  24:03 
You have the section 20.54.9 which has the section that we offered as part of the amendment 
stricken through. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  24:16 
Got it and then  
 
Patrick Barrett  24:19

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  24:20 
Right. And then on the cannabis retail store. So, this is back to Councillor Mallon's question, just 
so I understand the, if you didn't have this restriction, would cannabis retail store be allowed in 
this zone or not? 
 
Patrick Barrett  24:45 
In the residential and office district, I believe they are not allowed. It's only in the BBB A's one 
through three. This restriction is duplicative and probably more of a reminder than an actual 
significant change to the district by it removed it, it would have almost no impact. If the law were 
to be amended down the road, cannabis retail, we expanded it to different kinds of districts, like 
I think Office 1 is kind of a curious one. Because to me office, an office district and a business 
district, to me are almost indistinguishable. And I think by and large from our planning and 
Envision, and any of the report we've done, mixed use seems to be the direction we're headed. 
But if those things were to change, that the overlay remained the same, that this provision would 
be helpful. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  25:44 
Right. Just so I'm clear, as it's currently written, it's not an additional restriction, in fact. Thank 
you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  25:57 
Any further questions for Mr. Barrett?  Yes, in the I'm sorry, I do have one in. And that's helpful. 
Because I was concerned about that restriction on cannabis as well. I'm, we're going to get into 
comments later and things. So, I have a little bit to say about that. But in that same section are 
we, are banks going to be not allowed and in that area?  
 
Patrick Barrett  26:25 
So financial institutions as a use in their residential or office district, I believe in residential, they 
are definitely restricted in office use. I'd have to refer to my, my good friend Jeff Roberts. I 
believe they are also restricted. This was... the bank provision is really for the areas where is 
currently allowed. So, like I don't... there's no you still need a variance to have a bank and an 
office in a residential district, which it seems unlikely something that anyone would issue. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  26:56 
So, okay, so we can maybe find out from Mr. Roberts Because if again, if the goal... 
 
Patrick Barrett  27:02 
Yeah. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  27:03 
If the concern is cannabis is going to be able to pay more per square foot for rent, therefore, we 
should take this special, you know, action. 
 
Patrick Barrett  27:10 
Right. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  27:10 
The same would be true about banks. And so...

Patrick Barrett  27:12 
I think in there in the, the residential and the office district because they are operating within the 
overlay. I like just to make things as clear as I could possibly make them in terms of what's 
allowed and what's not allowed. So, I think by enumerating the use, you make a very clear 
distinction, even if at some point in time, someone were to seek a variance for say that there's 
actual explicit exclusion for that use is a pretty compelling argument as to why they should not 
be issued. In the terms of financial institution. I think I'm less concerned about a group bringing 
a variance to a residential district for a bank ever being pushed through the BZA versus 
cannabis retail. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  27:53 
So, so if we if we specifically. If we specifically saying, no cannabis in that, in that part of the 
district and no banks? Are there other businesses that would, could pay a higher, for rent per 
square foot that we also have to? I mean, it seems like, it seems like, it seems like there's a few 
things in here that are specifically going after cannabis in particular, which I don't think is right. 
But I mean, what... Are there other types of businesses that, if the, if the reason is, oh, they can 
pay more per square foot and by excluding them we lift someone who can pay less, have an 
opportunity. What other industries should we be... 
 
Patrick Barrett  28:36 
So, I also included a catch all, formula businesses are also prohibited from going into the 
residential and office district. While I can't predict what is today or tomorrow, it seems that a 
formula business regulation restriction for this particular district is appropriate for a bunch of 
different reasons. One is yes, they will be able to outpace our local retailers and people who are 
not our non-formulaic businesses. And two, in terms of keeping with look and feel and 
represent... and respecting the residential aspect of this, I think there's something to be said for 
design controls. That's really all formula business regulation is. It's not like you can say, you 
know, Dunkin Donuts, you can't come here, you just have to say, Dunkin Donuts, you can come 
here, but you have to look like you fit into the district. It seemed appropriate to put that caveat in 
there because the formula business regulations in Massachusetts don't really have much teeth. 
They just are design guidelines essentially designed to give larger corporate entities who have a 
more difficult time adjusting to require changes. You know, they see the opportunity but to put 
them on a different path than say a local retailer who is likely to fit into the space. Also bear in 
mind That it's in the Harvard Square overlay, still has to deal with the other layers of regulation. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  30:07 
Thank you. Further questions for Mr. Barrett at this time? Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler.  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  30:11 
Thank you. Where did the petition land with removing the required payment for weaving parking 
and loading requirements? 
 
Patrick Barrett  30:18 
So, the CDD memo that was sent to the Ordinance committee and to the council, I think is been 
left to the pleasure of the council. In terms of Harvard Square in Central Square, the only 
districts that have this provision, it doesn't really serve the intended purpose. It certainly doesn't 
comport to, at least our modern understanding of where urban planning is going. And that, 
really, it's up to the council to decide whether this is an appropriate provision they would 
maintain, whether it's actually doing what it's supposed to do. Or if it's just another layer of 
prohibition on development that makes it more problematic than not. In terms of, I think that's 
what that's how they left it in the memo. Between the groups, I think what I would say amongst

the neighborhood group and the Business Association, that the document itself represents, at 
least from between my apart over a year of tedious negotiation and discussion with the 
conservation district and what people would find appropriate. And that each piece of this 
represents a little give and take between all the groups. And that the reason why our hearings 
have gone the way they have in terms of there's been very little outcry, very little condemnation 
of this because that work had been done prior. And that, by and large, each piece of this is 
important to a certain group of people and that together the document represents that 
negotiated work and that pieces are pulled apart, then doesn't really come accomplish the goal? 
I think like I told the groups in part in Central square, ages ago it seems now. That the zoning 
really isn't the piece that gets us to a better place to Harvard Square, it's the culture and that by 
doing this like we didn't Harvard, Central Square and we need to do a lot more in Central 
Square, by the way began to change that allowed us to do things like we did in Central Square. 
And we see the positive impacts with that is the hope that this process does something similar. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  32:32 
Anything for Mr. Barrett? Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:36 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I found the... I have the old... On page 13 of the new package tonight. 
Under the last at the bottom it says additional FAR. And this is what confused me, and I'll read 
it. It short. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit granting authority may 
increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot located within the Harvard Square 
overlay district. Well, that includes multiple zoning districts, for any residential use in Section 
4.31, or any commercial use section 4.34, 4.35 provided the use and design complies with the 
goals and the design guidelines set forth and the Harvard Square Conservation District. So, as I 
read that, and it might be a misquote, that says any district and not what I thought you said 
earlier and what you said earlier, I totally agree with. That it shouldn't be the buffer zones, at 
least at that height may be modified height. 
 
Patrick Barrett  33:56 
What page are you on? I'm sorry. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  33:58 
In the package, just say handed out. The black and white package. It's page 13. Page nine of 
your submittal but it's page 13 in the big package. Lower right-hand corner says 13. it's 20.54.7. 
And reading that, that's different than what we discussed a moment ago and why I was 
confused. 
 
Patrick Barrett  34:30 
No and I know, No  I can see why you are confused because I think that the intent of this was to 
caps... encapture the allowed uses within the districts themselves. And that I might be I might be 
leaning a little too heavily on Charlie here in terms of reliance.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  34:49 
No, this says, FAR... 
 
Patrick Barrett  34:54 
It says FAR but I also have the sit... you know complies the goals and design guidelines [sic]. I 
think it is important for clarity to specify that this belongs exclusively in the BB district.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  35:09 
Thank you. I agree. And I thought that's what you said earlier. And I wanted to clarify. 
 
Patrick Barrett  35:15 
That's the intent. That's how it was. That's how it came about its not intended to pierce those 
other districts. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  35:21 
So, if I could continue, Mr. Chair? The retail exemption for ground floor retail, I can't agree more 
with this than anything else in here. I agree with that approach. But if you're in the BB district, it 
doesn't really mean much. Unless as we, you and I discuss we make it a criteria that, to what 
extent are there small-scale retail spaces on the first floor for the Planning Board and, for that 
matter, Historical Commission to approve it? 
 
Patrick Barrett  35:58 
This was a tricky provision Include into this package because Harvard Square is, like all 
Cambridge, unique. The overlay itself, the map is difficult to work with. It's a very amorphous 
large space that covers multiple zones, unlike Central Square, which is essentially a corridor. I 
think, Charlie, I think the first concern raised by historical is what happens as people try to chop 
up storefronts and how do we prevent this from happening? Some of the recommendations in 
the business association was that we use linear footage as opposed to actual square footage 
space.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  36:35 
I agree with that.  
 
Patrick Barrett  36:36 
I'm not, I don't agree or disagree. I think that's a fine way to delineate in terms of its impact, 
because this is a provision that sort of encompasses the overlay. I kind of like to give, at least 
when I, when I recommend different zoning to different groups of people and they're trying to 
create a different form for an area, multiple options, multiple directions that could take a project 
to allow for them to achieve the intent. This ground floor retail exemption has worked, so far 
pretty well in Central Square. I see it having a similar impact in Harvard Square. But again, I 
don't know, I don't know exactly how that's going to turn out. The again, the only thing that really 
give me any kind of solace in any of this was that we have multiple levels of engagement in 
terms of certificates of appropriateness being given by the Historical Commission and other 
layers of review that they'd have to go through before they actually wound up at the Planning 
Board. 
 
Patrick Barrett  37:36 
But in terms of the BB district, there will be, there'll be, there will be buildings that are already 
non-conforming, that are already maxed at the FAR where this provision could help 
immeasurably. In terms of getting you out, getting yourself out of a variance and into a place of 
compliance. How, again like this is a little bit unpredictable in terms of how that will be used. But 
I think given the fact that we do have that review piece from the Historical Commission, you're 
not going to see someone present to you a proposal where they're cutting a window and half in 
order to make this work.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  38:18 
Is it, was it primarily for 0-2 district and the... I dawned on me that it could be beyond the BB 
were its...

Patrick Barrett  38:28 
I wanted it to apply to all districts because I think especially in the "res" an 0-2 district where you 
have less form, that that flexibility might be much more useful because those buildings to would 
also be non-conforming. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  38:39 
Great. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  38:41 
Thank you. If there's nothing further from Mr. Barrett, don't go anywhere though, we'll ask the 
city to come up and to present. You might want to stay there in case... He's on the bench? 
Okay. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  39:07 
Mr. Chair could we have Mr. Sullivan join the table. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  39:10 
Absolutely anyone from... 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  39:24 
Thank you, Mr. Chair.  
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  39:26 
Your batting leadoff Mr. Roberts? 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  39:28 
I'm going to kick it off. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Jeff Roberts, Director of zoning development since 
the, this is the second hearing on this, since the previous hearing, our team worked on doing a, 
in the material you have which you've been talking about a little bit for the past little while, I'll try 
to present. it incorporates the, first, on the first page of summary of some of the discussion that 
occurred at the last meeting, which lays out some of the broader issues that the Planning Board 
suggested in their recommendation but didn't necessarily have specific recommendations 
about. And then on the following pages, the zoning text, which if you look at that particular 
document, you'll see that what we've attempted to do is to take the zoning, the text of the 
original zoning petition, which was shown as a unformatted document, and show that in a 
markup format, so that it's possible to see where the original petition amends the current section 
20.50 for the Harvard Square overlay district. And in addition to those changes from the original 
petition shows the changes that were recommended by the planning board, so You see all the 
changes together in one document and if you have keen eyesight, you would see that the 
original petition changes either have a single underline or a single strike through and additional 
changes from the Planning Board have a double underline or a double strike through. Hopefully 
that's readable in your version. Just stepping back a second, I wanted to make one note one 
things is the first ordinance committee meeting of the year. Often in the past, I've referred to our 
team working on these things, and I'm often just referring to myself but I actually have with me, 
some members of my team that I just introduced quickly, so Sarah Scott, in in the red, you've 
seen before and she's been doing a lot of the work on this petition and more recently, Daniel 
Messplay to her right is senior zoning manager. So, I'm no longer just referring to myself. The... 
so with that, back to this document, so just to very quickly walk through, again, some of these 
are changes that you've already been discussing. But to go through them a little bit more 
thoroughly. On... And you'll have to excuse me, I don't have the same packet you have in front

of me, but I have the document that we numbered is page one to 10 through page 10 to 10. Is 
that does that appear on your version? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  42:32 
So, Mr. Roberts here's, see what my colleagues think, as opposed to you going through... we're 
going to go through all of these amendments anyway because we have to vote on them. Maybe 
we should and maybe have Mr. Barrett get back to the table and we should just start going 
through them. If people have questions about them then you can explain them having you go 
through them once and then us go through them again. Seems... kind of seems... 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  43:01 
At your disposal Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  43:02 
Folks feel about... any issues with that? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  43:07 
Okay, so why don't, why don't we Why don't we do that and then we can take, then people can 
just ask questions as we go through. So, I'm sure there's a lot of these are going to be pretty 
simple and some will be more complicated. So, if we turn to page one, packet, packet, page 25 
at section 20.51. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  43:37 
The, the changes that are being recommended is to strike the word "and" after "Harvard Square 
overlay district", and then after "Harvard Square Historic overlay district" add, ", and Harvard 
Square Conservation District goals and guidelines", excuse me, and this was suggested by the 
Historical Commission staff that noted the goals as well as the guidelines of the Conservation 
District should be referenced. Is there any question as to why that change was made or any 
issue with that, or can we vote that now? Okay, good. Do you have a question? No. So on 
adoption of those amendments, all those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes 
have it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  44:34 
Hold on one second. 
 
Patrick Barrett  44:38 
Mr. Chair? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  44:38 
Mr. Barrett. 
 
Patrick Barrett  44:41 
In our discussion, Councillor Carlone and I discussed an amendment that is not currently in this 
packet. I think it's an important one... 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  44:51 
Is, is it next I mean, I'm going to [sic] when I get to it speak up, jump up and down, raise your 
hand? Okay. So, then the next amendment is on the page 26, 20.53.3 and it comes in 2, under 
2(B) at the end, "significant building as defined by the City of Cambridge demolition ordinance" 
and this is striking number 965. On adoption. All those in favor say "aye"? Those opposed 
"nay"? The ayes have it.

Councillor Marc McGovern  45:31 
We now go to 20.54.1 (C) and this is to add, add "C" and it reads "to support local businesses 
and uses that enhance the vibrancy and historical nature of Harvard Square with the 
aspirational goal of maintaining a 70% local and non-formula retail experience throughout the 
district". Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  46:01 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I don't know if this number is ground floor, or this is district wide. The 
garage, of course says small retail on the second level. It's wonderful. But it seems to me the 
public domain is the key. And if this percentage is different, and I know people know what that 
percentage is, maybe not right now, it should be the ground floor and adding the words "at 
ground floor". 
 
Patrick Barrett  46:31 
To... 
 
Patrick Barrett  46:34 
Through you, Mr. Chair. I have absolutely no objection to that, the only thing that I would point 
out is that currently the Harvard Square overlays around 70% non-formulaic retail and the 
distinction really comes as a part of the advisory board’s recommendations. So even though we 
have these provisions in here, the advisory board is, their opinions are advisory in nature, they 
can only give guidance to the Planning Board. The only real reason they ever come up is when 
the Planning board Disagrees with the findings of the advisory board. But to your point, it fully 
comports with the intent. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  47:13 
So, Mr. Chair, I, if I could continue I, I think the aspiration is true, but it might be good to know 
what the actual ground floor may be in parentheses as a guide, and I'm guessing it's close to 
that but it, it is that public edge that most people see, we want them to go into the garage, but if 
they don't know it they won't go in, but and that... it's a minor thing, but I would add, make sure 
to get that information at ground floor. 
 
Patrick Barrett  47:48 
So, is the suggestion to change from 70% ground floor local and non-formulaic retail 
experiences? Yes. I have no objection. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  47:59 
So, your... I'm going to go to Councillor Siddiqui in a second.  So Councillor Carlone you're 
amending... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  48:05 
Yes, I am. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  48:05 
Tell me where and what exactly. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  48:07 
Just Mister... Mr. Barrett's back mentioned maintaining... Well, I would put it at the end 
throughout the district under C, "at the ground floor level" at the end of that sentence.

Councillor Marc McGovern  48:25 
Okay. Councillor Siddiqui. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  48:30 
Mayor, sorry.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  48:33 
Sorry. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  48:34 
No worries. No worries. So, this is something I had a question about.  When I read to support 
local businesses, where are we define local, right, I think what I'm confused by is, where's that 
definition coming from and how are we defining it? Where is it somewhere did, I miss it? 
 
Patrick Barrett  48:55 
So right now, we don't define local as much as we defined formula ,formulaic. So, in the 
definition of Formula it references national, things like that. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  49:07 
Okay, just want to be clear because we, there's so much stuff that's thrown away, thrown out 
about chains and even small business. What a small business can be. I could you know, you 
can have up to 500 employees, right, there's all these different decisions. So, I just wanted to... 
 
Patrick Barrett  49:23 
Unfortunately, in zoning, it's a thin line to start pointing out local retail specifically. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  49:31 
Okay. Thank you. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  49:33 
Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  49:35 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Through you. I guess I don't quite understand the point of adding this 
language. I mean, what, what happens if the district it goes down to 50% local and non-formula 
is however we define that, what would this accomplish? 
 
Patrick Barrett  49:54 
So, the advisory board itself provides a report to the Planning Board. The Planning Board then, 
as it's written in zoning is supposed to look at this report, say that the district was... had declined 
to less than they desired. That the advisory committee's recognition of this and they're either, I 
guess in this case, let's say they disapprove of the project, the Planning Board can look at the 
special permit criteria. And typically, 10.43 there's somewhat broad parameters that can fulfill to 
you know we think the language will usually be granted. But in this case, they can look at their 
advisory board recommendations and say, Oh, we are not fulfilling the goals, this comes as a 
negative recommendation, they can use that opinion to essentially reject a special permit. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  50:48 
Okay, so first, we need to vote on Councillor Carlone's amendment which is to add after at the 
end after "district", "at the ground floor level". All those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". 
The ayes have it. Now on the... adding C as amended. All those in favor say "aye". Those

opposed "nay". The ayes have it. Next is very simple, hopefully, it's just changing C to D since 
we added a new, a new section. All those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes 
have it. We now move down to number two in that section. And the amendment is to strike, 
"may wish to receive advice and recommendations". And then to add, "has planned for the 
overlay the committee shall meet on an approximately monthly basis or with as much frequency 
as", strike "deemed required", add "needed", "to address pertinent issues in the Harvard Square 
overlay district with the schedule to be determined at the discretion of the chair". This was 
requested... put forward by the Planning Board. Mr. Robert. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  52:11 
I think this is the first point I'll just sort of jump in to briefly explain that there was a, the 
amendment in the original petition, the Planning Board commented that it didn't seem clear 
exactly how the schedule would be determined. And so they recommended it be modified so 
that it would be clear that there's an approximate sense of when the meeting would meet, but to 
make it clear who would be determining the schedule and in this case, we suggested that the 
chair should be the final say on when the committee would meet. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  52:45 
Any questions? Seeing none, all those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay" the ayes have 
it. We now flip to page 28. And we go to down to number 4(A)(1). 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  53:04 
And then it is to strike the word "one" and to add "two members", and then it reads having 
recognized qualification as an architect, and then to add ", attorney who specializes in zoning, 
urban planner, architectural historian". Questions? None. On adoption. All those in favor say 
"aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes have it and then move to number two, and that is to 
strike number two in its entirety. All those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes 
have it. We now moved on to add a new number two, "one member who operates a" and then 
the addition will be "non-formula business within the Harvard Square overlay district". All those 
in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes have it. We now move to what was number 
four, which will now be number three, is to strike the word "two" and add the word "one". All 
those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes have it. We now move to what was 
number five, which is now number four. That is to strike "five members representing residents of 
the five abutting Cambridge residential neighborhoods" and to add "four residents living within a 
half mile of the Harvard Square overlay". All those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The 
ayes have it. Next move down to what was number six and is now number five. That would 
strike "one additional resident to be appointed with should serve at large" and to add "one 
member representing the Harvard Square neighborhood association or neighborhood group 
representing Harvard Square and registered with the City of Cambridge". All those in favor. 
Councillor Simmons. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  55:08 
Just a clarifying question. It's a definitional one. I lost my place this... 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  55:18 
Under number four.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  55:19 
And registered with the City of Cambridge, what does that mean?

Councillor Marc McGovern  55:24 
Mr. Robert?  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  55:26 
Well... 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  55:27 
The neighborhood associations registered. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  55:29 
This is something that was pointed out in some of the staff comment. The Planning Board, I 
don't think had any particular concern with this, but staff didn't know that there is not a 
registration process for neighborhood groups. Typically, the way the Community Development 
Department addresses neighborhood groups, they are, you know, they're formed in their 
independent of the city. If a neighborhood group contacts the city and wants to be listed among 
the various neighborhood groups, we will list them and have contact in information for them so 
that, for instance, a proponent, a business owner who's trying to open a business and wants to 
meet with a neighborhood group, they can see who to contact. But I wouldn't describe it as a 
formal registration process. It's more of a notification process for the city.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  56:15 
So, through you, Mr. Chair, it's more of "and is known by the city" as opposed to just saying you 
are one.  Is that what you're trying to say? There's no poi... I never knew that we had a 
registration process for a neighborhood association. So that's what that makes the language 
odd to me. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  56:28 
Would it make more sense to say recognized as opposed to registered or listed by the City of 
Cambridge? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  56:36 
Through you Mr. Chair. If you're not... if... We're setting up... It looks like you're setting up a 
criteria that doesn't exist. And if we're going to have it, then you have to have it for every one so 
now we are going to have a neighborhood association registration process, which may not be a 
bad thing, but if we don't have it, right then why is it in here as something sort of acknowledges 
something that doesn't exist? You know, if we don't have a criteria of through whichever 
Neighborhood Association registers itself, then why is it in here, but we may have a process 
through which we recognize in Neighborhood Association. If it's for the purpose of whoever is 
accessing this document to know that they have at least made some contact with the city and 
we know that they exist, that you might want to finesse the language a little bit. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  57:21 
Mr. Barrett. 
 
Patrick Barrett  57:23 
Just a point of clarification on this point. While there is no specific process for registering 
neighborhood groups, they do often register with the City of Cambridge so that they can be put 
on lists when projects come into the area. Part of the problem, I say problem. One of the things 
we're trying to address is the particip... participation among these neighborhood groups in this 
process, and that even though there's not a specific process to register, that's kind of a half-truth 
in that you can register with the city and we're hoping that this provides the impetus to do so.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons  58:00 
Through you Mr. Chair to Mr. Barrett. I understand where you're coming from. The problem I 
have is the word registered. Because we don't, registered is a little bit more formal, then being 
known by and I don't say that there isn't a problem being registered. It's, it kind of lifts up a 
group to a status that doesn't quite exist. I mean, it's just difficult language. Is that the hill I'm 
going to die on? No. But I'm just I raised that to say the Port, the Port doesn't have a registered 
Neighborhood Association. You know, it's just a diff [sic]. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  58:35 
That would make me.  Through you Mr. Chair, I'd be more comfortable with that.  
 
Patrick Barrett  58:35 
If the language read one member renting the Harvard Square neighborhood association or 
neighborhood group representing Harvard Square period [sic]. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  58:49 
Let me go to Mayor Siddiqui. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  58:50 
I think that makes sense. And one, just wanted to add that on today's website, you have a list of 
the neighborhood organizations and so I think, I think this makes sense. But if you're listed in 
that, and that's pretty clear, so listed with the City of Cambridge, but I’m in favor of the former 
over what you just suggested, making it clear. Thanks. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  59:15 
Okay, so the question we first have to vote to strike... Is there a motion to amend this section to 
strike "and registered with the City of Cambridge" by Councillor Simmons. On that amendment, 
all those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes have it. On number five as 
amended. All those in favor say "aye". Those opposed "nay". The ayes have it. We now move to 
what was number seven now number six and it’s to strike "one member representing an 
institution owning institutional property in the Harvard Square overlay district". Councillor 
Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  59:57 
It's the same wording as what we're striking. Maybe a word is missing? Or is that a typo? I'm 
only raising and in case something's missing. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  60:09 
You are correct. It does seem to be exactly the same. Mr. Roberts. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  60:13 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, this is another situation where the formatting is, is important. So the, 
the original petition suggested striking "one member representing an institution owning 
institutional property in Harvard Square overlaid districts" and I believe added the set, the 
above, earlier in the list one member from Harvard University, the Planning Board's 
recommendation was to reverse that change and go back to the original language, finding that it 
wasn't appropriate to single out a particular institution within the zoning ordinance. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  60:51 
So... Councillor Zondervan.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  60:54 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Through you the language does seem a little bit redundant, Institution 
owning institutional property. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  61:06 
I can, I guess address that. So, this is the original language. So, I can't actually speak to how it 
was drafted, but it is, it is the case that institutions sometimes own non-institutional property. An 
institution like Harvard or MIT may own commercial property or residential property. It may be is 
belaboring the point to have that both in the sentence, but it is accurate, if we want it to be an 
institution that has an actual institutional presence in Harvard Square rather than an institution 
that might just own commercial property. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  61:48 
Okay, thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  61:50 
So, the question comes on striking was number seven. And then... We'll do that first. All those in 
favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. And then to add the language back as 
number six. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. And then next in 
this section is to change the number eight to number seven. All those in favor say aye. Those 
opposed nay. The ayes have it. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  62:22 
We now go to B and the amendment is to add on an annual basis is the first meeting in 
September the Harvard Square advisory strike board ad committee will strike appoint elected 
chair who may serve no more than two years as Chair within a three-year period. And questions 
on adoption. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have. Now flip to page 
29. We go down to 20.54.3 Number one, to add any retail use 4.35 allowed in business be 
zoning districts within the overlay may also be allowed as of right in any office or residential 
zone within the overlay provided the structure that contains the use has a main entrance on 
Massachusetts Avenue, Mount Auburn Street, strike Harvard Street, add Arrow street or Bow 
street for... period for all other lots, and then at the bottom to strike or findings made. 
Questions? On adoption, all those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. Now 
go to B, 1(b) which is to strike "and will not involve significant new construction". Those in favor 
say aye. Those opposed nay. the ayes have it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  63:56 
This is the... This is the section that we spoke a lot before. And we were asking clarifying 
questions and not so much statements. But I do. I just do want to reiterate that I do think that 
you know, I... given what Mr. Barrett said that cannabis establishments are not allowed there 
anyway. I'm at, that put me a little bit at ease, but I do. You know, I do have some concern 
about where that's going to lead. 
 
Patrick Barrett  64:23 
Through you, Mr. Chair, I think the concern could be put to rest by striking it. If you feel as 
though at some point in time, that if this were to be altered in a significant way that this could be 
addressed or should be addressed.

Councillor Marc McGovern  64:43 
Yeah. I mean, I think that you know, if you, one of the things Mr. Barrett, that you mentioned in 
the presentation was this was also to help local businesses and I think if you look at certainly 
the EE applicants that have applied to open in Cambridge, a lot of them are local people. You 
know, their, it's, their, it's cannabis. But there are people that are, who live in this community and 
their local people. It's a local business. So, you know, that does kind of, again, I think, and we'll 
get to the other part about striking around the frontage. You know, I think this council spent and 
extraordinary amount of time on the zoning, forget the whole conversations around EE versus 
medical and all that, just on the zoning and one of the things that we overwhelmingly voted for is 
to make sure that cannabis establishments are able to open throughout the city and no other 
square has these kinds of protections or these kinds of hurdles in it, you know, as was noted by 
Councillor Mallon. Four our opening in Central and that actually, you know, given what the 
decision in the lawsuit that just came down and where that goes revolutionary clinics which is 
medical could also do it. That could be the fifth. There are two going into, at least two applying 
for Porter square. And so, you know, we are giving certain, we are making it more difficult to for 
them to open in Harvard Square, which is not something that any other square has, that we've 
done anywhere else in the in the city. And in fact, we voted to make it city wide for a reason. So, 
it just, it doesn't totally sit well with me. 
 
Patrick Barrett  66:25 
Point of clarification. So, the use is already not allowed in these districts have also a special 
permit requirement throughout the city. So, it's not really putting any more undue burden than it 
was already present for that. I do agree that the other provision dealing with frontage, and not 
allowing cannabis retail in the BB district that has that component is a much more stringent 
provision that exists anywhere else in the city. And I think that was the thing that the Planning 
Board had the biggest issue with relative to equity in a cannabis retail, not this particular 
provision. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  66:58 
Yeah, we'll get, we'll get there. So now we will flip to page 30. And the first amendment is to 
strike section I. Questions? On adoption. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The 
ayes have it. Next, the next amendment is to change from j to i. All those in favor say aye. 
Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. The next amendment is to change K to J. And to add, 
"the use is not a formula business". Questions? All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. 
The ayes have it. The next amendment is to change l to K and to strike, the proposed use is not 
located in a base residence C to B or office to district. And then it will read the following users 
listed in Section 4.35 are however specifically prohibited. And then the amendment goes further 
to strike 4.35(e), 4.35(f), 4.35(g). Questions? On adoption all those in favor say aye. Those 
opposed nay. The ayes have it. The next amendment also under K is to add 4.35(s) cannabis 
retail store. That's what we're already talking about. All those in favor say aye. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  68:53 
Mr. Roberts, if you could... No, I'm sorry. So, the if you flip back to number one it says anything 
allowed in business be zoning district within the overlay may also be allowed as a right in the 
office and residential zone within the overlay. And then so that, but then, so is that saying that, 
is, does that contradict in terms of the cannabis retail. Is it saying earlier saying it is allowed and 
then... 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  69:45 
So, it's a good question Mr. Chair. So, with the provision says any retail use allowed in the 
business B zoning districts may also be allowed as a right in any office or residential zone within

the overlay. The question, then that the more specific question that I would need to ask is, does 
that mean that it must be allowed in business B as a right? Or could it also include uses that are 
allowed by special permit? So, for instance, in a business be zoning district, a cannabis retail 
store would be allowed by special permit as would a fast food establishment or commercial 
recreation establishment. So that might be a matter of interpretation. I think if the council wanted 
to be more specific or more sort of conservative on this note, it could be added to that text that 
any retail use allowed in the business B zoning district or allowed to as of right in the business 
be zoning district within the overlay may also be allowed as of right so that it's clear that only 
those uses allowed as of right would have the same allowance if they're along Mass Ave, Mount 
Auburn Street, Arrow street or Bow street. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  71:05 
So why don't you... we don't have to do that now and go backwards. Why don't you play with 
some of that language and then we can amend it as this moves forward? So, on 4.35(s), 
cannabis retail store, all those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  71:28 
Mr. Chair. While we're on that section. I hate to do this because it's so annoying, but it's 
bothering me. Can we please capitalize the "S" in sales?  
 
Patrick Barrett  71:40 
I fully endorse that amendment. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  71:40 
Where are you? 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  71:40 
It's the contract attorney in me. The drafting.  It's 4.35(M). And the "sale", "s" is lower case. That 
doesn't have to be an amendment but just it was bothering me. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  71:55 
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  71:56 
Good catch.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  71:59 
Point of order. A little bit relevant if, if we do change the language to say, as of right in number 
one, then it doesn't make sense to say, cannabis retail store at all because it's not allowed as of 
right. So, I think it does make sense to try to resolve that right away. 
 
Patrick Barrett  72:24 
Through you, Mr. Chair. I think last time I spent a good amount of time with his language was 
before the new year. And going through the amendments. That's precisely why it is enumerated 
at the base of this because I say not all, not all commercial users in the BB district, but all retail 
users under 4.35 are allowed in this district and specifically enumerating cannabis retail. Even if 
I were to go and get a special permit for it, I think it's certain puts the person on notice that that 
use simply is not allowed in this district. So, it's not really as duplicative I think, as it was 
explained before. But I think to Councillor Zondervan's point, I think you'd kind of choose one or 
the other. And you can in the amendment, if you just decided that you could strike that

language, if it's strictly as of right, or leave it is and it's pretty clear that that use is not allowed. 
Okay. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  73:24 
So, if that's the case, we can, if folks agree with that since we just voted to add 4.35(s), you 
don't have to come back with the new language in the other section if people feel comfortable 
with that answer. So next we go. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  73:40 
Can I stop for a second? Because I'm trying to make sure that I understand that the answer and 
the intent of the of the Ordinance committee. So if the, I guess that this is really complicated 
language, because it's all about sort of negative space, it's you know, certain users are allowed 
and then they're not allowed but then we're allowing them again But sometimes we're not 
allowing them and some as we're requiring a special permit so we can get very, very tangled. I 
think it's important to just to lay all that aside and understand is it, is it the intent or the desire of 
the council to allow cannabis retail stores in office and residential zoned parts of the Harvard 
Square overlay district? Ordinarily, cannabis retail stores would not be allowed in residential or 
office zone-based zoning districts. But that would be, it would be a significant, it, you know, it 
would be a significant difference if they were allowed and if it were unclear whether or not they 
were allowed, it could cause some complication.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  74:53 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I believe it is our intent to not allow them as is already the case. And so, I 
think the existing language just clarifies that. But it doesn't actually impose that restriction. I 
think where we're getting stuck is the as of right language, I'm not sure if that's even needed. I 
mean, we could simply strike the as of right phrase in that sentence. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  75:35 
So, Mr. Chair, I think if that is the, not to interrupt, but if, if that is the agreed upon intent of the 
committee, I think we would still ask to look at the language and make sure that that is how it 
would be interpreted. And if we feel that there's a need to make that clearer that we would 
provide that. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  75:55 
Okay, so let's move on from, from that. So now we go back. Again, it’s to strike the entirety of 
number three in that section. Questions? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  76:08 
All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. Now flip to page 31. And the 
amendment, recommendation is to strike 2(a), A-1, -2, -3 and then the two paragraphs below. 
Councillor Mallon? 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  76:32 
Mr. Chair, I have questions for the staff on this particular item. I think there was some need for 
greater clarity around the fund, the Harvard Square improvement fund that is paid into when 
there's new development and if we get rid of this, what the implications are. I think we need to 
understand that from the staff. I have a few questions. When  was the last time this fund was 
contributed to? And what were those funds used for? And I guess my underlying theme is I'm,

I'm not ready to move away from this revenue stream, if it is something that we use for 
streetscape improvements or safety improvements or placemaking in Harvard Square. If this is 
a revenue stream that does work if there is development, and we are trying to plan for 
development in Harvard Square, I don't want to walk away from this as a revenue stream. But I 
also want to understand if there's no money in it, and there hasn't been, and we don't do 
anything with that. I'm fine striking this. I just want to have a clear understanding of what this is, 
what it could be and what it what it is right now.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  77:43 
Mr. Roberts. Or who? Mr. Roberts. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  77:44 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, to answer the first part of the question. The so, the, on the most 
recent contribution... In fact, we did have a contribution made last year it's for the Regent, the 
Abbott building project right at the corner there, JFK and Brattle Street. So, it was recently 
approved project by the Planning Board, there was also reviewed by Historical Commission, 
and it provided because there's no parking provided on the site, it provides a contribution of 
approximately $2 million, I believe. So, the way that the ordinance works is it requires a 
contribution based on the cost of construction of parking spaces, which is pretty high in 
Cambridge. So, based on staff's analysis of the construction costs, the payment that a, the 
contribution that a project would have to make is about $50,000 per parking space. 
Approximately. So, the source for some from Matt some background that was the first 
contribution to the fund, in probably over decade. So, it... to the Councillor's question or the vice 
mayor's question about this being a sort of reliable revenue stream, it hasn't been what I would 
refer to as a, sort of a constant stream of funding for any particular kind of us. It's more of a 
every once in a while when there's a project that is of a sufficient scale, and really with the, 
frankly, with the resources to be able to provide that kind of a contribution that it does, will 
provide a chunk of funding which the city can then decide how to use. This in this case, because 
it was a recent contribution. It hasn't gone through the review process yet in terms of 
determining what the use might be and then the advisory harvest Advisory Committee makes a 
recommendation. It is, I think, beyond that it's, because of the way the zoning is written, it's, you 
know, a development might not have to make the contribution based on reducing the overall 
size. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  80:17 
And so for smaller projects that don't want to or don't have the resources to make that funding 
contribution, they will often make the choice of trying to reduce the scale of the project, the size 
of the project to be within the within 80% of the district limit, so as to not have to make the 
contribution. I think the other point that was made by the petitioners, in this, is that aside from 
Harvard Square and Central's where in any other part of the city, a development can seek a 
special permit to waive or eliminate the parking requirement and there's no there's no funding 
contribution required. So, it's a, it's a rather unique provision in the zoning ordinance. It, the 
application of it is, it's not completely, it doesn't work in the same way in each in each particular 
case. And so, it's hard to look at it as a reliable ongoing source of funding. But the Planning 
Board did note in their recommendation that while there are some issues with the provisions 
that is written now, they urge the city council to think about, you know, are there other 
alternatives rather than doing away with an entirely. Are there ways that it could be 
reformulated? And to think carefully about the uses of those funds or the purpose that those 
funds might serve? I'll make one more point I think to answer another part of your question 
about the uses of the funds. The zoning language states that the, the initial intent of this was 
when projects aren't providing parking, it would provide some revenue to the city or some

funding to the city. So, the city could create public parking, which is something that no matter 
how much funding comes in, it's still very challenging. It would be very challenging for the city 
and may not be desirable for other reasons to try to create new public parking in the area. So, it 
often is used for other transportation or public realm related improvements, pedestrian, bicycle 
facilities. That's how it's generally been used in the past. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  82:44 
Miss Farooq. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  82:46 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to add that one other thought that I think that the petitioner 
did touch on. Which is that just thinking about how we look at parking in planning today. We're 
not actually creating more parking requirements we, are across the board, thinking about how 
we can reduce parking requirements and not have people be incentivized to build more. 
However, that said, I think that the vice mayor's point is an important one, because even though 
we have not had contributions to this fund for a long time, that has been because there really 
hasn't, hadn't been construction activity in the square. And now we have seen some amount of 
turnover of sites and a lot of anticipated development. So, there could in fact, be, it could be 
more of a revenue stream if it is retained. And one way to think about how this interfaces with 
planning is to not try to solve this in this particular rezoning but to think about when we address 
parking in a city wide way, it might impact the parking ratios, and then there, as a result of that 
could impact whether there are contributions or not.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  84:17 
Vice Mayor. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  84:19 
Thank you. I was just... thank you for that, because we've been talking a lot about parking and 
parking ratios. And I do think that that is a way for us to address this particular issue. While not 
doing it here. I know in Central Square; I know I haven't had a minute to look up how exactly it 
works. But there are different buckets that the parking fund goes into and it seems to me, you 
know, we have a provision for arts and culture, we have a provision for street improvements, 
sidewalk improvements. So, you know, it's not about creating new public parking. I do think it is 
something that we need to address overall. I just, I can't figure out what problem we're trying to 
solve. I'm just wondering if the petitioner maybe we are trying to incentivize smaller 
developments where, for which this is a financial barrier. So, Mr. Barrett? Through you. 
 
Patrick Barrett  85:13 
Thank you. I think, I just get a bigger picture of this. You know, the groups that came together to 
put this petition together represented interests across the board, whether it be property owners, 
business owners, universities, as well as neighborhood groups, and that each piece of it for 
represents a give and pull on either side. This particular provision exists in Central Square 
because I put it there. And in my last presentation on this, I look at that provision now as 
potentially a mistake on my part. For the reason that, I think as stated by Jeff and Iram 
indirectly. That if you have a group that has enough capital, you're going to be able to get, exact 
a fund or some money from them, potentially, provided that if they want to go above 80% of 
FAR.  For the infill projects, the smaller projects, which are still many potentially there. This is a 
prohibitive barrier because remember, you're not going to pay to exclude parking in an existing 
building. That provision already exists, but you will pay for any addition there too. The problem 
that I think we're trying to address is in predictability and the ability for the infill development that 
we anticipate, will trickle through Harvard Square and as stated this, this fun hasn't really done a

lot.  It has done something recently and may do something when Church Street gets lift off for 
another decade or so or and when you know the Asana group decides to stop kicking all their 
tenants and maybe do something there. 
 
Patrick Barrett  87:06 
But, in my opinion, this represents sort of an archaic provision and planning and that, why do we 
want someone to stay below FAR? Why do we want someone to put money and provision for 
transfer, for more parking in the district? And I don't think that we do. All these things that 
unique about Harvard Square is, unlike most squares, it has a significant collection of important 
buildings that we don't want to incentivize ripping out and going underneath to build parking to 
either avoid paying a $2 million fee, or that we don't want to simply have stagnate. That's the 
reason why we're here. We didn't want this district to keep languishing. We wanted to infuse it 
with some incentive to do things. This provision is not a boon for the city. And while $2 million 
coming from Regency now is nice to have, I think in the grand scheme of 20 year, 20 years into 
zoning in Harvard Square. 
 
Patrick Barrett  88:07 
I don't see it as being as much of a potential benefit to the district as the infill development that 
we're trying to spur. So, in that sense, it was a balance. This one provision was the biggest point 
of interest among small, small property owners and landlords in Harvard Square because this 
does block them from utilizing anything in the zoning essentially, that if this provision were to be, 
were to be not stricken, that essentially, you're going to continue to see the proliferation of larger 
groups buying smaller groups out which you'll still see but that eventually the smaller landlords 
will just,  they won't utilize this and the way that we anticipate it. 
 
Patrick Barrett  88:55 
Vice Mayor. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  88:56 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Through you. I mean, I, with all due respect, I don't think anyone is going 
to build underground parking to avoid $2 million in a contribution with the amount of money at 
cost per parking spot, under underground... 
 
Patrick Barrett  89:10 
That's precisely my point, they're not going to build at all. So if you're faced if you're a small 
developer and you're faced with the either you have a project that you're going to add a couple 
thousand square feet to and then buy into a parking provision where you're paying a couple 
hundred thousand dollars to get out of it, that has the potential to destroy a pro forma for a small 
project. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  89:32 
Okay, so thank you, Mr. Chair through you. I'm curious to see what my colleagues think about 
this. If anybody has any thoughts. I'm not sure I'm totally comfortable with striking this language 
and walking away from a potential revenue stream. And I'm not sure I'm convinced that that's 
the right thing to do. So, I yield the floor

Councillor Dennis Carlone  89:57 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I understand why this discussion is happening. In some ways it seems 
like a step back from a policy that has stated goals but on the other hand in a special permit 
there can be sharing a public improvements can they're not with the developers’ part of the 
scheme if the criteria said such. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  90:28 
Through you Mr. Chair. Only if there is some trigger that is some thresholds that is crossed and 
that it is a mitigation for that. It's very hard to have criteria that, that that might accomplish that. 
So, for instance, the only instances where a special permit is able to require something of this 
nature, in terms of infrastructure improvements are if they, if one of the traffic triggers, for 
instance, is exceeded. And then somebody might be required to make a safety improvement or 
signal changes or so forth. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  91:14 
And, Mr. Chair, if I could just sort of add to that a little more sort of context of the way it works 
outside of Harvard Square, city wide. So, in, in well, back in Harvard Square, it has this 
provision that says the parking requirement can be waived, and under certain circumstances, 
they have to make the payment. That's sort of the it lays out pretty clearly, that's the exchange. 
In other parts of the city when there's a special permit to reduce or waive parking. It requires an 
analysis of what the different transportation options are, what the different parking availability 
and options are. So that all becomes part of the special permit review. And as with any special 
permit, the Planning Board or the BZA that's reviewing it can attach conditions that are meant to 
ensure that the, that the criteria are met. So it's fairly routine if someone's seeking a parking 
reduction that, for instance, traffic and parking might review that and recommend transportation 
demand management or other measures that would be attached to the special permit conditions 
to make sure that they're meeting the finding that the project won't cause undue spill over 
parking or other negative impacts on the public. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  92:24 
But, Mr. Chair it, through you. When a contractor works on a project, the sidewalk is generally 
redone that becomes a condition of using the public sidewalk. If there is a strategy, I'm not 
saying there is but if Harvard Square, the association decides to irrigate their trees and that 
becomes a criteria of ours to be part of the, you can't do that. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development  92:56 
Through you Mr. Chair. The only way that one could require that through a special permit is if a 
tree were being removed through this process and was then being re... You know, a new tree 
was being installed or some somehow it was being disrupted in the public way. Otherwise, the 
things like trees and things, enhancements related to that might be more likely to be 
accomplished on the site. It's challenging to be asking somebody to be doing something on the 
public way unless there's a very clear nexus between the project and its impact on whatever is 
desired to play against.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  93:42 
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

I just like to add a couple of points. One, the provision that requires an 80% of FAR to trigger 
this effect, that if you stay under the 80% of AFR, we are rewarding developers or we’re 
essentially rewarding development by less density. Essentially goes contrary to everything we're 
being told in transit nodes about development. That we want to actually increase the density of 
these districts, more so than other districts. I think it's interesting to note that Harvard Square 
and Central Square though I put an asterisk next to my name for that one. This is the only place 
where we penalize development in this way. It is also the most difficult place to address parking 
concerns. I've oftentimes heard the council discuss and citizens discuss the possibility of 
making Harvard Square carless or the possibility of, you know, increased bike lanes and you 
know, what have you. But if a project is built in Kendall Square, arguably the most lucrative part 
of our city. Such provision doesn't exist. If you build in Porter square, it doesn't exist. If you build 
in any part of the city but the overlay of  Harvard Square in Central Square, this doesn't exist. 
So in my mind, and through discussions with these groups, we came to the conclusion that if 
we're going to put prohibitions on a large triple net tenants like banks, if we're going to try to 
incentivize local retail, smaller footprints and invigorate the square with uses that people will 
like, that putting a duplicative tax on top of that kind of development scheme is contrary to 
almost everything this petition stands for. And while I do understand that the desire to keep a 
potential revenue stream in line because you simply have it there. I don't think that the fact that 
you have it justifies keeping it.  
 
Patrick Barrett  95:49 
Again, we have always been sort of amicable in terms of our working with the council, but this 
one provision is an important one to property owners in Harvard Square for lots of important, for 
lots of obvious reasons. I don't think we want to incentivize them to duck it. I think if you are 
encouraging to go beyond the 80% of FAR, you're increasing the tax base of the district, which 
is obviously a net positive revenue stream wise. But I would ask the council just to consider, 
what is it you're teaching us with this provision? What is it that we're supposed to glean from it 
development wise in terms of the plan of a Harvard Square is that we're supposed to stay under 
80%? Is it that we're supposed to keep our belt, keep the existing buildings exactly as they are 
do not go beyond the scheming and of course, a lot of them are beyond the 80% already, 
because a lot of buildings were built before FAR before zoning and they're already non-
compliant? So, I think it's, I do understand fully the power of having a revenue stream. I don't 
always think that that is the best way to achieve the goals that you're trying to achieve for a 
district. When there are other, more practical ways that also apply to other parts of the district. 
Unless, I mean, I'm not recommending you do this, you know if we're willing to apply this to city 
wide. What's unique about Harvard Square that this has to stay this way? And I think in terms of 
support, if this provision is withdrawn, I cannot see the Harvard Square Business Association 
continuing their support for this, although [sic] beyond their grasp. It's simply one of the 
probably, if not the most important piece to the small owners in Harvard Square, that they are 
alleviated from this in order to realize the density that this petition ultimately is pushing. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  97:41 
Pleasure the council? Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  97:46 
Yeah, I'm generally in favor this, in favor of, I think we should be moving towards getting rid of 
parking minimums in general and I realize this isn't a parking minimum but sort of anything that 
incentivizes parking, and this seems like a provision... One of the sort of similar angles, so, 
yeah, I support it.

Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission  98:07 
Can I make a comment Mr. Chair? I think the motivations for this provision in the first place were 
that it occurred during a period when this was a car centric culture. That Harvard Square was 
the only place in Cambridge where there was significant economic development activity in the 
1970s and early 1980s. Before Alewife before, before Lechmere, before Cambridge port, 
Cambridge Research Park. And the thought was that there was so much demand at Harvard 
Square that parking should be controlled in this way. That on the one hand, I think the Planning 
Board recognized that parking in the center of Harvard Square was not very desirable. No one 
wanted curb cuts. People didn't want cars actually coming into the middle of the city. But that 
the city could take advantage of the demand for redevelopment potential in Harvard Square to 
impose this sort of fee on development. The climate is entirely change. Harvard Square is no 
longer the only economic development game in town. And I think it's an historical anomaly that 
this was put into place when it was and that it remains in effect. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  99:33 
Pleasure of the committee? I would just, you know, I think this is a, I think this is a tough one 
because I actually I think the vice mayor makes some really valid points about... Even though it 
hasn't yielded a lot of money in the past... You know, it may... You know, it may in the future, but 
I also, I hear what, you know, I also don't want to do something that is going to make it more 
difficult on small property owners in the square. Mr. Barrett. 
 
Patrick Barrett  100:05 
 one point that we already have a provision to address commercial development in the city. It 
didn't exist at the time of adoption of this provision particularly. And it's called linkage. And when 
we look in development, we now calculate the totality of that building. So even the existing 
square footage, so that when a linkage fee is associated with commercial development, which, 
just so we understand, the reason why there's not a massive amount of housing requests in this 
petition is because Harvard Square has been at a 4.0 for commercial development, for decades, 
whereas residentials been a three which is another big change. We've tried to least normalize 
that condition. However, this provision existed before linkage existed. So, I think it's worth noting 
that you are able to now especially with the increases to linkage, to get money from commercial 
development in the way... I think a more modern way than anticipated by this. So, I just want to 
make sure that that's clear. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  101:09 
Alright, if we're ready to vote? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  101:12 
On striking "a", in its entirety, all those in favor say aye. Those opposed. The ayes have it. We 
also, this wasn't, now that we did that it's not listed here, but we then have to change in that 
section under number two, we have to change B to A, C to B, D to C and E to D. So, on that 
amendment, all those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. We now move to 
page 33, 20.54.6. It's to add nonresidential uses and 4.0 for all residential uses. For... 
parentheses 4.31 A through H and to strike uses except dwellings, 3.0 for dwellings. Any 
questions? On adoption, all those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. Then 
is to add, the next amendment is to add 20.54.7 additional FAR upon the issuance of a special 
permit, the special permit granting authority may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or 
portion of a lot located within the Harvard Square overlay district for any residential use in 
Section 4.3, A through H or any commercial use in Section 4.34 or 4.35 provided the use and 
design complies with the goals and design guidelines set forth in the Harvard Square 
Conservation District. Councillor Carlone.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  102:55 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is the area that we were discussing earlier to specify at the end of 
the second line on any lot or portion of a lot and add in the business B district located within. So, 
it's not the whole overlay district it's only business B. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  103:19 
So, the you would amend this on any lot or portion of a lot... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  103:25 
In the business B district located within the Harvard Square or something to that effect if Jeff 
wishes or the petitioner wishes the change it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  103:39 
Ok with that? Okay. So, first, we would, we would have to vote Councillor Carlone's 
amendment. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed nay? The ayes have it. And then on 
20.54.7 as amended, Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  103:55 
Just, I know we're not going to do it now. But the whole notion... This allows labs, continues to 
allow labs, which means they could get the increase in density. And there's question, I'm not 
suggesting we discuss it now, in the city about labs and the squares, including central square. 
So, I'm just raising it as something that we'll talk about in the future. But I question that. 
 
Patrick Barrett  104:23 
To Councillor... to Councillor Carlone's point, I fully agree with him. And I do believe we need to 
address this in Central Square, in Harvard Square, you know, for better or worse or whatever. 
It's been a business district for... it's there. The thing that would ask the council to look at 
beyond this petition is the definition of a lab. Right now, it's not quite clear, and that the 
unintended consequences of adding any kind of language like that right now would be 
unfortunate. But I do ask the council to look into that. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  104:56 
Thank you. So, we pass Councillor Carlone's amendment. On 20.54.7 as amended. All those in 
favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. We are then down to 20.54.8 FAR 
exemption for ground floor retail, retail spaces of 1500 square feet or less shall be excluded 
from the calculation of floor area ratio. Questions? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  105:27 
Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  105:28 
Well there was the comment about frontage versus square footage, I thought. We could move 
with this and then discuss it in the future. And then there was this discussion is a 2,000 square 
feet. I think I read that the Planning Board said that. I'm fine with this for now, but yes, please. 
 
Patrick Barrett  105:50 
Through you Mr. Chair. A point of clarification. I believe the mention of 2000 square feet came 
from board member Bowie and it was a misreading of the language in the petition. Also, the 
distinction between linear frontage and footage. I'm happy to discuss that as a potential 
element, but I think for now it needs to stay table. Thank you.

Councillor Marc McGovern  106:20 
Okay. Jeff. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  106:22 
Mr. Chair, I just wanted to clarify on that point, there was a comment in the staff materials that 
came at the very beginning of the petition review, about 1500 square feet and suggesting 
potentially 2000 square feet as a number. I think that came from some, just commentary by our 
economic development division. They work with a lot of local retailers and they were finding that 
there were some number of local retailers falling in that 1500 to 2000 square foot range. So it's 
never an exact science trying to pin down you know, what numbers the appropriate number, but 
I think it's... Whatever you pick, there's always going to be some businesses that you really like 
that are going to be constrained because they're a little bit above it. But I think the suggestion 
from economic development staff was that to you know, they're starting to see businesses that 
are under 2000, but over 1500. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  107:19 
On adoption. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. We now move to 
20.54.9 and the recommendation is to strike, restrict uses no bank or financial institutions 
section 4.34 (e), or cannabis retail store section 11.803.1 shall occupy more than 20 feet of 
building frontage within the Harvard Square overlay, and no more than 30% of a lot's aggregate 
ground floor building frontage facing one or more public streets may be occupied by such uses, 
and to add, frontage restrictions banks Trust Company or similar financial institutions as 
identified in Section 4.34. Shall occupy no more than 25 feet of the ground floor level frontage of 
a building, facing a street measured horizontally parallel to the street. In addition, such uses 
shall not occupy more than 30% of the buildings total horizontal ground floor building frontage 
aggregated over one or more streets, the Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a 
minor increase in the permanent frontage upon finding that such increase would create a, would 
create a result that is more compatible with the unique conditions of a particular building or site. 
And that and that the criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above are met. So essentially, I think 
the key to this is that we're taking out cannabis. The recommendation is to take out cannabis 
and then to go to 25 feet versus 20 feet. Is that the gist? Mr. Roberts. 
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development  109:02 
Yes, Mr. Chair, I think that the wording was developed. This is one where we spend a little bit 
more time on the wording because there were many questions during the hearing process about 
how to interpret what frontage means and how it's calculated. So, the gist of it is that this 25 feet 
with a provision for a special permit. And I'll just note, just given the we know that there was a 
concern to the petitioners about whether this, whether the special permit should be allowed or 
not. And whether it would, you know, leave everything really open ended, we really tried to 
phrase the special permit provision to be very specific as to what the intent was. It really doesn't 
leave everything wide open. It just accounts for situations where just the design of an existing 
building might make it more appropriate to have a 28-foot frontage rather than having to kind of 
mess with the facade and an unusual way to try to squeeze it into the into the desired frontage 
trip limit. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  109:59 
Are there any questions?

Councillor Marc McGovern  110:03 
On adoption of this amendment? All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have 
it. 20.54.10 to add fast order food establishments, as identified in Section 4.35(o), are allowed 
by right within the Harvard Square overlay district and are further not subject to the provisions of 
Article 11.30 of this ordinance provided the fast order food establishment is not a formula 
business. Questions? Mr. Barrett. 
 
Patrick Barrett  110:41 
I don't have a question as much as I... this particular provision. I think if any part of this petition 
has me in it, it's this one. This is a city-wide issue that I think the council needs to look at as a 
city. Why don't you eventually but that the fast order food as defined and the requirements into 
article 11 that upon transfer of that business to another person also requires a special permit. I 
think we're beyond this, and I'm going to get on my soapbox, but thank you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  111:12 
Okay. Questions? comments? On adoption? All those in favor say aye. Those opposed nay. 
The ayes have it. That is the end of what has been proposed. So, where we stand now is, we 
now have an amended Harvard Square overlay district zoning petition in front of us. There's one 
piece that's still a little bit outstanding, which CDD will get back to us down the road, but we 
could certainly do that in Council. Doesn't necessarily, it's pretty minor, doesn't necessarily have 
to come back here. Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  111:47 
Two things to Mr. Chair. One is I would love to have Charlie Sullivan talk about the 
Conservation District not... it's a 90-page document. So, we're not expecting everything but just 
a quick overview. And to talk how was, to tell us how it was, remind us how a certificate of 
appropriateness is necessary, and how that works with a special permit. I know they're two 
separate things, but how does, how will this review work? And then secondly, I'd like to talk 
about criteria for approval and how we're going to work on that together. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  112:35 
I'm sure if I know Mr. Sullivan, he has every word of those 90 pages committed to memory. 
 
Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission  112:43 
Well, the neighborhood conservation district was established in 2000s... 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  112:49 
Hate to cut you off, but the clerk did notify... just mentioned to me that this is beyond the call of 
the meeting.  
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  112:55 
Oh, well, then that's, I don't see how that can be since zoning is based... This whole thing is 
based on the conservation district. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  113:09 
Maybe it's the question... 
 
Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission  113:11 
Mr. Chair.

Councillor Marc McGovern  113:12 
Mr. Sullivan. 
 
Charles Sullivan, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission  113:13 
The Conservation District Study Committee that has been operating for the last two years, 
reached its conclusions at the end of 2019. Has prepared a final report the 90-page report that 
Councillor Carlone refers to, that is on its way to the council. A section of that would require a 
hearing before the ordinance committee, and perhaps that's the appropriate time to discuss 
that. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  113:42 
Fine. I would disagree in that interpretation, but so be it. I'm not the clerk. The criteria, every 
kind of special permit has a list of criteria. And I mentioned it to Jeff and what I'd like to suggest, 
and petitioner and I have talked about this is to do a draft together the Ordinance committee 
with Historic with the petitioner, with Community Development, and come back when we meet 
next and just talk about it. And it's the kind... the Planning Board said, what are the aspirations? 
How are we going to decide if something's yay or nay? And it's that kind of thing. The amount of 
ground floor retail, obvious things like that. Is there any housing? Maybe that's not appropriate, 
but those kinds of questions, and we would make sure that it's true criteria. There are none in 
this package. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  114:39 
We can do that moving forward. So, I would, our options is to move this forward as amended 
favorably to the full city council is there a motion? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  114:48 
Move to forward with a favorable recommendation. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  114:49 
Councillor Simmons moved that we move the Harvard Square zoning overlay petition forward 
as amended with a favorable recommendation, all those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed 
nay. The ayes have it. On a motion by Councillor Simmons to adjourn. All those in favor say 
aye. Those opposed nay. The ayes have it. We are adjourned.

Community Development Department

Date:  January 28, 2020  

Re: 

Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition 

SANDRA CLARKE 
Deputy Director 
Chief of Administration 

KHALIL MOGASSABI 
Deputy Director 
Chief of Planning 

Attached for the Committee’s consideration at its hearing scheduled for January 30, 
2020 is a text version of the Harvard Square Overlay District zoning provisions (Section 
20.50) showing changes proposed in the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition 
(Blier, et al.) and incorporating changes recommended by the Planning Board following 
its public hearing on November 19, 2019. The Planning Board recommendation is also 
attached.  

In addition to the changes in this text, the Planning Board identified several outstanding 
issues that it believed deserved more consideration by City Council and that were 
discussed by staff at the previous Ordinance Committee hearing on December 11, 2019. 
Below is a summary of some points that were discussed: 

•

•

•

•

The Planning Board supported the proposed changes to Parking and Loading
provisions in Section 20.54.4, but suggested that the City Council consider the intent
of the provision and whether alternatives to completely eliminating the
contributions to the Harvard Square Improvement Fund might be considered, such
as adjusting the fee and/or the instances in which the requirement is applied.

Some Board members raised concerns about proposed restrictions on Formula
Businesses, with some members noting that such businesses often provide
affordable goods and services to a broad range of community members who would
otherwise have to purchase them outside of Cambridge.

Board members noted that in the petition, the additional FAR that would be allowed
by special permit is not tied to any specific requirements or criteria, and wanted to
ensure that a clear public benefit would be derived from granting such additional
FAR. Staff noted that more specific criteria could be established to guide the
Planning Board in determining whether the additional FAR supports the City’s
objectives, such as protection and support for retail businesses that are publicly
accessible and activate the street.

Some Board members expressed concern that these changes might preemptively
conflict with the Affordable Housing Overlay proposal, if it is advanced in the future.
Staff noted at the previous Ordinance Committee hearing that, technically, there is
no preemption because a future zoning amendment could also affect the current
amendment; however, because the current petition increases the allowed density
for market-rate commercial and residential uses in Harvard Square, a future
amendment to advantage affordable housing citywide might be less effective in this
area or might require further density increases to be effective.

HARVARD SQUARE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND HARVARD SQUARE 
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT 

Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Harvard Square 
Overlay District and, the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District, and 
Harvard Square Conservation District Goals and Guidelines which shall be 
governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.50. 
It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to an area 
described generally as the Harvard Square business district and certain 
abutting portions of the neighborhoods around it. 

Historical 
Commission staff 
noted that the 
Goals as well as 
the Guidelines of 
the Conservation 
District should be 
referenced. 

20.51.1  

 The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on 
the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square 
Historic Overlay District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay 
district that is encompassed by any historic district duly established by the City 
Council under the authority granted by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of 
the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any Neighborhood 
Conservation District established by the City Council under the provisions of 
chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. All provisions of the Harvard 
Square Overlay District and all references to it in this Ordinance shall apply 
equally to the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District except as set forth below. 

General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning 
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to 
the Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more 
careful public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban 
form of the Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the 
extreme development pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique 
functional environment and visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the 
functional impacts of new development on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to 
maintain the present diversity of development and open space patterns and building 
scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory flexibility to advance the general 
purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility granted to development 
within the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to facilitate the 
protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of Harvard Square 
while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary 
changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. 

20.53 

General Provisions. 

20.53.1   The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special 

planning concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, 
Development Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development 
Consultation Procedure specified in Article 19.40 except that any Large Project 
Review (new buildings of 2,000 square feet or more) shall be conducted by the

The following text of the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition contains amendments 
proposed by the Petitioner (additions in underline, deletions in strikethrough) and incorporates 
revisions recommended by the Planning Board at its meeting on November 19, 2019 (additions 
in double underline, deletions in double strikethrough). All changes are highlighted. 
 

2
2.a

The Planning Board 
noted that it was unclear 
how the appropriate 
frequency of meetings 
would be “deemed 
required” and it should 
be made clear how the 
schedule would be 
determined. 

a.   To establish a formal, ongoing body that will review all major 
development actions in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  
b.   To provide a forum within which a wide range of perspectives on 

development actions can be heard.  

c.   To support local businesses and uses that enhance the vibrancy and 
historical nature of Harvard Square with the aspirational goal of 
maintaining a seventy percent local and non-formula retail experience 
throughout the district. 

cd.   To establish a citizen/professional body which can advise both public 
agencies and private interests as to the development and urban design 
issues raised by a development or planning proposal and suggest 
avenues of research which might be pursued to resolve identified 
conflicts or make the project better fulfill both public and private 
objectives for the Harvard Square Overlay District.  

2.   Responsibilities. The Committee shall undertake all Large Project Reviews 
and shall receive all applications for variances and special permits for 
activities within the Harvard Square Overlay District for review and 
comment. In addition, the Committee may comment on any preliminary 
proposal for which any public agency or private interest may wish to receive 
advice and recommendations has planned for the Overlay. The Committee 
shall meet on an approximately monthly basis or with as much frequency as 
is deemed required needed to address pertinent issues in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District, with the schedule to be determined at the discretion of the 
Chair. 

3.   Procedures.  

a.   Within six (6) months preceding any application for (1) a building 
permit for any project subject to Large Project Development 
Consultation Review or (2) a special permit or variance for any project 
within the Harvard Square Overlay District, the graphic and other 
material required in Section 19.43.2 - Application for a Large Project 
Review shall be submitted to the Harvard Square Advisory Committee 
for their review and comment.  

b.   Within thirty (30) days of that submittal, [or within up to sixty (60) 
days with the written consent of the applicant] the Committee shall 
prepare a written report of findings and recommendations with respect 
to the applicant's proposed project.  

c.   The Committee's written report shall outline the urban design and 

development issues raised by the proposal. It shall suggest those areas 
within which additional exploration of alternatives might be sought or 
factual information gathered which might help to resolve potential 
conflicts between the public and private objectives or which help to 
shape the project to better serve these objectives.  

d.   The report shall be forwarded to the applicant and shall be included in 
any application for a building permit, special permit or variance.

The following text of the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition contains amendments 
proposed by the Petitioner (additions in underline, deletions in strikethrough) and incorporates 
revisions recommended by the Planning Board at its meeting on November 19, 2019 (additions 
in double underline, deletions in double strikethrough). All changes are highlighted.

2.a

e.  

It is expected that, in making decisions regarding special permits and 
variances within the Overlay District, the Planning Board and/or 
Zoning Board of Appeal will give due consideration to the report and 
recommendations of the Advisory Committee. Where the Committee 
makes recommendations with respect to the granting of special permits 
and/or variances, and the Planning Board and/or Zoning Board of 
Appeal does not follow said recommendations, then the Board(s) shall 
make written reply to the Committee, detailing why the Board(s)'s 
decisions were different from the Committee recommendations.  

f.   The Community Development staff shall serve as staff to the 

Committee.  

4.   Membership and Terms 
a.   Membership. 

(1)   At least one two members having recognized qualification as an 
architect, attorney who specializes in zoning, urban planner, 
architectural historian, or landscape architect.  

(2)   One member having recognized qualifications as real estate or 

development or financial expert.  
(2)   One member from Harvard University. 
(32)  One member who operates a non-formula business within the 

Harvard Square Overlay District.  

(43)   Two One members owning commercial property within the 

Harvard Square Overlay District.  

(54)   Five members representing residents of the five abutting 
Cambridge residential neighborhoods Four residents living 
within a half mile of the Harvard Square Overlay.  

(65)   One additional resident to be appointed with should serve at 

large One member representing the Harvard Square 
Neighborhood Association or Neighborhood group representing 
Harvard Square and registered with the City of Cambridge.  

(76)   One member representing an institution owning institutional 

property in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  

(6)   One member representing an institution owning institutional 

property in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  
(87)   One member representing the Cambridge Historical 

Commission.  

The Planning Board 
recommended striking 
the language in the 
petition that reserves a 
membership seat for a 
representative from 
Harvard University and 
retaining the current 
provision to include an 
institutional property 
owner without 
specifying any one 
institution. 

The Planning Board 
recommended clarifying 
that the Committee 
should “elect” rather 
than “appoint” a Chair. 

b.   Terms. Committee members shall be appointed for terms of three years 
each. Initial appointment shall, however, be staggered such that four 
members shall have terms of one year, five members shall have terms 
of two years, and four members shall have terms of three years each. 
On an annual basis at the first meeting in September the Harvard 
Square Advisory Board Committee will appoint elect a Chair who may 
serve no more than two (2) years as chair within a three (3) year period.

The following text of the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition contains amendments 
proposed by the Petitioner (additions in underline, deletions in strikethrough) and incorporates 
revisions recommended by the Planning Board at its meeting on November 19, 2019 (additions 
in double underline, deletions in double strikethrough). All changes are highlighted. 
 

20.54.2     Building Height Limitations. The maximum height of buildings in the Harvard 

Square Overlay District shall be governed by the requirements of this Section 
20.54.2; however, at locations where the base zoning district establishes a more 
restrictive height limitation, the more restrictive shall apply.  
1.   As of Right Height Limitations. The maximum height of any building shall 

be sixty (60) feet.  

2.   Special Permit for Additional Height. The maximum allowable height in the 
Harvard Square Overlay District may be increased up to eighty (80) feet 
upon issuance of a Special Permit by the Planning Board. If a Special Permit 
is issued portions of the building may extend to eighty (80) feet in height 
provided that those portions in excess of sixty (60) feet are set back from the 
street line at least ten (10) feet, and that those portions are also set back from 
one or more forty-five (45) degree sky exposure planes, unless otherwise 
permitted by the Planning Board. A forty-five (45) degree sky exposure plane 
shall be an imaginary inclined plane beginning fifty-five (55) feet above any 
streetline in the districts and rising over one or more lots at a forty-five (45 ) 
degree angle.  

3.   Deleted. 

20.54.3   Retail, Business, and Consumer Service Establishments (Section 4.35) in Office 

and Residential Districts.  
1.   Any retail use (4.35) allowed in the Business B zoning districts within the 

Overlay may also be allowed as of right in any office or residential zone 
within the Overlay provided the structure that contains the use has a main 
entrance on Massachusetts Avenue, Mt. Auburn Street, Harvard Street Arrow 
Street or Bow Street. For all other lots, the Planning Board may allow by 
special permit the retail use of a lot or structure all or partially within the 
Harvard Square Overlay District and in a base residential or office district 
where retail uses are not permitted under the provisions of Section 4.30 - 
Table of Use Regulations; provided, however, that the following conditions 
are met or findings made:  
a.   The general purposes of this Section 20.50 are met.  
b.   The use will be located in a structure in existence as of June 1, 1985 

and will not involve significant new construction.  

c.   The addition of such use(s) will assist in the preservation, rehabilitation 
and/or restoration of a National Register or contributing building or 
important open space by increasing the economic feasibility of 
maintaining such features.  

d.   The preservation of the buildings and open space identified in (c) above 
is assured through an approved mechanism for the full period that the 
special permit is in force and effect.  

e.   The proposed use will preserve, rehabilitate or restore the outward 

f.  

appearance of the structure or open space.  
In its operation the use will not, in impact, be significantly different 
from the uses permitted in the base district.  

The Planning Board 
recommended deleting 
Harvard Street and 
adding Arrow Street to 
the list of streets where 
certain retail uses could 
be permitted as-of-right.

g.   The use is completely contained within the structure.  
h.   The use will be patronized substantially by pedestrians and will, if 

required by the Planning Board, function adequately without additional 
off street parking or loading facilities and will in any case not generate 
vehicular traffic in quantity and type substantially different from that 
generated by permitted uses.  

i.   The applicant can demonstrate a need for the use(s) as a service to 

adjacent residential communities or to the academic community and 
can demonstrate that for economic or other reasons the use cannot 
easily be located in existing business or office districts where the use is 
permitted. In addition the applicant must demonstrate that either the use 
has been displaced as result of redevelopment elsewhere in the Harvard 
Square Overlay District, or that the use is important in its contribution 
to the variety, continuity, or uniqueness of the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

ji.   The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.  
kj.   The use is not a formula business. 
lk.   The proposed use is not located in a base Residence C-2B or Office 2 

District. The following uses listed in Section 4.35 are however 
specifically prohibited:  
4.35e  (Lunchroom, restaurant, cafeteria);  
4.35f  (Establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold and 

consumed and where no dancing or entertainment is provided);  
4.35g  (Bar or other establishment where alcoholic beverages are sold 

and where dancing is provided);  

4.35j  (Mortuary, undertaking or funeral establishment);  
4.35l  (Veterinary establishment, kennel, pet shop);  
4.35m  (sales place for new and used cars);  
4.35o  (Fast Order Food Establishment);  
4.35p  (Massage establishment); 
4.35s   (Cannabis Retail Store). 

2.  

In the Office 2 base district the provisions of Section 4.40 - Footnotes to the 
Table of Use Regulations, footnote 12, shall not apply in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District.  

3.   The conditions and required findings mentioned in this Section 20.54.3 are 
not severable, and if a court declares any such condition or required finding 
invalid, then this Section 20.54.3 shall cease to operate in its entirety, and no 
additional special permits shall be issued under its authority. 

20.54.4   Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Harvard Square Overlay District 

which meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and 
loading requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and 
Loading Requirements.

improvements in the Harvard Square Overlay District:  

(1)   Provision of public parking, preferably for short term users;  

(2)  

Improvements to public parks, or restoration of historic 
structures, monuments and other features owned by the City of 
Cambridge or other public agency or a nonprofit organization;  

(3)   Extension throughout the Harvard Square Overlay District of the 
surface improvements installed by the MBTA as part of the Red 
Line subway extension(brick sidewalks, light post, street 
furniture, etc.)  

The Harvard Square Advisory Committee shall receive and make 
comments on any proposal for the expenditure of such cash 
contributions. To the extent practicable the provision of public parking 
facilities shall be the first priority of any expenditure. The funds shall 
not be used for ordinary maintenance activities normally undertaken by 
the City of Cambridge.  

The value of the cash contribution shall be determined by the 
Community Development Department assuming equivalent structured 
parking spaces and using generally accepted cost estimation methods 
customarily used by architects and engineers or using actual 
construction costs for comparable contemporary parking construction in 
Cambridge.  

b.   The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a 

development pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the 
retention of existing structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a 
specific finding shall be made that this objective has been met).

The following text of the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition contains amendments 
proposed by the Petitioner (additions in underline, deletions in strikethrough) and incorporates 
revisions recommended by the Planning Board at its meeting on November 19, 2019 (additions 
in double underline, deletions in double strikethrough). All changes are highlighted.

2.a

c.   The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from 

parking and loading requirements will result in a building design that is 
more appropriate to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and 
that it is in conformance with the objectives and criteria contained in 
Harvard Square Development Guidelines.  

d.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and  

e.   No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or 
altered so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) 
years preceding the application. 

20.54.5   Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's 

positive diversity of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards 
and courtyards is encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to 
permit design flexibility to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the 
character of the area within which it is located. To this end any building in the 
Harvard Square Overlay District shall be exempt from the yard requirements as 
specified in Section 5.30, (except where such yard abuts a lot, but not a public 
way, outside the Overlay District) if the following conditions are met:  

1.   The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been 

issued by that date, or  

2.   For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning 

district, for which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the 
Planning Board issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard 
requirements provided:  

a.   The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the 
objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development 
Guidelines.  

b.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and  

c.   No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the 

site in the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation or demolished prior to the 
application.

The following text of the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition contains amendments 
proposed by the Petitioner (additions in underline, deletions in strikethrough) and incorporates 
revisions recommended by the Planning Board at its meeting on November 19, 2019 (additions 
in double underline, deletions in double strikethrough). All changes are highlighted. 
 

20.54.6   Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area (FAR) in the Harvard Square 

Historic Overlay District. Notwithstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 
5.000 or elsewhere in this Ordinance, the maximum FAR applicable in the 
Harvard Square Historic Overlay District shall be as follows: Business B district: 
4.0 for all Non-Residential Uses and 4.0 for all Residential Uses (4.31 a-h) uses 
except dwellings, 3.0 for dwellings; Office 3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Office 2 
district: 2.0 for all uses; Residence C-3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Residence C-2B 
district: 1.75 for all uses; Residence C-1 district: 0.75 for all uses; Business A 
district: 1.0 for all uses except dwellings, 1.75 for dwellings.  

20.54.7   Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit 

granting authority may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot 
located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for any residential use in 
section 4.31 (a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or 4.35 provided the use 
and design complies with the goals and design guidelines set forth in the Harvard 
Square Conservation District. 

20.54.8   FAR Exemption for Ground Floor Retail. Retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or 

less shall be excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio. 

20.54.9   Restricted Uses. No bank or financial institution (Section 4.34e) or Cannabis 

Retail Store (Section 11.803.1), shall occupy more than twenty (20’) feet of 
building frontage within the Harvard Square Overlay, and no more than thirty 
percent (30%) of a lot’s aggregate ground-floor building frontage facing one or 
more public streets may be occupied by such uses.  

Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as 
identified in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of 
the ground-floor level frontage of a building facing a street, measured 
horizontally parallel to that street. In addition, such uses shall not occupy more 
than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s total horizontal ground-floor building 
frontage aggregated over one or more streets. The Planning Board may grant a 
special permit to allow a minor increase in the permitted frontage upon finding 
that such increase would create a result that is more compatible with the unique 
conditions of a particular building or site and that the criteria set forth in Section 
20.53.2 above are met. 

The Planning Board 
recommended 
removing the proposed 
frontage restrictions 
on Cannabis Retail 
Stores and proposed a 
reformulation of the 
limitation on bank 
frontage to allow 25’ 
with modifications by 
special permit. Staff 
suggests separating 
this provision from the 
subsequent provisions 
for Fast Order Food 
Establishments. 

20.54.10   Fast Order Food Establishments (as identified in Section 4.35o) are allowed by 
right within the Harvard Square Overlay District and are further not subject to 
the provisions of Article 11.30 of this Ordinance provided the Fast Order Food 
Establishment is not a Formula Business.

The following text of the Harvard Square Overlay District Zoning Petition contains amendments 
proposed by the Petitioner (additions in underline, deletions in strikethrough) and incorporates 
revisions recommended by the Planning Board at its meeting on November 19, 2019 (additions 
in double underline, deletions in double strikethrough). All changes are highlighted. 
 

20.55.1   All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic 

2
2.a

District, except as modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow 
greater flexibility in the size, location and illumination of signs in order to 
encourage more thoughtful design of individual signs, to encourage greater 
respect for the building and visual context within which new signs are erected, 
and thereby add interest and character to the shopping environment in Harvard 
Square.  

1.  

In Section 7.16.22 - Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts, 
Paragraphs A, B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts. 
However, no sign on the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet 
above grade.  

2.  

In Section 7.16.3 - Application of the Sign Frontage Formula shall not apply.  

3.  

In the Residence C-2B base district the provisions of Section 7.16.22 shall 
apply to permitted or legally established nonconforming office and retail 
uses.

and Guidelines which shall be governed by the regulations and procedures specified in this 
Section 20.50. It is the intent of this section that these regulations will apply to an area 
described generally as the Harvard Square business district and certain abutting portions of 
the neighborhoods around it. 

20.51.1   The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on the Zoning 

Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square Historic Overlay 
District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay district that is encompassed 
by any historic district duly established by the City Council under the authority granted 
by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts or any Neighborhood Conservation District established by the City 
Council under the provisions of chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. All 
provisions of the Harvard Square Overlay District and all references to it in this 
Ordinance shall apply equally to the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District except as 
set forth below.  

General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning 
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to the 
Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more careful 
public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban form of the 
Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the extreme development 
pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique functional environment and 
visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the functional impacts of new development 
on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to maintain the present diversity of development 
and open space patterns and building scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory 
flexibility to advance the general purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility 
granted to development within the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to 
facilitate the protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of 
Harvard Square while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate 
contemporary changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. 
General Provisions.  

The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special planning 
concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, Development 
Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development Consultation Procedure 
specified in Article 19.40 except that any Large Project Review (new buildings of 2,000 
square feet or more) shall be conducted by the Harvard Square Advisory Committee 
using procedures specified in Subsection 20.54.1 of this Section 20.50.

20.53.3  National Register and Contributing Buildings. For the purposes of this Section 20.50 the 

Permits and Variances. In reviewing applications for variances, special permits or 
development consultation reviews the permit or special permit granting authority or the 
Harvard Square Advisory Committee shall be guided by the objectives and criteria 
contained in the publication Harvard Square Development Guidelines [Document 
complied from the Guidelines for Development and Historic Preservation as contained 
in the Final Report of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study 
Committee, dated November 29, 2000 and the Harvard Square Development 
Guidelines, 1986], in addition to the requirements of Sections 10.30 (Variances) and 
10.40 (Special Permits) and this Section 20.50. These guidelines are also intended to 
assist in shaping any contemplated physical change within the Harvard Square Overlay 
District  

following definitions shall apply:  
1.  National Register Building shall be a building individually listed or determined eligible 

for the National Register of Historic Places as determined by the Secretary of the 
Department of the Interior.  

2.  A contributing building shall be:  

a.  Identified as a contributing building in a listed or eligible National Register 
District as determined by the Secretary of the Department of Interior; or  

b.  A building located outside a National Register District but identified as a 
contributing building in the Harvard Square Development Guidelines, 
Community Development Department, July 1, 1986.  

However, a building shall no longer be considered a contributing building as defined in 
this Subsection 20.53.3(b) for the purposes of this Section 20.50 if, upon application for 
a demolition permit, the Cambridge Historical Commission shall determine the building 
not to be a preferably preserved significant building as defined in the City of Cambridge 
Demolition Ordinance. 

Advisory Committee, with members appointed by the City Manager, which shall have the 
following duties, responsibilities, and membership.  
1.  Purpose. It is the intent of this Subsection 20.54.1 that the Committee shall in its 

official actions fulfill the following purposes.  
a.  To establish a formal, ongoing body that will review all major development 

actions in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  

b.  To provide a forum within which a wide range of perspectives on development 

actions can be heard.  

c.   To support local businesses and uses that enhance the vibrancy and historical 
nature of Harvard Square with the aspirational goal of maintaining a seventy 
percent local and non-formula retail experience throughout the district, at the 
ground floor level. 

d.   To establish a citizen/professional body which can advise both public agencies 
and private interests as to the development and urban design issues raised by a 
development or planning proposal and suggest avenues of research which 
might be pursued to resolve identified conflicts or make the project better 
fulfill both public and private objectives for the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

2.  Responsibilities. The Committee shall undertake all Large Project Reviews and shall 

receive all applications for variances and special permits for activities within the 

20.54    

Detailed Provisions .  

20.54.1  Harvard Square Advisory Committee. There shall be established a Harvard Square 

Packet Pg. 149

Harvard Square Overlay District for review and comment. In addition, the 
Committee may comment on any preliminary proposal for which any public agency 
or private interest has planned for the Overlay. The Committee shall meet on an 
approximately monthly basis or with as much frequency as is needed to address 
pertinent issues in the Harvard Square Overlay District, with the schedule to be 
determined at the discretion of the Chair. 

3.  Procedures.  

a.  Within six (6) months preceding any application for (1) a building permit for 

any project subject to Large Project Development Consultation Review or (2) 
a special permit or variance for any project within the Harvard Square 
Overlay District, the graphic and other material required in Section 19.43.2 - 
Application for a Large Project Review shall be submitted to the Harvard 
Square Advisory Committee for their review and comment.  

b.  Within thirty (30) days of that submittal, [or within up to sixty (60) days with 
the written consent of the applicant] the Committee shall prepare a written 
report of findings and recommendations with respect to the applicant's 
proposed project.  

c.  The Committee's written report shall outline the urban design and development 
issues raised by the proposal. It shall suggest those areas within which 
additional exploration of alternatives might be sought or factual information 
gathered which might help to resolve potential conflicts between the public 
and private objectives or which help to shape the project to better serve these 
objectives.  

d.  The report shall be forwarded to the applicant and shall be included in any 

application for a building permit, special permit or variance.  

e.  It is expected that, in making decisions regarding special permits and variances 
within the Overlay District, the Planning Board and/or Zoning Board of 
Appeal will give due consideration to the report and recommendations of the 
Advisory Committee. Where the Committee makes recommendations with 
respect to the granting of special permits and/or variances, and the Planning 
Board and/or Zoning Board of Appeal does not follow said 
recommendations, then the Board(s) shall make written reply to the 
Committee, detailing why the Board(s)'s decisions were different from the 
Committee recommendations.  

f.  The Community Development staff shall serve as staff to the Committee.

members shall have terms of three years each. On an annual basis at the first 
meeting in September the Harvard Square Advisory Committee will elect a 
Chair who may serve no more than two (2) years as chair within a three (3) 
year period. 

20.54.2     Building Height Limitations. The maximum height of buildings in the Harvard Square 

Overlay District shall be governed by the requirements of this Section 20.54.2; however, 
at locations where the base zoning district establishes a more restrictive height 
limitation, the more restrictive shall apply.  
1.  As of Right Height Limitations. The maximum height of any building shall be sixty 

20.54.3  Retail, Business, and Consumer Service Establishments (Section 4.35) in Office and 

(60) feet.  

2.  Special Permit for Additional Height. The maximum allowable height in the Harvard 
Square Overlay District may be increased up to eighty (80) feet upon issuance of a 
Special Permit by the Planning Board. If a Special Permit is issued portions of the 
building may extend to eighty (80) feet in height provided that those portions in 
excess of sixty (60) feet are set back from the street line at least ten (10) feet, and 
that those portions are also set back from one or more forty-five (45) degree sky 
exposure planes, unless otherwise permitted by the Planning Board. A forty-five 
(45) degree sky exposure plane shall be an imaginary inclined plane beginning fifty-
five (55) feet above any streetline in the districts and rising over one or more lots at 
a forty-five (45 ) degree angle.  

3.  Deleted. 

Residential Districts.  
1.  Any retail use (4.35) allowed in the Business B zoning districts, as of right, within the 
Overlay may also be allowed as of right in any office or residential zone within the 
Overlay provided the structure that contains the use has a main entrance on 
Massachusetts Avenue, Mt. Auburn Street, Arrow Street or Bow Street. For all other 
lots, the Planning Board may allow by special permit the retail use of a lot or 
structure all or partially within the Harvard Square Overlay District and in a base 
residential or office district where retail uses are not permitted under the provisions 
of Section 4.30 - Table of Use Regulations; provided, however, that the following 
conditions are met:  
a.  The general purposes of this Section 20.50 are met.  
b.  The use will be located in a structure in existence as of June 1, 1985.  
c.  The addition of such use(s) will assist in the preservation, rehabilitation and/or 
restoration of a National Register or contributing building or important open 
space by increasing the economic feasibility of maintaining such features.  

d.  The preservation of the buildings and open space identified in (c) above is 

assured through an approved mechanism for the full period that the special 
permit is in force and effect.  

e.  The proposed use will preserve, rehabilitate or restore the outward appearance 

f.  In its operation the use will not, in impact, be significantly different from the 

of the structure or open space.  

uses permitted in the base district.  

g.  The use is completely contained within the structure.  
h.  The use will be patronized substantially by pedestrians and will, if required by 
the Planning Board, function adequately without additional off street parking 
or loading facilities and will in any case not generate vehicular traffic in 
quantity and type substantially different from that generated by permitted 
uses.  

i.  The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.  

Packet Pg. 151

4

j.  The use is not a formula business. 
k.   The following uses listed in Section 4.35 are however specifically prohibited:  

4.35j  (Mortuary, undertaking or funeral establishment);  
4.35l  (Veterinary establishment, kennel, pet shop);  
4.35m  (Sales place for new and used cars);  
4.35o  (Fast Order Food Establishment);  
4.35p  (Massage establishment); 
4.35s   (Cannabis Retail Store). 

2.  In the Office 2 base district the provisions of Section 4.40 - Footnotes to the Table of 
Use Regulations, footnote 12, shall not apply in the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

20.54.4  Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Harvard Square Overlay District which 

meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and loading 
requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and Loading 
Requirements.  
1.  The use is contained within a structure or portion of a structure in existence on or 
before June 1, 1940 or if constructed later is identified as a National Register or 
contributing building; or  

2.  The use is contained in a new structure or new addition to a structure identified in 
(1.) above, after the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board provided:  
a.  The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a development 

pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the retention of existing 
structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a specific finding shall be 
made that this objective has been met).  

b.  The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from parking and 

loading requirements will result in a building design that is more appropriate 
to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and that it is in 
conformance with the objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square 
Development Guidelines.  

c.  No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing 
building; and  

d.  No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or altered 
so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) years 
preceding the application. 

of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards and courtyards is 
encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to permit design flexibility 
to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the character of the area within 
which it is located. To this end any building in the Harvard Square Overlay District shall 
be exempt from the yard requirements as specified in Section 5.30, (except where such 
yard abuts a lot, but not a public way, outside the Overlay District) if the following 
conditions are met:  
1.  The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been issued by 

that date, or  

2.  For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning district, for 
which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the Planning Board 
issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard requirements provided:  
a.  The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the objectives 

20.54.5  Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's positive diversity 

Packet Pg. 152

4

and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development Guidelines.  

b.  No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register or contributing 
building; and  

c.  No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the site in 

the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to terminate or 
preclude its designation or demolished prior to the application.  

20.54.6  Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area (FAR) in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay 
District. Notwithstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 5.000 or elsewhere in this 
Ordinance, the maximum FAR applicable in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District 
shall be as follows: Business B district: 4.0 for all Non-Residential Uses and 4.0 for all 
Residential Uses (4.31 a-h; Office 3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Office 2 district: 2.0 for all 
uses; Residence C-3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Residence C-2B district: 1.75 for all uses; 
Residence C-1 district: 0.75 for all uses; Business A district: 1.0 for all uses except 
dwellings, 1.75 for dwellings.  

20.54.7  Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit granting 

authority may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot in the Business 
B district located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for any residential use in 
section 4.31 (a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or 4.35 provided the use and 
design complies with the goals and design guidelines set forth in the Harvard Square 
Conservation District. 

20.54.8  FAR Exemption for Ground Floor Retail. Retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or less shall be 

excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio. 

20.54.9  Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as identified 

in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of the ground-floor 
level frontage of a building facing a street, measured horizontally parallel to that street. 
In addition, such uses shall not occupy more than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s 
total horizontal ground-floor building frontage aggregated over one or more streets. 
The Planning Board may grant a special permit to allow a minor increase in the 
permitted frontage upon finding that such increase would create a result that is more 
compatible with the unique conditions of a particular building or site and that the 
criteria set forth in Section 20.53.2 above are met. 

20.54.10   Fast Order Food Establishments (as identified in Section 4.35o) are allowed by right 

within the Harvard Square Overlay District and are further not subject to the provisions 
of Article 11.30 of this Ordinance provided the Fast Order Food Establishment is not a 
Formula Business. 

20.55  Sign Regulations in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District.  

20.55.1  All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic District, except as 
modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow greater flexibility in the 
size, location and illumination of signs in order to encourage more thoughtful design of 
individual signs, to encourage greater respect for the building and visual context within 
which new signs are erected, and thereby add interest and character to the shopping 
environment in Harvard Square.  
1.  In Section 7.16.22 - Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts, Paragraphs A, 

B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts. However, no sign on 
the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet above grade.  
2.  In Section 7.16.3 - Application of the Sign Frontage Formula shall not apply.  
3.  In the Residence C-2B base district the provisions of Section 7.16.22 shall apply to 

Packet Pg. 153

permitted or legally established nonconforming office and retail uses.

As Amended by the Ordinance Committee on January 30, 2020. 

All changes are highlighted.  Additions are underlined and deletions are striked though 

 

20.50 

20.51  

20.52  

HARVARD SQUARE OVERLAY DISTRICT AND HARVARD SQUARE 
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT 

  Establishment and Scope. There is hereby established the Harvard Square Overlay 
District and, the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District, and Harvard Square 
Conservation District Goals and Guidelines which shall be governed by the 
regulations and procedures specified in this Section 20.50. It is the intent of this 
section that these regulations will apply to an area described generally as the Harvard 
Square business district and certain abutting portions of the neighborhoods around it. 

20.51.1  

 The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be that overlay district established on 
the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge by Section 3.20. The Harvard Square 
Historic Overlay District shall be that portion of the Harvard Square Overlay 
district that is encompassed by any historic district duly established by the City 
Council under the authority granted by the City of Cambridge by Chapter 40C of 
the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any Neighborhood 
Conservation District established by the City Council under the provisions of 
chapter 2.78 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. All provisions of the Harvard 
Square Overlay District and all references to it in this Ordinance shall apply 
equally to the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District except as set forth below.  

  General Purpose. It is the purpose of this Section 20.50 to augment existing zoning 
regulations to respond to the unique problems and pressures for change particular to 
the Harvard Square area. The regulations contained in said section provide for more 
careful public scrutiny of development proposals that may alter the established urban 
form of the Harvard Square area. These regulations are intended to channel the 
extreme development pressures in ways which will preserve and enhance the unique 
functional environment and visual character of Harvard Square; to mitigate the 
functional impacts of new development on adjacent residential neighborhoods; to 
maintain the present diversity of development and open space patterns and building 
scales and ages; and to provide sufficient regulatory flexibility to advance the general 
purposes of this Section 20.52. The additional flexibility granted to development 
within the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District is intended to facilitate the 
protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of Harvard Square 
while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary 
changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area. 

20.53  

  General Provisions.  

20.53.1   The Harvard Square Overlay District shall be considered an area of special 

planning concern. Development proposals listed in Subsection 19.42 and 19.43, 
Development Consultation Procedures, shall be subject to the Development

from the uses permitted in the base district.  

g.   The use is completely contained within the structure.  
h.   The use will be patronized substantially by pedestrians and will, if 

required by the Planning Board, function adequately without additional 
off street parking or loading facilities and will in any case not generate 
vehicular traffic in quantity and type substantially different from that 
generated by permitted uses.

i.   The applicant can demonstrate a need for the use(s) as a service to 

adjacent residential communities or to the academic community and 
can demonstrate that for economic or other reasons the use cannot 
easily be located in existing business or office districts where the use is 
permitted. In addition the applicant must demonstrate that either the use 
has been displaced as result of redevelopment elsewhere in the Harvard 
Square Overlay District, or that the use is important in its contribution 
to the variety, continuity, or uniqueness of the Harvard Square Overlay 
District.  

ji.   The retail use does not take the place of a residential or dormitory use.  
kj.   The use is not a formula business. 
lk.   The proposed use is not located in a base Residence C-2B or Office 2 

District. The following uses listed in Section 4.35 are however 
specifically prohibited:  
4.35e  (Lunchroom, restaurant, cafeteria);  
4.35f  (Establishments where alcoholic beverages are sold and 

consumed and where no dancing or entertainment is provided);  
4.35g  (Bar or other establishment where alcoholic beverages are sold

2.  

In the Office 2 base district the provisions of Section 4.40 - Footnotes to the 
Table of Use Regulations, footnote 12, shall not apply in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District.  

3.   The conditions and required findings mentioned in this Section 20.54.3 are 
not severable, and if a court declares any such condition or required finding 
invalid, then this Section 20.54.3 shall cease to operate in its entirety, and no 
additional special permits shall be issued under its authority. 

20.54.4   Parking and Loading Requirements. Uses in the Harvard Square Overlay District 

which meet the following requirements shall be exempt from the parking and 
loading requirements as specified in Section 6.36 - Schedule of Parking and 
Loading Requirements.  

1.   The use is contained within a structure or portion of a structure in existence 

on or before June 1, 1940 or if constructed later is identified as a National

2.   The use is contained in a new structure or new addition to a structure 

identified in (1.) above, after the issuance of a special permit by the Planning 
Board provided:  

a.   The total development authorized on the site is reduced to eighty (80) 
percent of the maximum permitted on the lot; or a cash contribution is

made to the Harvard Square Improvement Fund to be established by the 
City of Cambridge in an amount equal to fifty (50) percent of the cost 
of construction of the spaces not provided, said contribution to be used 
by the City of Cambridge for one or more of the following capital 
improvements in the Harvard Square Overlay District:  

(1)   Provision of public parking, preferably for short term users;  

(2)  

Improvements to public parks, or restoration of historic 
structures, monuments and other features owned by the City of 
Cambridge or other public agency or a nonprofit organization;  

(3)   Extension throughout the Harvard Square Overlay District of the 
surface improvements installed by the MBTA as part of the Red 
Line subway extension(brick sidewalks, light post, street 
furniture, etc.)  

The Harvard Square Advisory Committee shall receive and make 
comments on any proposal for the expenditure of such cash 
contributions. To the extent practicable the provision of public parking 
facilities shall be the first priority of any expenditure. The funds shall 
not be used for ordinary maintenance activities normally undertaken by 
the City of Cambridge.  

The value of the cash contribution shall be determined by the 
Community Development Department assuming equivalent structured 
parking spaces and using generally accepted cost estimation methods 
customarily used by architects and engineers or using actual 
construction costs for comparable contemporary parking construction in 
Cambridge.  

ab.   The subject lot is sufficiently small in size as to contribute to a 

development pattern of diverse, small scale, new structures and the 
retention of existing structures (for lots exceeding 10,000 square feet a 
specific finding shall be made that this objective has been met).  

bc.   The Planning Board shall specifically find that an exemption from 

parking and loading requirements will result in a building design that is 
more appropriate to its location and the fabric of its neighborhood and 
that it is in conformance with the objectives and criteria contained in 
Harvard Square Development Guidelines.  

cd.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and

de.   No National Register or contributing building has been demolished or 
altered so as to terminate or preclude its designation within the five (5) 
years preceding the application. 

20.54.5   Building Setbacks. Maintenance of the Harvard Square Overlay District's 

positive diversity of building form and scale and its variety of open spaces, yards 
and courtyards is encouraged throughout the District. It is therefore desirable to 
permit design flexibility to allow any physical change in the District to reflect the 
character of the area within which it is located. To this end any building in the 
Harvard Square Overlay District shall be exempt from the yard requirements as 
specified in Section 5.30, (except where such yard abuts a lot, but not a public 
way, outside the Overlay District) if the following conditions are met:  

1.   The building existed as of December 15, 1985 or a building permit had been 

issued by that date, or  

2.   For any new building in any Business, Office or Residence C-3 base-zoning 

district, for which a building permit is issued after December 15, 1985, the 
Planning Board issues a Special Permit exempting the building from yard 
requirements provided:  

a.   The design of the new structure shall be in conformance with the 
objectives and criteria contained in Harvard Square Development 
Guidelines.  

b.   No National Register or contributing building is demolished or so 

altered as to terminate or preclude its designation as a National Register 
or contributing building; and  

c.   No National Register or contributing building previously existed on the 

site in the preceding five (5) years and which has been so altered as to 
terminate or preclude its designation or demolished prior to the 
application.  

20.54.6   Maximum Ratio of Floor Area to Lot Area (FAR) in the Harvard Square 

Historic Overlay District. Notwithstanding the FAR limits set forth in Article 
5.000 or elsewhere in this Ordinance, the maximum FAR applicable in the 
Harvard Square Historic Overlay District shall be as follows: Business B district: 
4.0 for all Non-Residential Uses and 4.0 for all Residential Uses (4.31 a-h) uses 
except dwellings, 3.0 for dwellings; Office 3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Office 2 
district: 2.0 for all uses; Residence C-3 district: 3.0 for all uses; Residence C-2B 
district: 1.75 for all uses; Residence C-1 district: 0.75 for all uses; Business A 
district: 1.0 for all uses except dwellings, 1.75 for dwellings.  

20.54.7   Additional FAR. Upon the issuance of a special permit, the special permit 

granting authority may increase the allowable FAR on any lot or portion of a lot 
in the Business B district located within the Harvard Square Overlay District for 
any residential use in section 4.31 (a-h) or any commercial use in section 4.34 or

4.35 provided the use and design complies with the goals and design guidelines 
set forth in the Harvard Square Conservation District. 

20.54.8   FAR Exemption for Ground Floor Retail. Retail spaces of 1,500 square feet or 

less shall be excluded from the calculation of floor area ratio. 

20.54.9   Restricted Uses. No bank or financial institution (Section 4.34e) or Cannabis 

Retail Store (Section 11.803.1), shall occupy more than twenty (20’) feet of 
building frontage within the Harvard Square Overlay, and no more than thirty 
percent (30%) of a lot’s aggregate ground-floor building frontage facing one or 
more public streets may be occupied by such uses.  

Frontage Restrictions. Banks, trust companies, or similar financial institutions as 
identified in Section 4.34e shall occupy no more than twenty-five feet (25’) of 
the ground-floor level frontage of a building facing a street, measured 
horizontally parallel to that street. In addition, such uses shall not occupy more 
than thirty percent (30%) of a building’s total horizontal ground-floor building 
frontage aggregated over one or more streets. The Planning Board may grant a 
special permit to allow a minor increase in the permitted frontage upon finding 
that such increase would create a result that is more compatible with the unique 
conditions of a particular building or site and that the criteria set forth in Section 
20.53.2 above are met. 

20.54.10   Fast Order Food Establishments (as identified in Section 4.35o) are allowed by 
right within the Harvard Square Overlay District and are further not subject to 
the provisions of Article 11.30 of this Ordinance provided the Fast Order Food 
Establishment is not a Formula Business. 

20.55   Sign Regulations in the Harvard Square Historic Overlay District.  

20.55.1   All provisions of Article 7.000 shall apply in the Harvard Square Historic 

District, except as modified below. It is the intent of these modifications to allow 
greater flexibility in the size, location and illumination of signs in order to 
encourage more thoughtful design of individual signs, to encourage greater 
respect for the building and visual context within which new signs are erected, 
and thereby add interest and character to the shopping environment in Harvard 
Square.  

1.  

In Section 7.16.22 - Signs in all Business, Office and Industrial Districts, 
Paragraphs A, B, and C shall not apply in office and business base districts. 
However, no sign on the outside of a building may extend higher than 20 feet 
above grade.  

2.  

In Section 7.16.3 - Application of the Sign Frontage Formula shall not apply.  

3.  

In the Residence C-2B base district the provisions of Section 7.16.22 shall 
apply to permitted or legally established nonconforming office and retail 
uses.
