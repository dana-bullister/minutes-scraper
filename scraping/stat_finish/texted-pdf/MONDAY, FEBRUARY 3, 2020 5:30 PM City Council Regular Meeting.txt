To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby recommending that in accordance with the requirements of the Massachusetts 
School Building Authority (MSBA), the Cambridge City Council adopt the attached order for the 
Statement of Interest Form to be submitted to the MSBA no later than February 14, 2020 for the 
replacement of windows at the Cambridgeport School Building located at 89 Elm Street.    
 
The Elm Street building’s windows are currently forty years old, with worn out balances, springs 
and operating sash hardware.  Cold air leakage frequently overwhelms the heating system, 
making it difficult to maintain classroom temperatures on cold days.  There is much loss of 
energy due to the age and construction of the existing windows.  The estimated total project cost 
for the windows replacement is $2,500,000.   The purpose of applying for the grant is to get 
partial reimbursement for the project.   
 
The School Committee of Cambridge, Massachusetts voted to authorize the Superintendent to 
submit the Statement of Interest Form to the MSBA at an open meeting held on January 21, 
2020. 
 
The MSBA submission of the Statement of Interest Form, in no way guarantees the acceptance 
or the approval of an application, the awarding of a grant or any other funding commitment from 
the MSBA or commits the City/ School District to filing an application for funding with the 
MSBA.

WHEREAS: 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 
 
 
 
 
 
WHEREAS: 
 
 
 
 
ORDERED: 

Having convened in an open meeting on January 21, 2020, prior to the SOI submission 
closing date, the Cambridge School Committee of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 
accordance with its charter, by-laws, and ordinances, has voted to authorize the 
Superintendent to submit to the Massachusetts School Building Authority the 
Statement of Interest Form dated no later than February 14, 2020 for the 
Cambridgeport School located at 89 Elm Street, Cambridge, which describes and 
explains the following deficiencies and the priority category for which an application 
may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future; and 
 
The funds are sought to be used for the replacement of the building’s windows; and  
 
The Elm Street building’s windows are currently forty years old, with worm out 
balances, springs and operating sash hardware; cold air leakage frequently overwhelms 
the heating system making it difficult to maintain classroom temperatures on cold 
days.  There is much loss of energy due to the age and construction of existing 
windows; and  
 
This project falls under priority category 5, which is for the replacement, renovation, or 
modernization of school facility systems, such as roofs, windows, boilers, heating and 
ventilation systems to increase energy conservation and decrease energy related costs 
in a school facility, as determined in the judgement of the Authority; and 
 
The Cambridge City Council hereby further specifically acknowledges that by 
submitting this Statement of Interest Form, the Massachusetts School Building 
Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or the approval of an application, the 
awarding of a grant or any other funding commitment from the Massachusetts School 
Building Authority, or commits the City/School District to filing an application for 
funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $250,000 in additional projected sewer revenues to 
the Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account to provide funds 
for the purchase of a Catch Basin Cleaning Truck.   
 
The  Catch  Basin  Cleaning  Truck  has  a  maneuverable  boom  with  a  clam  shell  used  to  remove 
rocks,  dirt  leaves  and  litter  from  catch  basins.    The  truck  is  used  daily  during  street  cleaning 
operations  and  supports  the  Sewer  Division’s  proactive  catch  basin  cleaning  of  6,000  catch 
basins.   These efforts are critical to keep material out of the storm drains; thereby allowing them 
to function properly during storm events and improving the water quality of the receiving water 
bodies.    The  truck  also  supports  emergency  responses  to  blockages  in  the  sewer  and  drainage 
systems.      The  existing  2007  Catch  Basin  Cleaning  Truck  is  a  2007  model  and  is  in  need  of 
replacement.  The new Catch Basin Cleaning Truck is estimated to cost $250,000.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $300,000 from the Parking Fund balance to the 
Public Investment Fund Finance Extraordinary Expenses Account, to be used for a new Hybrid 
Vehicle Lottery Program for owners of Cambridge taxicab medallions.    
 
The funds were received from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in FY19. 
Pursuant to Chapter 187 of the Acts of 2016 (the “TNC Act”), such funds may be used by the 
City to address, among other things, the impact of Transportation Network Companies (“TNC”s) 
on municipal ways, other transportation infrastructure, or any other public purpose substantially 
related to the operation of TNCs, such as the reduction of carbon fuel emissions.   
 
As you are aware, I have worked closely with City staff from the Law Department, the Traffic 
Parking and Transportation Department, the License Commission, and the Finance Department 
to strategize on ways to support the taxicab industry in Cambridge.  I am proud of the 
collaborative work with these Departments that has resulted in advancing this recommendation 
to the Council. The City also received very productive feedback from both City Council and 
representatives of the taxicab industry throughout the process.   This program is one of several 
ongoing actions related to this issue, which are outlined below, and is also consistent with related 
City efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution by reducing the carbon 
footprint of passenger vehicle trips generated by vehicles fueled by gasoline or diesel engines. 
 
Funds for this program will be used towards the purchase of 10 hybrid vehicles for successful 
lottery applicants.  Additional funds will be available for successful lottery applicants that elect 
to purchase a handicap accessible vehicle to be used as a handicap accessible taxicab.   
 
In order to participate in the lottery, a medallion owner must be: 1) a Cambridge taxicab 
medallion owner in good standing with the License Commission at the time of entry in the 
lottery, who currently drives a vehicle that is fueled by gasoline or diesel; 2) if a medallion 
owner owns more than one medallion, such owner may only submit one application into the 

1.5

 

 

Packet Pg. 28

1.5

lottery; 3) if an applicant wins the lottery and is approved to receive a hybrid vehicle to be used 
exclusively as a Cambridge taxicab, then the previously used, gasoline or diesel-fueled vehicle 
must be removed from the road and not used as a Cambridge taxicab.  The medallion owner must 
agree to use the new hybrid car as a Cambridge taxicab for a period of not less than (5) years and 
will be required to post a bond to ensure compliance with the provisions of the agreement with 
the City.   
 
The City of Cambridge recognizes the challenges facing the taxicab industry, especially 
considering the significant adverse impacts on the taxicab industry due to the rapid increase of 
TNC trips originating in the City over the past several years, as well as changes in technology.     
 
In addition to the Hybrid Vehicle Lottery Program, several other City efforts are currently 
underway to help the taxicab industry in Cambridge remain a viable part of the City’s diverse 
economic base. including, but not limited to: 
 
On January 24, 2020, Waave became the first e-hail application to be licensed as a radio dispatch 
service in the City of Cambridge.  Waave is a mobile application that provides technology to 
licensed taxis to assist with obtaining rides, providing price prediction and payment online 
through the application.   Waave is currently working on implementing the application in 
Cambridge and once it goes live, the License Commission will send out a communication to 
drivers and owners with information on how to sign up.  The City of Cambridge will be the first 
in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to implement this application.   
 
Other initiatives include, but are not limited to: 
  

•  Taxicab medallion renewal fees have been waived by the License Commission for the 
last 4 fiscal years, and hackney driver’s license renewal fees have been waived by the 
License Commission for the last 3 fiscal years; 
 

•  The License Commission has made the process for new drivers to get licensed in 

Cambridge more efficient; 

 

 

 

 

 

•  City staff have had ongoing meetings, and continue to meet with taxicab industry 

stakeholders regarding challenges and concerns; 

•  The License Commission’s Hackney Officer will also have quarterly meetings with 

drivers and medallion owners to discuss trends, issues, and to provide input and further 
training;  

•  The License Commission streamlined the process for taxi drivers to cash out vouchers; 

•  The License Commission’s Hackney rules and regulations have been amended to allow 

the use of soft meters (i.e., e-hail applications); 

•  The City will continue efforts to coordinate among City departments, surrounding 

communities, airport and State agencies, and other relevant associations, on strategies to 
expand the customer base; 

Packet Pg. 29

1.5

 

 

 

•  The License Commission has now posted applications for renewal of licenses and 

medallions online; 

•  The License Commission has streamlined the process for taxicab vehicle inspections; and 

•  The License Commission is coordinating a meeting with “Curb Mobility” (a state 

approved vendor with an e-hailing application) and Cambridge taxicab drivers to explore 
whether Cambridge taxicab drivers can participate in providing paratransit ground 
transportation in the MBTA Ride Program.     
 

It is anticipated that the Hybrid Vehicle Lottery Program will commence shortly.  The program 
will be evaluated after it is initiated and if found successful, will continue annually.

The Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee

in 2020 and beyond. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan 
Welcome everyone, we're going to get started in a second. Okay, so this is a committee hearing 
by the Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations 
Committee. I will read the call to the meeting: we will conduct a public hearing to discuss ways 
to ensure that the Cambridge Carnival will take place in 2020 and beyond. This hearing is being 
televised. We do have a quorum: I'm joined by my co-chair, Councillor Carlone, as well as 
committee member Councillor Siddiqui.  So before we get started, just wanted to make a couple 
of quick announcements. Michael Monestime from the Central Square BID wanted to join us but 
unfortunately he won't be able to be here tonight. He sent us a message that said "I'm sorry my 
daughter has a performance tomorrow at her school. I want to be known that we have met with 
Nicola and the bid will support the Taste Of Carnival and Carnival itself in any and all ways 
possible.  And we also have a message from Jason Weeks, who is unable to attend, but he's 
also sent a message that says "I've been working with Nicola Williams, Mike Monestime, and 
David Kale, on Taste Of Carnival for next spring in the Cultural District. We will continue to stay 
involved and provide partnership and assistance where needed. For the annual festival, 
Cambridge Arts has served as a partner in past years. We will continue to work with the 
organization to provide support going forward. So again, just wanted to share those messages. 
And then from the community, we received communications from Our Revolution Cambridge, 
the Cambridge Residents Alliance, and Sheli Wortis sent us a letter as well that appears on the 
December 16, 2019 regular meeting agenda for the City Council. So those are all in support of 
the Carnival and continuing. So what I would like to do is welcome the city staff and start with a 
message from our Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Representative. So if you could introduce 
yourselves and share with us your your thoughts. 
 
Betsy Allen 
Good afternoon, everyone. Councillor Carlone, thank you for the invitation as well. So I want to 
thank everyone for being here and for the opportunity to speak. In the context of this hearing, I 
feel it's important to clarify that as the City's Director of Equity & Inclusion, my work is internally

directed in that I collaborate with all employees to embed principles of diversity, equity and 
inclusion into everything that we do and how we carry our duties in service, sort of, to our 
diverse public. Let me start by stating that we, from the first day I was here and really from 
previous knowledge, that we are unequivocally and unquestionably committed to diversity. We 
are also firmly committed to the principles of equity, inclusion, and equal access to resources. 
All of this is our firm belief that if we cultivate an environment of equity, inclusion and diversity, 
that only serves to provide the excellent unparalleled customer service that we feel our public 
deserves. So, that’s really at the core- customer service- is really at the core of everything that 
we do.  So we talk a little bit about equity. We believe that equity is allowing impartial access to 
opportunities and resources and support to everyone. And for years, the city has been 
committed to DEI projects (that’s the shorthand I'm going to use, so I don't have to keep saying 
diversity, equity and inclusion, so DEI). But in 2017, we really ratcheted up our efforts when we 
launched the Cambridge Equity and Inclusion Initiative. This initiative is headed by the Deputy 
City Manager Lisa Peterson, and it has the full backing, support, engagement, and participation 
of the City Manager Louis DePasquale.  The reason we started with this Leadership Initiative is 
that we feel that by focusing on our top leaders, they will then permeate and help us embed the 
diversity principles into our operations and making sure that we are serving the public in the 
most inclusive, equitable and excellent way possible. And so I don't want to keep going on and 
on, you can always ask questions later. But we feel that in order for all of our efforts to be 
sustainable, adaptable and have accountability, we must have the structure to support that. And 
so we've partnered with an organization to do what we're calling a “recruitment hire and 
promotion project”, to look at how we're doing recruitment promotion, and hiring, to make it more 
equitable and more inclusive. And so, one of the other things I wanted to mention is that as part 
of our initiative, the city's top leadership, including the City Manager, Commissioner Bard, Mr. 
Kale and the chief here, they all have been through identity awareness training, race and 
structural racism training. They've been through microaggression training. In January we'll have 
an expert come in to do a full day training on microaggression for over 70 staff members, and 
also an implicit bias training in the spring. In addition to that, we have bi-monthly learning 
sessions about how to build cultural competencies and inclusive leadership skills. Everything 
that we do is about serving the public better. It's about providing that equitable customer service 
that our community deserves. With that, I want to thank you for inviting me and I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you so much. We really appreciate the commitment to DEI that has been shown. And so 
what I'd like to do next is we'll hear from Nicola Williams from the Carnival Committee. And we'll 
do about 20 minutes of presentation and then we'll hear from the City Manager and the Police 
Commissioner on the end of the Carnival, what happened, and then how we can move forward 
and then we'll have an opportunity for public comment and then we'll come back to some more 
discussion about making sure that Carnival 2020 takes place. 
 
Nicola Williams  
Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Carlone, and Councillor 
Siddiqui for being here. Appreciate it as well as the Manager and city staff and Commissioner 
and the community, including members of the Carnival Committee, on the coldest day of the 
year. I'm glad to be here. Oh, thank you for Councillor Mallon as well. So what do we intend to 
accomplish today? introductions, history of Carnival, I'm going to go through that very quickly. 
History of Cambridge Carnival, our programs and then I’ll focus more on preserving our legacy 
and the future of Carnival. So we hope to have a better understanding of Carnival in general, 
and learn about our 27 years of history, and plan for our next steps. So this is our Carnival and 
when I say our Carnival, our theme is planned by the people for the people. That's how all

carnivals are planned across the world. It's a grassroots community-led event. Our mission is to 
produce an annual festival, and organize year round cultural events, and sharing the diversity of 
Cambridge and South American cultures with the community, and, you know, support cross 
cultural understanding, and we do that through our annual festival, and accompanying events. 
Carnival across the world represents a celebration of freedom and diversity. Cambridge 
Carnival is one of the largest festivals in Cambridge and the longest running festival celebrating 
the Caribbean and African Diaspora. Our festival stakeholders to make this work are Mas Bands 
which are the costume groups, steel bands, and our artists. And it's held in Central Square 
Cultural District since its beginning. That's definitely been the heart and soul of Carnival- Central 
Square.  A snapshot of Carnival across the world: You have it in your document but there are 24 
carnivals across the US, and around the same number across the UK. Germany has one and 
many countries internationally, France etc. have carnivals. The largest Carnival in the northern 
hemisphere is Toronto. And then we we have Notting Hill, New York, Boston. So we have 
carnivals all over the world and most of them are free. The one in Miami does charge a fee. It's 
contained in a big stadium. But most of them are free. London did a study, I did actually do 
some did some work for the mayor there on their largest cultural event which is Notting Hill 
Carnival, and the study identified it generated 93 million pounds for the City of London. The 
Toronto Carnival generates $400 million for the city of Ontario.  So how we began, we were 
formed in 1992 with community members. It was important that Cambridge celebrates its 
Caribbean heritage, because a number of community members who were of Caribbean descent 
wanted to acknowledge Cambridge's long history of Caribbean people. Especially those from 
Barbados who settled in the early 1900s in Cambridge. Other ethnic groups came along, 
Caribbean groups and South American groups afterwards, but the largest representation of the 
Caribbean population in Cambridge is from Barbados. If you kind of ask most people have been 
here for generations, their lineage is from Barbados. It was actually sanctioned by (back then) 
Mayor Reeves. He appointed me as a community representative to help this group of people 
who wanted to start a carnival, and I've been part of it ever since. The city matched funds that 
the carnival committee raised, $1500, and that's how we started. It's based on Trinidad and 
Brazilian models with an international focus and we raised money through the jamborees that 
we did in Carl Barron Square. And over the years, we've sort of evolved we've moved from 
Central Square to Kendall Square, because we outgrew it. And so the first 10 years we were in 
Central Square, and we ended up in Kendall Square in 2005. Our current programs- we have an 
annual International Festival and Parade. We have community collaborations with various 
community groups identified. We do a lot of community engagement through the River Festival, 
Mayfair, Hoops and Health, Oktoberfest, and Honk! Festival. We have the Cambridge Youth 
Steel Orchestra initiative, which is a brand new initiative. We've done a Taste of Carnival before, 
and thanks to the city support we are able to bring it back.  Carnival operations- we are 
committee of mainly volunteers. Most of our funding comes from vendors, a little bit from 
sponsors. We used to have more sponsorship in the past but that has waned over the years. 
The city covers core services such as public safety, police, fire, and traffic. We are seriously 
under resourced. Ideally, a festival budget should be $150,000. We heavily rely on volunteers, 
interns, and in-kind planning services to organize this event. A committee of about eight to 10 
people plan this year round with a lot of in kind services. Our performers receive honorariums 
based on what we're able to raise, and it's grossly less than what the Cambridge River Festival 
and other festivals offer for artists. This is a snapshot of festival programming. Our Youth Steel 
Pan Program was awarded a one time grant of $40,000. We actually have a couple more pans 
to be delivered that were made for us, valued at $20,000, for our community in perpetuity.  The 
Taste of Carnival event, thanks to the support from the City Manager, and in collaboration with 
the Arts Council and the Cultural District it will be February 29. So details to follow.  So I'm going 
to focus now on a sustainability plan for Carnival for 2020 and beyond. So why do we need a 
Carnival in Cambridge? Well, Cambridge Carnival is an important and key cultural event that

needs to be recognized as such in the Central Square Cultural District. Our city seeks to 
promote diversity and celebration in all cultures, and to support and stimulate the public purpose 
of inclusivity for the city of Cambridge. So the Carnival is extremely important. When it was 
cancelled this year, I can't tell you how many youth have come up to me and they, you know, 
are very upset still and don't understand. But it's kind of like when you don't have something, 
then you realize how much more valuable it is. And certainly the community came out to raise 
their voices about the importance of Carnival. So, we need to sustain it. How do we preserve it 
and what resources would be required? So, Caribbean immigrants contributed to the history of 
Cambridge for the first hundred years, as evidenced by the individuals represented in the 
African American trail in Cambridge, and this legacy needs to be recognized and honored. Prior 
to 1992 there was no significant festival that represented the art, history, and culture of the 
significant Caribbean population in Cambridge. The Cambridge Carnival founders with the help 
of Mayor Reeves and the city launched this event. Its purpose is to unite the diverse Cambridge 
community through art, culture and celebration, and recognize freedom and the emancipation of 
slavery, which is celebrated annually for the last hundred and 85 years in the form of Carnival 
masquerade industries worldwide. Cambridge Carnival is an important and key event for the 
city. The committee believes that by improving the quality of the festival, we will improve the 
safety. Very few events in Cambridge focus on African and Caribbean culture. And that became 
very clear during the cancellation. So, sustainability. a commitment from the council to preserve 
this historical event will require a few things. First, sanctioning a comprehensive public safety 
plan for Cambridge Carnival. We do have one in place and a forum in 2005 actually started that 
process. But we believe it's time to revisit that and develop a comprehensive safety plan. Other 
cities like London, New York, and Toronto have public safety plans specifically for carnival. So 
there are reference points that we can tap and learn from. And also Boston has a process as 
well. So I think it would be something that we could benefit from. Improving the quality of the 
event is also another opportunity to sustain the event. And support for more participation from 
Cambridge residents, especially youth, who really want to get involved but don't know how. But 
but they certainly vocalize their disappointment when it doesn't happen. And employing the 
necessary resources to sustain the festival and the culture, long term. Public safety- so, the 
Cambridge Carnival Committee currently coordinates with the Cambridge Police Department. 
We have a separate meeting for the festival. And like I said, a public safety plan- an expanded 
one- is needed for Carnival at this time. We encourage our police to coordinate with law 
enforcement officials in carnival cities such as Boston, New York, and Toronto. And we also 
would like the city to commit the necessary public safety resources, to have them in place, so 
we can continue. So on improving the quality of the event. There are a couple of things that we 
could do. We need to pay our artists and performers fair and equitable fees. We need to 
increase the number of live performances by local artists. We feel by relying less on what 
someone else provides at the carnival for entertainment and having a more controlled process 
of organizing and deliberate public performances (live performances) will improve the quality of 
the event. We need to expand our kids fest program which offers free activities for our kids. We 
need a year round professional and production staff for the carnival. We don't have a 
representative that can be in command central all day, which is required from the police 
department, because we are under resourced. So that's an important part. And we need to 
expand the costume camps. We used to have them in North Cambridge and different parts of 
the city. But we'd like to expand that.  Cultural preservation: in order to preserve the legacy and 
cultural contributions of the Caribbean community, we feel that it would be great and important 
to have a Caribbean Cultural Center. We're almost 30 years old. The center will provide a 
permanent home to house our programs, including our steel orchestra. We don't store our pans, 
we have 20 pans that are stored in Boston right now. We can do community workshops, have 
meeting space, we kind of borrow space from banks, etc. to meet and it will provide a functional 
space as well.  Last slide. So we've identified some of the resources required to facilitate and

sustain the carnival. First, we need authorization of the necessary resources to develop and 
employ a comprehensive safety plan, through authorization of a line item in the city's budget. 
Our festival really would take about $150,000 for the festival to make sure that we offer fair fees 
to our artists and employee staff. $50,000 would support our steel orchestra program, and 
$50,000 will help develop new costume camps for our youth in Cambridge. There is precedent 
for a line item. The city has line items for various festivals like the River Festival, the City Dance 
Party, and other activities. We are looking for a commitment to identify and secure a Caribbean 
Cultural Center, a permanent home to house carnival. We're not expecting that to be immediate, 
but it's something to consider when community benefit opportunities come up. There is 
precedent: the city helped to identify and secure buildings to preserve the Dance Complex and 
the Cambridge Multicultural Arts Center. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Nicola. So now we'll hear from the City Manager and the Police Commissioner. 
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager   
Thank you. So, first, I want to say that I also have a long history with the carnival. Back in my 
early days when this Carnival first started, with Mayor Reeves, Manager Healey asked me to 
make sure all the finances worked and I've been working on that with Nicola on the committee 
since this time. In since becoming City Manager, I clearly have done everything I could to make 
sure that this event was supported, in that we did everything we could to make it continue. I've 
attended the last two events as City Manager, and really got to witness the culture and the 
richness of the event. I want to bring something that's real important here. There is nobody on 
this side of the table who doesn't truly understand the importance of this event and truly does 
not understand the disappointment that everybody had when we called the event off. I think 
that's real important. In 2017, when I was at the carnival, there was an incident that put some 
concerns in the community and the Commissioner will get into more detail but I quickly said to 
him that we need to have this Carnival in 2018: "do whatever it takes". And I think he will show 
how we changed things dramatically in terms of making sure that this Carnival was going to take 
place in 2018, and it did and it was great. In 2019, we continued to say how can we even do it 
better and as the commissioner will state, I clearly stated to him, "I'm not worried about the 
funds. I'm worried about making this the best possible Carnival we can do. And we are in place, 
I think, to do that again". However, when the Police Commissioner states that he has a real 
concern for the safety of the residents and the participants of any event, that is something that I 
have to take very seriously. And I can honestly say, and I think people who know me will 
understand this, there was probably no more difficult decision that I've had to make, knowing 
the importance of this to the community to have to say, "okay, we're not having the Carnival". As 
soon as we made that decision with the Police Commissioner, we reached out to Nicola. And 
the real question was, we could not have it this year, probably, but how could we do something 
to help compensate for that, and how can we get prepared for 2020? And, you know, the Taste 
of the Carnival, once we met on that, I can tell you that I really helped take a lead in making 
sure that was going to work. I reached out to Pastor Washington immediately to get the 
Christian Life Center to see if we could keep it in the Cultural District because that was 
important. I assigned David Kale to try to make the finances work. We worked with Michael 
Monestime to continue to help and support and we work with Jason Weeks. So we really have 
tried to make the best of a very difficult situation, and are looking forward to the February event. 
I think it is real important to continue to say that for 2020, now more than ever, it is incredibly 
important that we have this Carnival. And we will do everything we can, as we continue and 
have done, to make this Carnival a success. So, I'm going to turn it over on the specifics, but I 
just really want to thank everybody for working with us, for having this Carnival for all these

years, and I can assure you that on the city side, we will do whatever it takes to try not to have 
this happen next year. I'm going to turn it now over to Commissioner Bard. 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  
Good evening, Mr. Chair. I start off by saying that this year would have been my third Caribbean 
festival, and it's delightful working with the Caribbean Carnival Committee. From Nicola, 
Gregory, Miss Drucilla, Owen, everyone is fantastic to work with. I just want to frame the events 
surrounding this year's cancellation but to do that I have to talk about my first Carnival here. So 
during the 2017 Caribbean Festival, as we all know, gunfire erupted near viewing stand at 300 
Technology Square, resulting in two individuals being shot, and several other individuals being 
trampled. A secondary shooting, believed to be related to that shooting, occurred on River and 
William Street. Several houses were damaged, we recovered a large caliber weapon, and we 
made several arrests based on both of those shooting incidents. The video of that event I can 
tell you is brutally disturbing, and I've never publicly shown it or frames from it because I think it 
does damage to the reputation of the Carnival, which is, you know, a family friendly event. I 
have to point out that the event was also disrupted in 2015 and in 2016 by violence. So because 
the festival was interrupted by violence in those preceding years, after the gun violence in 2017 
I was inundated with emails and phone calls, and I believe the City Manager's office was as 
well, asking that the carnival be re-evaluated and many pleaded for it to be canceled.  
Therefore, the City Manager tasked me, after first stressing the importance of the event and the 
cultural landscape here in Cambridge, with conducting a review to make an informed 
recommendation as to whether the Carnival should be allowed to continue in 2018 and moving 
forward. So, to make an informed recommendation, a wide swath of historical and contextual 
knowledge was sought out. The following activities were undertaken by either myself or 
members of the Cambridge Police Department. We conducted a thorough review of prior 
incident action plans outlining our coverage for the festival. I conducted a thorough review of 
historical crime and incident related data pertaining to the festival, both here and in Boston. I 
met with then Superintendent and Chief William Gross of the BPD to discuss the event both 
here in Cambridge and in Boston. I held several intergovernmental meetings with departments 
most impacted by the festival. That includes obviously the police, fire, public works, inspectional 
services, special events, committee personnel, etc. Then I held several small working group 
meetings with elected officials and all, the Mayor, the Vice Mayor, and all the councillors were 
given opportunities to raise concerns and provide feedback and input. The mayor and his Chief 
of Staff continued to be assets throughout that entire fact-finding process. I conducted small 
clergy group meetings including with the police chaplains. I conducted a series of meetings 
between Cambridge Police Department and the Caribbean Carnival Committee board, who, I 
can't stress, were wonderful to work with. I can't stress that enough. I conducted several 
meetings between the Cambridge Carnival Committee board and then that larger 
intergovernmental group. We facilitated meetings between what was then the Central Square 
Business Association and the Cambridge Carnival board. We held two committee meetings, one 
in conjunction with the board, and Central Square and MIT, and then one that we held alone. 
And then we conducted several internal planning sessions where different policing strategies 
and incident accident plans were discussed and then subsequently developed. So, as a result of 
all of the information gathered from those key sources, and then several other things that we did 
that I didn't mention, several themes developed. The first theme was that the Carnival is of such 
importance in the context of celebrating the multicultural landscape represented in Cambridge, 
that its potential cancellation should not be considered without much deliberation. Two, the 
Carnival is the sole remaining Cambridge event that celebrates the heritage of the minority 
Cantabrigians. Three, the consensus was also that continued violence cannot and should not be 
tolerated. Four, although slightly more muted, most stakeholders indicated that they would defer 
to the discretion of the Cambridge Police Department and its belief as to whether it could devise

a plan that would severely reduce the likelihood of violence. And then the last one was that 
should the event be held in 2018, and should violence occur, that the event should be 
terminated for the foreseeable future in Cambridge.  Based on all of those factors, I made a 
recommendation to the City Manager that the carnival be permitted to occur in 2018. The 
recommendation was heavily influenced by the opinions of stakeholders pertaining to the 
cultural importance of the carnival, and my opinion that the likelihood for violence could be 
drastically reduced by several factors. One, we had an augmented staffing plan. Two, we 
changed our zone policing philosophy. Instead of looking at it as one large event, we broke it 
down into several zones, with a Deputy Superintendent in charge of each zone, with dedicated 
resources, and a superintendent being the overall incident commander, with me being present 
the entire time. And then we shortened the length of the Carnival, and we also augmented the 
amount of volunteers that the committee provided. So I made the recommendation that we allow 
it to occur based on that but then my final sentence of that recommendation to the City Manager 
was, "although I make this recommendation, I would ask that the City Manager allow me to 
reserve the right to alter or cancel the event should information or any situation develop that 
was seen threatened public safety if the event were allowed to occur".  So we had a wonderfully 
successful family friendly event in 2018. And you fast forward to August of 2019, And I 
recommended to the City Manager that the Caribbean festival that was scheduled for 
September 8, 2019 be canceled. Looking at the year prior and the backdrop, you know I did not 
come to this recommendation lightly. I did so because of the serious concern that gun violence 
would occur during this year's celebration. I consistently feel like I always have to point out that 
we were all set to go for 2019. We went through all of the necessary external, internal planning 
steps that we did the previous year. Much the way we had a successful event in 2018, we 
severely augmented our staffing plan. One of the bullets on on Miss Williams' presentation was 
a comprehensive public safety plan. Well, we already had a comprehensive public safety plan. 
We went from a staffing plan that costs for the Cambridge Police Department $40,000 in 2017, 
to one that cost $172,000 for the Police Department alone in 2018. And like I said, we pulled off 
a wonderfully smooth, successful event. So I already outlined how we went from treating it as 
one large event, to treating it as several smaller events in that zone policing, which worked out 
well. So we did that and many other things to prepare for this year. We were ready to go. The 
cancellation wasn't a knee jerk reaction to the violence that occurred surrounding the 
celebration in Boston. Although, I continually say of course, incidents that occur in Boston do 
play a role in the calculus for the events that occur here. I think it is key to remember that we 
went to, although this predated me, we went to a two week period and Between the Boston 
event and the Cambridge event as a cooling off period. So the recommendation this year was 
born out of a serious concern that gun violence was going to occur this year. And with the 
realization that there's no perfect public safety plan that can prevent targeted violence. I mean, 
you just got to harken back to the video of 2017, when you see an individual pull out a gun, and 
fire into a crowd of up to 40,000 people with 20 police officers within chasing distance. I mean 
very close to them. Understand that there's no perfect plan that can stop that type of targeted 
violence. So while I have the utmost confidence in the members of the Cambridge Police 
Department and our ability to successfully handle these large scale events, I can't let that 
confidence interfere with considerations when they concern matters of the highest level of public 
safety here in the city.  I didn't make the recommendation lightly. I went into it knowing that the 
carnival is of such importance in the context of celebrating the multicultural landscape in the 
city. I knew that its cancellation could not be even considered without much deliberation. And 
regrettably, as I initially went to law enforcement interventions and augmenting what was 
already an augmented plan, I remember having the epiphany of  "wait a minute, what are you 
doing? The best way to ensure that nobody gets hurt and nobody gets shot during this year's 
celebration is not to have it". So, I made a recommendation to the manager to cancel it. 
Obviously, I remain committed and the department remains committed, to ensuring that we

have the highest degree of public safety at the events moving forward. But this year, you know, 
it boils down to simple calculations. The simplest way to ensure safety was not to have it. Also, I 
felt like I wouldn't have allowed my wife and daughter to go to the event this year based on my 
serious concerns. So that means I wouldn't want any of you going to the event this year. And 
with that, I conclude the presentation of my comments. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Commissioner and thank you City Manager. I want to welcome Councillor Alanna 
Mallon as well as former Mayor Ken Reeves. We'll hear from Mayor Reeves for a few minutes. I 
do want to stress that I appreciate the history and and how we got here. Tonight, we're really 
looking forward. Of course we need to process the past so that we can plan for the future but we 
don't want to spend a lot of time on what happened. It was painful to many of us, and that's 
acknowledged. We now want to move forward and make sure that we have the Carnival in 2020 
and beyond, and that we have the necessary plans in place to make sure that happens. So we'll 
hear from Mayor Reeves and then we'll go to public comment. 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves   
I apologize for the late moment of my arrival as I have a competing Margaret Fuller board 
member meeting right now. So if I do leave that's why, I have to go back. I'm all about going 
forward. But I do think that we should not miss the many lessons that have been taught with 
respect to the cancellation of the Carnival. The first of which is that when the Carnival was 
canceled, members of the committee and members of the community came here to city hall to 
say to their elected officials that we do not think that this action is merited based on information 
that we have. So if you have more information, we could hear it, but we were just essentially told 
that, you know, there was information and this was done. That's it. So we came as citizens and 
we spoke at the mic. And the council, in its wisdom decided, well, what it would do was put over 
the discussion of this issue for another week. So we came back again, and we spoke again. 
And at the Council hearing about this event, there was no City Manager and no Police 
Commissioner, the two people who made the decision according to what was told to us. So, it 
was daunting, and I bring this up because I don't want anybody to think we missed it, that in our 
attempt to advocate on this issue, we didn't get a forum from our elected officials, because 
many of them for some reason kind of understood. I've talked to Craig Kelley, I've talked to you 
Councillor Zondervan, I've talked also to Sumbul Siddiqui. What do you think we came here for? 
And we couldn't have been more specific about: we don't think it should be canceled, we don't 
understand the nexus between the Boston event, you know, weeks prior, and this thing. And 
then the coup de grâce was that even the rain day couldn't occur based on this information. So, 
very truly, I don't, I'm not a police officer. I'm certainly not the Police Commissioner, and I don't 
expect to do that person's job but I do know this is a $50 million police operation we have. And I 
can't for the life of me understand, if the Boston Marathon continues to go on, despite the 
carnage that occurred there, and the fact that no Carnival anywhere in the world that we know 
of has ever been canceled. None! I had a good friend Ruth Batson who is a famous lady of 
Boston, who used to sometimes say to me, you know Ken, not good enough. Well, that's what I 
would say to this: just not good enough. It was so demeaning and unsatisfying. And this is the 
meeting that should have taken place the next week at the Council. This is exactly the meeting. 
Now here we are in the cloak of Christmas when nobody is watching and nobody is listening 
and nobody cares! And it's not because we didn't come and bring our issue here. It was really 
misdealt with. And I have to put this on the council, because you are the people who bring us 
the Manager and the Police Commissioner. To add insult to the injury, we had a rally here at 
City Hall. We had a big meeting over at the Union Baptist Church. We did everything we thought 
necessary to have our voices heard, and they were not heard. Because it got canceled, and and 
there was no, well, why don't why don't we come and counsel, let us let you know a little more

than we've let you know. Anything! And this has happened to no other group in the city that I'm 
aware of, and I've been aware of the city for a long, long, long time. And the further insult was 
that other events scheduled for that day went forward. So this is deeply problematic, both as to 
procedure, but as to fact. And, I for one, don't want to be treated in this manner. I am a citizen of 
the city, I pay taxes in the city. I'm paying for this $50 million police force. I expect it to be able to 
come up with a plan. If somebody does something to somebody in Boston, that will happen all 
the time. That has happened every year that there has been a Carnival. What made this year so 
distinct? We can't know because we don't have any information!  So, you know, I'm not going to 
argue with the air. But trust me, I do not feel in any sense that any concern I have has been 
addressed, because, no information! And what little there is, is so...I mean, what gives? So, that 
being said, I don't think there is the fullest awareness that until this Carnival came, there was no 
vehicle in this city where the peoples of color felt celebrated at all. And as one of the founders of 
this Carnival, from the first event, people literally cried in the street as we walked down the 
street, to see the celebration of themselves and their culture here. And for the City of Cambridge 
to sort of respond in this way to this thing was really shattering. And unfortunate, to say the 
least, but also very suspect. Because, you know, there are no secrets in Cambridge. I mean, I 
know that the police force in general doesn't care for the Carnival, because everybody has to 
work that day. And it strikes me that if I had a police force that I'm leading and the opportunity 
exists, because there is some problem, to just call the whole thing off, I think that's well received 
in some places. It was not well received in our place. And I don't know that this isn't irreparable 
because this was not done without information. And we did come and we did all the English 
language things we could think of doing, and we were not heard. And certainly there was no 
action. And I for one, you know, I'm glad that something is going to happen in February. But not 
good enough is my conclusion. And I will refer back to the amount of resources we have in 
policing. And you know, if we wanted to come up with a system where we had checks for people 
to come near, etc, and so on, all of those are possible. And again, I'm not the police. But to shut 
us down on this pretext is just not acceptable and won't be accepted, I'll put it that way.  So 
going forward, you know, the dynamic of the carnival and the city has been an interesting one 
because the carnival has always caused various concerns. And we're known to have the best 
Carnival in the area. People like to come to Cambridge, people won't go to Boston carnival. But 
we can't prevent people from Boston coming here. And if we have bands who are from not here, 
come here, they often bring with them whatever is going on wherever they're from. We have no 
way of protecting us from that either. But we can either have nothing ever, or we can come up 
with some sort of notion that is important as this goes on. Even if it had been confined to 
another area. That came up. Why can't we just go over and do it in the Forest City property, 
where we used to have it, a well contained area. Nope, that couldn't happen either. So it just, it 
just does not taste good. And I wish I had the great recipe going forward because I don't know. I 
stand on the fact that it has never been canceled before anywhere. So why we would be in dire 
concern about future cancellations is...you'd have to explain that to me. I don't have an 
explanation for that. But there are too many large events that go on around the world in New 
York City and wherever else. In the New York Carnival, they have issues all the time, but they 
they don't call it off. They try to build better systems to contain it and make public safety, and I 
do want to make it very clear that I want us all to be safe. But why we are calling our stuff off 
when other things occur and they don't seem to have to be called off. The Mayfair in Harvard 
Square didn't get called off. They said, "well, there's not been any gun violence there". Well, 
they didn't invite it. We didn't invite it. But we are living in a dynamic context so, stuff happens. 
And I hate to conclude so generally, but it does. You yourself Commissioner Bard say you were 
there and then, you know, something spontaneous happened with 20 officers around, whoever 
would imagine that? Certainly not you or I. So, but does that mean we're not going to have 
festivals? Because that could happen?  And so I'll just end for now with that, but I want to thank 
Councillor Zondervan, I didn't know you very well. But coming to you was the most hearing that

we could have had. You understood this issue in the way it should have been understood. 
There's a big cultural underpinning to this and because of where you're from and what you know 
from being there, you know what it is we're talking about. People wait the whole year to, in many 
ways, do their dance at Carnival in a way that just sort of lifts them up for the rest of the year. 
And they miss it! And not everybody is so articulate to come and tell you the many things it 
means, but it means a lot, and this meant a lot. And I want to say to you, Nicola Williams, you 
have done a wonderful job of really shepherding this event. Because you have been with us 
since the beginning, since I asked you would you do it. so I can't thank you enough for your 
efforts. But you took a big hit on this because there were people who believed that you called it 
off, and as I have told you, there's something you will never escape but it doesn't have to be 
true. And I thank you for your efforts in this. And I did run into the City Manager because I 
couldn't not tell him that, you know, when we came back to the council to discuss the issue, how 
come you and the Police Commissioner weren't there? And he did say that maybe the council 
didn't ask them to be here but I don't get that at all. I really just don't get that and I have a lot of 
faith in Cambridge government but this instance here really has woken my eyes and my number 
one went all kinds of new places because I wouldn't stand for this again, I just would not do it 
because this is a real limiting thing that occurred here for reasons that I still don't fully 
understand. So I think that's my few minutes. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you, Mayor Reeves. 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves  
Oh, I wanted to thank also the Our Revolution letter, I thought that was a very thoughtful letter, 
and I thought it spoke to why we're here. Thank you, Henry Wortis. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. And if I can ask the members of the audience to keep your enthusiasm inside, even 
though I understand the sentiment. So, let's hear from the public. We have a few people signed 
up to speak. When I call your name, please to the podium and make sure the microphone is 
turned on. So we'll hear from Nancy Ryan, and you'll have three minutes to speak. 
 
Nancy Ryan  
Thank you, I won't speak anywhere near that amount of time. I just wanted to say that I'm 
speaking formally for the Cambridge Residents Alliance. We've supported this organization, this 
community event in the past. We recognize how deeply important it is, especially in my 
neighborhood, The Port/Area IV, where so many of the Barbadians and other Afro-Caribbean 
people live. Our neighbors and friends were part of that enormous disappointment. So, I'm 
delighted that at least now it's getting an airing and we are committed to helping carry it forward, 
whatever that means. So, thank you all. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you, Nancy. Now we'll hear from Nomadik from Malden. 
 
Nomadik   
Hi, it's Nomadik and I live in Malden. So yes, I would like to speak and just say a few words 
about my experience with Carnival. I've been a long time attendee, and I've been participating 
as a DJ for the last couple of years. And it's been an amazing experience not only as a 
participant, but to actually be behind the scenes. I've been working with Nicola a little bit more 
over the years, and she's like a mentor to me. I am beginning to learn about all the work she 
does, all the tremendous energy and effort she puts in. And so it's much more than just me

being a DJ. It's actually just experiencing as, like I said many years as a participant, the joy I get 
every year looking forward to it just as former Mayor Ken Reeves mentioned, you know, it is the 
carnival where people are like, in the area wants to be at, you know. Cambridge Carnival always 
seemed more family friendly. So, I'm just hoping today we really move forward into 2020 and 
just, you know, just pray for a safer and even better Carnival going forward. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. We will now hear from Owen Howell. 
 
Owen Howell   
Yes, thanks for this opportunity. When I first came to this city in 1973, you know, it was the early 
days of Cambridge, and I used to walk from Central Square to Harvard Square. And that route 
was filled with nightclubs, and, you know, Cambridge has a wealth of diversity that it was this 
uh, you know, just walking from Central Square to Harvard Square at night was like, that was 
my joy. You know, I was in high school, but just doing that made me feel alive. Speaking on the 
carnival, being a carnival committee member, it was always a struggle trying to get resources, 
trying to get stuff with the city, it kind of felt like we were the forbidden child. And it was the city, 
obviously, and to be our opponent rather than help us go forward. Seeing that 2020 is perfect 
vision 2020 vision, I hope that perfect vision will allow us the resources and the time and the 
help to move this Carnival to where we always knew it should be. And that is a real, real high, 
you know, we we don't plan a bad carnival. You know, we aim to bring diversity, talent, things 
that people haven't seen to Cambridge. Hopefully the city will adopt our plans and help us get to 
that stage together. And that's all I want to say. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you so much. Henry Wortis is next. 
 
Henry Wortis   
Thank you for the opportunity. I've submitted a letter, which you either read or have the 
opportunity to read. And I won't repeat what I've said in that letter. But the point I raised is that 
the actions of a city or a civil committee or a school or a school committee, actions by any of 
those bodies are going to be judged. And those institutions, in this country, lie in the history of 
institutional racism. And this has nothing directly to do with the motivation of any individual. It's 
the fact that once institutional racism exists, you've got to consciously break out of it. Otherwise, 
actions easily repeat the same patterns. And I want to add to what I've written, my own belief 
about the standard that we should expect from our institutions and from this city. And this is 
personal, I can't prove that what I'm saying is correct. It comes from some experience that I 
have, working in education, dealing with issues of diversity. And I've come to learn from 
interacting with people about this. So the standard a few years ago, and this is decades ago, in 
dealing or confronting or preventing racism, the cutting edge then was against the most blatant 
forms of outright racism. That was the cutting edge. About 20 years ago, there was a shift. And 
of course, the most blatant forms of racism still exist and at the highest levels even. But the 
cutting edge of the movement against racism, now 20 years ago, shifted to implicit bias. People 
becoming aware of all the things they've internalized, and without even realizing it, just acting 
out, right? Over the last few years, there's been another shift. And that's where I think we're 
going to be challenged, all of us, because now the standard isn't even implicit bias. The 
standard now is that people from the dominant culture, people in the dominant institutions, have 
to be aware, have to become aware, of what will the people most affected by my actions think 
about this? What's their view? Because if you haven't internalized that, as an institution, you 
take the risk, whatever your motive, of repeating again and again, the very actions that have 
harmed people over the years. That's the challenge. Thank you.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Up next is Marilee Meyer. 
 
Marilee Mayer   
I'd love to thank you for your comments. Very, very astute observation. I also am representing 
the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, which is also very much in support of the 
carnival. If we had more cultural events, there'd be more understanding and less fear, this kind 
of interaction, and I've been attending Carnival for since the beginning, I knew Nicola before I 
knew who she was, and for 50 years, my parents, my family has been a host to the British Virgin 
Islands students up here, several who went on to become Attorney General Premier, Head of 
the Conservation and Fisheries, and Climate Change Commissioner. And I have, because of 
my dual cultural indoctrination, I had been in the position of being a liaison, during Carnival, in 
explaining to people on the sidewalk and explaining to neighbors, with my enthusiasm, how 
things work. And there's a lot more acceptance and a way of looking at things because people 
are talking. And so Carnival is a connection to my roots. And I've been to Boston for 15 years 
and there's always some incidents over there. And it's been frustrating to have those individual 
incidents always be associated with the carnival. They are using them as camouflage. And 
Brooklyn hasn't canceled, nobody's canceled. But this is an opportunity to include local 
musicians, etc. And I want you to pay attention to the suggestions that Nicola put up about 
improving the cultural event. As with other situations, communication was lacking. And I would 
like to see the organizers at the table. They had a right to hear, and even see the video 
perhaps. And maybe they did. The organizers need to be pulled in immediately. And if you're 
going if you're going to create a void where there's a lot of confusion, it is up to you, Manager 
and Commissioner, to not only create a teachable moment, but calm the waters. You guys were 
absent at some of these smaller rallies. I was at the church, at the small parade and there were 
no representation from the people who made the decisions. But in any case, you you get my 
point there needs to be more communication. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Lynette Laveau-Saxe is up next. 
 
Lynette Laveau-Saxe   
Hello. It's a privilege for me to be part of this Carnival given that the small group of co founders 
started with three and ballooned out to about 11 of us. Nicola was sent by Mayor Reeves, who 
believed in our vision and sailed with us all the way from 1992 to the parade in 1993. The 
response ability of the artist is to inspire and make a difference. And the carnival provided just 
such a platform for local artists. I've been a longtime resident of Cambridge, for about 50 years. 
And it was a wonderful thing to see how artists embraced the carnival. But over the years, of 
course, people move on, they migrate, they get married, they move away, whatever. So the 
responsibility of the current community is to continually let the public know the origin of the 
carnival, the original one, 185 years ago, that we are now continuing the tradition of celebrating, 
which is the emancipation of slavery. That was the first day of carnival. And if the public doesn't 
know, then, you know, we provide just such a platform for ne'er-do-wells who think that it's, 
someone said that, you know, it's a camouflage they use it as a camouflage to do their dirty 
deeds. So we must hold on to this product, energize it, edify it to newcomers. People who aren't 
understanding that it's a wonderful thing to to be part of because it has value. It allows people to 
release, celebrate. That was the reason why we decided to bring the carnival, because we can 
all celebrate this freedom that we now enjoy as people of color. And also share with other 
people. And I'm sure for people in this room if you've been to the carnival, you do see that. You 
see the effects. But on that first day, many things were happening. People were not only

celebrating, but they were mourning their dead and searching for lost family members. And you 
feel it all. All of that is felt at Carnival. People don't know why they just explode with exuberance. 
But there's a reason. It's like a primordial call for everyone when you are part of the carnival. 
And I'm looking forward to seeing it continue. I was sorry that it had to be interrupted, but that's 
in the past. We are all optimistic here. I thank the City Manager for having faith that this Carnival 
will, again, rise. Thank you, Ken for helping us to give it birth. Thank you Nicola for representing 
City Hall at that time and continuing to do the work. And we're going to make it live again. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Kevin Donaher is up next. 
 
Kevin Donaher   
Sorry, I had a speech to say but most of my points were made better by Ken. So I'll just jump to 
the conclusion: the question is how will we incorporate input from the Caribbean-American 
community to ensure that the mistakes of 2019 are not repeated in 2020.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. James Williamson is next. Thanks so much, James. Three minutes.  
 
James Williamson   
Thanks. James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place in Cambridge. I guess I want to start with a 
little bit of my own experience. I was sitting on a bench behind the reviewing stand in 2017, 
having a conversation with a German who I think was here working temporarily in the biotech 
sector. And for some reason, I think maybe partly because I saw a group of about a dozen 
officers with jackets on the back saying "Metro Gang Unit" or something, real big, bold letters, 
obviously a gang unit, all clustered together in the same location behind the reviewing stand. 
And I started having a conversation, I said, you know, maybe because there had been an 
incident on a previous occasion at the Carnival, and I said, well, you know, things can 
sometimes happen. But by and large, I think it's pretty safe. I think I also did talk about the fact 
that the German national police had fired their weapons in one recent year 70 times and I 
mentioned that Amadou Diallo was shot in New York City 41 times- just one person shot 41 
times- while in all of Germany, the National Police in one year had fired their weapons 70 times. 
At which point, a huge mass of people came running around the corner of the building. The 
German I was sitting next to on the bench took off, and I got down crouch down on to the side of 
the bench. Just to wait and see what was happening. I wasn't going to start running without a 
better idea of what was going on. In a minute, when it sort of settled down, I had an computer, a 
laptop with me and I took it out and I went around the corner and about 30 feet away was the 
spot where I think the initial shooting had taken place. And they hadn't even put up any sort of 
police line or anything. And I started to record and a police officer, while other people walked in 
front of him to, you know, move to a different location. He singled me out and started yelling at 
me that I had to go. And I think it was because I was recording and I think the recording actually 
might have turned out to be useful. In fact, later that afternoon, I talked to a detective who said, 
"could you send me that recording? because it might be useful in terms of assembling 
information about what might have happened here". And I was, to be frank, so upset about the 
way I'd been yelled at, in my feeling totally inappropriately, abusively by this officer, that I just 
said no. I'm not going to go there. And I think that's an example of where unfortunate things 
happen that don't have to happen in the way things get handled. So I did find myself wondering, 
why a gang? Why a gang team of a dozen people all clustered in the same location? In 
retrospect, thinking about this and going to the meeting at the church that has been alluded to 
earlier. I wondered, the specific question that I had about the cancellation, in addition to 
comments that have been made by others was, if there was, in fact, credible evidence that

would lead a prudent person to feel the right thing to do is to cancel the event, why were those 
people not arrested? I just didn't understand if it was credible enough to be like, yes, they're 
definitely going to do something, that you would presumably have enough information to make 
arrests, and that was the one thing that I didn't understand.  Okay. I didn't realize it was three 
minutes. The ordinance says five, but may I have just a brief extension? I think going forward, 
the key thing about this is to do whatever is possible to make this safe. As safe as possible. I 
don't think it's going to be possible to make it perfectly safe. I go to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. 
There are shootings there they happen all the time, quote, unquote, they don't cancel Mardi 
Gras, they don't cancel second lines on Sunday afternoons. I've been there, people have said 
don't go. I've had amazing experiences and yes, shooting sometimes happen. But they can 
happen anywhere and they happen there with a lot more frequency than here. The couple 
things that I would suggest that might help: one is to strengthen the connection to the history of 
the Caribbean community in this city. To elevate that, to integrate that and make that part of 
what this continuing and sustaining a safe Carnival here in Cambridge would be. That it's 
connected with that history that people have referred to. And the other thing is to elevate the 
visibility of when the Commissioner spoke about it having been a family-friendly event, to 
elevate the visibility of it as a family-friendly event. And to stress that. But the chair is getting 
looking impatient and I'll close early. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Andrew Sharpe is next. 
 
Andrew Sharpe   
The Caribbean and the US have been tremendous friends, from the establishment of Alexander 
Hamilton, to Shirley Chisholm. The establishment of the US-Caribbean engagement acts 
speaks on the basis of the Caribbean diaspora importance to the US economic development 
and its cultural diversity. Carnival is one of the most important elements of the Caribbean 
diaspora community throughout the entire United States. And I encourage the council to look at 
the HR 4939 US Caribbean Engagement Act, which explains more the importance of the 
Caribbean diaspora community. And it is important that we continue our cultural heritage, which 
is carnival. And I commend Nicola for your continued support to our Carnival community and 
members of our Caribbean diaspora. And that's my input regards to the carnival: it must 
continue. And we have reached so far that the Caribbean caucus in Washington has 
established this US Caribbean engagement. And it is focused on the importance of the 
Caribbean diaspora. And in the City of Cambridge and in the state of Massachusetts. We have 
to, you know, work, engage, and elevate our diverse community. And the Caribbean community 
ain't going away because we were one of the pillars that really supported the United States. And 
we're America's third border. So we really appreciate you approving the continuation and 
establishing mechanisms, engaging with our community, bringing everyone at the table to see 
how we can move forward to continue Cambridge Carnival because I look forward to attend 
anytime. I'm a Boston resident, but definitely appreciate the work that you guys are doing and 
thanks a lot. Have a good night. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. That concludes the list of people have signed up. Anyone else want to speak, who 
hasn't spoken? All right, seeing none, we'll close public comment. So we'll have a little bit of 
discussion. And again, I want to frame it by focusing on what we do, going forward to make sure 
that the carnival happens in 2020 and beyond. As Mayor Reeves mentioned, I'm myself from 
the Caribbean, from Suriname in South America. I have the great privilege of going home on 
Saturday for a couple of weeks to visit. And when I came to Cambridge in 1992, I wasn't fully 
aware of the Caribbean heritage that exists here. But it must have spoken to me because I felt

at home here, and ended up settling down here. So when the carnival was canceled it impacted 
me as well, personally, as a person of Caribbean heritage, that this event got canceled. And 
when, you know, as the Commissioner said, In 2018, there was a series of meetings and I met 
with the Commissioner and the police, I believe was Superintendent Elow actually, that I met 
with, regarding whether or not we should have the carnival in 2018. And I began to understand 
some of the history and some of the challenges that the carnival has experienced in sustaining 
itself through the years in Cambridge. And in 2019, when it was cancelled, it really became clear 
to me that this is an issue of equity, and an issue of race, even though it again does not reflect 
on any one person who is making decisions. But it's in the context of institutional and historic 
racism, that we come to a place where this important cultural event to an important part of our 
community can be cancelled so easily, when other events are not. And that is an issue of equity. 
And I thank Nicola for her presentation because she really gave us some very specific ways that 
we can remedy some of those inequities. And we can begin to stabilize this event, in the same 
way that we have done for other events that take place in our city every year. This really can 
and should be a signature event for our city that we can be very proud of and that we can 
ensure continues to happen year after year and grows and really speaks to and uplifts the 
Caribbean community. So I really have only one question and I'll open it up to to my colleagues 
if they have other questions. But my question is, knowing what we know now and knowing what 
happened this year, what can we put in place so that if in 2020, we get to the same point where 
we have information that threatens the carnival, can we have a plan that ensures that the event 
can still happen? It can happen in a different way, it can happen in a different place, but can we 
make sure that it can still happen? 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner   
Mr. Chair, yeah, yeah. As I said, the City Manager, the Police Department, we're committed to 
ensuring that we have a family friendly, safe event in 2020. If you want me to say, with 100 
degree, hundred percent certainty that nothing could threaten the carnival, then I can't sit here 
and do that. You know, for instance, if we found a device along the path where the festival was 
supposed to occur, then, you know, in many ways it would be derelict, you know. But absent 
something, you know, to that extreme degree, we will do everything within our power to ensure 
that the carnival is successful, safe, and that it you know, kicks off in 2020. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you, and I certainly appreciate that. And I want to press a little bit on on your example. 
Even in that case, obviously, we couldn't have the event in that place, at that time, given a 
threat like a device that might explode. Can we have a plan that says, in that event, we will have 
the carnival somewhere else at another time, under different circumstances, so that we can 
secure it sufficiently that it can still happen? 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  
To you and through you, Mr. Chair, that's not unreasonable. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. I appreciate that.  
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager  
I would just say that, absolutely we can have a date. We may need two or three dates, because 
pending the situation and would give us as much flexibility as possible, because we understand 
the importance of this event. So I think having as many backup plans as possible, hopefully we 
don't have to use any of them. But to make sure that whatever we do, I think the problem is if 
the backup dates are too close, often you get the same issue. So I think being realistic to say,

these are the dates and we have some plans in place where I am all for that and I think we can 
work that out and be happy to see how that works for Nicola and the committee and everybody 
else. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. I appreciate that and I’ll introduce a motion in a little bit to that effect. Mayor 
Reeves? 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves  
I think we should speak a little to sort of the elephant in the room and that is the breakout of 
violence in public celebrations. Now, for whatever reasons I happened to be in the middle of the 
Detroit riots of 1967. They broke out two blocks from my house, and I was a junior in high 
school. I have seen weeks of unrest, snipers, tanks in the streets. So I really know what can 
happen when there's public bedlam. And in Cambridge, I have seen I have been at Carnival 
when something happened in Kendall and everybody was running, and it's a very difficult feeling 
for me because it reminds me of '67 Detroit. And that's the reason I came to Cambridge is it was 
not like Detroit. So my point is this. I think there is a deeper understanding of what it takes to 
maintain order, but I'm not the police. But I do think this in prior years under prior 
commissioners, particularly under Commissioner Haas, after 9/11 happened and it seemed like 
the government had a lot of surplus riot gear, etc. So suddenly we have in the middle of 
Cambridge Carnival, you know, 50 officers in black with machine guns. And I'm bringing this up 
because you will never convince me that that ever happened at Saint Cosmas and Damian or 
any of it. I mean, that was for us. So we're not here imagining things. There's a history here. 
And it's important as the Police Department does its planning, etc. to really deeply realize that 
there are some things that set off public reaction and you put these people in riot gear in 
August, September, and you get a bunch of revelers with a Caribbean Carnival, many of whom 
are not from the city. It's like asking for a combustion. And I'll give you one more example. And 
this again was during Commissioner Haas. Some Caribbean people on Prospect Street had an 
annual party. And someone called about noise. And the police came and told them to turn down 
the noise. And the police went away and the noise went back up, and someone called again. 
Well, the person whose house it was contacted me to say that the police had now given them a 
ticket for this party, etc. So I said, Well, you know, you want to be able to have a party so I got 
involved with this issue. Spending this moment to say this: the next thing the man told me, he 
says, you know, there were 50 officers in riot gear on the river, in response to this party. And I 
said, Oh, no, that could never be, because given my Detroit instincts, I know that's the recipe for 
disaster. And so Commissioner Haas told me, oh, no, that could not have happened. And I 
continued my research to only find out that it did happen. It was a combination of Cambridge, 
and the MPC police and MIT and Harvard were ready in the event there was something, and 
this was so wrong. So as planning goes on, this is notes from the bridge of civilian, but there 
have been times in my life where I really felt that I was underpaid because some of these just 
needed a match. And it was in complete obliviousness, and maybe the commissioner didn't 
know which is even more concerning. So it's just to point out that this is a city of 110,000 
people. It is not New York City. There must be a way to better engage and also be able to 
contain, without inciting. And that is a lesson I would really want to know that we have learned. 
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager  
Through you, Mr. Chair, can I just respond briefly? So, as I said, just before you got here, I was 
involved in the first one from Manager Healey working with you to make this happen. And I 
really believe we've had a very strong working relationship for all your years as Councillor and 
as Mayor. I think you know how much respect I have for you, and I know how busy you are. But 
in talking to the Commissioner, if you would like to, in any way, shape, or form, be part of

anything in terms of us trying to figure out moving forward, I would take that as a great 
opportunity for us and certainly would welcome you to help play a role. I think the council would 
feel that it's appropriate Nicola as well so I just want to make that as an offer. I think we've 
worked well together in the past, and we'll continue that, but I really want to make sure that that 
offer is out there for you. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. Councillor Carlone? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Obviously the conversation and comments have been very powerful 
tonight. I thought the presentation was excellent. But I want to focus on something a little 
different. And that's Nicola's presentation, page 21, and a sustainable carnival. So we had a 
problem last time, people were disappointed. And in a way, as Nicola has done, it's sort of a 
recap. All right, where do we go from here? And I can say it without asking the four councillors 
that are here are all big enthusiasts for arts and celebrations. There have been committees 
made, and I think what I'm looking at here on page 21, seems very reasonable. I'm not going to 
ask what we do now because you need to look at that yourself. But it seems to me that the city, 
no matter if we thought it was the right thing, we still owe something to a group of people. And 
we need to look at how can we learn from this. And really invigorate what makes Cambridge 
special on those days. And that's the few celebrations we do. We don't do many. We don't have 
museums. We don't have our own theaters. This is it, really. And so I hope the 
recommendations here and I know the four of us, if not the whole future council, will be looking 
into this. How can we reinforce and remedy at least the planning and the strategy portion at the 
same time that we look at the whole plan for safety. And honestly, I went and re-read this. And 
it's extremely well put together and quite reasonable and it affects a large segment of our 
population and the rest of the city. I enjoy it. You're all going to laugh and that's okay. I was 
invited to be in the parade, not in an outfit. And I felt completely out of place, but I was 
welcomed! I won't do it again, but I was welcomed and and it was fun. I was out of my...it's not 
who I am to dance publicly, but 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves  
You did a good job! 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Well you were just behind me which also made me feel awkward. But we all, I think everybody 
in this room wants this to work and wants it to be even more special. And maybe, as an 
example, you know, I know the River Festival, I was involved in the beginning. And I know a 
good chunk of money goes into that. And activities. So we don't have that many and we should 
make the most of it, but I'm saying what everybody here knows. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. Councillor Siddiqui? 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  
Thank you, Mr. Chair, through you. I want to echo Councillor Carlone's comments on this. 
Thank you to the members of the public comment who came and spoke. And thank you to 
Councillor Zondervan for being the lead on these important conversations. I think former 
Mayor/Councillor Reeves is right in that when this did happen, I think there was a failure of 
leadership on making sure that the community knew exactly what was going on. And I think 
something the city has to always do a better job as of is over communicating. And I think we

think we communicate, but that doesn't happen. And so I think this was a lesson learned. It 
happened. Even that meeting, making folks come back, you know, that type of stuff, that was 
not the right thing to do. And so that's noted, and I'm sorry to you, I'm sorry to the Carnival and, 
you know, I think we need to accept responsibility for that, and then think about, as Councillor 
Zondervan has said, what do we do now moving forward in making this event as amazing as it 
can be? And how do we really think about how do we empower the Caribbean community in 
general? I think there's so much more work to be done. And I'm committed. I know my 
colleagues are committed. So I look forward to working together on that.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you Councillor. Councillor Mallon? 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm not a member of this committee so thank you for allowing me the time 
and space to speak. I also want to thank Councillor Zondervan for putting this meeting together. 
I do, back to former Mayor Reeves comment, feel like it should have been held a long time ago 
and I'll take responsibility for that along with my colleagues. You know, city council meetings 
aren't the forum to have conversations, especially ones as important as this. So I think this is 
the right meeting. It just happened at the wrong time. So, I want to apologize to you and to the 
members of the public who are feeling not heard by their city leadership. So, and I also will say, 
I have been thinking a lot about this actually, in, you know, in terms of arts and culture here in 
Cambridge and the lack of celebrations. This is very high stakes, right, because this is the 
celebration. This is the event for the Afro-Caribbean community. And when it gets canceled, 
boy, that's it, right? A whole year goes by. So I will say looking forward, I like the idea of having 
the smaller taste of Caribbean events. Could there be more events that could make it feel like 
high stakes, while at the same time be preparing for having this event annually? And then, in 
terms of one of the things that you mentioned here is securing a Caribbean Cultural Center and 
something that Councillor Carlone said around we don't have museums here. We do have a 
museum in Central Square, the MIT Museum, and it's going away. I don't know what MIT's 
plans for the first floor of that building. It's right here in the cultural district. We've been thinking a 
lot about how do we bring more arts and culture into the Cultural District to make sure that it 
isn't...all the arts and culture don't just leave Central Square and we say, jeez, isn't that too bad? 
So is there a way to be intentional around that space here in Central Square to really think 
about a Caribbean Cultural Center to again, add on that layer of this isn't just this one thing. So I 
guess that's that's all I'll say except, you know, I am, of course supportive of trying to figure out 
how to continue to hold this while at the same time really being aware and cognizant that, you 
know, public safety is a real thing. Public safety is something that we all really care about, 
obviously, and I know our Police Commissioner really cares about it. And I know, like, just 
looking at this number $172,000 for public safety for 2018. That's, that's quite a, quite a jump 
from $40,000. So I know that there's a commitment on the city side and on the police side to 
make sure that this event happens and it happens safely. I guess the last thing I'll say is I am 
thinking a lot about what Mayor Reeves said around the riot gear and what kind of visual and 
optics that presents. I have been thinking about that actually a lot lately, in terms of how that 
presents to the community. And what that relationship between the police and and festival 
goers...how that interplay is and to carefully, really think about that so I'm supportive of how 
we're going to move forward here. I thank you again for allowing me to speak and being present 
tonight. And thank you to Nicola for really bringing this event forward every single year. I know 
it's a lot of work. So I look forward to working with you in the future. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Councillor Mallon. Mayor Reeves?

Former Mayor Ken Reeves   
The comment of Councillor Carlone, and I meant to thank you for your prior participation and 
current because I think you have turned up twice. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
It was very forgettable! 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves   
It was good and he brought his Hawaiian shirt so he was in the spirit. I'm from the tradition 
where you take lemons and you make lemonade. So I want to refer to page 21 along with 
Councillor Carlone and just say, now if Cambridge really want to get into the carnival business, 
it turns out that in Canada, they understand this much better. So in Toronto, they have 
something called Caribana. And the provincial government gives Caribana $400,000 a year, 
because the number of people who come at that time, food sold, etc, is economic development 
too! So then, Montreal, they came up with their $400,000. In America, there's another idea that 
we couldn't possibly use public money in these ways. And Canada has some interesting cultural 
challenges, so they know how to put a little something to see if we can make things better. So I 
would hope, and Nicola has argued, that she has spent so much time telling me about how the 
city should embrace this as its own, because it's such a rich thing and I'm thinking to myself, or 
thinking to her, Nicola, they are not trying to own Carnival. But there is a point of view that could 
be mutually beneficial, which is evidenced by these kinds of supports. Now, I will say this to you, 
as somebody who's involved in Margaret Fuller. And I went on that board because I was asked 
to, I did not want to be on the board. But now I feel I'm a part of running an operation because 
our biggest problem is we don't have money. And to see East End House get tied to a $9 million 
dollar deal, it got my attention because these community institutions, nobody is giving away 
money. But we still expect them to exist. So I really think the council, and it would take several 
of you to with Councillor Carlone to say, well, you know, why don't we ask the Carnival people 
to pitch this in even greater detail, or, you know, bring in one of these steel bands so people can 
get to see how this works. And the steel band culture is a magnificent thing. And there are 
whole places in this country where it is a great deployment of youth, because you teach them to 
play these steel drums and have a curriculum and they compete, they travel, it is one of the 
things you want young people to be doing. So I think you've bought something of great value 
here, other than let's don't cancel again. Maybe we should build in some more support to make 
our Carnival even greater. 
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager   
Hey, Mr. Chair, Can I just follow up with that? I think it's an important point. So you made a good 
point about government and financing and all of that. And, you know, one of the things we've 
been able to do with the Taste of Carnival is because it's in the Cultural District, its at a lot lower 
number, but be able to come up with some finances that's allowed us to really help support the 
event. I think at this larger amount, we're gonna have to really revisit the whole structure of the 
thing because it would probably almost have to be a City of Cambridge event. And that doesn't 
mean we shouldn't but it would mean we'd have a long conversation. But I do think the key is 
that in a smaller event, we were able to really be creative in the Taste of the Carnival. But I think 
to make this a reality, it's going to take some time, it's going to take a lot of meetings and a lot of 
discussion and I would be happy to have David Kale be a point person on my side to figure out 
what we can and can't do and working with the council and Nicola to see, you know, what role 
we can play as we have in the Taste of the Carnival, which I think has been a really good 
success. It's a lot smaller event, but trying to think about, can we tie it to the BID district? Can

we tie it to Central Square? But again, these are not overnight decisions. But we're, I'm hearing 
you. 
 
Nicola Williams   
I just want to mention too that Michael Monestime said that the Central Square BID, because 
he's aware of this plan, can help. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you both. And I had the brief pleasure of being part of the steel band effort, and it was 
quite remarkable to see the way the kids respond and get interested in in the music and the 
culture behind it. And I do want to thank the City Manager and the Commissioner, I know this 
has been a challenging conversation. I know it was a difficult decision. And we felt the impact in 
the community. And, you know, as Mayor Reeves said, we didn't fully hear what was being said. 
And so it took a while to get there. But I think the City Manager has been working with the 
Carnival Committee to address the immediate concerns around cancellation. And, we did plan 
to have this meeting sooner, but unfortunately, we had a death in the family and so that delayed 
it a bit. But I am glad that we were able to come together this evening and at least begin to look 
forward to 2020 and beyond. So thank you all for being here and for participating in that effort. 
 
So I will put forward a motion and I will read it, and then I am of course open to 
suggestions for how to amend it and make it stronger. That the City Manager work with 
the Carnival Committee to enhance the Cambridge Carnival event, allocate the necessary 
funds, and develop a comprehensive public safety plan, including contingency plans so 
that the event can take place in a secure time and place, even in the presence of 
significant threats that can be anticipated.   
 
So on the motion, all in favor?  
 
All right. Thank you all. Happy holidays. Happy New Year. 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves  
Thank you. Thank you.

December 18, 2019 
 
To the Members of Cambridge City Council, 
 
The City of Cambridge cancelled the 2019 Caribbean Carnival at the last minute without 
consulting the organizers of the Carnival, its vendors, artists and other participants, including the 
Cambridge community. The Carnival is a well-established major contributor to Cambridge’s 
celebration of its Caribbean-American heritage. When sponsoring events, the City must take 
responsibility for including people and groups who belong to the cultures being celebrated as 
they bring great experience and knowledge to planning and implementation.  
 
The failure to include the Carnival’s organizers and participants in discussions about potential 
threats to public safety, was disrespectful of the community of people who have been 
successfully organizing the Caribbean Carnival for almost 30 years.   
 
In America today, institutional racism is still dominant.  Institutional racism, a phrase coined by 
Stokely Carmichael, was fully defined in The Lawrence Report for the United Kingdom as, "The 
collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people 
because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, 
attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, 
thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people."  When the 
City acts in a way that is consistent with the historic pattern of institutional racism, we can 
conclude that the pattern is continuing.   Breaking the pattern takes conscious effort. 
 
We support the future success of this treasured celebration of Caribbean-American heritage in 
2020 and beyond.    
 
Henry Wortis, 
On behalf of Our Revolution-Cambridge 
 
(106 Berkshire St.  Cambridge 02141)

HISTORY OF CAMBRIDGE CARNIVAL
INTERNATIONAL- FESTIVAL FOOTPRINT

• For the first 10 years or so, the date of the Carnival was held on the second week in August, 

we used our rain date of the day after Boston Carnival. 

• The Committee decided to keep that date for 2 reasons: fresh costumes and attracted more 

people

• The festival grew tremendously since the date change and we were bursting at the seams.  The 

Committee also wanted to plan for the growth of the festival and work with the City to 
proactively develop a safety plan 

• In 2005, in collaboration with the City and organized by residents, we held our first Carnival 
Community Forum to discuss the expansion and challenges with the growth of the event.  

• The outcome of the meeting resulted in a new location of Kendall Square accompanied by a 

parade route that began on Sidney Street

• In 2008, based on community feedback and input (especially from seniors), we worked with 

City to reclaim our old route starting from the River Street

CARNIVAL OPERATIONS

• Planning Committee consists of mainly volunteer residents:

Everton Daniel, Drucilla Edwards, Rocky Jeanty, Owen Howell, Kathy King, Ellis 
Mendes, Gregory O’Bannon, Wayne Robinson, Maxine Samuels, Natalie Syrion, 
Nicola Williams

• Funding mostly comes from vendors, a little from sponsors.  The City 
covers services relating to public safety such as police, fire, and traffic

• We are seriously under-resourced. Our ideal festival budget is $150,000.  

We heavily rely on volunteers, interns, and in-kind planning services.

• All our performers receive honorariums that are less than what the 

Cambridge Riverfest and other festivals offer

CULTURAL PRESERVATION

• In order to preserve the legacy and cultural contributions of the 

Caribbean community in Cambridge, we need a Caribbean 
Cultural Center which offers a permanent home to house our 
programs, including the Cambridge Youth Steel Orchestra and 
costume camps. This center will provide the following:

– A functional space for performances: music, dance, and other art forms 

focusing on the Caribbean and African Diaspora

– Storage for our Steel Pans (valued at $20,000)

– Community workshops 

– A meeting space for low cost rentals for artists and for rehearsals

ORDERED: 

The Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee met on December 19, 2019 to 
discuss the Cambridge Carnival. 
 
The committee voted in the affirmative to send the following order to the City Council. 
 
That the City Manager work with the Carnival Committee to enhance the Cambridge 
Carnival event, allocate the necessary funds, and develop a comprehensive public 
safety plan, including contingency plans so that the event can take place in a secure 
time and place, even in the presence of significant threats that can be anticipated.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER

The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments;

That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

Cambridge’s tree canopy has shrunk by nearly 20% over the last decade; and 
 
Amendments made to the Tree Protection Ordinance (TPO) last year which restrict the 
removal of “significant trees” on private property will expire on March 11, 2020 if no 
action is taken; and 
 
On November 12, 2019, the city and consultants presented a thorough and impressive 
report to the Health & Environment Committee on a long term approach to reversing 
the canopy decline, rooted in recommendations from the Urban Forest Master Plan 
Task Force which met 13 times between June 2018 and April 2019; and 
 
The report, which contains numerous recommendations on lasting changes that should 
be made to the TPO, was originally scheduled to be released in June 2019 but was 
delayed; and 
 
The report is excellent and deserves careful deliberation and discussion by the city 
council, and it would be a great disservice to rush this conversation in an attempt to 
overhaul the ordinance ahead of the March 11, 2020 expiration date; and 
 
At the same time, it would be a travesty to let the temporary amendments to the TPO 
expire without any new language, as doing so would almost certainly result in a 
massive citywide cutting spree, worsening our canopy decline and erasing any positive 
impact the temporary amendments might have had; now therefore be it

ORDERED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

 

That section 8.66.055 of the municipal ordinances of the City of Cambridge, entitled 
“Procedure for Other Significant Tree Removals” be amend by substitution to read as 
follows: 
 
“For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050, a permit will be required 
from the City Arborist. In all cases, the City Arborist shall keep a record of the type 
and size of tree removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the tree 
documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractor(s) involved, and the name 
and address of the property owner. No such permits will be issued until December 31, 
2020 or sooner by further amendment to this section, except for emergency 
circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects undertaken pursuant to State or 
Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, or where a tree poses 
significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or for dead or dangerous 
trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the removal of certain 
significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree canopy. Any tree 
removed in violation of this section, prior to December 31, 2020, shall require a 
payment into the tree replacement fund as per section 8.66.070 according to a schedule 
as follows:  10% of the replacement value for property owners who qualify for the City 
of Cambridge residential real property tax exemption, no fee for property owners that 
receive established forms of financial assistance, and the full replacement cost in all 
other circumstances. The value to be paid into the tree replacement fund shall be 
equivalent to the cost of purchasing, planting, watering and maintaining said 
Replacement Trees for a period of not less than five years.” 
 
 
 
That the City Council go on record expressing a clear intent to pass comprehensive 
amendments to the TPO, based off the recommendations of the task force, well ahead 
the new proposed deadline of December 2020.

On May 6, 2019 the Cambridge City Council introduced the Welcoming City Ordinance

The Welcoming City Ordinance was placed on file due to the end of the 2018-2019 
legislative session, requiring reintroduction; and 
The City of Cambridge is a proud supporter of our Sanctuary City status, but there is no 
codified ordinance establishing itself as such; now therefore be it 
That the Cambridge City Council amend the Municipal Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to insert a new Chapter 2.129, entitled WELCOMING COMMUNITY 
ORDINANCE, to read as follows:

It is not within the purview nor mandate of Cambridge to enforce 
federal  immigration  law  or  seek  the  detention,  transfer  or

that end.  
 
The City of Cambridge will equally enforce the law and serve the

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL 

 

January 23, 2020 

To the City Council: 

I am resubmitting the Welcoming City Ordinance, complete with amendments that the Cambridge Police 
and Massachusetts American Civil Liberties Union agreed on. I did not include proposed changes that 
the Police and ACLU did not agree on, nor did I include amendments that require more information from 
the Cambridge Police.  Below is a summary of the proposed changes that we will discuss in committee. 

In Section D, federal requests for information, the Police Department representative stated that the police wish 
to cooperate with federal agencies outside of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.  The ACLU 
representative Laura Rotoldo did not object to this change, provided the police state the agencies they want to 
work with for criminal enforcement, and only cooperate when they are able to show probable cause. 
 
Section E, encountering persons driving without a license, the police requested we strike this section. The ACLU 
believes this section is integral to the purpose of the Welcoming City Ordinance and should not be taken out.  I 
agree with the ACLU. 
 
In Section F, notice to individuals subject to ICE interventions, the police believe this section is too broad.  The 
ACLU asked for clarification on what paperwork the police would not want shared with a person issued a 
summons or arrested. 
 
I also received a public inquiry on Section I, raids and other immigrant enforcement actions. A resident was 
concerned that this section enables Cambridge Police to support ICE during raids, even if in a supporting 
function.   
 
I am willing to consider amendments to the ordinance, provided we pass the strongest laws protecting our 
immigrant population possible  
 
Sincerely, 

 

 

Dennis Carlone 

Cambridge City Council.

new Chapter 2.129, entitled WELCOMING COMMUNITY ORDINANCE, to read as follows: 

 
2.129.010 - PURPOSE.  
 
The purpose of this ordinance is to establish the City of Cambridge as a Welcoming City, 
to  declare  that  all  are  welcome  here,  and  to increase  public  confidence  in  Cambridge’s 
government by providing guidelines associated with our city’s voluntary involvement in 
federal immigration enforcement.   
 
2.129.020 - PREAMBLE 

It is not within the purview nor mandate of Cambridge to enforce federal immigration law 
or seek the detention, transfer or deportation of Cambridge residents for civil immigration 
purposes, nor should Cambridge’s resources be expended toward that end.  
 
The  City  of  Cambridge  will  equally  enforce  the  law  and  serve  the  public  without 
consideration of immigration status, citizenship, national origin, race, or ethnicity.  
 
2.129.030 - DEFINITIONS 
 
“ICE” means the federal agency “Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), and any 
other federal agency charged with the enforcement of immigration laws.  

 

 

“Immigration  detainers”  and  “ICE  detainers”  are requests  made  by federal  immigration 
officials, including but not limited to those authorized under Section 287.7 of Title 8 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations to local Law Enforcement or Courts to voluntarily maintain 
custody of an individual once that individual is released from local custody, and/or to notify 
a federal agency before the pending release of an individual. 
 
“ICE administrative warrant” means a warrant, notice to appear, removal order, warrant of 
deportation, or other ICE custody document (I-200, I-203, I-205 or another listed in the 
National Crime Information Database (NCIC)) issued by a federal immigration official,

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The position of individual staff assistants for each City Council member was first 
introduced in 2006, with the role being envisioned as a part-time position that would 
focus primarily upon researching and drafting policy orders; and 
 
This role has, in the ensuing years, greatly expanded and evolved, with Council Aides 
managing the schedules of their Council members, conducting constituent intakes and 
triage, planning and participating in Committee hearings, representing their Council 
member in public and private meetings, serving as liaisons between their Council 
members and other elected officials, and serving as an additional conduit between the 
municipal elected officials and their constituents, in addition to their originally outlined 
duties; and 
 
As new technologies over the past two decades have created the expectation that 
elected officials are to be accessible and responsive virtually any time of day, the role 
of a City Councilor in Cambridge has expanded and evolved, and the role of the 
Council Aide has similarly evolved, with the work now encompassing a wider range of 
responsibilities and the time commitment demanding far more than the allotted 30 
hours per week, and the individuals serving in these roles have demonstrated a 
commitment to public service and working to benefit the Cambridge community; and 
 
The City of Cambridge, which has long prided itself on serving as a model for treating 
employees in all roles, and from all walks of life, fairly and equitably, now has the 
obligation to review the role, function, and compensation of the Council Aide position 
to ensure that those serving in these roles are being fairly and adequately compensated 
for the work they perform; and 
 
The individuals who serve as Council Aides come from a variety of backgrounds and 
experiences, each bringing different and valuable skill sets and perspectives to their 
roles, and they each ultimately contribute to the professionalism and responsiveness 
that the City Council as a whole prides itself in delivering to its constituents; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to review the roles, responsibilities, 
and compensation of City Council Aides with an eye toward designating this as a full-
time position, and to report back on this matter to the City Council prior to the start of 
the FY21 budget discussions.

As part of the City’s Zero Waste Management plan which was finalized in 2019, it was 
recommended that the City reconsider the role and purpose of the Recycling Center 
located at 147 Hampshire Street behind the Department of Public Works in 2020 and 
consider implementing a mobile Recycling Center within the next three to four years; 
and 
 
The current site which is intended to provide a safe and efficient way for 
residents/businesses to dispose of items that cannot be recycled curbside and to leave 
items for reuse is often not accessible to residents due to the high volume of users and 
the lack of parking; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of 
Public Works and any other relevant City departments to update the Council on the 
plans for the Cambridge Recycling Center in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The Council’s Short-Term Rental (STR) Ordinance (#1397) took effect on April 1, 
2018, with the purpose of regulating short-term rentals in the city and to ensure that 
short-term rentals “will not be a detriment to the character and livability of the 
surrounding residential neighborhood;” and 
 
Despite Cambridge’s enforcement efforts and compliance on the part of good-faith 
operators, perhaps hundreds of units are still removed from the residential market and 
offered on a short-term basis in violation of the ordinance, a practice which has been 
identified in other municipalities and by the Mayor’s Blue Ribbon Task Force on 
Tenant Displacement as driving housing instability; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to return to the Council 
recommended amendments to Cambridge’s existing STR Ordinance to assist in 
enforcement to include advertising registration numbers, data sharing, and removing 
illegally rented units.

IN CITY COUNCIL 
February 3, 2020 

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
MAYOR SIDDIQUI 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

Tonight’s meeting of the City Council is taking place at the start of Black History 
Month 2020; and  
 
Black History Month’s origins date back to September 1915, when Carter G. Woodson 
and Jesse E. Moorland founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and 
History (ASNLH), which was charged with researching and publicizing the 
achievements of Black Americans, and which sponsored National Negro History Week 
during the second week of February in 1926; and 
 
As important as this public recognition of the countless contributions made by African-
American citizens to the United States was, it would frustratingly take another half 
century before President Gerald Ford would formally declare February to be 
recognized as Black History Month; and 
 
In the ensuing decades, Black History Month has been designated as a time when 
communities all across the country make a point of recognizing, highlighting, and 
celebrating the achievements made by African-American citizens to our country, and 
to bring those individuals who had otherwise gone under-recognized and 
underappreciated out of the shadows and into the full mainstream of the American 
Story where they belong; and  
 
The City of Cambridge has been the home of many groundbreaking African-American 
leaders and history makers over the past two centuries, including the likes of Maria 
Louise Baldwin, Clement G. Morgan, Saundra Graham, and countless others who have 
helped shape this amazing community; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  While the people of Cambridge should be delving more deeply into all the parts of our 
history, including the contributions made by African-Americans, throughout the entire 
year, we should nevertheless make a concerted effort during Black History Month to 
shine a spotlight on the contributions to our shared story that was made by the African-
American individuals who walked these paths before us; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Council go on record recognizing February 2020 as Black History Month 
in the City of Cambridge, and that the City Council encourages residents across the 
community to delve into the many contributions that African-American citizens have 
made in Cambridge since this city’s earliest days.

In   keeping   with   our   commitment   to   equity,   access   and   inclusion,  
Cambridge   Public   Schools   (CPS)   seeks   to   provide   access   to   a  
variety   of   healthy   food   options   that   equitably   address   the   needs  
of   all   students.   We   are   excited   to   announce   that   beginning   in  
February   2020,   CPS   will   offer   menu   items   that   include  
Halal-certified*   chicken   to   our   students.

Informed   by   families   in   our   Muslim   community   and   advanced  
through   the   efforts   of   Mayor   Sumbul   Siddiqui   to   make   meals   in  
our   school   kitchens   as   inclusive   as   possible,   this   much-needed  
option   will   serve   both   a   nutritional   benefit   to   students   who  
cannot   rely   on   a   daily   packed   lunch   from   home,   as   well   as  
promote   opportunities   for   social   learning   through   sharing   meals  
with   classmates.   CPS’   Food   and   Nutrition   Services   Department  
will   partner   with   local   vendor   Mayflower   Poultry   to   source  
certified   Halal   chicken.   The   following   details   are   provided   to  
help   families   make   informed   decisions   about   our   new   offerings:  

● Select   chicken   recipes   from   the   existing   school   menu   will   be  
prepared   with   Halal   Certified   Chicken   from   Mayflower  
Poultry   (sourced   from   Noor   Al-Jabal   Foods   in   Delaware)   at  
all   Elementary   and   Upper   School   sites.  

● Any   menu   item   that   uses   the   Halal   chicken   will   have   an  
icon,   “HI,”   to   indicate   that   it   contains   Halal   ingredients.    

● Kitchen   staff   will   ensure   that   there   will   be   no   intermingling  

of   Halal   and   commercially   sourced   chicken   in   storage   and  
service.   For   example,   commercially   sourced   drumsticks   will  
NOT   be   served   along   with   Halal   drumsticks   during   the   same  
meal   session.  

● Due   to   infrastructure   limitations,   Halal   chicken   will   share  

refrigeration   space   with   Haram   foods.  

● Cooking   equipment   and   service   items   such   as   spoons,   pots  
and   pans   will   have   to   be   shared   between   Halal   and   Haram  
ingredients.   Kitchen   staff   will   ensure   that   all   service   items  
have   been   washed   and   sanitized   before   use   with   the   Halal  
ingredients.  

We   welcome   feedback   about   this   expansion   of   meal   options   for  
our   students.   Please   feel   free   to   share   ideas,   comments,   or  
concerns   with   the   Food   and   Nutrition   Department.   Your   insights  
will   help   us   assess   the   delivery   of   this   exciting   option   and   inform  
next   steps.  

Sincerely,  

Mellissa   Honeywood ,   Food   &   Nutrition   Services   Director  

Kenneth   Salim ,   Superintendent   of   Schools

Subject: 

Communicating information from School Committee Budget Retreat January 28, 2020 

The School Committee and Administration held a Budget Retreat this past Tuesday, January 28 for the 
purpose of reviewing input from the two budget Community Meetings, held on January 21 and 25. Thank 
you to Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor Simmons for attending and participating.  
 
Several issues and suggestions were brought forth during the Community Meeting discussions, with the 
following three major themes arising: 1) Improving recruitment, retention, and professional pathways for 
Educators  of  Color,  including  creating  a  pipeline  for  CPS  students  and  OST  providers;  2)  increasing 
capacity to address mental and behavioral needs (e.g. social workers, mental health specialists, counselors); 
and 3) strengthening partnerships with out-of-school time programs and DHSP in order to expand student 
access  to  learning  and  enrichment  opportunities  before-,  during-,  and  after-school.  I  encourage  my 
colleagues to review the Raw Notes from Community Meetings on Budget Priorities. The full presentation 
from  Tuesday’s  Budget  Retreat,  including  a  summary  of  suggestions,  can  be  found  here.  This  year’s 
Community Budget Meetings were a pilot; some specific feedback offered to improve the format in the 
future include: 

•  Approving the budget calendar earlier (~November) so that Community Budget Meetings can be 

scheduled (and advertised) further in advance; and 

•  Considering multiple meetings, held in various and more accessible locations;  

o  For staff: Offering variable times to accommodate teachers’ schedules (2:30PM, 3:30PM, 

4:30PM) and embedding in staff meetings 

o  For  families: Additional  weekday  evening  &  Saturday  options;  additional  outreach  & 
partnership to increase family participation; and language support for non-native-English 
speakers 

o  For students: Providing an option during school day 

 
We  will  have  further  discussions  on  how  to  use  input  to  inform  our  budget  process at  future meetings. 
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.  
 
Respectfully,
