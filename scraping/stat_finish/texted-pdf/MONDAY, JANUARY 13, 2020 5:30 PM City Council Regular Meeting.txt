To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19- 117, regarding data from 2019 Summer Meals 
Program, Assistant City Manager Ellen Semonoff reports the following: 
 
The Cambridge Summer Food Program aims, every summer, to increase food security in 
Cambridge by providing free and nutritionally balanced lunches to anyone 18 years of age and 
under. Over a number of years, the Summer Food staff of the Department of Human Service 
Programs has partnered with other departmental and city programs in an effort to enhance the 
quality of the food and the number of program participants. Partnership with the nutrition staff 
from the Department of Public Health led to healthier and more appetizing food choices, and 
partnerships with the Book Bike program and the Obama Administration’s Let’s Move program 
lead to an increase in children’s meals served. Through a strong collaboration with the 
Recreation Division of Human Services, more physical activities and games were added to 
summer food park sites to increase both children’s physical activities as well as attract more 
children to the parks for lunch.  Despites these strong partnerships, there was still a need to find 
ways to serve more children during the summer months. 
 
During the winter and spring of 2019, with strong advocacy and support from the City Council’s 
Human Services and Veteran’s Committee, the Department explored new opportunities to 
expand programming.  This was particularly important because changes in the ways that the state 
certified sites for inclusion in the program resulted in fewer sites being eligible for the federally 
funded meals program 
 
For many years, the City was able to operate summer food sites in parks adjacent to schools that 
were deemed eligible based upon the percentage of children in that school eligible for free and 
reduced lunch. Because schools in Cambridge are not neighborhood schools, the State no longer 
allows school data to be used to make parks eligible. Only census tract data for the area  can be 
used To address this challenge during the summer of 2018, the City began its first direct funding 
of park sites. The City funded two open park sites that had become ineligible for state funding to 

1.1

ensure the continuation of the program in those areas. During the summer of 2019, with the 
support of the City Manager and City Council, the City funded an additional open site, at the 
Central Square Library and added Russell Field as an additional state funded site, resulting in 9 
open park lunch sites across the City. 
 
During the Summer of 2019, Monday July 1st through Thursday August 15th, lunches were 
served from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Monday through Friday at the following open park sites: 
Danehy Park, Hoyt Field, Sennott Park, Green-Rose Heritage Park, Gold Star Mother’s 
Park/Gore Street, Hurley Street Playground, Central Square Library, Fresh Pond Apartment 
Playground, and Russell Field.  Over four thousand lunches were served during the Summer of 
2019.  
 
During Summer 2019, lunches were also served at 25 camp sites. In total, 20,310 lunches, 
17,821 breakfasts and 1,946 snacks were served. This represents a 12% increase from Summer 
2018.  
 
One of the suggestions that came out of the City Council’s Human Services and Veteran’s 
Committee public hearing on Summer Food was to pilot evening meals. The Department’s 
summer food and recreation staff proposed piloting this effort at the youth Summer Basketball 
Leagues.  The pilot Summer Dinner Program, using the Summer Food food vendor, Sidekim 
Foods, took place at Sennott Park (Devonte Neal League), on Monday and Wednesday evenings, 
at Glacken Field (Shariff Mustafa League) on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, and at Hoyt Field 
(Crunch Time and Fast Break League) on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday Evenings.   
 
The Department also piloted two other components for the Summer 2019 Dinner Program. 
Evening meals were piloted at all six Screen on the Green events at Parks across the City, 
Donnelly Field, Hoyt Field, Sennott Park, Rindge Field, Green Rose Heritage Park and Glacken 
Field. Evening meals were also provided in conjunction with the Book Bike Evening Events at 
public housing sites including Jefferson Park, 808 Memorial Drive, Roosevelt Towers, Walden 
Square, as well as at Clement Morgan Park.  
 
Overall, the pilot program was an enormous success. That success was based, in large part, on 
the partnerships (new and old), necessary for an effort like this. In addition to the partnerships 
described previously, there is a very strong positive relationship between the Cambridge Public 
Schools food service staff and the Summer Food Staff.  Sidekim Foods has been the procured 
vendor for many years. The staff at Sidekim and the Summer Food staff were in daily contact 
throughout the summer. This contact was critical, particularly with the expansion to providing 
dinners. Despite the strong relationship, there were bumps in trying to ensure timely delivery of 
evening meals at sites across the City.  This spring, the contract for a summer food vendor will 
go out to bid again.  
 
Another important partnership that was strengthened with the support of the Human Services and 
Veteran’s Committee was with Project Bread/Summer Eats. The partnership helped with 
community outreach and with establishing with the State Department of Education summer food 
manager that the Summer Food program could serve both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals 
at the same sites. This was a positive change that gave children and youth greater choice in meals 
and addressed different dietary and religious needs.  
 

Packet Pg. 21

1.1

The planning for Summer 2020 will include efforts to enhance community outreach for 2020. 
There will be more targeted outreach for the Book Bike events and greater efforts by summer 
Recreation Supervisors to do outreach for their assigned parks. The Department will also work 
with the Central Square Library on outreach for the upcoming summer to see how to attract more 
children and youth to the site.  
 
Staff will also work with the successful food service vendor to explore opportunities to have hot 
dinners and/or cold dinners that can be microwaved after they are served. Some evening sites 
worked well with the cold dinner, especially those sites serving younger children who had 
parental support with their meals. The Hoyt Leagues site serving older children was somewhat 
less successful and hot meals or take away meals that could be microwaved later might be more 
successful.

STOP Grant for $46,302.29 received from the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security 
(EOPSS) to the Grant Fund Police Department Salaries and Wages account ($41,250) and the 
Grant Fund Police Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account ($5,052.29). 
 
The Executive Office of Public Safety and Security (EOPSS) has recently awarded the 
Cambridge Police Department with $46,302.29 in Year 3 grant funding. The grant provides 
funds to continue contracting with a civilian advocate to implement the Police Department’s 
Trauma Informed approach to policing.  
 
A key component of this approach is to provide advocacy support to victims/survivor. The 
victim advocate responsibilities include assisting victims in identifying areas of need and assess 
safety risks; directing victim/survivors to community resources and explaining court procedures.  
In years 1 and 2 of the Grant, the Victim Advocate Assistant has helped the Department enhance 
strong relationships with service provider agencies and carry out its mission of trauma-informed 
approach to policing. Year 3 funding would enable the Department to continue this work.

December 9, 2019 

Re:  Surveillance Use Policy and Related Documents 

Pursuant to the Surveillance Technology Ordinance, Chapter 2.128 of the Cambridge 

Municipal Code (the “Ordinance”), I am submitting the following to the City Council for review 
and discussion at the December 9, 2019 Council Meeting: 

 
•  A proposed Surveillance Use Policy, which has been approved by the City Solicitor and 

the City Manager and requires Council approval; 

•  Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, describing Surveillance Technologies which 

are subject to the Ordinance, which require Council approval; and 

•  An Annual Surveillance Report compiled from Department-specific Annual 

Surveillance Reports concerning the Surveillance Technologies used by those City 
departments since December 10, 2018, which requires Council approval.  

The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, the Information Technology 
Department, the Police Department and all other City departments have worked to complete 
these materials for submission to the City Council.  Since this is my first submission to the City 
Council under the Ordinance, I am also providing background information on the compliance 
process which the City Council may find helpful.   

Background 
 

The Ordinance was adopted by the City Council on December 10, 2018, after extensive 

work between the City Council, the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts 
(“ACLUM”), Cambridge residents, and City staff.  The Ordinance regulates Surveillance 
Technology that may be acquired or used by the City and balances the right to privacy with the 
need to promote and ensure safety and security.  The Ordinance also provides for informed 
public discussion about Surveillance Technologies and any impacts they have on the civil rights 
and liberties of individuals, communities and groups in the City.  

Surveillance Ordinance Requirements 
 

The Ordinance addresses the following key components:

•  A Surveillance Use Policy, applicable to each City department that possesses or uses 

Surveillance Technology or foresees doing so in the near future.  The Surveillance Use 
Policy must be approved by the City Solicitor and the City Manager and submitted by the 
City Manager to the City Council for review and approval.   

•  Surveillance Technology Impact Reports, which relate to specific Surveillance 

Technologies, must be submitted by the City Manager to the City Council before the City 
seeks funds for or acquires Surveillance Technology, uses Surveillance Technology in a 
way not previously approved by the City Council, or enters into an agreement to share 
Surveillance Technology or the Surveillance Data it gathers with a non-City entity.   
•  An Annual Surveillance Report, submitted by the City Manager to the City Council, 
pertaining to each City department whose use of Surveillance Technology has been 
previously approved by the City Council in the past year.  The first Annual Surveillance 
Report is due to the City Council by December 10, 2019.  In 2020, and annually 
thereafter, the Report is due by March 1.   

•  The City Council must hold a meeting by May 31 of each year to discuss the City’s  
Annual Surveillance Reports and must also release a public report summarizing the 
Surveillance Technology Impact Reports received by the City Council during the prior 
year.   

Timing & Content of the Attached Surveillance Use Policy and Reports 
 

The Ordinance requires the City Manager to submit a proposed Surveillance Use Policy 

within 180 days after its effective date.  The Ordinance took effect on September 10, 2019.  
Therefore, a proposed Surveillance Use Policy is due to be submitted to the City Council by 
March 8, 2020.  Because the first Annual Surveillance Report, which is due to the City Council 
by December 10, 2019, assumes the existence of a Surveillance Use Policy, I am transmitting a 
proposed Surveillance Use Policy at this time, along with the Surveillance Technology Impact 
Reports and Annual Surveillance Report, for the Council’s review and approval.   
 

•  Specifically, the proposed Surveillance Use Policy includes the following five (5) 

appendices:  

o  Appendix A–a form for City departments’ internal report to the City Solicitor of 
technologies that may be Surveillance Technology as defined in the Ordinance.   

o  Appendix B–a Surveillance Technology Impact Report form. 
o  Appendix C–an Annual Surveillance Report form.  
o  Appendix D–a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Report form. 
o  Appendix E–a checklist for City departments and Compliance Officers to use as a 

guide when completing the above-referenced forms. 

•  The attached Surveillance Technology Impact Reports completed by City departments 
relate to existing Surveillance Technology covered by the Ordinance.  Therefore, the 
dates and costs listed are the original deployment dates and known costs.   

•  As this is the first submission of an Annual Surveillance Report under the Ordinance, the 
attached Annual Surveillance Report for this year to date does not include information

regarding complaints about Surveillance Technology or about violations of the 
Surveillance Use Policy. 

Department Compliance Process 
 

For each Surveillance Technology that was determined to be subject to the Ordinance, 

Department Heads were asked to review and confirm the applicability of the Ordinance to such 
Surveillance Technologies, complete a Surveillance Technology Impact Report, and complete an 
Annual Surveillance Report.  The Law Department, the City Manager’s Office, and the IT 
Department worked with each department to review all technologies that potentially fall under 
the Ordinance and to ensure that each department’s submission was complete.   

Continued Compliance  
 

the Surveillance Ordinance: 

The City Solicitor will coordinate further trainings to ensure continued compliance with 

•  Compliance Officers.  Each Department that currently possesses Surveillance 

Technology and any Department that seeks to acquire Surveillance Technology in the 
future must designate a Compliance Officer.  As further explained in the Surveillance 
Use Policy, the Compliance Officer will oversee record-keeping within their department 
in order to ensure that the department complies with the Ordinance and the Surveillance 
Use Policy.   

•  Training.  The Law Department has held several meetings with other City departments 
in order to familiarize City staff with the provisions of the Ordinance, the proposed 
Surveillance Use Policy, and the types of Surveillance Technologies that must be 
reported to the City Council under the Ordinance. I will continue to work with City 
departments to continue training about the Ordinance and the Surveillance Use Policy for 
City staff. 

I respectfully request that the City Council approve the attached proposed Surveillance 
Use Policy as well as the Surveillance Technology Impact Reports and the Annual Surveillance 
Report that I have also submitted herewith. 

 

I look forward to reviewing these documents in detail with you at the December 9, 2019 

City Council meeting and to answering any questions you may have.   
 

Sincerely, 
 
 
 
Louis A. DePasquale 
City Manager

IV.  Oversight. 
 

The Department Head of each City department which currently possesses, uses or 
anticipates seeking to acquire or use Surveillance Technology shall submit to the City Manager 
the name of a designated Compliance Officer assigned by the Department Head to keep and 
maintain records on the acquisition and use of Surveillance Technology or Surveillance Data by 
that City department, including records on access to Surveillance Data to ensure that the 
requirements of the Ordinance and this Policy are followed.   
 

The Department Head or Compliance Officer for that City department shall be 

responsible for internal record keeping on the acquisition and use of Surveillance Technology or 
Surveillance Data by that City department, including records on access to Surveillance Data, to 
ensure compliance with this Policy.   
 

A.  Data Collection. 

Surveillance Technology produces Surveillance Data upon which the City relies for 
governmental functions.  It is the policy of the City to ensure that the Surveillance Technology it 
uses collects no more Surveillance Data than is necessary to achieve the specific, authorized 
purposes of that particular Surveillance Technology. 
 

In accordance with the Ordinance, the City has reviewed all of the Surveillance 
Technology currently in use by City departments as of the Effective Date.  The Surveillance 
Technology, the departments that use or propose to acquire or use the Surveillance Technology, 
the purposes for which the particular Surveillance Technology is used, the nature of the 
Surveillance Data the Surveillance Technology collects, and information as to whether the 
minimum amount of Surveillance Data necessary is being collected, shall be submitted in a 
report to the City Manager by each Department Head for each City department which uses or 
proposes to use Surveillance Technology.  If any employee, agent, or contractor of any City 
department becomes aware of any inaccuracies concerning the use of Surveillance Technology 
or Surveillance Data that is collected by a department’s Surveillance Technology other than as 
outlined in that City department’s report to the City Manager, that employee, agent, or contractor 
is required to immediately report the collection of such Surveillance Data or use of such 
Surveillance Technology to the department’s Compliance Officer, the Department Head, the City 
Manager, the City Solicitor, or the Personnel Director.  

 

B.  Data Protection. 

No Surveillance Data shall be stored, accessed, or transmitted without proper encryption, 

access and password controls, and access-oversight approved by the City’s Chief Information

Officer or his/her designee in the Information Technology Department (“ITD”).  Each City 
department’s Compliance Officer shall complete and submit to ITD a list of each type of 
Surveillance Technology currently used by that department, the Surveillance data it collects, the 
staff who have access to the Surveillance Data, and all other information required under 
Subsection A above.  ITD shall ensure that proper procedures are in place to protect all 
Surveillance Data.  In the event that any department is, in the judgment of ITD, unable to 
implement the security measures necessary to adequately protect Surveillance Data, ITD shall 
immediately contact the City Manager and the City Solicitor, and propose additional measures to 
protect Surveillance Data from inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure. 
 

C.  Data Access. 

City employees may only have access to Surveillance Data when such access is necessary 

for their official duties. The Department Head or Compliance Officer of each City department 
shall report to ITD, the City Manager and the City Solicitor, the name of each employee, 
contractor, or other agent that requires access to Surveillance Data.  The Department Head or 
Compliance Officer shall state the specific Surveillance Data to which each individual may have 
access.  The City may, at any time, with or without notice to the individual, terminate any 
individual’s access to Surveillance Technology or Surveillance Data. 
 

D.  Data Retention. 

Surveillance Data will not be maintained any longer than is necessary to achieve its 
approved purpose(s), provided that the City will retain Surveillance Data for the periods required 
by the Massachusetts Public Records Law, G.L. c. 66, § 10, the Massachusetts Municipal 
Records Retention Schedule, or any other applicable laws or regulations.   
 

Exceptions to the Massachusetts Municipal Records Retention Schedule may be 
requested from the Commonwealth by the City Solicitor at the request of a Department Head as 
follows:  
 

1.  A Department Head may seek exceptions for a particular type of Surveillance Data by 

seeking the exception explicitly in a Surveillance Technology Impact Report or 
Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy; or 
 

2.  A Department Head may seek an exception for a particular type of Surveillance Data 

from the City Manager on a case-by-case basis.   

All exceptions and the reasons therefor shall be included in a department’s Annual 

Surveillance Report.

V. 
 

Public and Third-Party Access. 

The City shall comply with its obligations pursuant to the Massachusetts Public Records 

Law, (G. L. c. 4, § 7 cl. 26, and G. L. c. 66, § 10 et seq.), Chapter 2.126 of the Cambridge 
Municipal Code (the “Open Data Ordinance”), and any other applicable law, regulation, or order 
of a court or state or federal administrative agency of competent jurisdiction that requires the 
disclosure of particular Surveillance Data. 
 

The City’s intent is to make as much information as possible available to the public 

without compromising the privacy of any Identifiable Individual(s), as defined in Section 
2.128.020(C) of the Ordinance.  The City shall, to the extent possible and permitted in 
accordance with applicable laws and regulations, anonymize, aggregate, and/or geomask 
Surveillance Data where necessary to protect the privacy of Identifiable Individuals. While some 
data may not on its own reveal the personal information of Identifiable Individuals, when 
combined with other data it may reveal information that would otherwise be exempt from 
disclosure by law.  In the event that a City employee suspects that the release of data would 
present such a risk, the employee shall report that risk to the Department Head or the 
Compliance Officer for that employee’s department and the Department Head or the Compliance 
Officer shall contact the City Manager and City Solicitor requesting a legal opinion from the 
City Solicitor as to whether the data is exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Law or 
other applicable law or regulation. 
 

Surveillance Data may only be accessed by authorized City employees, as described in 

Section IV(C) above, and may only be distributed to third parties in accordance with this Section 
V of this Policy.  However, any department may share Surveillance Data with the Police 
Department under Exigent Circumstances.  
 
VI. 
 

Training. 

Upon beginning employment or within a reasonable time after commencing employment, 

any City employees or City contractor who will be involved in the collection of Surveillance 
Data or use of Surveillance Technology will be given a copy of the Surveillance Ordinance and 
this Policy for their review and trained by their Department Head, supervisor, or other 
appropriate person assigned to conduct such trainings in ensuring that the activities to be 
performed by that staff or contractor comply with the Surveillance Ordinance and this Policy.

VII.  Relationship to Other Policies and Required Reports. 
 

All Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policies shall be consistent with the provisions 

set forth in this Policy as it may be amended from time to time.  To the extent there is a conflict 
between this Policy and a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy, this Policy shall govern.   
Departments Heads shall be responsible for submitting to the City Manager the following 
documents required by the Ordinance: 
 

A.  Surveillance Technology Impact Report(s) (Section 2.128.030) in the form provided in 

Appendix B attached hereto—submitted for each proposed acquisition or use of 
Surveillance Technology.   
 

B.  Annual Surveillance Report(s) (Section 2.128.060) in the form provided in Appendix C 
attached hereto—submitted annually by the City Manager to the City Council covering 
the prior calendar year. The first such report, describing all existing Surveillance 
Technologies and Surveillance Data is due to the City Council on December 10, 2019. 
Thereafter, the report will be due to the City Council by March 1 of each year.   
 

C.  Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy(ies) (Section 2.128.030) in the form 

provided in Appendix D attached hereto—submitted for each proposed acquisition or use 
of Surveillance Technology not already covered under this Policy.    
 
When providing any of the above reports or a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use 

Policy, a Department Head should pay particular attention to the impacts the use of the 
Surveillance Technology has on marginalized communities in the City, including, but, not 
limited to, communities of color.  For any disparity that exists, the Department Head shall 
explain its understanding as to why the disparity exists and how the Department Head intends to  
address the disparity. 
 
VIII.  Amendments. 
 

This Policy may be amended from time to time by the City Manager, provided that any 

proposed amendment shall be submitted to the City Council for approval.

APPENDIX C: CITY OF CAMBRIDGE ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REPORT 

Department: 
Division or Unit 
(if applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

 
 

 
 
 

 
1.  What Surveillance Technologies has the department used in the last year? 

List each Surveillance Technology and, for each Surveillance Technology, describe how it 
works and what it has been used for. For example: “Automatic license plate readers. 
Deployed on police and traffic enforcement vehicles to read license plates of vehicles as 
selected by the individual operator. Used by traffic enforcement to enforce parking laws. 
Used by police to aid in the identification and recovery of stolen vehicles.” 

 
 
2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party? 

List each entity with which Surveillance Data was shared, the date(s) on which Surveillance 
Data was shared with each entity, the type of Surveillance Data shared, and the purpose for 
sharing. 

 
 
3.  What complaints (if any) has your department received about Surveillance 

Technology? 
Describe how many complaints were received, the subject of the complaints, any department 
response, and the organizations responsible for the complaints, if any. 

 
 
4.  Were any violations of the Surveillance Use Policy found in the last year?  

List all known violations, the department’s diagnosis of the reason for the violation, and what 
remedial action was taken by the department. Also, identify steps taken to determine if 
violations have occurred. 

 
 
5.  Has Surveillance Technology been effective in achieving its identified purpose? 
For each Surveillance Technology and each stated purpose listed in (1) above, describe whether 
the Surveillance Technology has been effective in realizing the purpose. Be specific, using 

Page 9 of 12

quantitative data whenever possible. For example: “Automatic license plate readers. Identified 
800 vehicles that had exceeded posted parking time limits, leading to $40,000 in fines collected.” 
 
 
6.  Did the department receive any public records requests concerning Surveillance 

Technology? 
Describe how many requests were received, how many records the department produced in 
response thereto, and generally what information the requests were seeking. 

 
 
7.  How much did it cost to acquire and operate Surveillance Technology? 

For each Surveillance Technology listed in (1) above, list all costs associated therewith. 
Costs include but are not limited to operating personnel, maintenance, upgrades, training, 
storage, and acquisition. Also explain the source of funding for each Surveillance 
Technology for next year. 

 
 
8.  Are any communities disproportionately impacted by Surveillance Technology? 
For each Surveillance Technology listed in (1) above, explain whether and how any 
communities are disproportionately impacted by the use of the Surveillance Technology. 
“Impact” in this context may mean that a population is disproportionately the target of a 
Surveillance Technology, disproportionately penalized as a result of the City’s use of a 
Surveillance Technology, or disproportionately excluded from reaping the benefits of the 
City’s use of a Surveillance Technology. 

Pay particular attention to low-income communities, communities of color, or any 
community that is marginalized in the City. If any disproportionality exists, explain either the 
department’s proposed remedy or why the disproportionality is appropriate. Use quantitative 
data whenever possible. For example: “Automatic license plate readers. Of the 1,000 vehicles 
stopped due to use of ALPRs, 400 were driven by African-Americans and 200 were driven 
by Hispanics. This is significantly disproportionate to the population of Cambridge. The 
department will adjust patrols in order to ensure that ALPRs are not deployed 
disproportionately in communities inhabited by African-American and Hispanic residents.”

APPENDIX E:  CHECKLIST FOR SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY COMPLIANCE 

 
In order to better assist departments in compliance with the Surveillance Use Policy, we have 
compiled the below checklist for department heads and compliance officers to review. 
 

1.  Is this a Surveillance Technology for which City Council approval has previously 

been obtained?   
 

a.  If yes, skip to No. 2.  

b.  If no, you will need to complete the following: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

i.  Surveillance Technology Impact Report (see Appendix B); and 

ii.  If the Surveillance Technology is not covered in the Surveillance Use 

Policy, you’ll also need a Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy 
(see Appendix D). 

2.  Is there a proposal to use the Surveillance Technology for a purpose, in a manner, 

or in a location not previously approved by the City Council? 
 

a.  If no, skip to No. 3. 

b.  If yes, you will need to resubmit a Surveillance Technology Impact Report (see 
Appendix B); then you will need to list the Surveillance Technology in the 
Annual Surveillance Report (see Appendix C) referenced below in No. 3.  
 

3.  Surveillance Technologies previously approved by the City Council must be listed 
on the Annual Surveillance Report (see Appendix C) submitted to the City Council 
by the City Manager each year by March 1.  Draft submissions for the Annual 
Surveillance Report must be submitted by Department Heads to the City Manager 
no later than January 1 of each year.

November 5, 2018 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

WHEREAS:  Recently the state fire marshal board voted to adopt provisions from 2018 

NFPA 1 for mobile fueling; and 

WHEREAS:  The State Fire Marshal announced in under 527 CMR 1:00-42.10 that in

streamline the approval process for businesses; and  

WHEREAS:  The Cambridge Fire Department and its Fire Prevention Bureau could 

potentially receive an application from one of these mobile fueling services;

WHEREAS:  Many car owners do not have off-street parking and might want to have their 

cars filled while parked on the street or in public garages, raising additional 
curb management conflicts and safety concerns; and

transportation sector by encouraging the use of sustainable mobility options and 
electric vehicle technology. B. Definition. Mobile On-Demand Fueling. The practice of 
delivering motor vehicle fuel to a motor vehicle while the motor vehicle is parked in a

penalized by a noncriminal disposition as provided in G.L. c. 40, §21D. For purposes 
of this section, the Chief of the Fire Department or their designees shall be enforcing 
persons. E. Severability. It is the intention of the City Council that each separate 
provision of this chapter shall be deemed independent of all other provisions herein,

declared to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of 
this chapter shall remain valid and enforceable.

COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN 
COUNCILLOR KELLEY

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City Council passed Chapter 2.128 Surveillance Technology Ordinance on 
December 10, 2018, which imposed a requirement that the City Manager seek approval 
from the City Council prior to acquiring or using certain surveillance technology, 
including Biometric Surveillance Technology and facial recognition software and 
databases; and 
 
Notwithstanding this existing check on the City’s authority to acquire and use face 
recognition technology or data derived thereof, the potential threats to residents’ civil 
rights and civil liberties that are unique to face recognition technology warrant its 
outright ban; and 
 
Facial recognition software can discriminate based on classes like race and gender; a 
2018 report out of the MIT Media Lab and Microsoft “Gender Shades: Intersectional 
Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification” found that while the 
“maximum error rate for lighter-skinned makes is 0.8%” in commercial gender 
classification systems, “darker skinned females are the most misclassified group (with 
error rates up to 34.7%);” and 
 
The use of face recognition technology can have a chilling effect on the exercise of 
constitutionally protected free speech, with the technology being used in China to 
target ethnic minorities, and in the United States, it was used by police agencies in 
Baltimore, Maryland, to target activists in the aftermath of Freddie Gray’s death; and

WHEREAS: 

State Representative Dave Rogers (whose district includes parts of Cambridge) has 
filed legislation that would impose a moratorium on face recognition technology, and 
as recently as Thursday, July 25, 2019, Representative Ayanna Pressley introduced a 
bill before Congress that would: 

1.  Prohibit the use of biometric recognition technology in public and assisted 

housing units funded under HUD; and 

2.  Require HUD to submit a report to Congress that provides analysis on any 

known use of facial recognition technologies in public housing units; the impact 
of emerging technologies on tenants; the purpose of installing the technologies 
in the units; demographic information of impacted tenants, and; the impact of 
emerging technologies on vulnerable communities in public housing, including 
tenant privacy, civil rights and fair housing includes HUD federally assisted 
rental dwelling units;  

 
WHEREAS: 

 
Three cities have already banned the use of facial recognition technology by municipal 
authorities, including San Francisco, Oakland (CA), and next door in Somerville; now 
therefore be it 

 
ORDERED: 

 
That the attached amendment to Chapter 2.128 Surveillance Ordinance Technology be 
forwarded to the Public Safety Committee for a hearing as soon as possible.

Re: Proposal to ban face surveillance in City government 
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui and City Councillors, 

 

We write on behalf of the ACLU of Massachusetts (“ACLU”) and our thousands of members and 
supporters in the City of Cambridge to express strong support for the proposed amendment to the 
Surveillance Ordinance to prohibit the use of face surveillance technology. The amendment—proposed 
by Mayor Siddiqui, Councillor McGovern, and former Councillor Kelley—provides for a ban on the use 
of face surveillance technology by the City of Cambridge’s government and public officials. 
 
Face surveillance technology poses unprecedented threats to civil rights, civil libterties, and open, 
democratic society. But we don’t have to live in a dystopia with constant government tracking of our 
every movement. Instead of accepting that the technology will determine the boundaries of our rights, 
we must chart an intentional course into the 21st century, maintaining democratic control over our 
society and our lives. To protect residents now and into the future, the City of Cambridge should join 
San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, California and Somerville, Brookline, and Northampton, 
Massachusetts in prohibiting the use of face surveillance technology by local government. 
 
For too long, we have accepted that new technologies will determine the boundaries of our 21st century 
rights. But face surveillance is too dangerous to allow that trend to continue. Imagine if you were 
required to tattoo a barcode to your face, which could only be read by the government—enabling 
officials to secretly track your every movement, habit, and association. That is the functional equivalent 
of this technology. Face surveillance is the final frontier of government tracking, enabling officials to 
track you not through a cell phone, but through your face—an immutable, physical characteristic you 
carry with you everywhere. Unlike your cell phone, you cannot leave your face at home. To maintain 
democratic control over the future of civic life in Cambridge, and to protect the rights of the most 
marginalized and oppressed, we urge you to support this crucial measure.  
 
Face surveillance enables mass tracking of public life 
 
Face surveillance technology uses algorithms designed to analyze images of human faces, and can be 
used to identify and track people en masse, without their knowledge or consent. In one form of facial 
surveillance technology, a computer program analyzes an image of a person’s face, taking measurements

of their facial features to create a unique “faceprint.” Face surveillance algorithms can use these 
faceprints, in combination with databases like the driver’s license system at the Registry of Motor 
Vehicles and surveillance camera networks, to identify and track people en masse.  
 
Some companies are also selling so-called “emotion detection” facial surveillance systems, which they 
claim can determine whether someone is happy, sad, honest, or deceitful. Independent research 
concludes it is not possible to discern how someone is feeling by judging the physical characteristics of 
their face.1 
 
There are three primary ways face surveillance systems can be used by governments: 
 

(1)  Identification: Authorities have a photo, image, or even a drawing of someone they 
want to identify. Using face surveillance, authorities can automatically scan vast 
databases of labeled images (for example, a driver’s license database) to find one or more 
faceprints that may or may not “match” their photo. 

 

 

(2)  Tracking: Governments can use networks of surveillance cameras to scan for and track 
individuals and groups of people, creating persistent records of every person’s public 
movements, habits, and associations—merely with the push of a button. The People’s 
Republic of China uses face surveillance technology in this way to control and oppress 
religious minorities. Local governments in the United States, including in Chicago and 
Detroit, have likewise overlaid face surveillance technologies on their public surveillance 
camera networks.2 

(3)  Analysis: So-called “emotion detection” can be used to assign emotional attributes 
based on a person’s facial expressions. For example, a system may tell a user that a 
person is agitated, anxious, or angry. (Again, research indicates this is not a scientifically 
sound project.3) 

 
Face surveillance is unregulated, biased, and a threat to fundamental rights 
 
The ACLU has three primary areas of concern regarding face surveillance technologies, pertaining to (i) 
unregulated use of the technology; (ii) specific harms to communities of color, youth, transgender 
people, and immigrants; and (iii) civil rights, civil liberties, and other core constitutional concerns.  
 
(i) Unregulated Use of the Technology 
 
Face surveillance is currently unregulated in Massachusetts. Nonetheless, the spread of this technology is 
occurring in the dark, absent public debate or democratic oversight. Nationwide, federal, state, and local 
government agencies are adopting face surveillance technologies despite the absence of privacy 
regulations, the technology’s biases and inaccuracies, and the threats it poses to free and open societies. 
 
Behind closed doors, face surveillance companies are preying on local governments across the nation, 
trying to use our families and communities as guinea pigs for their private financial gain. In Plymouth,

Massachusetts, for example, emails obtained4 by the ACLU show the police chief was in talks with 
Suspect Technologies, a face surveillance manufacturer, for two years—entirely in secret. The emails 
show the police department planned to deploy inaccurate, potentially biased face surveillance technology 
on public surveillance cameras throughout town, despite the fact that the company CEO acknowledged 
his product might only work about 30 percent of the time. The plans were scrapped once they became 
public.5 
 
(ii) Face Surveillance Poses Special Risks to Black People, Youth, Transgender People, and Immigrant 
Communities 
 
Facial recognition technology is not always accurate. And these inaccuracies are more likely to unfairly 
harm people of color, youth, and transgender people. 
 
First, the use of facial surveillance technologies undermines Cambridge’s commitment to racial justice. 
Face surveillance in the hands of government exacerbates the disproportionate harm these communities 
suffer from overpolicing in at least four ways.  
 

(1)  Rigorous, academic peer-reviewed studies show certain face surveillance algorithms have high 
failure rates when evaluating the faces of Black women.6 Most recently, in December 2019, a 
federal government study by the non-partisan National Institute for Standards and Technology 
found that face surveillance algorithms are more likely to have trouble accurately identifying 
people with darker skin, women, children, and the elderly.7 

(2)  Renowned psychologists have found that attempting to determine a person’s emotional state 

from their facial expressions alone is a “futile exercise.”8 Moreover, a study found that so-called 
“emotion detection” software inaccurately classified Black men’s faces as more angry and 
contemptuous than white faces, even in pictures where the men are smiling.9 

(3)  Face surveillance systems in use by law enforcement frequently compare images against mugshot 
databases. Numerous studies, including those examining trends in Massachusetts, have shown 
that Black and Latine people are many times more likely to face arrest for a variety of crimes 
than white people, even when whites commit those crimes at the same rates.10 Making matters 
worse, arrest does not equal guilt. Using mugshot databases for face surveillance searches 
exacerbates historical inequities by recycling that bias through new technology, and unfairly 
scrutinizing people who have long been targets of disproportionate police attention.

4.2.a

(4)  Even if face surveillance systems were perfectly accurate, and even if the police did not use 

mugshot databases for facial recognition searches, history suggests these technologies will be 
disparately deployed in low-income and communities of color, and against immigrants. This has 
the impact not only of subjecting traditionally oppressed groups of people to yet more 
surveillance and tracking, but also of making other, less policed communities even more invisible 
to law enforcement.  

 
Second, face surveillance is especially dangerous when it is used on children. Research11 that tested five 
“top performing commercial-off-the shelf” face recognition systems shows these systems “perform 
poorer on children than on adults.” As children grow, their faces change shape, but face surveillance 
systems optimized for use on adults do not account for these changes. Despite these problems, some 
school districts are experimenting with the use of face surveillance to track and monitor students, 
teachers, staff, and visitors.12 Schools should be safe environments for students to learn, explore their 
identities and intellects, and play. Face surveillance technology threatens that environment. The use of 
face surveillance in schools transforms students into perpetual suspects, where each and every one of 
their movements can be automatically monitored and catalogued. The use of this monitoring technology 
in public schools negatively impacts students’ ability to explore new ideas, express their creativity, and 
engage in student dissent. 
 
Third, face surveillance technology is prone to misgendering transgender people.13 Research shows that 
automatic gender recognition, a subfield of face surveillance technology, “consistently operationalises 
gender in a trans-exclusive way, and consequently carries disproportionate risk for trans people subject 
to it.”14 At a time when transgender rights are under attack nationwide,15 Cambridge must do everything 
in its power to protect this marginalized group. 
 
Finally, the use of face surveillance technology harms immigrant families. In this political climate, 
immigrants are already fearful of engagement with public institutions, including schools and local police, 
and face surveillance systems would further chill immigrant participation in public life.   
 
Cambridge officials have worked hard to make the City a safe place for all people, including immigrants, 
people of color, and transgender people. Banning face surveillance extends that progress into the digital 
future, ensuring Cambridge remains a welcoming and safe place for all.16

Face surveillance poses a threat to Cambridge residents’ and visitors’ civil rights and civil liberties. 
Especially concerning is how this technology affects our privacy interests, and our rights to freedom of 
expression and association. 
 
As artificial intelligence, big data, and automation continue to change every area of our lives, the pull of 
so-called “smart city” devices that bring more tracking and surveillance of residents will become 
stronger. Face surveillance technology connected to surveillance camera feeds in Cambridge would 
facilitate government monitoring of every person’s public movements, associations, and habits—not just 
on one day, but on all days—merely with the push of a button. 
 
If the Government can track everyone who goes to a place of worship, a political rally, or seeks 
reproductive or substance use medical attention, we lose our freedom to speak our minds, freely criticize 
the government, pray to the god we want, and access healthcare in private. Cambridge residents and 
visitors should feel free to visit the cannabis shop or the health clinic without fear that their attendance is 
secretly being tracked by government officials. 
 
These are not hypothetical dangers taken from a Black Mirror episode: This technology is currently being 
used to conduct precisely this kind of dystopian monitoring. For example, the authoritarian government 
in China is deploying facial surveillance to control and oppress the religious minority Uighur population. 
Closer to home, the Detroit Police Department has been using face surveillance on its networked public 
surveillance camera system for two years. The system was established in secret, without public debate, 
legislative authorization, or regulations to protect civil rights and liberties.17  
 
Moreover, face surveillance raises significant constitutional concerns, including the following: 
 

(1)  Face surveillance enables the government to identify individuals while they are 

exercising rights protected by the First Amendment. Freedom of speech, freedom of the 
press, freedom of association, and free exercise of religion are all at risk when the government 
can easily and continuously track everyone’s public movements. Persistent identification and 
tracking can have a chilling effect, as people will be less likely to exercise their rights if they know 
the government is tracking and identifying them everywhere they go. 

(2)  Face surveillance threatens our Fourth Amendment right to be left alone. The highest 

courts in the United States and the Commonwealth have both held that the government cannot 
use technological advancements to track our public movements via our cellphones without 
judicial intervention. The government’s use of face surveillance raises the same constitutional 
concerns, as this technology allows the governments to keep tabs on all of our public 
movements and activities easily, efficiently, and without our knowledge. 

(3)  Failing to disclose the use of face surveillance jeopardizes our Fourteenth Amendment 
Due Process rights. Due process requires the government to disclose potentially exculpatory 
information to defense attorneys. Failing to disclose to defendants how face surveillance was 
used violates this constitutionally protected right and threatens their ability to have a fair trial. 
The government routinely discloses information regarding human eyewitnesses; its constitutional 
obligations should be no different for identifications stemming from face surveillance. We know 
these technologies are in use in other states, including Massachusetts, but it is our understanding 
that in the vast majority of cases criminal defendants have not been given the opportunity to 
review or challenge information derived from face recognition searches.

4.2.a

As Northeastern scholar Woodrow Hartzog has observed, face surveillance is a perfect tool for social 
control.18 People in Cambridge must be able to visit substance use clinics, churches and synagogues, 
friends and family, political protests, and doctors’ offices without fear that a government agent is secretly 
keeping tabs of their every movement. 
 
Cambridge must chart a different course 
 
Ultimately, faced with the question of whether Cambridge should prohibit the use of face surveillance by 
government actors in City, Councillors ought to consider what kind of community they want to foster 
into the 21st century. Constant surveillance has negative effects on health, well being, and community 
trust. Surveillance increases not only our fears and uncertainty, but also personal anxiety.19 Privacy 
advocates have long warned about the psychological consequences of being watched and observed by 
unaccountable, faceless entities.20 Face surveillance magnifies these concerns and extends them into truly 
new and frightening territory, by totalizing the surveillance of our movements in public space. 
 
Following the bans in the three cities in California and three Massachusetts communities, 
Cambridge has the chance to lead by becoming the first technology epicenter on the East Coast 
to ban municipal government use of face surveillance technology.  
 
As written, the proposal before you protects people from government use of a dangerous, racially-biased 
technology in the City of Cambridge, advancing racial, economic, and immigration justice, and protecting 
democracy, open society, and liberty. Fundamentally, this proposal enables the City to maintain 
democratic control over a technology that, unattended, threatens democracy itself. We therefore 
respectfully ask that you support this crucial measure. 
 
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about the proposal or its implications. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
 

Sincerely, 
 

 
Kade Crockford

On January 17, 2020, Emma Watkins shall be retiring from her role as Director of the

Emma Watkins has worked to make the Senior Center such a welcoming place for all

As one senior recently stated, “Emma will be missed, but then again she will be 
present in all the kindness, peace, love, intelligence, strength, respect and unity that 
touches all our souls and hearts at the Cambridge Senior Center,” and surely this 
sentiment captures the feelings shared by so many who have come to know, work with,

Emma Watkins has invested so much care, energy, and love into her role at the 
Cambridge Senior Center, the City has been all the better for her work, and the

WHEREAS: 

The Arts, tourism, and local small businesses are heavily intertwined, as non-resident 
arts and culture event attendees spend an average of $42.53 on meals, souvenirs, 
ground transportation, and other expenses for each arts and culture event they attend in 
Cambridge, excluding the price of admission; and 
 
During the FY20 budget hearings, the City Council requested that the Cambridge 
Office of Tourism, the Cambridge Arts Council, and the Economic Development 
Division of the Community Development Department meet regularly to coordinate 
efforts to strengthen the local small business community and the Arts through tourism; 
and 
 
Since then, these entities have been meeting regularly, with a representative from the 
City Manager’s Office in attendance; and 
 
Having an update on the work that has been done at these meetings would grant

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

Cambridge’s tree canopy has shrunk by nearly 20% over the last decade; and 
 
Amendments made to the Tree Protection Ordinance (TPO) last year which restrict the 
removal of “significant trees” on private property will expire on March 11, 2020 if no 
action is taken; and 
 
On November 12, 2019, the city and consultants presented a thorough and impressive 
report to the Health & Environment Committee on a long term approach to reversing 
the canopy decline, rooted in recommendations from the Urban Forest Master Plan 
Task Force which met 13 times between June 2018 and April 2019; and 
 
The report, which contains numerous recommendations on lasting changes that should 
be made to the TPO, was originally scheduled to be released in June 2019 but was 
delayed; and 
 
The report is excellent and deserves careful deliberation and discussion by the city 
council, and it would be a great disservice to rush this conversation in an attempt to 
overhaul the ordinance ahead of the March 11, 2020 expiration date; and 
 
At the same time, it would be a travesty to let the temporary amendments to the TPO 
expire without any new language, as doing so would almost certainly result in a 
massive citywide cutting spree, worsening our canopy decline and erasing any positive 
impact the temporary amendments might have had; now therefore be it

ORDERED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

 

That section 8.66.055 of the municipal ordinances of the City of Cambridge, entitled 
“Procedure for Other Significant Tree Removals” be amend by substitution to read as 
follows: 
 
“For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050, a permit will be required 
from the City Arborist. In all cases, the City Arborist shall keep a record of the type 
and size of tree removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the tree 
documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractor(s) involved, and the name 
and address of the property owner. No such permits will be issued until December 31, 
2020, except for emergency circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects 
undertaken pursuant to State or Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, 
or where a tree poses significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or 
for dead or dangerous trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the 
removal of certain significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree 
canopy. Any tree removed in violation of this section, prior to December 31, 2020, 
shall require a payment into the tree replacement fund as per section 8.66.070 
according to a schedule as follows:  10% of the replacement value for property owners 
who qualify for the City of Cambridge residential real property tax exemption, no fee 
for property owners that receive established forms of financial assistance, and the full 
replacement cost in all other circumstances. The value to be paid into the tree 
replacement fund shall be equivalent to the cost of purchasing, planting, watering and 
maintaining said Replacement Trees for a period of not less than five years.” 
 
 
 
That the City Council go on record expressing a clear intent to pass comprehensive 
amendments to the TPO, based off the recommendations of the task force, well ahead 
the new proposed deadline of December 2020.

The ordinance committee will conduct a public hearing on the following items: A petition to amend 
Articles 2.00 and 4.32 of the zoning ordinance regarding Mobile Fueling; and a petition to amend 
Articles 8.12.010 of the Municipal Code regarding Fuel Pump Warning Label Amendment. 

A.  Hearing on mobile fueling 

Councillor Dennis Carlone  6:27   
Welcome, everyone. Thank you, John. We have a quorum today. And the call of the hearing is as follows 
the Ordinance Committee will conduct a public hearing on the following items. A petition to amend 
articles 2.00 and 4.32 of the zoning ordinance regarding mobile fueling and a petition to amend articles 
8.12.010 of their municipal code regarding fuel pump warning label amendment. 
 
Excuse me. 
 
This hearing is, as you heard, being audio and video recorded. There is an attendee and speaker signup 
sheet, although we might not be proceeding that far as I'll explain on the first one. The format of the 
meeting is the petitioner will be heard first, city staff... on the first one primarily the law department... will 
speak. What is interesting about this first petition, on mobile mobile fueling, is the law department has a 
recommendation that really would make this meeting ineffectual. So it is a preliminary meeting, that will 
lead to the next step. Perhaps the best thing to do would be to have, if it's the vice mayor, just give a quick 
overview. And then the legal department will come forth and present their recommendations which 
actually will lead to a rethinking of how this is approached.  

Packet Pg. 260

7.1

 
Madam Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  8:36   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Okay. So, about... probably a year ago, a resident contacted me and brought to my 
attention that there were new... a new class of business that operated sort of by app, and they were 
offering so called mobile on demand fueling and the idea is you could, you know, just summon somebody 
to come and pump gas for your car and this resident said, "Gee, that sounds kind of like not such a great 
idea." And so I checked with our fire chief. And at that point we hadn't heard anything about these 
businesses and then started to hear a little bit more about them. And I guess it's, you know, it's a new new 
segment of the technology business sort of, and I guess there's probably some venture capital money 
going into it. And so... Actually the state... Fire... is it right... Marshal, right, looked into it. When we were 
first contacted, the State Fire Marshal had not, at that point, looked into it. They looked into it, and 
basically are leaving it to the discretion of cities and towns to decide how they want to handle it. Our Fire 
Chief, I won't speak for him, has been not very enthusiastic about it. But I spoke with Councillor Kelly, 
from a public safety standpoint about whether we should just put in a prohibition against having this on, 
on the theory that it's not really that needed in Cambridge given the size of our city. And that there are 
certainly legitimate concerns about who is handling a highly flammable substance like gasoline, the 
potential for spilling and why we would even have trucks driving around to deliver gas when it's really 
not that hard to go to a gas station and fill up your car. So anyway, so Councillor Kelly at that point, and 
I'm sorry he's not here suggested that we amend the zoning ordinance to make it a use that is not allowed 
city wide, which sounded like a brilliant idea. And I trusted his knowledge of how to go about amending 
an ordinance and now the city solicitor has informed us that in fact, that wasn't the right approach because 
the zoning ordinance can't be used that way. And it should have been an amendment to the municipal 
ordinance, which, on a side note, I think, again, underscores the fact that the council really could use a 
closer connection somehow with the law department so that we don't spin our wheels, so to speak. So, 
you know, maybe we should have checked in advance or, you know, whatever. So anyway, so now we 
have the memo from the city solicitor, which very kindly does suggest how we could go about amending 
the municipal ordinance to achieve the same goal, which is to basically say, we're not going to allow these 
mobile on demand, fueling apps. So that's kind of where we are, and I'm happy to hear from staff. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  11:45   
So just wanted to say before we have Arthur come up. I'm joined today by the vice mayor. Vice Mayor 
Devereaux, Councillor Zondervan,  Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui and I am Dennis Carlone. We 
have representatives from community development, the fire department, Public Works, traffic, Parking 
and Transportation, and of course the law department. So Arthur, even though the vice mayor gave an 
overview of your recommendations, perhaps you could go over it a little bit more. And basically what it 
says is that, instead of having the meeting today, we will have a future meeting, as you recommend. 
Please. Welcome. 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  12:32   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So the vice mayor, did summarize the legal opinion that we gave to the committee. 
That this really is not appropriate for a zoning ordinance because zoning cannot regulate what goes on in 
the public ways. Number one, and number two, even on private property, the fueling of a car would not 
be considered a use under zoning. So... the... but we do believe that what you're trying... what you appear 
to be trying to accomplish here could be done by way of a general ordinance amendment to the municipal 
code. So we propose possible language for the committee to consider. One issue that I think you were just 
alluding to is that this meeting was advertised as a meeting on a potential zoning ordinance. So, if the 
committee is in agreement that you wouldn't be going forward with a zoning amendment, then I think 
meeting on the general ordinance would have to be a different meeting. 
 

Packet Pg. 261

7.1

Councillor Dennis Carlone  13:55   
Thank you for that and thank you for a well written comment on the proposal. Now we could have other 
staff members talk but in considering their time is very important, I think we will hold off unless the fire 
department, DPW or or any of the departments wish to come forth with comments. We'll wait until we 
come back, hopefully in the early part here. I don't see anybody eagerly wanting to go forth. Any 
comments. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  14:35   
Only from the procedural standpoint, I understand that the zoning thing is is moot at this point. So can we 
as a committee vote to send to the recommended language to the council for consideration in the future as 
an amendment to the municipal ordinance. Do we... Can we take any action today or do we have to say 
we'll save this memo and deal with it? Some other time? 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  15:01   
Well, I think... Through you, Mr. Chair. I think the action would be on the zoning amendment, which 
could be that... you are... that you recommend to the council that the zoning amendment be withdrawn 
based on the legal opinion that you've received. The issue with discussing the proposed general ordinance 
is that it really wasn't advertised as being part of the agenda for this meeting. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  15:38   
I see. I mean, I'm happy to withdraw the zoning thing, I just wonder if... by sending it to the council, it 
could just be placed on a future agenda doesn't, necessarily mean that it's, I don't know, maybe the clerk 
can explain what that would mean; sending it to the council. Would this committee... This committee will 
have report right? Can it have just an order in it that says... you know, at a council meeting: "Now 
consider this language." 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  16:08   
So I think there are two things that would happen to get to where I think you're trying to go Vice Mayor 
Devereux. One is you refer the petition back to the city council with a negative recommendation or 
recommendation to withdraw. And then, Two, you could include a policy order to have the council amend 
the ordinance to reflect the language in the Solicitor's opinion.  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  16:37   
That sounds like a good plan. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  16:40   
Councillor Zondervan please? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  16:43   
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And if you would indulge, I would like to have a brief discussion with the fire 
chief about whether we need such an ordinance at all or not. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  17:04   
Welcome, Chief. 
 
Gerard E. Mahoney, Chief of the Fire Department  17:06   
Thank you. Good afternoon. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  17:11   
The question is do we need any kind of ordinance or does state law... I assume what you're saying does 
state law trump anything that we need. 

Packet Pg. 262

7.1

 
Gerard E. Mahoney, Chief of the Fire Department  17:24   
So, without having the actual text of the regulation in front of me my best recollection of the new fire 
prevention regulation that has been promulgated by the Commonwealth is that any individuals or 
corporations or businesses that wish to provide this type of mobile fueling service anywhere in the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts must first obtain a permit from the State Fire Marshal's Office and 
secondly, obtain a permit from the head of the local fire department. Which in this case by statute, I 
currently serve as the head of the local fire department for all kinds of issues dealing with state fire 
regulations. If the way it was explained to me at a meeting I attended, not so long ago, at the State Fire 
Marshal's Office was that if the local head of the fire department refuses to grant this permit in their 
particular community, the company applying for said permit will be unable to even if the State Fire 
Marshal has signed that permit. So for example, the ABC fueling company could get a permit from the 
fire marshal and apply to provide the service and say six communities in the Commonwealth. And if one 
fire chief or head of the fire department in one of those six community says no and the others say yes, 
they may provide the service and those communities but in the community Which the head of the fire 
department has said no, they may not provide the service. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  19:06   
Did you want to follow up? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  19:09   
Yes, thank you. And in addition to that, it's my understanding that they would have to pre-arrange the 
location that they would provide the service. So you would have to approve even if you said they're 
permitted to provide the service for each customer, they would have to obtain permission to provide the 
service. 
 
Gerard E. Mahoney, Chief of the Fire Department  19:33   
Through you, Mr. Chair, I don't believe so. But again, with with not having the text in front of me, I 
would want to research the text a little more closely to give you a more accurate answer, but my 
understanding is, the head of the fire department would be granting permission for that particular 
individual or business to conduct this operation anywhere within the boundaries of thier city or town or 
fire district. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  20:02   
Right. Then the City Solicitor's opinion gave some further restrictions. So it says, "mobile fueling 
operations and delivery vehicle parking shall be prohibited... prohibited in buildings and covered parking 
structures on public streets and in public ways. It also provides mobile fueling shall not take place within 
25 feet of buildings, property lines, combustible storage, and when mobile fueling cars within 25 feet of a 
storm drain, a storm recover approved by the fire department shall be used to protect the storm drain. The 
Fire Safety Code also provides the fire department can require a site specific safety and emergency 
response plan for locations where mobile fueling is authorized for purposes of ensuring that fueling 
operations are conducted in a safe manner that is acceptable to the fire department." So it seems like there 
is a lot of leeway there too regulate where in how it takes place. Even if we were to say that, in general, it 
could be allowed. 
 
Gerard E. Mahoney, Chief of the Fire Department  21:04   
Through you, Mr. Chair, I believe you are correct Councillor that one of the enforcement tools that the 
head of the fire department would have is that any specific... any site specific, you know, an office park 
has it has a parking garage or a large parking lot. We could require that facility or property owner to 
submit a safety and emergency response plan if we were to allow mobile fueling to take place on their 

Packet Pg. 263

7.1

property. And if they, either; A. were unable to provide a plan or they provided a plan that was deemed 
non satisfactory, we could deny the opportunity for fueling on that specific location. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  22:01   
Thank you and, through you Mr. Chair, are you aware of any companies that are trying to provide this 
service in Cambridge? 
 
Gerard E. Mahoney, Chief of the Fire Department  22:10   
Yes, through you Mr. Chair, there... I have received, by email, several different brochures, flyers, etc from 
different companies. This is something that is kind of taking off throughout the country. I know that there 
is some pending litigation out on the west coast. I believe the city of Seattle, Washington is currently 
engaged in some litigation with one of the services. Again, as the vice mayor stated, she brought this to 
my attention, I think a little over a year ago. I immediately brought it to the attention of the State Fire 
Marshal. A cease and desist order was issued to two companies that were doing this in the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We... they actually found out that one of the companies when they 
asked where the vehicle, the fueling vehicle was being stored. It was discovered it was being stored in the 
driveway between two three storey wood framed dwellings in a community outside of Boston, the fire 
chief in that community was pretty upset when he found out about it. And the vehicle was ordered to be 
removed from that location immediately. The marshal's office did tell me that what they did discover was 
that,  at that time, the fire prevention regulations did not adequately address this particular issue. Those 
regulations are periodically reviewed for a whole sundry of issues, changes in technology and so forth. 
They realized there was a gap, they identified the gap and they took steps to close the gap which I think 
they did a pretty good job with. And I mean, I'm sure as is the case with a lot of things there maybe some 
legal challenges posed, but I think they've done a pretty good job in crafting a regulation that provides a 
lot of authority to the local jurisdictions to say, hey, look at, you know, this thing may work in a more 
suburban community that, you know, doesn't have some of the issues that a place like Cambridge does. 
But when you're going to close... when you're in a very densely, built up, community such as Cambridge, 
this is something that is neither, in my opinion, practical, nor safe. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  24:39   
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  24:42   
Vice Mayor, did you want to follow up? 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  24:45   
Well, yeah, I mean, I appreciate the fire chief's explanation and Councillor Zondervan's question. I think 
his question was, do we need an ordinance? We're hearing that our current acting fire chief would not 
approve any of these applications. I guess the question is, to be safe, should we have something on the 
books so that... you know... future Fire Chiefs have the same instructions? Because we don't know... You 
know, I don't know... So I guess I would... I would support doing what the clerk recommended which is to 
formally withdraw the zoning amendment and then have a policy order from this committee to the next 
council saying, we encourage you to amend the municipal ordinance to just make sure that we can't have 
this in Cambridge.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  25:34   
I concur. Councillors, any other comments? So I see no other comments from staff or the council unless 
the fire chief wanted to add something. Or Arthur. No. So let's do it. I agree, and I... Why don't you 
propose exactly what you said, but... and we'll vote on that. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  26:09   

Packet Pg. 264

7.1

Well, I guess what I said is I would make a motion to withdraw the proposed zoning amendment. Oh, 
what someone... Would you like to open public comment before we do this? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  26:22   
Sure. Only for the press. John, welcome. 
 
Unknown Speaker  26:27   
Hi, Mr. Chair, John Hawkinson. I had two comments that seemed worth mentioning. One was the 
proposed ordinance as drafted, appears to say that if my car runs out of gas, I can walk to the nearest gas 
station, grab a jug and walk back to my car and because I'm not a commercial entity, that's fine, but I can't 
call AAA and ask them to bring me some gas. And I really wonder if that's intended, and how that 
comports with the current practice. And you might want to check with the fire chief on that. And 
secondly, as a matter of public policy, you guys are substituting your proposal to enact this ordinance that 
is consonant with the current state regulation seems to be substituting your judgment on safety issues for 
those of a future fire chief. And that seems a weird thing to do. I would suggest it unnecessarily 
complicates the municipal code. And if in the future, the fire chief figures out a safe way to do this, that 
makes sense. Why should he have to ask you guys to amend the ordinance again, it seems superfluous or 
unnecessary, and I would caution against it. Thank you.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  27:44   
Thank you. Any other public comments? Seeing none, I close public comment. I would agree with 
the vice mayor that we need to refer this back to the full council with a recommendation to 
withdraw based on the memo from the law department. So I move that. All those in favor say aye.  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  28:08   
Aye.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  28:09   
Aye. That's unanimous. those against…  
 

1.  Zoning  Amendment  Articles  2.00  and  4.32  regarding  opposition  to  permitting  on-demand  

mobile fueling services to operate in Cambridge. 

RESULT: 

REFERRED TO THE FULL CITY COUNCIL WITH A 
RECOMMENDATION THAT THE PETITION BE WITHDRAWN. 

 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Sorry, I spoke too quickly. And the other is to put forth the policy order. That states that during the 
ordinance meeting, it was learned that the proposed ordinance was not indeed a zoning ordinance and a 
recommendation from the law department with wording for a municipal code amendment or change was 
proposed and was recommended for further discussion. Please. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  28:48   
I mean, that sounds fine. And and to John's comment, when the council discusses this, they can certainly 
ask the opinions of the staff about whether there needs to be some carve out for a AAA like service for 
emergency refueling in small quantities. And I'm sure they could put in something that helps future Fire 
Chiefs have discretion. I mean, you know, cross that bridge when we come to it. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  29:20   
I totally agree. Yes, Councillor.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan  29:24   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I do agree. I agree with the vice mayor. I think there is a second reason that we're 
proposing this ordinance besides the safety hazard. And it's in the statement of purpose. The second 
sentence reads there is no compelling public interest in allowing such a service to operate in a city whose 
climate action goals are to decarbonize the transportation sector, by encouraging the use of sustainable 
mobility options, and electric vehicle technology. So we're not simply making a fire safety judgment, 
we're also saying that we don't believe there is a public interest in providing or allowing this type of 
service in our city. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  30:12   
And where were you reading that? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  30:14   
Sorry, this is from the Solicitor's proposed ordinance amendment in the statement of purpose. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  30:22   
I see. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  30:24   
So just to clarify that the reason we're doing this isn't purely for fire safety consideration. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  30:37   
So, voting on the policy order to present the municipal code language to the full Council for 
consideration. All those in favor say aye.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  30:57   
Aye.  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  30:57   
Aye.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  30:58   
Those against. So that is anonymous.  
 

 

Councillor  Zondervan  moved  to  send  a  policy  order  to  the  City  Council  that  the  Municipal 
ordinances of the City of Cambridge be amended to incorporate the proposed ordinance in the 
document  titled  ‘A  communication  was  received  from  City  Manager  Louis  A.  DePasquale 
transmitting a Legal Opinion, regarding the proposed zoning amendments to Articles 2.000 and 
4.32 of the Cambridge  Zoning Ordinance  regulating "Mobile Fueling"’ which was received by 
the committee.

Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Thank you. I believe that is the end of that meeting. Do I have to close the meeting to begin the next one? 
Okay, so I hereby close this hearing. Don't go away.

B.  Hearing on Fuel Pump Warning Labels 

Welcome to the next hearing.  I read earlier the call to order and I'll just repeat it. The ordinance 
committee... I will repeat the portion that's appropriate... the ordinance committee will conduct a public 
hearing on the following item, a petition to amend article 8.12.010 of the municipal code regarding fuel 
pump warning label amendment. Now, I think this was also Councillor Kelley, who was the lead? 
Councillor Kelley had a family issue today and couldn't join us. So we're going to ask the vice mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  32:12   
I think it was actually me, but it doesn't... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:13   
 Oh. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  32:14   
I really... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:15   
I stand corrected. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  32:16   
 It's okay.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:17   
I remember now it was the vice mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  32:20   
And some and I think Councillor Zondervan co-sponsored and maybe even you I don't know. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:24   
I did.  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  32:24   
There was a policy order a while back 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:26   
About five years ago. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  32:28   
Yeah. It seems like five years. 

Packet Pg. 267

7.1

 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  32:30   
Why don't you go ahead and just give an overview. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  32:33   
Okay. So the idea of climate change warming labels is something that has originated on the west coast 
and in Sweden, and I think someplace else in Europe, where, as part of a sort of broader awareness 
campaign to reinforce the connection between fossil fuel consumption and climate change. Municipalities 
have been requiring the use of little placards that are actually attached to gas pumps that give a general 
warning. So we all have pictures of one that was sent to us by a guy, a grad student in the San Francisco 
area who has been advocating for this. And the... A while back, the city solicitor gave us a memo that said 
she felt that we would be within our rights to require such language on fuel pumps, so long as it was non-
controversial. So, you know, sort of the wording here is and this is just a suggestion the US 
Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has determined that burning petroleum fuel contributes to 
climate change. There probably aren't too many people out there who haven't heard that, at some point in 
their life, I wouldn't call that controversial at this point. I believe in the policy order, we suggested that the 
Department of Public Health have the ultimate say over the language that would be used. So I think what 
we're talking about today is whether we can have this be a requirement and then leave it to staff to figure 
out what the placard should say, and how we would actually administer the program. We don't have a 
large number of gas stations in Cambridge. So we're not talking about hundreds of these things, and it 
would have to be done in conjunction with a broader, potentially social media campaign or something that 
would get people's attention. So, you know, I know that some people would say, it's not going to make 
any difference if you have gas burning car and you're at a service station, what choice do you have other 
than to put fuel in your car? Certainly true, but also true that we put warnings on all kinds of products that 
people use. And it's still worthwhile to remind people that products that they're using or consuming are 
dangerous to themselves and to others, and sometimes it does serve as a deterrent. And I think in the 
interest of the real imperative that we have to raise awareness about the impact that each of us have in our 
choices of how, how to get around, in this case, that it's, you know, it's a good thing to do so I would 
support moving it forward. Knowing unfortunately, that it won't be my responsibility to figure out how to 
implement it. Thank you.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  35:57   
You might be surprised. I do think the analogy with cigarettes is a good one on billboards and whatever. 
And it isn't just the smoker. It's the smokers family. The kids who see it and they go, what why are you 
doing this? So I do think there's an impact. Now I know Mr. Goldberg has a question, but does any... do 
any of the remaining staff have any thoughts on this? That they wish to express? Okay, we thank you for 
your silence. Mr. Goldberg. 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  36:40   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I just had a question. Where were the proposed language references the 
Department of Public Health. Am I correct in assuming that is referring to the local department of public 
health or is that an attempt to refer to the State Department of Public Health? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  37:00   
Madam Vice Mayor? 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  37:02   
I would assume it would be the local one. And I'm open if there's another city department that is the more 
appropriate... and it could be in conjunction with community development, since they are doing all of our 
climate change modeling. I mean, we're talking about probably a maximum of 20 words. So, you know, I 

Packet Pg. 268

7.1

don't want to create a whole committee to write a sentence. So it's not really up to... It's up to the city 
manager to decide which of his staff he would like to charge with the word smithing of such a warning. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  37:43   
Any other thoughts or questions? Mr. Goldberg? 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  37:51   
No, other than we would like to also review this language in some detail and then the law department... 
And I apologize that we have not actually done that prior to this meeting. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  38:04   
Yes. Well, I can understand why the wording is really critical in doing this. Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  38:17   
And thank you Mr. Chair.  Through you to Mr. Goldberg wouldn't it make more sense if we said, 
approved by the city manager and then they can... he or she can decide who the most appropriate 
departments are to approve it. 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  38:34   
You could do that then that is an option. 
 
Through you, Mr. Chair, the law department is... would probably also want to at least review whatever 
language was being proposed. So it may provide more flexibility not to just designate one department. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  39:03   
So you're agreeing with Councillor Zondervan, that through the city manager and his departments? Is that 
what you're suggesting? 
 
Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor  39:12   
 Yes. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  39:13   
Okay. Any other comment? We will have any other clarifying questions? Excuse me, we might have a 
public comment. Any other clarifying questions? No, no, I see none. Is there any public comment? Please 
state your name and address, sir. 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. John Hawkinson. I did want to note that it would be great if memos from the 
law department were available four business days prior to the meeting in which they were discussed. 
Thank you. 
 
 Yeah, we agree. 
 
Unknown Speaker  39:50   
So I would encourage you to encourage that. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  39:53   
Yes, we have. Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  39:56   
I'm recalling that when this was first proposed.  We had a suggestion from the Massachusetts Sierra Club 
energies committee on some language which I could offer for future consideration. It's a little more 

Packet Pg. 269

7.1

detailed than what this one from California was. And I can, I'll send the language to the clerk but briefly, 
it just says this fuel contains carbon which is contributing to the worsening climate, the warming planet 
and rising seas, the City of Cambridge Climate Action Plan states, we must reduce carbon emissions from 
cars and other modes of transportation. So, you know, maybe that's too long to fit on a small thing, but it 
conveys both the connection to the burning of fossil fuel and global warming and the fact that the City of 
Cambridge has a climate action plan that is explicitly committed to doing what we can to reduce carbon 
emissions. So it does make that connection so I will send that sentence to the clerk and he can include that 
with the report for future consideration. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  41:21   
Yes, please still we were just clarifying that it will be in the minutes as a recommendation by you. Any 
other thoughts? Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  41:34   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So I'll make a motion to amend the language that it says see manager 
instead of Department of Public Health. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  41:49   
So all those in favor of the amendment. I thank you. I heard one aye, I was gonna say aye saw I'll 
assume it's unanimous. Yes.  
 

1.  Councillor  Zondervan  moved  to  amend  the  proposed  ordinance  by  deleting  the  words 
“Department  of  Public  Health”  in  the  last  paragraph  and  replacing  it  with  the  words  “City 
Manager”. 

RESULT: 

ADOPTED 

 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Thank you. Nobody against any other thoughts. So, voting now. So let's see here this. So this... we're 
proposing to send this to the full council or are we holding it in committee? Hold it in committee. I mean, 
full Council, all those in favor of... with a positive recommendation sending this to the full Council, 
please say aye.  
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux  42:32   
Aye.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  42:33   
Those against. So that's unanimous. Thank you all for coming. This is the new kind of ordinance 
speedway that we're going to have from now on. We're going to get two meeting... two discussions done 
in 45 minutes. Thank you very much. I appreciate you all coming and we'll see you in the new year. 
Meeting is adjourned. There is another meeting at five. You're welcome to come back.

VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX 
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN 
COUNCILLOR CARLONE 
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge is working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of its 
response to the climate crisis; and 
 
An estimated 43% of emissions in Massachusetts come from transportation, and 
driving personal gasoline-powered vehicles causes a large portion of those emissions; 
and 
 
The City of Cambridge’s Climate Action Plan states that in order to reach our 
sustainability goals, the City must actively pursue innovative methods to reduce 
vehicular emissions; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Many gasoline nozzles come equipped with a “nozzle talker” that could easily hold a 

small label; and 
 
Requiring these labels at the gas pump will provide consumers with information about 
the impact of fossil fuel consumption directly at the point of purchase, which may 
encourage them to reduce their consumption and use alternative forms of transportation 
when appropriate; and 
 
The fight to reverse climate change requires that everyone take action to change their 
behavior, and the City must underscore the fact that each individual’s behavior can 
make an impact on the environment and on public health; and 
 
In City Manager’s Agenda #13 of October 17, 2016, the City Solicitor opined that such 
an ordinance would violate neither the First Amendment nor the Commerce Clause, as 
long as it contains “purely factual and uncontroversial” information; now therefore be 
it 
 
That the proposed amendment to article 8.12.010 of the Municipal Code (as attached) 
be referred to the Ordinance Committee for hearing and report before the end of 2019; 
and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor and the 
appropriate staff to review the language of this draft amendment and to report back to 
the City Council in advance of the Ordinance Committee hearing.

Re: 

Ordaining Face Recognition Technology Ban 
 

Councillors: 

As we begin the work of this new term, I do not want us to lose sight of the effort made by the 

 
previous City Council 2018-19 to prepare an amendment to the Surveillance Ordinance by banning 
municipal use of facial recognition technology. That amendment was already discussed and moved 
favorably through the committee and was passed to a second reading on December 9, 2019. Having lain 
on the table the requisite amount of time, it now comes before this Council to be ordained, an action this 
Council can take at our first meeting of the year on January 13, 2020. 

I hope this Council will take final action on the facial recognition technology ban and secure for 

 
our residents the protections to our civil rights and liberties that lay at the heart of this legislation. As a 
reminder, several municipalities across the country—and in neighboring Somerville—have passed similar 
protections, and my Office has worked closely with the ACLU to bring forward not only this amendment 
but the underlying Surveillance Ordinance. To reiterate testimony that my Office delivered on my behalf 
at a committee hearing on December 3, 2019: 

the unregulated and intrusive use of facial recognition technology is so onerous to the 
idea of a free republic, so intrusive to our daily lives and expectations of due process, 
and has been shown by other governments to be so menacing and intimidating to our 
cherished notion of free assembly, free speech, and freedom of thought that the 
Council is right to erect the further barrier that we seek with the amendment before 
you today. Before some future Council wishes to authorize this most intrusive of 
surveillance technologies, they will have to [hold numerous Committee hearings], 
hear the public, and consider changes through a lengthy amendment process. 

I ask for this Council’s support in ordaining the amendments to the Surveillance Ordinance by 

 
 
banning the municipal use of facial recognition technology in Cambridge.  
 

Best Regards,

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR 

Sumbul Siddiqui 
Mayor 

 
To: 

 

Cambridge City Council 

From:   

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor 

Date: 

 

January 9, 2020 

To the Honorable, the City Council: 

Subject: 

Communicating Information from January 7, 2020 School Committee Regular Meeting  

The School Committee held its first Regular Meeting of the new year last Tuesday, January 6, 2020. The 
meeting focused on the upcoming FY2021 Budget Development Process and included a presentation 
given by Claire Spinner, Chief Financial Officer for Cambridge Public Schools (“FY2021 Budget 
Development: Process and Key Dates;” attached here). The schools’ annual budget development process 
is currently entering its development stage (Phase 2), concluding with the presentation of Superintendent 
Salim’s proposed budget to the School Committee. After the School Committee has reviewed, adjusted, 
and voted to adopt its final FY21 Budget (Phase 3), it will be forwarded to the City Council for its 
adoption through a formal hearing.  

Given the issues and concerns brought forth by the City Council at last year’s FY2020 School Budget 
adoption hearings, it is imperative that the Council be aware of the various meetings related to the School 
Budget Process so that Council members may stay up-to-date and informed on the process, and any issues 
that arise may be communicated prior to the time of the Council’s adoption proceedings. A list of key 
dates associated with the Schools’ Annual Budgeting Process, such as Community Meetings and Budget 
Retreats, may be found on page 13 of the attached presentation. 

In preparation for the Joint Roundtable meeting of the School Committee and the City Council on Tuesday, 
February 11, I encourage my colleagues to attend and observe the School Committee’s upcoming Budget 
Retreat on January 14 at 6:00 pm in the Dr. Henrietta Attles Meeting Room at the Cambridge Rindge and 
Latin School, at which a discussion of the FY2021 Initial  Budget and Enrollment Projections is to take 
place. This meeting will not be televised. No votes will be taken and there will be no public comment.  

Additionally,  I  propose  that  the  City  Council’s  Finance  Committee  Chair(s)  and  School  Committee’s 
Budget Co-Chairs keep in close contact prior to Phase 3, in order to facilitate as many conversations as 
possible and share any concerns sooner in the process.    

My office will be hiring an Educational Liaison who will support the budget process and assist with keeping 
the Council updated and informed. Please contact me with any questions or concerns. 

Respectfully,
