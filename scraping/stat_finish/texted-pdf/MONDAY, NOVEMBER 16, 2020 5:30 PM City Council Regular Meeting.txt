To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am herby requesting an appropriation of $850,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Public Works Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for a 30 -Year Post Closure 
Evaluation and Report of Danehy Park.  
 
Danehy Park was opened in 1990 and is a 50-acre open space that provides sports fields, walking 
paths, a dog park, and other open space amenities for the community.  Prior to its use as a city 
park, the area was predominately clay, and between 1847-1952, the clay was extracted to 
manufacture bricks by the New England Brick Company.  The result was a deep clay pit that the 
City used as its landfill between 1952 and 1971.  With the capping of the landfill and the creation 
of the Park in 1990, the city reclaimed what was a waste site and turned it into a significant 
community resource.     
 
Permitting of the site is managed through the MassDEP, Division of Solid Waste in order to 
ensure that the site is managed in a safe manner and that landfill gases are properly managed and 
allowed to safely vent.  The City contracts with CDM Smith to conduct quarterly monitoring, 
inspect the methane trench (which is the stone-filled trench around the perimeter of the park) 
quarterly, and develop an annual environmental monitoring report that is submitted to MassDEP. 
 
When the landfill was closed, MassDEP Solid Waste Management Regulations required the 
owner of a closed landfill to maintain, care for, and monitor the site during the post-closure 
period of a minimum of 30 years.   Funds will be used to develop a 30-year Post Closure Report 
which will require, additional testing; an assessment as to the integrity of the existing cap, 
stormwater features, and landfill gas controls; an update to the environmental monitoring and 
maintenance plan; as well as an evaluation of the condition and functionality of the existing vent 
trench, and analysis of the cumulative effect of siltation on the vent trench system.

Re:  Report on contacting appropriate representatives regarding party buses.  

Ref.:  Awaiting Report #20-57, dated October 26, 2020  
 
 
The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report #20-57, dated October 26, 2020, whereby 
the City Manager was requested to report back on raising the issue of rented luxury buses rented out by 
groups of people with the appropriate representatives of the Cambridge Crossing buildings and the 
Governor’s Office to ensure that these businesses are not in violation of any current statewide COVID-
19 protocols. 
 
Cambridge Police Officers initially responded to a Leighton Street noise complaint on Friday, October 
23 regarding a group of people and a rental luxury bus. The following weekend, Officers were assigned 
to the area and responded to and stopped parked buses Friday, October 30 in the area of Leighton Street 
and Saturday, October 31 in the area of Morgan Avenue. As a result of these responses, Officers were 
able to identify the residents responsible for renting the buses and made the drivers and owner of the 
limousine company aware that their passengers were not following proper social distance guidelines. 
   
While there were no complaints or observed violations the weekend of November 6-8, Officers will 
remain assigned to the areas of concern for proactive visibility to deter any ongoing activity. Anyone 
responsible for potential future violations, which now include the Governor’s statewide stay-at-home 
advisory between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and updated limits on gatherings, are subject to fines.  
 
I have been in contact with the property managers at DivcoWest to set a plan of action to address both 
the residents and bus companies, and can assure you that the police department will continue to work  
on a variety of fronts to mitigate these concerns. 
 
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions, information needed 
or concerns regarding this matter, please let me know. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr. 
Police Commissioner

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing to ask for your approval to allow members of adjudicatory boards and commissions 
such as the Planning Board, the Board of Zoning Appeal, the Historical Commission, the 
Conservation Commission and the License Commission, among other adjudicatory bodies, to 
vote on a matter before the adjudicatory body of which they are a member if the board member 
has missed one of the sessions regarding the matter at issue. 
 
Chapter 39, Section 23D of the Massachusetts General Laws, known as the “Mullin Rule” (see 
attached statutory language), provides that members of municipal boards or commissions who 
are absent from no more than one session of an adjudicatory hearing may still act on the matter at 
a future session, provided that the municipality accepts this section of the law and that the absent 
member reviews a transcript or video or audio recording of the hearing and certifies that they 
have done so. This statute is known as the Mullin Rule because it overturns in part a court case 
which had provided that only members present at all sessions of an adjudicatory hearing on a 
particular matter are eligible to vote on that matter.  Mullin v. Planning Board of Brewster, 17 
Mass.App.Ct. 139 (1983). 
 
On a number of past occasions, hearing sessions have needed to be postponed on short notice 
due to a member’s unanticipated absence for illness or other reasons, causing inconvenience to 
members of the public and applicants. Acceptance of the Mullin Rule for adjudicatory boards 
and commissions in Cambridge would help to forestall some of these issues in the future.  
Therefore, I am hereby requesting that the City Council accept the provisions of G.L. c.39, 
§23D. 
 
I look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have.

Awaiting Report 20-45 regarding implementation of traffic calming measures on 
Walden Street. 

Date:   November 10, 2020 

With respect to the above-mentioned policy order, we report the following.  
A roadway and sidewalk reconstruction project on Walden Street was completed in 
2008.  At that time, traffic calming was a priority for the residents participating in 
the community process. As a result of their input, the following traffic calming tools 
were included in the project: Walden Street roadway width was narrowed by the 
bend between Hubbard Avenue/Mt. Pleasant Street and Vincent Street, a raised 
intersection was built on Walden Street at Raymond Street and a curb extension 
was built at Richdale Avenue. Installation of these tools resulted in some speed 
reductions of vehicles and improved pedestrian safety at crossing locations.   
  
Larger traffic calming infrastructure changes to streets are completed in 
conjunction with other roadwork such as paving and sidewalk reconstruction. At 
this time, Walden Street is not included in the City’s Five-Year Sidewalk and Street 
and Reconstruction Plan. Since no roadway construction is programmed for Walden 
Street at present, stand-alone speed management tools, not requiring 
construction, are being studied. Staff from CDD, TP+T, and the Department of 
Public Works have reviewed the safety issues and are considering a variety of tools 
and strategies. 
•  Walden Street is included in the new 20 mph Speed Limit Safety Zones Program 
and new speed limit signs are anticipated to be installed by the end of the year. 

•  A speed feedback sign will also be considered to make drivers aware of their 

speed. 

•  The raised intersection at Raymond Street is being reviewed for condition and 
effectiveness to ensure it provides the speed reduction and pedestrian safety 
benefits as designed.    

•  City staff will also discuss and review additional markings and/or signage 

needed to improve pedestrian safety at marked crossing locations and reinforce 
messaging to drivers to obey the speed limit.   

 
Once we have completed evaluating these additional speed control and safety 
improvements, we expect to install any additional changes starting in the spring of

 Awaiting Report # 20-10 dated February 10, 2020 regarding renaming 
the Agassiz neighborhood 

With regard to the above-mentioned policy order, we report the following.  
At their January 14, 2020 meeting, the Agassiz Neighborhood Council discussed a 
neighborhood name change proposal that would remove scientist Louis Agassiz’s 
name and possibly rename the neighborhood after Maria L. Baldwin.  
 
Those present voted to change the neighborhood name and seek support from the 
City Council in creating a process that appropriately engages the larger community. A 
letter was sent to the City Council that included the following affirmation of the 
Agassiz Neighborhood Council vote: 

"There is a strong consensus in the neighborhood council in support of a name 
change, to be discussed in forums over the coming months with an opportunity 
to educate neighbors about the relevant issues, with the objective to come up 
with a recommended name from the neighborhood.”

The Neighborhood Council’s meetings were on hiatus for several months due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and re-started in August in virtual format. Community 
Development Department staff have been in conversation with representatives of the 
Agassiz Neighborhood Council and neighborhood advocates starting late summer to 
provide support in framing and executing a community process related to the 
renaming of the neighborhood.  
 
At their upcoming November and December meetings, the neighborhood group is 
slated to discuss the process to appropriately involve neighborhood residents in this 
conversation. The process is likely to include some educational information, resident 
statements, outreach via the neighborhood’s email newsletter, flyers, and a 
neighborhood survey.  The process is working toward the goal of reaching a decision 
about the future name of the neighborhood this winter and forwarding a 
recommendation to the City Council thereafter.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $310,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Community Development Department Extraordinary Expenditures account.  Funds will be 
used for consultant services to conduct a study that will evaluate resident experiences in 
affordable housing in Cambridge.   
 
The purpose of the study is to identify and assess issues faced by residents living in inclusionary 
affordable housing units, and to compare their experience to residents living in market-rate units 
in the same buildings, and to that of residents living in non-inclusionary affordable housing.  The 
analysis will focus on identifying any biases which may exist towards tenants and homeowners 
living in affordable housing from landlords, property managers, owners, neighbors, or tenant or 
homeowner associations; how prevalent such experiences are; and whether residents in market 
rate units in the same buildings and non-inclusionary affordable units in other buildings have 
similar experiences.    
 
The process will include a survey of tenants and homeowners living in affordable and market-
rate units in buildings with inclusionary housing units, as well as other affordable buildings. 
There will also be focus groups conducted and data walk discussions to solicit input from and 
review findings with residents and stakeholders.  A final report is anticipated to include 
recommendations on ways to improve experiences in inclusionary housing.   
 
The study process is anticipated to begin within the next several weeks and be completed late 
next year.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
On June 8, 2020, I updated you on the City’s efforts to respond to the restaurant community’s 
need to expand outdoor dining services and I requested and received the City Council’s 
authorization to grant street obstruction approvals, which are required for restaurants to operate 
outdoor dining on the sidewalk or street, from that date until November 30, 2020.  I am now 
requesting that the City Council extend its prior authorization for me or my designee to grant 
such approvals, along with any other necessary approvals for temporary street obstructions, from 
this date until sixty (60) days past the end of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State of 
Emergency. 
 
On June 1, 2020, Governor Baker issued an Order Clarifying the Progression of the 
Commonwealth’s Phased Workplace Re-Opening Plan and Authorizing Certain Re-Opening 
Preparations at Phase II Workplaces (the “Order”).  The Order temporarily waives some of the 
time-consuming procedural requirements for restaurants that are licensed to sell alcoholic 
beverages for on-premises consumption that are applying to operate outdoor dining services and 
waives the requirement that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission approve such requests.  
The Order also waives zoning requirements that may prohibit outdoor dining services.  Any 
approval for outdoor dining services issued pursuant to the Order was in effect only until 
November 30, 2020.  However, on September 10, 2020, Governor Baker issued an Order 
Making Certain Phase III Adjustments, which included extending any approval for restaurants 
that sell alcoholic beverages to operate outdoor dining services until sixty (60) days past the end 
of the state of emergency or such earlier date that a city or town establishes. 
 
Pursuant to Governor Baker’s extension of the outdoor dining approvals, the City has likewise 
extended approvals for outdoor dining until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of 
emergency.  The Board of License Commissioners voted to automatically extend all currently 
issued Temporary Extensions of Licensed Premises, and for outdoor dining on City streets and 
sidewalks, the City has extended all Sidewalk Business Use Permits for outdoor dining and is

amending the term of its License Agreement for restaurants that serve alcoholic beverages with 
outdoor dining until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency. 
 
To allow the City to continue to respond to the restaurant community’s need for outdoor dining 
in an expeditious manner, I am hereby requesting that the City Council extend its prior 
authorization for me or my designee to grant street obstruction approvals, along with any other 
necessary approvals for temporary obstructions, from November 30, 2020 until sixty (60) days 
past the end of the state of emergency. 
 
I look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have.

That from November 30, 2020 to sixty (60) days past the end of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts State of Emergency, due to the significant 
adverse impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has had upon local businesses 
including restaurants and consistent with Governor Baker’s June 1, 2020 Order 
Clarifying the Progression of the Commonwealth’s Phased Workplace Re-
Opening Plan and Authorizing Certain Re-Opening Preparations at Phase II 
Workplaces and September 10, 2020 Order Making Certain Phase III 
Adjustments, which temporarily waive some of the time-consuming procedural 
requirements for restaurants that are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-
premises consumption that are applying to operate outdoor dining services, the 
requirement that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission approve such 
requests, and zoning requirements that may prohibit outdoor dining services, all 
applications for temporary street obstructions will hereby be referred to the City 
Manager, instead of to the City Council, with authorization to act.

[…] 

(c)   Net Zero Narrative: A written description of how the Green Building Project is being designed in 
response  to  the  City's  Net  Zero  Action  Plan,  which  seeks  to  neutralize  greenhouse  gas 
emissions  resulting  from  buildings  by  reducing  their  energy  use  intensity  and  promoting 
renewable sources of energy. This information is provided for advisory review by CDD staff, and 
CDD may provide a questionnaire template to the developer for completing this narrative. At a 
minimum, this narrative shall include the following information:  

(1)    anticipated  building  envelope  performance,  including  roof,  foundation,  walls  and  window 

assemblies, and window-to-wall ratio;  

(2)    anticipated  energy  loads,  baseline  energy  simulation  tool  assumptions,  and  proposed 
energy  targets,  expressed  in  terms  of  site  energy  use  intensity  ("EUI"),  source  EUI,  and 
total greenhouse gas emissions;  

(3)    a  description  of  ways  in  which  building  energy  performance  has  been  integrated  into 
aspects  of  the  Green  Building  Project's  planning,  design,  and  engineering,  including 
building use(s), orientation, massing, envelope systems, building mechanical systems, on-
site and off-site renewable energy systems, and district- wide energy systems;  

(4)    a  description  of  the  technical  framework  by  which  the  Green  Building  Project  can  be 
transitioned to net zero emissions in the future (acknowledging that such a transition might 
not  be  economically  feasible  at  first),  including  future  net  zero  emissions  options  for 
building envelope, HVAC systems, domestic hot water, interior lighting, and on- and off-site 
renewable energy sources; 

(5)   a description of programs provided by local utility companies, government agencies, and 
other organizations that  provide  technical assistance, rebates, grants,  and incentives that 
can  assist  in  achieving  higher  levels  of  building  performance,  summarizing  which  entities 
have been contacted and which programs could be utilized in the Green Building Project; 
and 

(6) 

  an assessment of the technical and financial feasibility to meet the projected HVAC  and 
domestic  hot  water  demands  of  the  building  (as  set  forth  in  Paragraph  (2)  above)  using 
energy  systems  that  do  not  consume  carbon-based  fuels  on-site  (to  include  solar 
photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source heat pumps, district 
energy, geothermal systems, and/or similar systems) compared to code-compliant energy 
systems  that  consume  carbon-based  fuels  on-site  (including,  where  applicable,  the 
construction  or  expansion  of  energy  plants  controlled  by  the  developer  that  may  be 
necessary  to  produce  energy  for  that  specific  building),  which  shall  include  the  cost  of 
installation,  maintenance  and  upkeep  of  the  energy  system  and  its  components 
(incorporating programs and incentives as set forth in Paragraph (5) above).

COUNCILLOR CARLONE 
 
WHEREAS: 

City of Cambridge 

O-1 
FIRST IN COUNCIL 
June 22, 2020 

 

 

The City of Cambridge publicly acknowledges we are facing a climate change crisis 
due to increasing dangers of fossil fuels impacting public health and quality of life; and 
 
The intent of Article 22.000 of Cambridge’s Zoning Code is “to promote 
environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient design and development practices in 
new construction and renovation of buildings in the city”; and 
 
The city has set goals for different building types to meet the highest standards for 
environmentally sustainable design in the coming years; and 
 
Costs for different forms of clean energy are equal to or less than fossil fuels; and 
 
Cambridge set a building standard for utilizing clean energy in their non-zero buildings 
to minimize adverse environmental impacts and as examples for private industry and 
all public facilities design to replicate; and 
 
It is of utmost importance that new and renovated projects seriously explore the 
environmental and likely cost advantages of using alternative and renewable energy 
resources during the design development of their projects; now therefore 
 
Under 22.20 Green Building Requirements, the following will be added as Section 
22.25.1 (c) (6): 

an assessment of the technical and financial feasibility to meet the projected HVAC 
and domestic hot water demands of the building (as set forth in Paragraph (2) above) 
using energy systems that do not consume carbon-based fuels on-site (to include solar 
photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source heat pumps, 
district energy, geothermal systems, and/or similar systems) compared to code-
compliant energy systems that consume carbon-based fuels on-site (including, where 
applicable, the construction or expansion of energy plants controlled by the developer 
that may be necessary to produce energy for that specific building), which shall include 
the cost of installation, maintenance and upkeep of the energy system and its 
components (incorporating programs and incentives as set forth in Paragraph (5) 
above). 

Delete the last “and” in section 22.25.1 (c) (4). 

Insert “and” at the end of the paragraph in section 22.25.1 (c) (5).

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS  
  

Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives in General Court 

assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:  

 
SECTION 1.  
  

Beginning in the year 2019, notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, 

the City of Cambridge may offer early voting for municipal elections. 

The City of Cambridge may elect to allow any qualified voter, as defined in section 1 of 

chapter 51 of the General Laws, to cast a ballot for any biennial municipal election during the 

early voting period.  

The City of Cambridge’s Election Commission may promulgate regulations to implement 

this act not inconsistent with section 25B of chapter 54 of the General Laws and with other 

election laws applicable in the City of Cambridge, including those governing proportional

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it

Communication for Council Meeting of November 16, 2020

Please transmit this email to the City Council for its meeting of November 16, 2020. Thank you.

  Cambridge City Council
  John Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street, Cambridge, 

To:
From:
Subject: Tree Protection Ordinance

Please consider the following statement that I prepared as a public comment for the Nov. 10 hearing of the 
Health and Environment Committee on the Tree Protection Ordinance. (I was unable to sign up for comment 
via Zoom after the hearing had started.)

Comment on Proposed Revision of the Tree Protection Ordinance 
Prepared for the November 10, 2020 Hearing of the City Council Committee on Health and 
Environment

Extension of Cambridge?s Tree Protection Ordinance is a necessary step to stem the losses of Cambridge?s 
tree canopy. The Urban Forest Master Plan reports document the need for this beyond a reasonable doubt 
and suggest revisions to improve the interim ordinance. 

The Council should consider these proposals and will hopefully enact some as part of a more permanent 
ordinance. But the Council and the city should have no expectation that the ordinance can be a silver bullet. 
As the Urban Forest Master Plan report states, there needs to be a shared response in order to stem the 
losses, maintain, and grow the tree canopy. 

Curtailing the cutting of viable trees has to be part of a much broader strategy. An effective response will have 
to engage all property owners as well as residents and businesses and must involve caring for not only the 
trees we can see but the soils and water that support them. 

A Tree Protection Ordinance is analogous to mandatory quarantining as part of the strategy to fight the Covid-
19 pandemic. It is essential but it needs to be accompanied by universal practices that everyone can 
understand and rapidly adopt. These practices need to be clearly stated and effectively communicated to 
ensure wide awareness and general compliance, and it is up to the City to do this.

In the last nine months the City has shown that it can effectively communicate new public health practices. 
With good leadership, I believe it can do the same to promote our common environmental health. 

The City administration and its consultants have documented the need and what needs to be done. It is up to 
the City Council to lead the way on communication and engagement on the new practices and ecological 
culture we urgently need.

Mallon, Alanna; Sal Zinno; Clerk; City Council
Re: Public Comment Form Submission Confirmation

Please accept these comments in support of BioMed's ordinance hearing tonight. Been waiting on 
the call. For the record, I believe I signed up - see below- and wanted to verbally supportive 
tonight on the call with my colleagues in arts, business, and citizenry. This will have to do the 
job!

I fully support the project, and agree with the comments on the need and beauty of design.

As important is the process by which plans have been made and continue to be made with the 
community, not in name of the community.

This is an act of extended Equity Diversity and Inclusion - seeing artists as
"othered" and the amount of access and agency allowed into the development process speaks to 
Sal and his team's authentic dialogue to create a project in service to what already exists here. 
This allows the ecology of the existing arts to be added to with value and not cancel the work we 
at The Dance Complex- and all the hundreds of micro business owners we represent (2/3rds to 
3/4's of whom are BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and persons with disabilities).

Our dialogue continues with BioMed to this day- it is a relationship not a transaction. This bodes 
well for a healthy and vital dynamic future that allows arts to grow in value in Cambridge.

Thanks-

Peter DiMuro

POR 2020 #267 for City Council Public Comment

I'm writing in support of POR 2020 #267.

I'm a frequent user of Riverbend Park when Memorial Drive is closed. On Saturday, with warm weather and people out 
celebrating election results, Riverbend Park had many people -- far more than would be using the road in vehicles -- but 
everyone was able to maintain a healthy distance.

Closing Memorial Drive to cars makes more room for walking on the sidewalks, keeps green space for people to sit, and 
makes biking easier.

Thanks for opening this on Saturdays this year and extending the opening through November. Please pursue any and all 
options for expanding this program (as well as opening the Fresh Pond golf course to non-golf use!) as a way to help our 
community get through COVID-19.

Perez, Lori

Written Public Comment!

Dear City Manager, I'm submitting a Written Public Comment to be read and added to today's city council 
meeting and record. I won't be able to attend today's council meeting to orally comment, so I'm sending in a 
Written Comment,it should serve the same function and purpose as an oral public comment submission.

Peace Be Unto To You,
Hello everybody, I'm Hasson Rashid, I reside at 820 Massachusetts Avenue,my Written Public Comment is on 
Policy Order and Resolution List, Item # 2. Update on City-Owned Vacant Properties Inventory Vice Mayor 
Mallon, Mayor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Nolan POR 2020 #261.

Dear City Council members, remember "Charrette 2015 on Homelessness Week in Cambridge,MA (9/15-16, 
and 18)" held at the the Cambridge YWCA and the Hotel Sheraton? One of the discussion themes was 
"Increase Housing Supply for those experiencing Homelessness." The council will hopefully address an item 
that calls for an inventory of vacant property and relating issues. I'm on official city records addressing the 
council to use vacant city own properties to address and house homeless people. I think that the transfer of 
these properties should be transferred and turned, over to community collaboration groups such as the 
Alliance of Cambridge Tenants (ACT) and the Cambridge Continuum of Care (CoC),etc., for fixing these 
unoccupied properties up and moving the homeless in. This will help towards reversing policies that contribute 
to the city's affordable housing crisis.

For to long has our local municipal policy makers (City Hall) been guilty of helping to hoard public lands. Now 
other suitable public land opportunities are being available for City Hall to help in closing the homeless 
housing gap from the ground up, by developing and constructing homeless housing. The City Hall has failed in 
the past in doing justice to the homeless segments of our community by cowardly not opening the way for 
construction and development, of homeless housing at other parcels of public properties. I’m almost certain 
that homeless housing will definitely be left out of the equations and considerations at today's city council 
meeting.

Housing that are affordable to people at a wide range of income levels are in short supply across Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. Significant inequities in access to housing still exist, creating disparate impact. The homeless 
and renters at the lowest income levels face the greatest challenges with housing cost. Now in Cambridge our 
home less service systems have become increasingly bottleneck by scarcity of decent housing at sustainable 
cost, and achieving our shared goal of ending homelessness remains out of reach.

City Council's conversations today on vacant public properties, housing affordability, and homelessness should 
begin to take center stage here in Cambridge. Partnerships to align thinking and discussion should be the 
mathematics and order of the day, in the local affordable homeless housing arena here in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts. Expanding housing access to people who are at risk of or are experiencing homelessness, 
should always be foremost in the mentality and mindset of local politicians and others linked to the affordable 
homeless poverty housing arena. Until this actually happens, the state of affordable housing in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts will remain abnormal.

Finally, I close with a reference for you all, especially City Policy Makers to read and reflect on the: 1. Bible’s 
PSALM 82: 3-5 (The Passion Translation (TPT) “Defend the defenseless, the fatherless and the forgotten, the 
disenfranchised and the destitute. Your duty is to deliver the poor and the powerless; liberate them from the 
grasp of the wicked). Thank You.

Closing the Restaurants

Listening to the meeting tonight I am shocked! To suddenly have this brought up in a city meeting with No notification is 
reprehensible.

No ability for any business to make a case etc. We don't know where these cases are coming from.. are they from group 
meetings, celebrations from the elections??

I am beyond very upset
My Business Paddys, which is the oldest family and owned bar in Cambridge 86 Years..Has not opened yet from the 
March Closing!
I have been a member of the community and have given back ten fold plus...I live and love Cambridge..but this basically 
makes me close my doors..and I will lose my business!

I was just about to open..we have taken out loans, maxed out our credit cards, and put my home, bills and credit in 
jeopardy. I did not receive any PPP loan nor the loan from the city! We have no funding!!

I would be able to rehire my employees, and try to sustain my Business, with this small opening in December.

I received the small grant offered by the city 10K, which only paid for a small amount of my creditors...and only for 2 to 3 
months..

Unless you supplement all my earnings, my Monthly bills, pay my loans...I will not survive.

I am a huge proponent and have been very active in the support for the schools.. We need to keep them open, but You 
need to supplement me!!! When I asked for help I was told well we only have so much to go around... That is NOT 
acceptable! For a 3rd generation woman owned business shame on you. You have NO other Business who is like us.

Perhaps that is what you want..a small 3rd generation woman owned 86 year old business, with Community spirit to fail. 
You will succeed! Hooray you got rid of us..another part of Cambridge History erased.

I would love to talk to any one if not all of you.
my Phone number is 617 4482273.

Thank you in advance..I look forward to my check and supplemental money !!

manager's communication and policy orders

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors,

I am writing about the City Manager Communication #7 requesting funds to support a study on the experiences of 
residents in inclusionary and other affordable housing in Cambridge. Although I applaud the intent, I am unsure about 
the communication as written. Fellow residents and I answered a similar city survey years ago when we lived in the 
Kennedy Biscuit Loft Building near Central Square. There were issues with the management treating the low-income 
tenants badly. Nothing came out of that survey. I wholeheartedly support asking low-income residents of their 
experiences but I hope you give support with conditions attached.

I think the consultant should be independent from the administration which is sometimes complicit in the conditions 
they supposedly seek to address. There should be questions not only about property managers and neighbors but also 
about the City’s Inclusionary Zoning Department and how they treat the residents who come to them with issues. And 
why, for instance, do they force residents to sign leases that seem to conflict with their rights? It may be out of the 
purview of this communication but I would also like to see Cambridge residents questioned about how they are treated 
by other facets of the “Poor Business” (to quote the late Roz Springer) such as fuel assistance, CEOC, and the multi-
service center. I am weary of seeing the administration carry out these studies that have no results. What would the city 
actually do if they found discrimination? In my experience, Cambridge is so entwined with developers and so scared of 
law suits, that they usually fail to take meaning-full action.

Any questionnaire should have in bold print in more than one place that it is confidential.

On other matters, I support policy #6 requesting a review of extensions of permits on properties that should now have 
20% below-market rents but are not held to the new standard. The property at 625 Concord Avenue has been a vacant 
bank building years after it was permitted for housing. This case exemplifies my above argument questioning the 
administration’s close ties to developers as opposed to residents.

I also support  PO, #2 which asks for an inventory city-owned property which is vacant. This order is long overdue and I 
appreciate its introduction.

I support extending the tree-cutting moratorium until the study of the tree canopy committee is completed. In addition, 
I support the order regarding the zero-emission bus lines in Cambridge.

Thank you for reading this lengthy email. Stay well.

Sincerely,
Kathy Watkins
90 Fawcett St #511
Cambridge, MA 02138

Hello,

I wanted to briefly comment on this coming week's agenda. I want to voice my support for CMA #263; 
affordable housing is incredibly important, as is very clear, and with a commitment to building 
affordable housing must also come a commitment to building housing that serves its residents well –
and eliminating all-too-common bias towards those in affordable units is a big part of this.

Next, I wanted to voice my support for POR #261. I find it appalling how long many of our vacant lots 
remain unused. Any active step towards cataloging, and pushing these spaces towards active use, is a 
positive step in my book. I understand the desire to do well with any given parcel or space, and to take 
the time to do that, but at some point, enough is enough. While there is a single unsheltered person in 
this city, we are not doing enough with our vacant spaces.

Third, I wanted to voice my strong, strong support for POR #262. I agree with every word in this policy 
order.

Finally, I want to close with saying that, generally, I believe that we must continue to recognize, in many 
ways, rent burdenship and homelessness are political choices that we collectively make and maintain, 
and we need to have the political will to not continue to treat these as anywhere near the status quo. I 
was dismayed listening this evening to a portion of the Human Services & Veteran Committee Meeting 
from earlier today, where voices were criticized simply for suggesting that we can and need to do more 
in advance of this coming winter. I do think it is so, so important to recognize the amazing work that the 
City and homeless services agencies have done during the pandemic – but I think with this we must also 
acknowledge that it is not enough, and there is so much more we need to do.   

Thanks so much,
Kavish

WHEREAS:  The City Council was deeply saddened at learning of the death of Dr. Leah Anne 

Zallman at the age of 40 on November 5, 2020; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah was born on Human Rights Day, December 10th, 1979, in Panama City, Panama; 

and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah was the beloved daughter of Marcia Bernbaum, and was preceded in death by her 

father Eric Zallman; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah was the loving wife of Nadav Tanners; and  
 
WHEREAS:  Leah attended Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C. from which she graduated 

 

and was named a Presidential Scholar; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah met her future husband, also a Presidential Scholar, on a bus going to the White 

House, and their romance began when they reconnected at Swarthmore College, which 
they both attended; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah and Nadav moved to Somerville, Massachusetts and were married in 2008, and 

welcomed Eli (2011) and Kai (2014). They had a full life in the Boston area, where 
they traveled to the Cape with family, New Hampshire and Maine with friends, and 
toured the sights of Boston with their kids. They cherished their family time together, 
even more so during the Covid-19 pandemic, during which time they created new 
traditions, including daily lunches together, evening neighborhood walks, and weekend 
hikes; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah was wholeheartedly devoted to her family and her ridiculously large and closely 

connected network of friends; she demonstrated levels of empathy and giving that most 
of us never thought possible before we knew her, and she made it look easy; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah graduated from Swarthmore in 2001 with a degree in Biology and a concentration 

in Public Policy, and graduated from NYU School of Medicine in 2007, receiving 
accolades and awards recognizing her commitment to humanitarian causes; and  
 

Packet Pg. 77

4.5

WHEREAS:  Leah devoted herself ceaselessly to her work, which included clinical care as well as 

research into social justice issues that she was passionate about, including immigration 
and social determinants of health; she was admired as a doctor, researcher, and leader 
by the entire institution where she worked. Her kindness and brilliant mind shone in 
every setting and interaction; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah completed her residency at Boston Medical Center and her General Internal 

Medicine Fellowship at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance, and 
also received her Masters in Public Health from Harvard University; following 
completion of her studies she joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School and stayed 
on at Cambridge Health Alliance; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah co-led Cambridge Health Alliance's programming about engaging clinicians to 

care for our diverse populations; she reached out to policymakers about measuring and 
improving access not just to health care but to food, housing, and other determinants of 
health for these populations; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah published research widely in leading journals, including a pioneering study that 
showed that immigrants contributed more to the healthcare system than they took out 
of it; she was on the brink of fulfilling her dream of founding a Center for Immigrant 
Health Research that was to be announced later this month; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah's passion and dedication to social justice was infused in her from infancy by her 
parents; she lived the ideals she was raised with fully. She once wrote, "(my) passion 
arises from a deep belief that all humans have a right to health care, and that as a 
physician researcher, I have a role to play in elevating the voices of the most 
vulnerable." She took on that task with zest. She cared for immigrants in her clinical 
practice in East Cambridge, using her Spanish skills as well as her compassion and 
talent for listening; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah effortlessly expressed her love to her family and friends, she drew energy from 

and delighted in these relationships, and the world will be a dimmer place without her; 
and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah’s passing will leave a void in the lives of all her surviving family; her precious 

children Eli and Kai and her husband Nadav; her sister Shana; her mother-in-law Dina, 
father-in-law, Paul, sister-in-law Timna and brother-in-law Avi; her loving her 
nephews Jonah Smith, Zeke Smith, and nieces Isa, Talia and Elizabeth; and many other 
loving relatives and friends; and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Leah will be sorely missed by all she touched and loved; now therefore be it 
 
RESOLVED:  That the City Council go on record extending its deepest sympathy for the family of 

 

Dr. Leah Anne Zallman at this time of such personal loss; and be it further 
 

 
RESOLVED:  That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of 

this resolution to the Zallman family on behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS: 

On March 26th, 2018, the City Council adopted a policy order asking the City 
Manager to work with relevant City Departments to conduct, compile, and publish an 
inventory of all City-owned vacant properties with the City’s plans for them, if any; 
and 
 
The City Council has not yet received a report back on that policy order, and there still 
is no complete inventory of the City’s vacant properties and plans for them; and 
 
Some City-owned properties lay vacant for many years without having planned future 
uses, when these properties could instead be developed into affordable housing, open 
green space, economic empowerment opportunities, or other uses that benefit our 
community; and 
 
As residents’ need for community resources only grows as the COVID-19 pandemic 
wears on, the City must address these vacant properties in a timely manner to ensure 
need gaps are filled in; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with relevant City 
Departments to prepare a report on any steps it has taken to work towards conducting, 
compiling, and publishing an inventory of all City-owned vacant properties with the 
City’s plans for them, if any; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter by the November 30th regular meeting.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

On November 15, 2020, the union contract for 700 Harvard University janitors was 
due to expire, jeopardizing the livelihoods of these 700 essential workers in the midst 
of a global pandemic; and 
 
These 700 workers, represented by SEIU 32BJ, have been working to keep Harvard 
University safe and clean throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, even as janitorial and 
security workers have been among those hardest hit by the Covid-19 pandemic; and 
 
During the ongoing contract extension discussions, the janitors and the 300 security 
workers who are also represented by 32BJ have been seeking the following assurances 
from Harvard University:  
 

• 

Job security that recognizes that, as Harvard looks ahead to the Spring 
semester, it is imperative that no workers (whether employed directly by the 
University or indirectly through a third party contractor) should be laid off, as 
such layoffs would jeopardize the safety and cleanliness of the campus and 
would place hundreds of families at great risk of slipping into poverty, 
homelessness, and food insecurity in the midst of a global pandemic;  

 

•  An economic improvement for 2021 that recognizes the contribution of 

Harvard’s janitors and security workers as essential workers, and that provides 
a one year agreement to allow time for a more stable environment to be 
realized; and  

 
It is imperative that Harvard University support all its workers, from the world-class 
professors that teach in its classrooms to the janitors that clean those same classrooms, 
as this community seeks to pull together in weathering the worst of this public health 
and intertwined economic crisis; and 
 
As one of the pillars of the Cambridge community, Harvard University helps set the 
tone for how all workers in this city can and should be treated, Harvard has the 
resources to ensure that all of its workers are treated with fairness and are paid family-
sustaining wages, and this has never been more critical than during the public health 
and related economic crisis presented by Covid-19; now therefore be it

RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

 
That the City Council formally goes on record in standing firmly in support of the 
Harvard University janitors and custodians represented by SEIU 32BJ who are seeking 
a contract extension, and that the City Council formally goes on record in urging that 
Harvard University commit to extending the pay policy contract for all 700 janitors to 
guarantee job security and economic improvements for these essential workers heading 
into the coming year; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward this resolution to Lawrence 
Bacow, President of Harvard University, and to representatives of SEIU 32BJ, on 
behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The City of Cambridge experienced record-breaking voter turnout during the State 
Primary and General Elections, with over 33,261 ballots cast in the State Primary 
Election and 35,000 ballots cast in the General Election, including over 11,000 in 
person ballots cast at early voting locations; and 
 
Cambridge is a diverse city with residents speaking many languages, including 
Spanish, Amharic, Bengali, Haitian Creole, Chinese, Portuguese, and American Sign 
Language; and 
 
Language can sometimes create a barrier to civic engagement, so Everett, 
Massachusetts and cities throughout New York and Pennsylvania provided interpreters 
at polling locations to assist voters who speak another language; and 
 
Polling site interpreters are only available to assist a voter with understanding the 
ballot and for no other reason; and  
 
It is critical to find ways to increase access to voting and ways for residents who speak 
another language to participate in our local, state and national government, and 
language access is one of those ways; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Law Department and Election Commission on 
providing interpreters for the above languages at future elections and report back on 
this matter to the City Council by January 25, 2021.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The City Council and the Department of Public Works are working on lasting 
amendments to the Tree Protection Ordinance based on the detailed findings of the 
Urban Master Plan Task Force; and 
 
The discussion has been advanced out of the Health & Environment Committee into 
the Ordinance Committee, but the next hearing cannot be scheduled until draft 
ordinance language is available, and ordination is unlikely before the current 
language’s expiration date of December 31, 2020; and 
 
Despite significant delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that there 
is no gap between the expiration of the current regulations and the commencing of the 
new ones; and 
 
Cambridge’s tree canopy has declined by nearly 20% over the course of the last 
decade, with the most severe impacts felt in the most vulnerable neighborhoods; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the following amendments to the Tree Protection Ordinance be adopted to extend 
the temporary prohibition on tree cutting permits until February 28, 2021.

8.66.055 - Procedure for Other Significant Tree Removals. 

 

5.5

For any significant tree removal not subject to Section 8.66.050, a permit will be 
required from the City Arborist. In all cases, the City Arborist shall keep a record of 
the type and size of tree removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the tree 
documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractor(s) involved, and the name 
and address of the property owner. No such permits will be issued until February 28, 
2021 December 31, 2020 or sooner by further amendment to this section, except for 
emergency circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects undertaken 
pursuant to State or Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, or where a 
tree poses significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or for dead or 
dangerous trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the removal of 
certain significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree canopy. Any 
tree removed in violation of this section, prior to February 28, 2021 December 31, 
2020, shall require a payment into the tree replacement fund as per Section 8.66.070 
according to a schedule as follows: Ten percent (10%) of the replacement value for 
property owners who qualify for the City of Cambridge residential real property tax 
exemption, no fee for property owners that receive established forms of financial 
assistance, and the full replacement cost in all other circumstances. The value to be 
paid into the tree replacement fund shall be equivalent to the cost of purchasing, 
planting, watering and maintaining said Replacement Trees for a period of not less 
than five years. 

ORDERED 

That the city manager communicate this extension to the residents and property owners 
of the City of Cambridge as done previously.

The City Council passed new inclusionary zoning regulations in 2017, increasing the 
number of inclusionary units in all developments to 20%; and 
 
The City established updated guidelines for construction in flood prone areas, based on 
the most recent scientific data; and 
 
The City seeks to ensure that current regulations apply to all projects, and any project 
not currently permitted should be treated the same as a new project for the purposes of 
inclusionary zoning and climate mitigation regulations; and 
 
A recent project, 605 Concord Avenue, which started in 2016, should now be subject 
to inclusionary zoning, requiring 10, not 7, affordable housing units, and required to 
follow updated flood maps in all constructions to ensure the building is built to last; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the Council go on record as stating that all projects seeking a permit extension 
should be reminded of the need to follow all regulations in place at the time of the 
request for an extension; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to review the granting of an 
extension for the 605 Concord Avenue project which appears counter to the City’s 
zoning code and confer with the relevant departments on how many projects that had a 
permit prior to these changes could request an extension; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager is requested to report back to the City Council in a timely

RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

Electrification of buses and public transit should be an environmental justice 
imperative because it both reduces diesel emissions in low-income communities of 
color and provides an opportunity for transit to be powered by cleaner energy; and 

 
At its Fiscal Control Management Board (FMCB) meeting on November 9, the MBTA 
declined to set a target year for 100% electrification of its bus fleet, as other cities such 
as Chicago, Minneapolis and New York have done; and 
 
Instead of planning to implement all-electric, battery powered buses in communities 
like Chelsea and Dorchester that have been historically under-invested in and have 
higher rates of air-pollution, the MBTA is planning to implement “enhanced electric 
hybrid” buses that would be exclusively powered by diesel engines; and 

 
Initial deliveries of all-electric, battery powered buses will go only towards replacing 
buses that are already zero-emissions and have been used effectively for many years, 
such as the 71 and 77 buses in Cambridge; and 
 
The FMCB has acknowledged there have been problems with their initial pilots of 
these battery powered vehicles but is still proposing to use them to replace existing 
zero-emissions buses that have functioned well in communities such as Cambridge; 
and 
 

networks to improve service for riders and reduce carbon emissions, the MBTA is 
proposing to reduce its network in Cambridge in favor of a battery-powered 
technology that has still has issues that could cause service disruptions for Cambridge 
residents; and 
 
The MBTA should instead purchase in-motion charging buses that take advantage of 
the existing infrastructure and increase the reliability; now therefore be it 

 
That the City Council go on record in opposition to the Fiscal Control Management 
Board plans to replace existing zero-emissions electric bus routes in Cambridge; and 
be it further 
 
That the City Council go on record requesting that the MBTA prioritize environmental 
justice communities such as Chelsea and Dorchester for electrification efforts that 
would improve service and reduce emissions; and be it further

ORDERED: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced opportunities for residents to get fresh air and 
spend time outdoors while safely socially distancing; and 
 
This can be even more challenging for the many Cambridge residents, including lower-
income residents, who do not have access to yards or private outdoor space; and 
 
Spending time outdoors has been proven to improve mental and physical health and 
has been deemed a lower-risk activity during the pandemic; and 

 
The Cambridge City Council passed a policy order in April that led to Riverbend Park 
being opened on Memorial Drive on both Saturdays and Sundays, which has provided 
an opportunity for residents to spend time outside while safely social distancing; and 
 
Riverbend Park, which is owned and operated by Massachusetts Department of 
Conservation and Recreation (DCR) is currently scheduled to be open on Memorial 
Drive through Sunday, November 29, 2020; and 
 
Keeping Riverbend Park open beyond November 29 would provide a much-needed 
opportunity for residents to spend safe, socially distant time outdoors as the colder 
weather begins to make some other activities more challenging; now therefore be it 

 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to work with the Massachusetts 
Department of Conservation and Recreation to explore the feasibility of keeping 
Riverbend Park open beyond November 29; and be it further 
 
That the city confer with DCR and advocate for extending Riverbend Park the length 
of Memorial Drive; and further be it 
 
That the City or DCR collect data on residents’ usage of Riverbend Park to better 
inform future decisions regarding its status; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council by November 23, 2020.

WHEREAS: 

Citywide, Cambridge businesses, the Cambridge Public Health Department and 
Cambridge Public Schools have implemented several protective measures and 
strategies to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 throughout the community; and 
 
Though these protective measures have kept Cambridge COVID-19 positivity rates 
lower than neighboring cities, Cambridge’s positive cases do continue to increase 
daily; and 
 
The Cambridge Public Health Department reported 44 new cases in Cambridge today, 
the highest number of new cases since the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
Epidemiologists recommend closing bars, casinos and gyms, and other non-essential 
business activities to stop the spread of COVID-19 as a way to keep schools open; and 
 
Research suggests a strong correlation between indoor activities and the rise of 
COVID-19 community spread; and 
 
Indoor activities are contributing to the rise in cases in Cambridge, getting our metrics 
dangerously close to closing schools and resuming remote only learning again; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  We must take action to restrict the activities of non-essential businesses and gatherings 

in order to keep our schools open; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  We must prioritize our scholars and their education as we navigate through the next 

phase of the public health crisis; and 
 
Our efforts must be part of a regional response in order to not unfairly penalize 
Cambridge restaurants and small businesses; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Metro Mayor’s Association to close indoor 
dining, gyms, casinos and other non-essential indoor activities as soon as possible; and 
be it further 
 
That the City Manager, Community Development Department, the Economic 
Development Division, the Assessing Department and other relevant City Departments 
organize a small business and restaurant relief program that will assist during this 
second shutdown and our efforts to stop community spread of COVID-19 and keep 
schools open.

the reappointment of Christopher Bator to the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority for a term of 
five years and to discuss the Envision Cambridge citywide plan, and review how to set priorities 
and goals. 
 
Present at the hearing were Councillor Nolan, Chair of the Committee, Naomie Stephen, 
Executive Assistant to the City Council, and Paula M. Crane, Deputy City Clerk.   
 
Present via Zoom were Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Zondervan, 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Mayor Siddiqui, Lisa Peterson, Assistant City Manager, Iram

and a quorum was present.   
 
Councillor Nolan opened the hearing to Public Comment. 
 
Lee Farris, Cambridge Residents Alliance, read from a prepared written statement 
(ATTACHMENT A) noting that the Envision plan goals are good overall, but some of them 
conflict with each other.  She asked that the City discuss creating a process on how to resolve 
conflicting goals.    
 
Suzanne Blier stated that she attended as many meetings as she could, but she emphasized that 
this is not a city plan.  She said that the citizens asked for one and the City hired Utile and then 
decided that instead of an actual plan we would settle for goals, many of which are contradictory.  
She said that there is no zoning code or designation of places.  She said that there are key areas 
of the city with no plans that have been updated in many years.  This has opened the City to spot 
zoning.  She asked the City Council to look at the contradictory elements of the plan.     
 
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, stated that she is one of the few members of the public that 
attend the CRA meetings.  She said that the CRA could teach every other board, commission, 
and City Council about how to treat the public and to encourage the public to take part in their 
deliberations.  She said that she cannot think of a member of the current CRA board that she 
would be happy to see replaced.  She said that she would like to see Mr. Bator reappointed.  She 
said that as it relates to Envision, it is a monumental disappointment. She said that it is not a 
disappointment that the people that the City hired did a lousy job, it is a disappointment because 
the City administration required them to do a lousy job.  She said that when talking about 
stability, the fact is that everything the city does undermines stability.  She noted that the City 
Council has become interested in seeing how one particular thing that the city government can 
do affects rent, how about rampant commercial development with no creation of long-term 
housing.     
 
Councillor Nolan made a motion to close Public Comment.

Councillor Nolan invited Mr. Evans to briefly provide introduction to the CRA Board process.  
Mr. Evans noted that the CRA has guided the city through a dynamic period.  He said that Mr.

6.1

Bator grew up in Cambridge and has a long career in government service.  He stated that Mr. 
Bator has been highly attentive to the Board’s fiduciary position and has worked hard to ensure 
that resources that they have are extended to facilitate projects throughout the City of 
Cambridge.  He stated that Mr. Bator has encouraged thoughtful investment in purchases and 
other strategic partnerships.   
 
Kathy Born added that the last eight years have been a terrific exercise in small democracy in the 
City of Cambridge through the CRA.  They have been careful in setting goals and measuring 
accomplishments against those goals.  She said that Mr. Bator has been a most conscientious 
Treasurer.  She said that as it relates to financial matters, Mr. Bator has been at the helm when 
the CRA was taken over.  She said that every member of the CRA are contributing members.  
She said that she is happy to continue to work with Mr. Bator.   
 
Christopher Bator stated that he is happy to answer any questions that people may have.  He has 
been deeply honored to serve on the CRA since 2012.  He said he is proud of the work that has 
been done which involved rebuilding the CRA from Ground Zero.  He asserted that the CRA has 
a very talented and professional staff.  He said that the CRA Board works wonderfully together.  
He noted that he cares most about trying to move the wealth that exists in Kendall Square and 
spread it to important needs across Cambridge.   
 
Councillor Carlone stated that the CRA has unique capabilities and that is one of the reasons he 
wants them to get involved in purchase of affordable housing.  He said that he is impressed with 
Mr. Bator.  He said that the more the City Council includes the CRA in implementing projects, 
the better.  He thanked the CRA Board for its important work. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he has been impressed by the work of the CRA and the number 
of times that they have been rescuers in difficult situations. Councillor Zondervan asked how we 
can do more to develop the city in a way that is just and benefits all residents. Mr. Bator stated 
that he would defer to Mr. Evans for a more substantive answer.  Mr. Bator said that in his view, 
they are deeply committed to use the resources and talents of the CRA to assist the City, not just 
in the core responsibilities in Kendall Square.  He said that they are looking for opportunities to 
do work where there is need.  He said that they have had a very significant grassroots strategic 
planning effort in order to ensure that where they choose to use the resources, it is among the 
most important things in the purview of the CRA. He said that the CRA seeks guidance from all 
important entities in the City. Mr. Evans added that the last time that the CRA met with the City 
Council in February, the CRA was discussing a revisit of their strategic plan.  He noted that he 
looks forward to a broader discussion and engage the City Council in this process. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon thanked Mr. Bator for his continued service.  She said that she is 
appreciative of the work of the entire CRA.  She said that the City Council will be drawing on 
the CRA in the future to get the City through the Covid situation to see all the different ways to 
partner together to help those in the community that are struggling.   
 
Councillor Nolan said that she is thrilled that Mr. Bator will continue his work.  She said that 
transparency has been a hallmark of the CRA, recently, after a time of trouble and operations that 
were not transparent and exhibited poor practices.  She expressed gratitude that the current CRA

board corrected those past deficiencies and now is a great example to the rest of the city.  And 
noted that the Foundry project is a excellent example not yet mentioned of the CRA’s good work 
 
Councillor Nolan made a motion to forward a favorable recommendation to the full City Council 
on the reappointment of Christopher Bator to the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority for a 
term of five years. 
 
The roll was called and resulted as follows:

and the motion passed. 
 
Councillor Nolan moved to the Envision Cambridge citywide plan.  She stated that the 
background for the meeting is that there have been many hours spent on Envision with a robust 
City process that sought to develop a comprehensive planning document for the City.  She said 
that the last meeting of the City Council on this issue was in December of 2019.  She stated that 
today’s meeting is the first step in moving forward and getting the City back on track.  She said 
that one of hundreds of ideas was the Affordable Housing Overlay which became a central focus.  
She said that there are planning goals, focus areas, 300 action items with 44 priorities.  She said 
that the publication of the final plan brought together many of the elements into the City from a 
range of areas. She said that we must take a step back and review where Envision landed the 
City, what has happened since that process.  She said that the interim document was put out in 
2017 with a final document in 2019.  She said that her hope is that the committee reviews how 
Envision is being used and how it is shaping the work of the City.  She stated that it is important 
for the City Council to weigh in. 
 
Ms. Farooq stated that she is appreciative of being present when the committee is voting on the 
reappointment of Mr. Bator. She said that the CRA is a partner agency to the City and there have 
been many initiatives and endeavors in which they have worked in partnership.  She noted that 
she is pleased to see positive feedback and to see him reappointed.     
 
As it relates to the impact of Covid 19 on Envision, Ms. Farooq said that as CDD has looked at, 
it is a long-term plan that has not been changed significantly by Covid.  She said that it does 
shine a stronger light on some of the elements, particularly in the last 6-7 months such as 
community health, social equity, and racial equity.  She said that CDD has been focused over the 
last several months on the response to the pandemic such as supporting residents and businesses.  
She said it was interesting for CDD to pivot back to the long-term planning mode in preparation 
for this hearing.  She noted that CDD did not ask partner departments to be present for the 
hearing but their feedback is incorporated into the materials that CDD sent out earlier this week 
that includes updates on each of the topic areas in terms action status.  She said that in terms of 

Packet Pg. 97

6.1

the prioritization process with Envision Cambridge and each of the topic areas, it is more of a 
framework for how to move forward in each endeavor.  In looking at all the action items and 
working with the community and the working groups, they went through a process of 
prioritization to determine higher priority items and particularly which were short term versus 
long term.  She said that at today’s meeting they are focusing on the high priority, short-term 
actions.  Within that ,they have tried to keep maximum flexibility.  She said that in terms of the 
work that is taken up by CDD each year is what the particular needs of the moment are.  In terms 
of what would be most useful to staff from today’s discussion, Ms. Farooq noted that being able 
to understand what is important to the City Council and the community is very helpful as they 
move toward the budgeting process.  Ms. Farooq introduced Community Development staff and 
invited Melissa Peters to give a summary of the materials that were sent to the Committee 
(ATTACHMENT B). 
 
Ms. Peters gave an overview which stated that Envision Cambridge is a roadmap to the year 
2030, setting out a course of action to promote inclusive and sustainable growth.  She noted that 
the plan recommends 37 Goals, 42 strategies, and 176 new actions across six planning topics: 
climate and environment, community wellbeing, economy, housing, mobility and urban form.   
 
Councillor Carlone stated that he appreciates the update.  He reminded everyone that he co-wrote 
the Policy Order and it was a struggle to get it approved.  He said that it was planning and urban 
design yet when he looked at the urban form section, there were guidelines but there were no 
urban design massing studies, height studies or open space studies.  He does not know how you 
do zoning without an urban design analysis.  He said that this baffles him.  Ms. Farooq addressed 
in the Urban Form section many of the priority areas and action items that will get to the specific 
urban design recommendations that Councillor Carlone is speaking of.  For example, one of the 
recommendations is taking a closer look at the Inman Square area and what development 
patterns there might look like, particularly as impacted by the Green Line extension.  She said 
that as we delve into that level of plan, that will be more granular and would incorporate more 
detailed urban design input that Councillor Carlone is referring to.  Councillor Carlone said that 
all the commercial districts need to be studied.  He said that it is not on the list and if you are 
going to do that, add it.  He said that urban design will study conflicts.  Councillor Carlone said 
that a confusing thing to him is that Envision they mandated an urban design study of Alewife.  
A site plan was done.  He asked if that is the Alewife plan?  Ms. Peters responded that when they 
refer to the Alewife District Plan, it is the plan that came out of the Envision process that Utile 
helped with. She said that if it is in reference to current zoning, the existing Concord Alewife of 
2010 is still the plan on the book.  She said that as they have spoken with developers in the 
community, they have been pushing the goals and community aspirations from the new Alewife 
plan into the conversation.  Councillor Carlone said that is priority one given the we are getting 
development proposals.   
 
Councillor Carlone said that starting a study could be three meetings.  He noted that he would 
like a schedule of when things will be done.  He said that it would be great to say, “These 3 
should be done in 6 months.”  He said that we are well past starting.  He stated that starting is a 
good thing but literally it does not really say anything.  Ms. Farooq explained that the one reason 
they referenced everything to starting rather than concluding is because a large percentage of the 
actions are ongoing actions.  She said that some actions will never be complete.  She said that 

Packet Pg. 98

6.1

there are things that will have a start and end such as open space planning updates.  She said that 
a larger set of actions are ongoing items that will not be completed so that is why they linked 
everything to starting the work.  Councillor Carlone said that there is no idea how far along the 
work is.  He said that words are not a plan, words are not a strategy.  He said it would be great to 
receive updates every 3-6 months, specifically on what is being currently worked on and what is 
being accomplished.   
 
Councillor Zondervan thanked the staff for the update and added his voice to the call for more 
regular updates and the addition of dashboards. He stated that the Committee heard about 
conflicts between different roles and one way to address the issue is do holistic planning.  He 
said what is great about Envision Cambridge is that the first step in holistic planning has been 
accomplished.  He said that the next step is to evaluate our actions against all the goals.  He 
stated that a lot of actions are driven by developers who buy property and then come to the City 
Council.  He said that if we were having a more robust discussion in the context of Envision, we 
would take those proposals and air them to Envision.  He said that the public should not feel so 
left out and powerless.  He said that there needs to be more effort into evaluating plans and 
decision going forward against these goals.  He said that we do not seem to be going through any 
kind of guided exercise that says how to adjust the zoning to move forward in a way to 
accomplish goals. He said that there are constantly individual issues that ensue an argument 
when we should evaluate all issues against zoning and goals and then see how zoning can be 
more aligned with goals.  He asked how we create a real planning process based on goals 
developed through Envision that produces a plan through zoning that lays out what we are going 
to do where in the city.  Ms. Farooq said that as it relates to a dashboard, they are working on 
putting together a direct dashboard and are now in conversation with IT Department to figure out 
how to do the technical work and get it on CDD’s website.  She said that it will take several 
months, and the hope is to have it available sometime next year.  In terms of zoning and 
evaluation actions, Ms. Farooq said that there are actions that are identified, and it is easy to 
proceed one by one through these.  She said it is more challenging when it is a development or 
rezoning proposal. At the staff level they built in that thinking into it, but they do not specifically 
do holistic planning.  She said that they could utilize that method.  She asked Jeff Robert to add 
to this.  She said that there are two ways to think about how to take the conceptual citywide plan 
and translate that into zoning and it is not a small exercise. She said that the alternative is to take 
every proposal before CDD (whether coming from staff, the City Council, residents or 
developers) and then sieve it through the sift of Envision and see what the picture looks like. She 
said that we must pick one path or the other. She said that she would appreciate guidance.  Mr. 
Roberts said that in terms of overall strategy, it is important to establish planning goals and then 
evaluate the policies, including the Zoning Ordinance, to understand how that aligns with goals.  
He said that much of that work has been done in the Envision Cambridge plan.  There are 30 
specific actions that related to zoning.  He said that one approach to tackling those is to prioritize 
and to work through them in some order.  He said that the alternative approach is to say, “Put 
everything else on hold so we can do a fully comprehensive reconsideration of the whole Zoning 
Ordinance which can have benefit, but it will take a lot of time.” He said that approach of 
focusing efforts on things that we want accomplished the most is a good strategy but if we want 
to take a different tact, we could but it would come with a lot of tradeoffs. 
 

Packet Pg. 99

6.1

Councillor Zondervan stated that he is conflicted because he understands the challenge and yet at 
the same time, he thinks how can we not do both things.  He said that he struggles to reconcile 
these two approaches.  Ms. Farooq said that when thinking about capacity and that as a 
constraining factor, it is not just if CDD has enough staff in the zoning division, it is also if there 
is enough staff in other department who are analyzing each of the components.  She said it is a 
mushroom as well as capacity at Planning Board, Ordinance Committee, etc.  She said that 
making changes incrementally has served us quite well. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that as it relates to staff capacity, she would love to see a dashboard of 
the Envision goals and actions and where we are on each one of them. She said that she wonders 
about staff capacity to do something like that.  She asked if we should entertain the idea of hiring 
someone outside to put together a dashboard. She said that she would like to think about how to 
make that come to fruition without adding burden onto CDD.  As it relates to regular progress 
reports, she stated that she has some questions.  She wondered if they could be updated.  She 
asked if there is a way to update progress reports via color-coding with a small blurb of what is 
happening.  Something that would indicate where we are in the absence of a dashboard would be 
helpful.  Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is there a way to use the committees to move work 
forward.  She asked how the City Council committee chairs can have more of a partner with 
action items and move them forward in that way.  Ms. Farooq said that it is a great idea.  She 
said it is a key way to build two-way communication around specific topics and actions.  She 
said that the committees grapple with the same kind of restraint in doing multiple things at the 
same time. She welcomes that partnership. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is a way that 
progress reports could be updated to show a visual representation of where the work stands. Ms. 
Farooq said that they will do the updates.  Ms. Farooq asked Ms. Peters to provide a sense of 
how long this will take.  She stated that we must keep in mind that more detailed updates involve 
more departments than CDD.  She said that they will work on it and maybe take the approach of 
sending them forward as they are done. Ms. Peters added that they can color code the actions to 
correspond to the pie chart but if more detail is added they will have to reach out to staff and 
department heads which would take more time.  She said that CDD can send color coding first 
and then as they go through each planning topic, they will forward to the City Council.     
 
Councillor Nolan said that we have talked about dashboards and she believed that they are in the 
process.  Ms. Farooq said that it is in the process and she does not believe additional resources 
are necessary.  Ms. Peters said that there is a fulltime senior planner that is charged in the 
Envision implementation and moving to forward.  He is getting the data organized to track the 
indicators to ultimately go onto a dashboard.  The next step is the web design and development 
phase.  In the interim, progress reports will fill the gaps. Councillor Nolan said that the data is 
already partly there but it is not tied to the actual item so that has been challenging.  She stated 
that other data would not have to be gathered.  She said that we could use the sustainability 
platform and use for other categories.  Melissa Peters stated that the intention is to use the City’s 
web infrastructure for Envision so they have more control over updates.  Councillor Nolan stated 
that she would like a timeline prospectively for actions to the completion or next steps of action 
items.  Ms. Farooq responded that they aim to create the pool of priority items but retain the 
flexibility to be responsive to the needs of each item.  She said that it is hard to ascribe timelines 
that go beyond the fiscal year unless it is to an item that is an ongoing item or an item that they 
have started.  She said that for the items that have begun, they could try to layout a timeline 

Packet Pg. 100

6.1

guideline, but it will be challenging and difficult to say that for all the other items that have not 
begun, when they would begin.  Councillor Nolan said that actions are related to strategies which 
are tied to a goal and the goals are long-term. She said that there are some goals that are longer 
term.     
 
Councillor Nolan stated that the Envision document should be all of the City Council and City 
staff guiding document to keep the focus on all of the goals that are encompassed.  She said that 
as it relates to the various working groups and department heads, is there anything that the City 
Council should be thinking about moving forward.  Ms. Farooq said that the key conversation 
that has been had with department heads have been around action items and ensuring that they 
are attaching updates.  In terms of what would be most useful, Ms. Farooq said that the most 
useful feedback is to have clear priorities of the City Council as a body.  In terms of the working 
groups, she said that they were informed about this discussion.  Ms. Peters said that they were 
notified of the hearing today and some members indicated that they would be listening in. She 
noted that since December 2018, CDD has not regrouped with the working groups.   
 
Councillor Nolan said that this is a good start for her.  She said it is a document that could be 
more specific.  She noted that there has been some frustration about the range of actions.  She 
said that it would make sense for the Committee to recommend to the full City Council that the 
work continue in the committees that are set up around these areas.   
 
Councillor Nolan made the following motion: 
 
ORDERED:  That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public Facilities, 

Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council that a 
response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to include holding 
committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are updated and ready 
to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to the goals and plans 
as follows: 

 

 

 

 

 

Climate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee 

Community Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee 

Economy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee 

Housing to the Housing Committee  

Mobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee 
 
Urban Form to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts 

and Celebrations Committee  

 

 
Councillor Carlone stated that he agrees with the Councillor Nolan’s motion.  He said that this 
was tried before the final report came out when it was in draft form, but it was not completely 

Packet Pg. 101

6.1

successful.  He said that this is the right next step.  He said that CDD has both a long-term 
planning and instantaneous response responsibility that the City Council asks for things and the 
City Council expects it yesterday.  He said that this department is the most unique in that way.  
He said that it makes sense and it might be a way to help staff understand the point of view of the 
City Council.   
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that the City Council can set a goal as a City Council to have a 
process to change City Councils to reflect the Envision goals.  He said that there is a discrepancy 
between the current City Council goals and the Envision goals and maybe that is the place to 
start as a body to do this work.  
 
Councillor Nolan asked Councillor Zondervan if he was proposing adding language to the 
motion or would that be a separate meeting.  Councillor Zondervan responded that the 
Committee can recommend to the full City Council to initiate a process to look at the current 
City Council goals and look at the Envision goals and decide on City Council goals going 
forward rather than perpetuating the current discrepancies.   
 
Councillor Nolan stated that the words “that it work on establishing long-term goals” could be 
added to the motion in the first paragraph. Councillor Zondervan stated that this works but he 
suggested changing the word “establish” to the word “updating.” 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked the Chair to re-read the amended wording for the motion.   
 
Councillor Nolan read the following motion: 
 
ORDERED:  That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public Facilities, 

Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council that it 
update its goals and that a response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to 
include holding committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are 
updated and ready to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to 
the goals and plans as follows: 

Climate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee 

Community Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee 

Economy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee 

Housing to the Housing Committee  

Mobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee

Vice Mayor Mallon suggested that a motion be made to extend the meeting by 10 minutes.   
 
Councillor Nolan made a motion to extend the hearing for 10 minutes. 
 
The roll was called and resulted as follows: 
 
YEAS:  
 
 
 
NAYS: 
 
ABSENT: 
 
and the motion passed on the affirmative vote of four members. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that she is uncomfortable to speak about the City Council goals in this 
setting. She said that she is comfortable moving forward with the motion by Councillor Nolan.  
She stated that if we want to City Council goals, she believes that it should happen in a different 
committee and she believes that Mayor Siddiqui had spoken about a treat at some point to talk 
about goals. She said she is not comfortable combining those two things.  She said that the 
Committee should focus on moving progress to the committees as originally suggested.   
 
Councillor Zondervan responded that the Committee is not suggesting to the City Council what 
to do other than to initiate a process to evaluate its updated goals.   
 
Councillor Carlone said that we are only talking about planning goals, not the City Council’s 
twelve goals that will probably be refined in the next few months.  He said that we are talking as 
it relates to Envision and it is a Policy Order that will be discussed by the full City Council.  He 
said that this is a good discussion.   
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that the City Council should update its goals but exactly how we 
want to go about that is a topic for another discussion.  He said that he is just saying that we 
should look at the goals.   
 
Councillor Nolan stated her agreement with Vice Mayor Mallon that these should be two 
separate motions.  She stated that she would like to vote on her originally proposed motion 
which reads as follows: 
 
ORDERED:  That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public Facilities, 

Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council that a 
response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to include holding 
committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are updated and ready 
to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to the goals and plans 
as follows:

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR 

 

Sumbul Siddiqui 
          Mayor 
 

 
To: 

From:   

Date: 

 

 

Cambridge City Council 

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor 

November 12, 2020 

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
On Thursday, November 5th, the School Committee held a Special Meeting to discuss and adopt 
the  recommended  revisions  to  the  health  and  safety  metrics  proposed  by  CPSD’s  scientific 
advisors.  These  recommendations  make  an  argument  for  narrowing  the  scope  of  the  existing 
metrics to focus more on Cambridge-specific data. Despite overwhelming support and agreement 
with the proposal itself, the vote was tabled by Member Wilson, who exercised her charter right 
due to issues raised by the Educators of Color Coalition (EOCC) and Cambridge Families of Color 
Coalition (CFCC) on lack of inclusivity in the design process.  
 
I have called a Special Meeting for Thursday, November 12th to have a discussion of these metrics 
with community stakeholders of color and hopefully move to adopt the recommendations.  
 
The current metrics, which are displayed on the CPS COVID-19 dashboard, reflect: 
 

1.  Daily new cases: The weighted average of new cases each day per 100,000 people in 

Suffolk and Middlesex Counties (Threshold: less than 25) 

2.  Positive testing rate: The rate of positive new COVID-19 cases in Massachusetts 

(Threshold: less than 5%) 

3.  Wastewater monitoring: The level of COVID-19 found in sewage wastewater for 61 

communities in the region (Threshold: less than 100 copies viral genomes/mL) 

 
If two or more of those metrics exceed the recommended thresholds, the CPS plan to minimize 
risk requires a transition to remote learning for all students. As of the morning of Thursday, 
November 12th, the reported data shows that both the number of daily new cases and the 
wastewater measure have surpassed the recommended thresholds. As a result, CPS is prepared 
for a possible and temporary shift to remote learning for all students next week.

If the recommended metrics are adopted at the November 12th Special Meeting, a shift to all-
remote learning will not be necessary at this time. No matter what, we will continue the in-
person school schedule on Friday, November 13 and Monday, November 16 for those 
students currently learning in-person.  
 
Our upcoming meetings are as follows: 

▪  Discussing the proposed updated metrics and consider the calendared motion 

•  Thursday, November 12th, 2020 

o  Special Meeting |7:00 PM 

•  Thursday, November 17th, 2020 

o  Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM 

 

•  Wednesday, November 18th, 2020 

o  Roundtable Meeting | 4:00 PM 

▪  Discussing ways that the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color 

may be factored more explicitly into the CPS Re-opening Plan 
 

o  Special Education and Student Supports Subcommittee Meeting | 6:00 PM 

▪  Discussing the reading level benchmark data, resources to scholars reading below grade 

level, dyslexia indicators, and professional development to educators 

 
The final CPS Family Resource Fair will be held on Saturday, November 14th outside the Pisani 
Center at 131 Washington Street from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. It will be a grab-and-go event 
for families, as usual. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.  
 
 
Respectfully,
