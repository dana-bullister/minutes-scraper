          H THEODORE COHEN:  Welcome to the August 18, 2020 

meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My name is 

Catherine Preston Connolly, and I'm the Chair.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles D. Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 

2020, temporarily amending certain requirements to the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on July 

30, 2020.  

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online 

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.  Members of the public will be 

kept on mute until it is time for public comment, at which 

time I will give instructions for public comment, and you 

will also find instructions on the city's webpage for remote 

Planning Board meetings.  

          I will start tonight by asking the staff to take 

Board member attendance and verify that all members are 

audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

Jeff Roberts, the Director of Zoning and Development at CDD.  

I'm just going to check Board member attendance.   

          So Louis Bacci, are you present and is the meeting 

audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.

          Also from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department we have Adam Shulman present. 

          Just a quick update on schedule before we get 

started.  We have two public hearings tonight -- a special 

permit case and a zoning petition.  As I noted last time, 

we're starting to get into cases that were -- kind of came 

our way sort of during the time in which meetings were 

suspended, so we're still kind of getting caught up on those 

cases.  

          And next week at the Planning Board we have a 

continued special permit hearing on case 75-115 Smith Place, 

which is a project for a special permit and a permit in the 

Alewife Overlay District, that was heard back in February, 

and is coming back. 

          We're going into September now with meetings, and 

we're going to be continuing to go -- we're picking up some 

new business, but also working through some zoning petitions 

that hadn’t had a chance to be heard back in the spring. 

          On September 8, we have a special permit hearing 

on a cannabis retail store proposal at 200 Monsignor O'Brien 

Highway. 

          And we are getting -- and we are also having a

hearing on an Alewife Quadrangle Northwest Overlay District.  

It's a citizen zoning petition, that has been presented by 

representatives who are property owners in the area that’s 

being rezoned.  The Board heard a version of this last year, 

and it will be coming back. 

          And then on September 15, we'll be having a public 

hearing on a zoning petition for the Canal District Kendall 

PUD, which is the zoning petition by Biomed realty.  And 

again, it was filed some time ago.  It didn't have a chance 

to be heard, and it will be scheduled in September. 

          I'll just leave it there.  We will have more 

hearings to schedule in September, and even looking into 

October at this point.  So I look forward to updating 

everyone on that when we get there. 

          Oh, and I'm sorry, there were two more updates. 

Just in -- and I believe I mentioned this the last time, but 

there are Ordinance Committee hearings this month.      

          Tomorrow, August 19, there's a continued Ordinance 

Committee hearing on the Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning 

Petition. 

          And August 25 there is an Ordinance Committee 

hearing on the Fossil Fuel Zoning Petition, which the

all.  Thank you.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  All right.

                  Sieniewicz 

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  All right.  

The next item on the agenda, then, is a public hearing on 

Planning Board Special Permit Case PB #365, an application 

by GreenSoul Organics, LLC, to convert an existing space at 

759 Massachusetts Avenue into a cannabis retail store.   

          We'll start off as always with CDD staff 

summarizing why this is before us procedurally.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair. Back to me 

-- Jeff Roberts -- once again.   

          And just a quick update.  Cannabis retail stores 

are allowed in this zoning district by special permit from 

the Planning Board, per the requirements in Section 11.800 

of the zoning ordinance.  Although there were other

permitted cannabis retail stores within 1800 feet, this 

applicant is a certified Economic Empowerment applicant, and 

so, those requirements for separation are waived. 

          And the Board's action is to grant or deny the 

requested special permits.  The applicable criteria have 

been provided in documents submitted to the Board.  Thank 

you.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  All right.  

The presenter will be Rebecca Adams on behalf of the 

applicant.  You will have up to 30 minutes for your 

presentation, though we hope you can be as concise as 

possible.  So please introduce your project team and begin.  

          REBECCA ADAMS:  Great, thank you.  If you could 

start with the first slide, please?  Thank you. 

          Good evening members of the Planning Board and 

residents of Cambridge.  On behalf of our team, GreenSoul 

Organics, LLC, we would like to thank you for your time this 

evening and consideration issuing a special permit for our 

project. 

          If you could go to slide 2, please?  Our 

presentation this evening will focus on who we are, and how 

intricately we plan to work with the city and our 

11

neighborhood to provide a positive impact for everyone.  We 

understand the Board has reviewed the architectural drawings 

and the Traffic memo, and we have experts on the Zoom call 

this evening here to answer your questions. 

          Slide 3, please? Thank you.   

          Our proposed project location -- again -- is 759 

Massachusetts Ave.   

          Slide 4, please?   

          We will be discussing our team -- our proposed 

project details, our plan to mitigate traffic, and the 

benefits that we will provide to our community. 

          Slide 5, please? 

          At this time, I'd like to introduce our Licensing 

team, so everyone here who is going to be presenting with us 

this evening:  Taba Moses, the Founder and CEO of GreenSoul 

Organics, LLC; Richard Harding, Vice-President and Chief 

Compliance Officer of GreenSoul Organics -- Richard is also 

the President and Founder of the GreenSoul Foundation;  

Rebecca Adams -- that is myself, I am a Compliance and 

Regulatory Consultant who has been assisting medical and 

adult-use cannabis companies in the state of Massachusetts. 

          We also have on the call this evening Will

Chalfant, the Project Manager for our proposed project.  He 

works for Khalsa Design; and Paul Tyrel (phonetic), the 

Traffic Engineer for our proposed project.  And Paul works 

for Greater Boston Survey and Engineering. 

          We have Joe Hanley and Tom Miller, our zoning 

attorneys with McDermott, Quilty & Miller; and Max Stern, 

the General Counsel for GreenSoul Organics from Todd and 

Weld.   

          Slide 6, please?  Thank you. 

          GreenSoul Organics -- again -- is an approved 

Economic Empowerment applicant that has been approved 

through the Cannabis Control Commission. 

          And the team consists of Taba -- again, as CEO; 

Alexander Heredia, COO; Richard Harding, the Vice-President 

and Chief Compliance Officer:  Saba Moses, Chief of 

Strategy; Dawn Martin, Marketing Director; Amine Benali, 

Capital Advisor; and Maria Alvir-Heredia, VP of Operations. 

          I'm now going to turn it over to Taba to talk a 

little bit more about the GreenSoul Organics team.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sir, you're on mute.  

          TABASURI MOSES:  Can you hear me?

now, Taba, thank you.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  How's everybody doing?  So real 

quick, myself and Richard grew up in Cambridge down the 

Port.  I grew up across the street from the projects.  

Richard Mokey Harding -- people know him as, "Mokey" grew up 

in the projects.  We've been childhood friends since 6 years 

old.  We've watched the gentrification of Cambridge, our 

city, and the transformation of Central Square.   

          When we were kids, that corner where it's 24 hours 

used to be Hi-Fi Pizza and the fancy restaurant next door 

used to be Burger King, right?  So that's where we hung out.  

We used to pass through there when we went to the Y to play 

ball.   

          So this for us provides a unique opportunity.  

Central Square's been part of our neighborhood since we were 

young, and this provides us a chance to be a part of the 

Central Square Business Community and continue to be a part 

of our neighborhood and impact our neighborhood in a 

positive way.   

          That being said, when we first went into this, we 

thought about how we could strategically help ourselves and 

help our community at the same time.  We came up with the

GreenSoul Foundation, which we're in our office now.  And 

that actually provides us with an opportunity to actually 

give back while we're moving forward.   

          I think one of the key things with our group is 

that we've created a team that allows us to mobilize from 

day one, right?  There's a lot that goes into this, and it 

takes a lot to get through the zoning process to be able to 

actually build out your space and understand what the SOPs 

are, the regulations and be able to move forward and really 

open up a business. 

          The team that we have, which includes Richard and 

myself amongst a bunch of other people -- my wife, everyone, 

has different expertise, and we're 100 percent minority-

owned.  We plan to continue to be that, and we'd like to 

just tell you a little bit more about what we're doing and 

bring ourselves to the table. 

          I'll pass it onto Richard from here, so he can 

talk a little more about us, and then give it back.   

          RICHARD (MOKEY) HARDING:  Can you hear me Jeff and 

Chairwoman Conolly?  Can you hear me?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.

          RICHARD (MOKEY) HARDING:  First and foremost, I 

just want to thank the great team at CDD, both Swaathi and 

Iram and the other folks.  They have been great to help 

guide us through the process, and we're very thankful for 

their sage advice through the process, which has been 

arduous, and with COVID somewhat -- you know, disheartening.   

          But I'd say that we're glad that we're here today, 

and this opportunity to be with you presents us with the 

opportunity to really follow our dream.   

          Taba and I grew up through humble beginnings.  You 

know, I grew up in Washington, onto Newtown Court.  And, you 

know, from there, we always wanted to figure out how we 

would find that place to stay within Cambridge, 

understanding that Cambridge is evolving as a world-class 

city. 

          Growing up in the most innovative square mile in 

the world, we knew that it was going to be very hard for us 

to maintain our stead in Cambridge without having a viable 

business and having viable connections to the community. 

          And so, we are steeped in our mission, not only as 

a cannabis LLC but with the Foundation to be socially just 

and economically just to people with humble beginnings just

like us, particularly those who have been adversely affected 

from the War on Drugs. 

          I would just also say that, you know, we built 

this company for a love of community, right?  We embraced 

our community, and Central Square was our second home, as 

well as embracing the culture of Central Square and the 

culture that exists in Cambridge that we know and grew up 

in.   

          And so, with the company that is formed by -- you 

know, members who have -- you know, mostly graduated from 

Cambridge Rindge and Latin, we have real roots in the 

community, and we look forward tonight to tell you our story 

and walk through this process, hopefully with the favorable 

recommendation of the Planning Board.   

          So we thank you, and you'll hear later about the 

Foundation and other things.  But I'm going to turn it back 

to Rebecca.  And I do want to thank the Board for hearing us 

out tonight.  So thank you, thank you, thank you. 

          Rebecca?   

          REBECCA ADAMS:  Thank you Taba and Richard, I 

appreciate it.  Our proposed project consists of repurposing 

759 Massachusetts Ave.  Renovations would include the first

floor and the basement, with minor renovations to the 

exterior façade.   

          The total renovation is 1365 square feet.  This 

project does not propose adding any off-street parking.  

However, GreenSoul Organics has proposed TDM measures in 

line with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department's recommendations. 

          Slide 8, please? 

          GreenSoul Organics will be a good neighbor.  We 

held our Community Outreach meeting on November 30, 2019, 

and we received positive feedback from the community and our 

abutters.  We are proposing hours of operation Monday 

through Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.; Saturdays 10:00 

a.m. to 11:00 p.m., and we were proposing Sunday hours 11:  

00 to 8:00 p.m. 

          However, we received some information this 

afternoon from the Orthodox Church requesting our retail 

space open later on Sundays.  And we're more than happy to 

honor that request, and would like to ask the Board if we 

could be open on Sundays from 2:30 to 8:00 p.m.  

          We will operate our retail space professionally.  

We'll have a total of 24 employees when fully operational,

and that would be various shifts.  It's illegal to consume 

any products on site.  Loitering and littering will not be 

allowed, and you have to be 21 years of age to enter their 

retail facility. 

          Deliveries will be two to three times per week, 

and they will occur on a random schedule early in the 

morning.  Our deliveries will not interfere with any 

abutters to 759 Mass Ave.   

          We propose options for our delivery.  The first 

option and the preferred option would be to pull the 

delivery van, which would be similar to a transit van, into 

the alleyway behind 759 Mass Ave and unload deliveries 

through the back door.   

          If for any reason our delivery vehicle is unable 

to utilize that space because of garbage pickup and drop-

off, we would then tell the delivery driver to utilize the 

loading areas in front of the building and across the 

street. 

          And if for any reason those loading zones are not 

available, we would then tell them to use street parking.

comment.  We're -- GreenSoul Organics will not block any 

traffic on Mass Ave or Inman Street.  Nor will we allow any 

deliveries to put bikers in any danger. 

          We will be utilizing what's called, 'the Dutchie 

Software System."  It's an online ordering program which 

takes seconds for our customers to order product, versus 

customers perusing in the store.  Customers can go online, 

place their order, and the store will then alert them as to 

when their order will be ready for pickup. 

          This decreases lines from inside the facility as 

well as outside of the facility. 

          Slide 10, please? 

          I'm now going to turn the presentation over to 

Will to discuss the exterior façade and proposed project 

design. 

          WILLIAM CHALFANT:  Thank you, Rebecca.  Will 

Chalfant from Khalsa Design.  This is a space formerly known 

as Hair Collage.  The scope of work, as Rebecca has stated, 

will be to replace the existing storefront with a new 

storefront, add an additional part of the front of the space 

and then it's obviously the interior renovation, which we'll 

get to shortly.

          Being that this is a cannabis dispensary, we're 

cognizant of the concerns the community might have regarding 

product visibility.  At the same time, we by no means want 

to close the space off to the pedestrians walking by.   

          So our approach was to create entry space that 

maintains activation on the sidewalk, while shielding the 

products within the store.  This is achieved by creating our 

waiting area, security check in at the front of the store.   

          And this entire front of house, as it were, will 

be decorated by the local artists from Street Theory.  A lot 

of their artwork is in and around Central Square already, 

and I'm sure you're familiar with it. 

          But the intention, obviously, is to activate this 

space while still shielding it from the pedestrians.   

          Next slide, please? 

          Okay.  So just to orient you, Mass Ave is on the 

right-hand side of this plant.  So as you'll see, we'll 

enter in through a new door on the left-hand side of the 

existing storefront, where there will be a queuing space.  

This space will hold roughly 11 people.  The store itself 

will also hold around 11 customers, for a total of 22 at any 

given time.

          There is -- so as you enter through this space, 

you'll obviously be checked in through security.  And then 

once there, there will be a concierge station of sorts, 

where they'll direct you to different parts of the 

dispensary, depending on what you're looking for.  We have 

CBD drinks and items like that on the far side in colors, as 

well as some Edible products. 

          And then in the middle of the store is the 

GreenSoul desk, and that's where a budtender will be, which 

assists customers in learning more about specific strains 

and what they may be looking for. 

          At the bottom side of the screen are the checkout 

stations, as well as online pickup. 

          Now the rear of the store, we're going to have 

three employee bike spaces, as well as a new handicap lift, 

which will provide accessible access for employees to the 

basement of the store, which I believe -- 

          Next slide, please? 

          Right.  So this is actually kind of flipped.  So 

Mass Ave is on your left.  But our lift is on the right-hand 

side there, and there's an employee locker space, as well as 

an accessible toilet and the vault of the store, as well as 

22

Manager's Office.   

          Next slide, please? 

          So here's a sort of interior perspective section 

here showing on the right-hand side our queuing space and 

entering through there, and then entering through the 

facility, with some of our shelving and built-in coolers, as 

I mentioned earlier.   

          Next slide, please? 

          Again, this is an opposite view.  The left-hand 

side there is your entrance sequence.  The facility in the 

middle here, with audio-video screens, which will display 

things as menus, different items like that, as well as our 

checkouts in the rear. 

          Next slide, please? 

          So we've done some interior renderings just to 

show sort of the vibe of this store.  You know, GreenSoul 

wants the customer to have a memorable experience in the 

store using the technology, the local artists and the high-

quality materials and products that they offer.  We've got 

the logo on a bit of an undulating wall there that creates 

some drama in the space. 

          Next slide, please?

          And again, this is looking back towards the point 

of sale area, as well as the budtender desk, which will have 

products for customers to view.   

          Next slide? 

          And again, this is more of the same here as far as 

looking at the different parts of the dispensary.  The areas 

that are sort of yellow in tone are the built-in coolers 

which will house the drinks and items like that.   

          Next slide? 

          And I will kick this over to Paul Tyrell, our 

Traffic Engineer, who can go through the multiple transit 

options we have available to us.  Thank you.   

          PAUL TYRELL:  Good evening and thank you very 

much.  Hopefully I can be heard?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.   

          PAUL TYRELL:  This location is rather unique and 

has a multitude of opportunities for public transit, 

bicyclists, foot, MBTA, Zipcars; there's a multitude of 

opportunities to reach this location utilizing current 

public transportation.   

          The MBTA Red Line is a mere 400 feet away, a two-

minute walk.  There's seven MBTA bus lines.  There is a

Zipcar location.  There are a number of city parking lots.  

There is a Bluebikes station across the state, as well as 

off-street parking. 

          Rebecca mentioned a number of things that we're 

going to make sure that don't happen.  We are not going to 

worry about deliveries impacting traffic in the peak 

periods.  There will obviously be in the mornings, as was 

mentioned, so that there's no impacts to the public and/or 

to the surrounding traffic.   

          Next slide, please? 

          The key to the success of the project is going to 

be the opening day setup.  Of course, we're going to work 

with the local police.  We're going to make sure we have a 

plan well in place before we even start.  A uniformed 

officer is going to be required for a period of time.   

          We're looking forward to the online orders and 

utilizing technology to its fullest advantage.  Folks today, 

folks that would be using this project are technically 

savvy; they will want to be able to limit their time.  They 

will use the online ordering; they will be able to shop 

online.  It really reduces the amount of folks that are 

congregating in the area.

          And employees and customers are going to be 

strongly encouraged to use public transportation.  There 

will be a bike facility; there will be bike storage on site.  

There's going to be an economic support to the employees for 

using public transportation, as well as to join the Bluebike 

program.   

          So the organization itself is embracing the first 

thing they're in a wonderful location to benefit immensely 

from the multiple opportunities for public transportation.    

          Slide 20, please?   

          At this point, I pass it over to Taba, I believe.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Taba, you're mute.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  Can you hear me?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  Thank you, Paul.  So real quick, 

we're going to talk about Street Theory.  I think in talking 

with them, we came up with an idea of a way that we could 

activate the space and support local artists.  I think it's 

really important, and I think it's in the best interest of 

Central Square.   

          And from talking to Mike Monestime about the best 

vision for Central Square is how can we maintain the culture 

26

as the city grows, right?  We can't stop things from 

growing.  People grow, the world progresses, but we don't 

want to lose a sense of who we are in the process.   

          We thought that Street Theory was a critical 

collaboration, which allows us not only to post art, but our 

agreement with them is that they're going to not only curate 

art, but work with different artists.   

          So it'll allow us to expose artist, support 

artists in their dreams in terms of being recognized, and 

continuously creating a space that changes and not always 

stays the same. 

          So if you look at the store and you're always 

seeing the same thing, it gets boring.  But it's not real 

true support of the culture.  That's one of the big things, 

to figure out how we support the culture.   

          So we'll be working with them not only around 

exposing new artists, but creating programs and working with 

the Central Square Business Association to possibly do shows 

and different things -- maybe an art show once a year -- 

that really supports local artists and supports the local 

business community.

          So the Last Prisoner Project, it gives us a unique 

opportunity.  I connected with them about a year ago.  

They're a national project.  They're well-known.  They have 

a great Board.   

          Their main goal is to basically reduce the 

recidivism rate and help as many people as possible that 

have been convicted by the War on Drugs and are doing time 

for possession of whatever -- marijuana and different things 

-- to be released at this point. 

          I mean, everyone's familiar with the politics of 

the country, we're in a different place right now.  Our 

relationship with them I think allows us to have a direct 

impact on our community.  Central Square, Mokey said -- 

Kendall, the biggest innovation square mile, right, in the 

world right now…  right around the corner from there is the 

projects.   

          We got kids still getting in trouble, we got kids 

that are stuck.  We got kids that need help.  Those are kids 

from our community that look up to us that we've watched 

grow up, right?  We still have kids in Cambridge public 

school system that aren't making it.  We got to figure out 

how to help them.

          Through our connection with the Last Prisoner 

Project, we'll be able to provide jobs through Workforce 

Training development, and help the citizenry in Cambridge be 

reduced.  And I think that's a great opportunity for us and 

a great opportunity for them, and it's good for the city.   

          I'm going to turn it over to Richard to close from 

here.  Thank you very much.   

          RICHARD(MOKEY)HARDING:  Next slide, please? 

          Yeah, so when Taba and I -- it's been a long time 

now -- had decided to start the company, and we tried to 

figure out what we could do, understanding that this created 

an opportunity not only for generational wealth, but also an 

opportunity for us to have an impact on our community. 

          We decided to have a dual business model of the 

LLC and the GreenSoul Community Foundation, a charitable 

foundation, looking to giving to our community in a real way 

around social and economic justice, particularly in the 

cannabis space.   

          So what we decided to do was to design a program 

and a mission that would provide job title and workforce 

development within the cannabis industry to diversify the 

ranks of cannabis.

          Cannabis is a very -- it's a privileged, a place 

of commerce -- we'll say a privileged business space, where 

you have the same power brokers controlling all the 

interests across the country, and understanding what that 

Economic Empowerment status that we needed to represent that 

in a real way. 

          So our Foundation will not only provide job 

training and workforce development and cultivation in 

retail, but also technical assistance for other Economic 

Empowerment groups who are going through the arduous 

licensing process, as well as community service component. 

          We're now helping another group -- another 

Economic Empowerment group -- who's needed some technical 

assistance to maintain their space in the cannabis space by 

helping them financially, but also really looking forward in 

creating these partnerships like the Last Prisoner Project 

to make sure that we're connecting with people who've 

already done this in California and other places to make 

sure that we have the most robust training and workforce 

development program in the cannabis space. 

          We're looking to not only diversify cannabis -- 

our cannabis business and make sure that people who have

been mostly adversely affected by the War on Drugs can take 

advantage of it, but also helping to train people, so that 

the other cannabis businesses that will operate in the 351 

cities and towns in Massachusetts -- and quite frankly 

throughout the country, will be able to have a cadre of 

skilled workers to work in their facilities -- both retail 

and cultivation. 

          We've also looked at and spent a lot of time with 

our community service.  COVID has forced up to step up, and 

we've done that in many ways.   

          We've given away -- you know, thousands of masks -

- I think it's, like, 4000 masks so far -- to not only small 

businesses, particularly in the Greater Boston area, but 

also to the Suffolk County House of Corrections, where there 

was a shortage of PPE and masks early on. 

          And we're going to run our operation out of 

Kendall Square on 255 Main Street, and we're looking forward 

to really having an impact and helping those who are most 

adversely affected by the War on Drugs find a real space so 

they can survive in the cannabis industry.   

          We have a motto, Taba and I -- and we talked about 

this -- that we hope for some kid who's having trouble, who

maybe had walked in and hit an obstacle in their life, maybe 

with the law or other way -- that cannabis can one day save 

their life.   

          And so, we look forward to having our impact in 

the most positive way we can in the city of Cambridge.  And 

we're thankful for this opportunity to be before you, and 

we're looking forward to any questions you may have.   

          And I just want to thank our team, who has worked 

really, really hard to get us in this position. And we look 

forward to all of your questions, and we'll do the best we 

can to have a conversation about how we can be licensed in 

the city of Cambridge.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  So one of 

the things that we have been doing with the Board to try to 

keep things moving as quickly as possible is we're actually 

going to take public comment first, and then have questions 

from Board members after that.  So we'll move to public 

comment now, as this is a public hearing. 

          Any members of the public who wish to speak should 

now click the button that says, "Raise hand."  If you're 

calling in by phone, you raise your hand by pressing *9.  As 

of 5:00 p.m., the Board had not yet received any written

comments from the public on this case.  Written 

communications received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday will be 

entered into the record. 

          All right.  I'll now ask staff to unmute speakers 

one at a time.  You should begin by saying your name and 

address, and staff will confirm that we can hear you.  After 

that, you'll have up to three minutes to speak before I ask 

you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  This is Jeff Roberts, 

again.  I'm just going to control the speakers.  I'm going 

to read names.  I'll read one name, and then I'll read the 

next name coming up, just so you know that your turn is 

coming.  The first speaker is Mo Barbosa.  And then 

afterwards is Quinton Zondervan. 

          Mo Barbosa, you can begin by giving your name and 

address.   

          MO BARBOSA:  So I'm Mo Barbosa.  I currently 

reside as an expat at 1670 Summer Street in Newton Mass.  

I'm a longtime Cambridge resident, and can you hear me?  Are 

we all set?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you, thanks.

sure.  So thank you all and thanks to the Planning Board for 

the opportunity to speak and provide some public comment.   

          I want to first applaud the folks who did the 

presentation today for laying out the real cause here, which 

is not just economic opportunity, but ensuring that the 

cannabis industry is open to people who have been 

historically shut out of the economy.   

          We have people who walk the streets of Mass Ave in 

Central Square today who aren't able to work in the very 

places that they are passing.  Now, this is something that 

gets repeated over and over again.   

          Many -- unfortunately black and brown -- men who 

come having had some interaction with the law or even after 

they've left high school and haven't found their way yet are 

looking for a job, and many of the places that they pass on 

the very streets where they've grown up -- on the very 

streets that they went to the Y with (sic), that they went 

to the old Burger King or might have in the oldest days gone 

to sermons, and got their first suit -- the very places on 

those streets would not employee them and do not employee 

them, and don't provide them the kind of economic 

opportunity to move forward in their lives.

          And so, I'm really proud of what GreenSoul 

Organics and GreenSoul Foundation is doing about basically 

creating an on-ramp for people who have been passed over and 

passed on by the general economic and -- in some ways -- in 

the cannabis economic, to have a leg into the process, to 

have a way to join the process. 

          Also just want to mention that this is homegrown.  

These are guys from the Cambridge neighborhoods that they've 

talked about from the Port.  This is young people who grew 

up and have been giving -- have a long history of civic 

participation, and also, have been engaged in their 

community and have really close ties. 

          And what that means is that not only is this a 

shop that's going to open and be great for customers in the 

Cambridge community, and all the folks who would be walking 

through Central Square anyway now have an opportunity to 

visit this business, but it also means that all the folks 

who've grown up looking up to this generation will see that 

these are successful businesspeople who can be role models 

for them; and also, that they are able to bring into (sic)  

businesspeople who otherwise would be shut out.   

          Also want to just mention that as an Economic 

35

Opportunity site, this is -- they did not have to be so far 

away from everybody else, but they chose a site that 

actually would be helpful with that kind of distancing.  And 

it made sense, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to 

visit this establishment, once the Planning Board gives it 

the okay.   

support.   

          I hope you'll do so, and thank you for your 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Quinton 

Zondervan, and will be followed by Kenneth Reeves.  Quinton 

Zondervan, you can unmute yourself and begin. 

          COUNCILLOR QUINTON ZONDERVAN:  Hi.  My name is 

Quinton Zondervan.  I live at 235 Carlos Medeiros Avenue. 

And, as you probably know, I am a City Councillor.   

          And I had the opportunity last term to work on the 

cannabis equity policy with our then Councillor Siddiqui, 

now our Mayor -- and we designed this policy from the very 

beginning to be explicitly antiracist, and to create 

opportunities for Economic Empowerment applicants in our 

city to start a cannabis retail business.   

          And so, I'm really excited about this proposal.  

It's a great team in a great location, right next to City

Hall -- in fact, just across the street.  And this is 

exactly the kind of application, kind of applicant that we 

were hoping for when we crafted the policy. 

          So I really support this team and this 

application, and I hope that the Planning Board can approve 

it speedily so that we can begin to see Economic Empowerment 

applicants open their stores in Cambridge and take advantage 

of the economic opportunities that we have created through 

this policy. 

me out, and thank you.   

          So thank you for hearing the case, and for hearing 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Kenneth Reeves, 

followed by a telephone participant.  The last digits are 

642, and we'll ask for your name when we get there.   

          Kenneth Reeves, you can begin by giving your name 

and address, please.       

          KENNETH REEVES:  Okay.  I'm Kenneth Reeves at 340 

Harvard Street.   

thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  We can hear you fine, 

          KENNETH REEVES:  You can?  Oh, great.  I'm here to 

support this application.  I'm really excited about it, for

both for the applicants and for the potential for community 

jobs.   

location. 

          And since I have spent a lot of my professional 

career looking at Central Square as a vibrant and kind of 

multifaceted place -- really the heart of Cambridge where 

four neighbors come together -- I think it's a very central 

          And I think with the inclusion of the changing 

artwork on this façade, I just think it fulfills the dreams 

for excitement in Central Square in terms of just having a 

streetscape that is welcoming to people. 

          Now, I have a different lens that I also would 

like to speak a little about, which is that you know, post 

the virus, none of us know how many businesses in our major 

squares will be returning.  And I have -- I'm not 

clairvoyant, but I have some belief that it's going to be 

          In Harvard Square, I was speaking with the 

Executive Director of the Business Association a week or 10 

days ago, and just mentioning that of perhaps in excess of 

400 members, only about 200 have reopened so far.  So causal 

shocking.

          So this is a good news story, that we have an 

applicant who would be ready to open, and open something 

that will bring something to the Square.  So I do think in 

the economic development sense and in the city development 

sense this is a good proposal.                

          The truth is, my greatest concern about Cambridge 

is that it has developed in ways that are not necessarily 

for the people who live in the city. And given who these 

applicants are and their roots in the city, I think this is 

some evidence that the city needn't develop for those who 

are coming, as opposed to those who have been here and grown 

up here.   

          So I won't say more.  I do think it's a strong 

proposal.  I know well the principles, and I believe in 

them.  I have this other hat, which is that of the President 

of the Cambridge branch of the NAACP, which is the country's 

oldest civil rights organization.   

          And last year in July I attended their convention 

in Detroit -- it was supposed to be in Boston this year, but 

had to be turned into a virtual convention, which will soon 

be coming -- but the point is their national platform 

committee presented a resolution requesting cities and towns 

39

and states to pay particular attention that as cannabis 

licenses are distributed, that they go to groups who have 

had in many instances some very great difficulties with 

cannabis and cannabis distribution. 

          So in keeping with that resolution, I can say that 

the NAACP of Cambridge looks favorable on the facts of this 

application, and hoping you will consider them positively.  

Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is a telephone 

participant, with the last digits 642.  You can unmute 

yourself by pushing *6 on your phone and begin by giving 

your name and address.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  *9.   

          SHAWNI LITTLEHALE:  Hello?  Hi.  Hi, good evening, 

Madam Chair and Planning Board.  Am I vibrating here?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We are hearing some feedback on 

your line.   

too.   

          SHAWNI LITTLEHALE:  Hold on.  I have the zoom on 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Like a radio station.   

          SHAWNI LITTLEHALE:  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  

I'll get off the Zoom.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, that's much better, thank you.   

          SHAWNI LITTLEHALE:  Okay, thank you.  Good 

evening, Madam Chair and Planning Board members, and all the 

participants this evening.   

          My name is Shawni Littlehale.  I'm one of the 

owners of the building at 759 Massachusetts Ave, where Mr. 

Moses and his team would like to open their GreenSoul 

Organics shop.  I am so impressed with their presentation 

this evening.  And I wholeheartedly support this endeavor.  

          In this time of business closing because of the 

pandemic, it's good to have a business that will be reliable 

and provide local artists and people in the community with 

the opportunity for Economic Empowerment. 

          So please consider favorably this proposal.  And 

that's all I have to say at this point.  Hello?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.   

          SHAWNI LITTLEHALE:  Oh!   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  Does the last speaker 

have more to say?  I don't believe that's the case.  You're 

still on mute, so if you want to say more, it's *6.  Okay.

          SHAWNI LITTLEHALE:  I am all set, but thank you 

for letting me participate in this presentation this 

evening.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker I'm 

sorry I didn't announce is James Steedle, and it's the last 

hand that's raised.  So that's before we start.  As a 

reminder, now is the time if you haven't spoken yet to push 

the "Raise hand" button or push *9 on your telephone.  James 

Steedle, you can unmute yourself and begin.         

          JAMES STEEDLE:  Thank you.  My name is James 

Steedle.  I'm a tenant in the building.  I'm in fact the 

President of Russell Scott Steedle and Capone Architects, 

and we are on the second floor, directly above this proposed 

project.  And I wanted to thank Taba and Richard for a great 

presentation.   

          My one concern is the queuing of people coming to 

the business.  Because right now Life Alive because of the 

COVID situation -- there's huge lines in front of the 

entrance to our building, and it could be even worse if 

people start lining up outside. 

          My one concern is that in the morning before you 

open, will the waiting area be available, or will people

have to queue up outside until the opening time? Because 

I've had experience with other facilities of that type, and 

people do show up ahead of time and wait for the opening.  

So I'm just wondering if they can address that issue.   

          And also, I was wondering why they're showing 

chairs and tables on the sidewalk as part of their 

presentation.  It doesn't seem like that would be an 

appropriate use of the sidewalk, since the use of these 

products is illegal to be used in public. 

          So if they could address those two issues, that 

would be great.  Thank you, and I'm look forward to 

welcoming them into the neighborhood.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So that is the last speaker.  

Again, I'll just give one last call. If anyone wants to 

speak and hasn't been heard, push the, "Raise hand" button 

or *9 on your phone.     

          [Pause] That appears to be all the speakers.  I'll 

turn it back over to the Chair at this point.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  We will now 

move from public comment to board discussion.  If this 

hearing is continued to a future date and additional 

information is received, there will be an opportunity for

public comment on the additional materials at that time.  

Additional written comments may also be submitted. 

          We've received memos on this application from the 

Community Development Department and Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation Department staff who are available.  So now I 

will ask the Board if there are questions for staff or the 

applicant.   

          And perhaps we can start with the questions about 

queuing and outdoor tables and chairs that were just posed 

by the last speaker, while other Board members collect their 

thoughts and decide whether they have questions. 

          Can someone from the applicant team address those 

questions? 

          WILLIAMIAM CHALFANT:  Hey, Rebecca, do you want to 

address that, or do you want me to talk about it?   

          REBECCA ADAMS:  Sure.  I can address the queuing. 

And I think that Will can probably address the tables and 

chairs located outside.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT: Okay.     

          REBECCA ADAMS:  If that's ok with you, Taba?     

          TABASURI MOSES:  That's fine.     

          REBECCA ADAMS:  Okay.  So we will not be able to

open the store until the hours of operation.  That is part 

of the Cannabis Control Commission.  So we are not allowed 

to let individuals into the facility until we are actually 

open.   

          We would like to hope that if for any reason 

people are lining up outside the facility, that we can talk 

with them to make sure that they're not forming lines.   

          Again, we do have an opening day plan which will 

be approved by the city of Cambridge and the Police 

Department, and we do hope that [the] majority of our 

customers will be using the online software system. 

          Will, will you be able to address the chairs and 

tables?  Sure.  So those were shown somewhat for context, as 

those are all existing along Mass Ave there.  And I think 

the thought was possibly folks who could not wait in line 

could sit there waiting.   

          But I don't think it would be a problem at all to 

remove those if the concern of the Board was that of public 

use or encouraging that.  So I don't believe GreenSoul will 

have any issue with moving those tables and chairs out 

there, if that was a concern of the Board.      

          REBECCA ADAMS:  And Will, correct me if I'm wrong,

but I do believe that in one of the meetings we had with the 

city they did suggest that, you know, we keep the cityscape 

and provide some area for people.  Because I believe there 

was a comment from someone on the Board that, you know, they 

would like the public to be able to have a bench to sit down 

on.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  Right, right.  Yeah, I mean as I 

said there's a lot of existing seating there between -- for 

the coffeehouse and I believe what used to be the -- oh, 

God, I'm blanking on the name of the Mexican eatery that was 

right there, but it's sort of becoming a place for people to 

sit, whether or not they're utilizing those shops or not.  

So that was the thinking.   

          But, again, I don't think there's any -- would be 

any issues if the Board felt those needed to be removed.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  Yeah.  So I think we'd like to 

work with the city, right?  And the Board to figure out the 

best use of the space as part of our lease.  We're 

responsible for maintaining the space.  So we want it to 

look good and coincide with how the storefront is.  But that 

being said, we want to work with the city and the community 

so that space is best utilized.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thank you so 

much.  All right.  Other Board member questions, either for 

the applicant or for staff on the memos we received?  You 

can use the "Raise hand" function or just start speaking 

with your name.     

          [Pause]             

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No questions from the 

Board?   

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Madam Chair?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  It's Tom Sieniewicz.  As was 

noted in the memo that we received from staff, this is the 

tenth application that we have reviewed --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- for cannabis retail in the 

City of Cambridge.  I would compliment the applicant, and 

I'm sure he's -- the group has taken lessons from previous 

applications, because this is a complete application, 

notwithstanding some of the inconsistencies which were 

pointed out in the memo relative to the numbers of people in 

the building, which I'm sure are typographic errors. 

          The application appears very complete to me.  I

don't have any questions, and that may be why you're hearing 

silence, the sounds of silence.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  And that's absolutely 

fine.  Given that I'm not seeing any -- oh, Lou has put his 

hand up.  So let's -- Lou, do you have a question?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I have a quick one on 

the numbers.  Are they comfortable with the numbers they 

provided -- 400 while they're controlled and 840 per day 

after?  I'd like them to go into a little bit of detail on 

how that works.  That's a lot of people right there.       

          REBECCA ADAMS:  Yes.  We can definitely delve into 

the numbers.  And I figured we would be.  So I'm glad 

someone brought it up.  So we took the least amount of 

customers that we thought would come into the store and the 

extreme maximum amount, which is the 840.   

          And what we did is we provided an example of 

during hopefully a 13-hour day, you know, the amount (sic) 

of customers as well as, you know, an average transaction 

time. 

          If we took the average transaction time of 10 

minutes per customer, that is actually a customer that would 

enter into the facility, browse around with a GreenSoul

Organics registered marijuana agent, versus someone that's 

coming into the facility to just pick up the order and then 

turn around and leave.   

          And so, that's why the number seems very high -- 

you know, 840.  You know, it's a pie-in-the-sky, "Gosh, we 

hope so" kind of number, but we wanted to make sure that we 

did calculate out, you know, that projected high volume 

number, to see what we could handle and what we couldn't 

handle.  And we can't handle any more than that, in reality.  

          PAUL TYRELL:  Rebecca, Paul Tyrell wanting to just 

help and add in that, like you said, these are very 

conservative numbers, the higher numbers.  But, like you 

said, we wanted to make sure that we could tackle every side 

or every issue that would be possible -- [1:36:10 audio cut 

out]  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, I think we're 

having a little bit of trouble hearing Mr. Tyrell, but the 

gist of the comment -- the projections on the high end of 

the numbers are kind of an extreme, you know.   

          For the business, perhaps the best case scenario; 

for the traffic, perhaps worst case scenario.  But everyone 

was looking at that extreme end to make sure that it could

be handled.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  Yes.  I think it's important.  

People are worried about line and other things, if I could 

just speak on that real quickly?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  It's important that we use the 

right technology, right?  Working with partners and people 

that have done this in California and that dealt with high 

numbers and have learned how to get people through, right?  

in a way that's convenient and that makes people want to 

come back to your store, right?  So they're not waiting a 

half-an-hour and they have a good experience.   

          So between our budtenders, our online orders and 

our staff members and the new technology with Dutchie, we 

will be able to service people.   

          And it's interesting.  You say 500 people is a 

lot, it's a lot.  I've done some research in Davis Square, 

and some of their stores they get 500 people a day, right?  

Life Alive -- I've done research -- Life Alive has had over 

1000 tickets a day sometimes, right?  So in that sense, if 

you look at it it's a high number.   

          But if you look at the coffee shops and the people

around us, people are getting 500 and 1000 people a day.  If 

we get 500 people a day and we can redirect them to other 

places in Central Square and say, "We're going to text you 

when your order's ready" hopefully we can bring more 

business to Central Square, right?  The Tavern -- places 

down the street, go to Dunk', go get a coffee as more shops 

open up, little boutiques, right?   

          So it's a way for us to also use our technology to 

help support the Square and bring business to other people.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Absolutely.  It's 

certainly something we have heard from other applicants as 

well.  All right.  So I'm not seeing any other questions 

from Board members, unless, Lou, you had a follow up?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, a quick one.  Will you 

require the use of the app after the initial opening time, 

or will you allow walk-ins?       

          REBECCA ADAMS:  We will absolutely allow walk-ins.  

Yep.  So we had anticipated, you know, that customers would 

be able to walk in off the street and/or use the app to 

online order.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So the walk-ins would tend

to add to the queuing problem, correct?       

          REBECCA ADAMS:  10 minutes.  10mi per customer.  

However, you know, that's why we also took the consideration 

of adding a separate door for exit, so that we would have 

additional space for queuing inside the facility.  Hope that 

answers your question.    

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It helps, but that leads to 

another question.  I see all the art walls in your queuing 

area.  It seems like it uses up a lot of real estate in 

directing the traffic around the walls.  As much as you can 

do to get more queuing space in the building seems more 

appropriate.     

          TABASURI MOSES:  Well, I can answer that real 

quick.  I've been doing construction maybe 15 years, I'm a 

GC.  I do small development in Cambridge, Boston.  With 

those art walls, those art walls would be mobile.  So you're 

talking about three inches.   

          So if you thought about a velvet rope that you had 

to create the line, you're taking up the same space, right?  

So it's an opportunity to use the same space to help support 

local artists without taking away what you would use if you 

just had a rope.

          If you look at the airport, they have the little 

piece that you can take off if you skip the line if you're 

in the airport.   

          But the actual bar, right, is three inches.  So if 

you take a 2 x 3 and you vertically put that up, you're 

still taking the three inches of space that would be taken 

away from the actual line anyway.       

          SPEAKER UNIDENTIFIED:  Taba, if I could just 

dovetail off that quickly.  I understand -- you know, I've 

done this before where --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sorry, who's 

speaking?  

Design, Architects.    

          WILLIAM CHALFANT: Sorry, Will Chalfant from Khalsa 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT: Sorry about that.  We've -- you 

know, we've heard this before about wanting to increase the 

queuing space in front of the store and I think it's a -- 

you know, a good point.   

          I think in this instance, you know, by the time 

you're done putting all the finish work and everything else 

inside the space, we're only really left with about 500

square feet of retail space.  So if we shrink that a whole 

lot more, I think it's going to negatively affect the 

ability of the business to succeed. 

          So while I understand it, and -- I just think 

we're really trying to -- we're trying to make everyone 

happy, and this is our best approach here.          

          REBECCA ADAMS:  And I think, Lou, to your point, 

you know, maybe we can move the artwork to the side of the 

walls.  You know, we can -- we could definitely -- because 

Taba said that it is, you know, a modular.   

          You know, if you feel that, you know, it would 

make more sense for us to move those art walls -- you know, 

maybe to the sides, so that we can put additional customers 

in that space, that's definitely something that we can look 

into.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I see Ted 

Cohen also has a question.  Ted?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, well, first let me follow 

up on the queuing issue, which personally I think has become 

a red herring in all of these hearings.  We talk about it so 

often, but there are so many other businesses in the city of 

Cambridge where people are queuing out on the streets and no

one seems to complain about it, and no one seems to have an 

issue with it.   

          I think, you know, that this is an issue we've 

spent enough time on, and that the businesses will either 

succeed or fail, based upon what type of experience the 

customers have.   

          Having said that, I want to congratulate the 

proponents for the most attractive presentation -- the most 

artistic presentation -- I think I've seen in all my years 

on the Planning Board.  I really enjoyed it. 

          One of the criteria we have to determine is what 

sort of programs the facility will have for patients seeking 

services for medical marijuana use?  And I didn't see any 

reference to that in the documents?   

          I believe there was a reference that you were not 

going to seek a medical marijuana license.  So if you could 

explain what facilities or what you will be doing for the 

medical marijuana users?   

          And then I'd also be curious what my colleagues 

have to say about CDD's comments in its memo with regard to 

the storefront changing the black to aluminum I guess, or 

stainless steel; and also, with regard to the painting of 

55

the wooden panels on the side.       

          REBECCA ADAMS:  I can address the medical 

marijuana question.  Unfortunately, we are not applying for 

a medical marijuana retail license.  However, Revolutionary 

Clinics is located at 541 Massachusetts Ave.   

          So we will obviously try to assist a medical 

patient.  If we have products that, you know, can help them, 

we welcome recreational marijuana customers. 

          And, you know, we can definitely direct them, 

obviously, to Revolutionary Clinics as well.  But we welcome 

medical patients as well into the retail space.   

          And I just wanted to clarify on one quick thing.  

I know you're asking the other Planning Board members for 

input.  In our revised application, I just want to note we 

did take into consideration the Historical Committee, their 

recommendation to not paint those two side panels, and to 

keep them as is.  And so, that is part of the new design.  

So we will not be painting those, just for the record.  

Thank you.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT: And as far as -- and this is 

Will from Khalsa Design.  As far as the black storefront 

system, we'd be happy to go with brushed aluminum, if that 

56

pleases the Board just to match the other storefronts 

adjacent to it.  I don't think that's an issue anymore.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.   

          ATTORNEY JOE HANLEY:  Madam Chair, just to cap 

this -- it's Attorney Joe Hanley with Attorney Tom Miller as 

well.  So you'll see in the application that we appeared and 

obtained a Certificate of Appropriateness from the 

Historical Commission for that storefront, which Will and 

Rebecca were speaking about, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Okay, 

this provides a good transition to more general Board 

discussion.  Ted, since you have queued up at least a couple 

architectural features you'd like other Board members to 

comment on, why don't we get any other comments you have now 

first?     

comments.    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Actually, I have no other 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  That's great.  

And I will go -- Hugh, why don't you chime in next?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  Can you hear me?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I'm impressed by the application

and the applicants, but there seem to be a couple of 

significant dimensional issues.  The proposal is to have a 

van deliver into the service area behind the building.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I went out there a couple days ago 

and measured that there's eight feet four inches in width 

between the dumpsters and the bars on the wall that protect 

the wall from vehicles.  I went online a few minutes ago and 

found that the typical transit van is seven feet wide.   

          So that means if you drive right into the middle 

of the space, there's eight inches of space between the van 

and the obstruction, and I don't think you can open the door 

or do a delivery in that kind of spacing.   

          So I think we have to -- we have to view this as 

an unworkable proposal.  And perhaps that's just as well, 

because there are residences on the thirty-fourth floor of 

the building.  And having early morning delivers or late at 

night deliveries right under people's windows is not 

probably the best thing. 

          I should say that I'm familiar with the building, 

because my last office is in the building.  I worked in the 

building for about two years before I retired.

          The other problem is that the proposed store is 

not handicapped accessible.  And I'm wondering if we can 

make the finding that site design provides convenient, safe 

and secure access and egress for clients and employees if 

people in wheelchairs can't get in. 

          So I took some more measurements.  The floor of 

the shop is five inches above the sidewalk.  And there is a 

sloped concrete ramp that goes from the existing door out on 

the plan that we have now in front of us.  It's 54 inches 

long.  The slope of the ramp is 9 percent -- that's in 

excess of what's permitted by the access code. 

          Now the new indoor has a ramp that goes about 

halfway up.  And then there's a step a couple of inches up 

into the building.  You can actually see it on the front 

elevation.  There's like a thin, white line under the door.  

So that's not workable.   

          Thirdly, the maze for the queuing isn't wheelchair 

accessible, doesn't have the proper dimensions to get a 

wheelchair through.   

          So this is a problem that needs to be solved.  So 

those are my two comments.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT: Hugh, if I could respond, this

is Will Chalfant from Khalsa Design.  The exit door -- both 

those doors are going to have to have automatic openers in 

order to provide adequate access.  It is a 48-inch wide 

access path.  That is the same as the queuing route.  That 

is 48 inches, which is ADA compliant.   

          I understand the concerns over the slope.  I 

agree, 8.3 percent is the max we're allowed to go with 

there.  We are not exceeding the threshold in order to bring 

the entire project up to accessible standards, as far as the 

percentage.  We doing our best in that.   

          If we need to -- the intention is of the indoor.  

I think that the elevation is a little confusing -- I think 

that's an artistic issue as far as that white line you're 

referencing.  The intention is not to have any step.  That 

is a threshold max of three-quarters of an inch there to get 

in and out.  If we need to work with --  

          PAUL TYRELL:  Will, if I could join in -- if I 

could join in as well, this is Paul Tyrell?     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT: Sure, Paul.   

          PAUL TYRELL:  I'm really glad that the question 

was raised, and it's a compliment to the team, because we 

just did our Planning session two days ago discussed both of

these elements.   

          And Rebecca did note during her presentation that 

working around the dumpsters is going to be a requirement of 

the delivery.  Those dumpsters are movable, and they are not 

going to be a hindrance to the van delivery.  The van is 

very small.  So we were well aware of the observations you 

made, they are wonderful ones, and we appreciate them. 

          Handicapped accessibility is a building code 

issue, and the parking in the back will be organized with 

the dumpster cans that exist and the deliveries will be 

coordinated to make sure that there's plenty of space.  

Thank you.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT: To just to finish up, if we need 

to create a depression within the space to accommodate that 

entrance door for a ramp, we will do so.  But the full 

intention is for this to be fully accessible.  I appreciate 

the concerns.  But I mean obviously these will be building 

code issues that we need to address prior to obtaining a 

building permit, but we are cognizant.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So the -- so you have approval from 

the Historic Commission of a design which if you're going to 

make it accessible, will have to change a little bit -- a

few inches?     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT:  Yes, yes, very minor.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Well, the last building I designed 

had a bunch of retail stores in a building that was built 

five years after this one.  And it was incredibly difficult 

to make those grades work out and become fully compliant.  

And I just don't think you're facing up to the amount of 

difficulty.   

          You're basically going to have to -- I think -- 

take out the first 12 feet of the store, drop everything 

down to sidewalk level, create interior ramps that 

accomplish that, and those ramps have to meet the width 

standards and the turning standards.   

          And I don't think -- once you do that, you're 

going to have a lot of queuing space left.  And once you do 

that, it also changes the design.  It has to go back to the 

Historic Commission.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT:  Well, I don't believe that it 

will change the exterior much.  I agree with you that it 

would require some work on the inside, but I -- I mean our 

intention is to really take a very fine brush to the 

exterior and not touch as much as we can.

          I completely understand where you're coming from 

and appreciate the -- you know, you noting this.  It's 

something we're going to have to address.   

          But again, our intention is really not to touch 

that exterior more than putting a new storefront in and 

obviously providing accessibility.  But we don't feel that 

aesthetically it's going to alter much from what we're 

presenting tonight.                 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, well, I must say that makes 

me even more concerned, because you don't understand that 

it's a difficult problem.  It's a significant change to make 

the storefront five inches taller to have it have a 

different relationship than this to the adjacent properties.  

          You know, you can try to gloss over this, but it's 

a real issue.  This is a very important historic building, 

and I think you can't just pretend this problem doesn't 

exist, you've got to solve it.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT:  Well, respectfully, I'm not 

pretending that it doesn't exist, I do plan on addressing 

it.  I simply am trying to let you know that our intention 

is not to touch the exterior of this building as much as 

possible.  And if we have to go back before Historic, then

that is the route we will take.  But that is what we're 

trying to avoid.        

          REBECCA ADAMS:  Right.  And please keep in mind, 

you know, we didn't -- we do not have full set of drawings 

here.  You know, this is a proposed plan, a proposed 

project.  And we plan on working with the city of Cambridge 

-- every department -- to make sure that this project works.   

          And if for any reason, you know, God forbid, we 

came across something and it didn't, then -- you know, 

obviously, we're realistic and we are willing to work with 

the city in each department to make sure that the project 

works for everyone.     

          WILLIAM CHALFANT:  And Hugh, I've recently just 

dealt with this at 212 Hampshire, the former Riles night 

jazz club, which we've refurbished into its former glory.  

And there was an issue there with existing grades and the 

floor.  And we've handled that with internal grants.   

          So we are familiar with the process and the 

challenges that it presents.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh, did you 

have any other questions or comments you wanted to make on 

the plan?

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Nope.  That's it.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary, why 

don't we turn to you?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, I want to thank the proponents 

for a really excellent presentation.  It was very well put 

together.  I think it was Ted who said it was probably the 

most artistic we've seen.  And it certainly was colorful.   

          I think you have a great team.  I have the same 

concerns that Hugh has mentioned, particularly with the rear 

entrance.  But I think both of the staff memos -- the CDD 

memo and the one from Traffic, Parking and Transportation -- 

call for the proponent to continue to do additional work on 

those issues that we've just been discussing.   

          So our usual procedure is to wrap those into the 

special permit findings.  So I think we can rest assured 

that there will be ongoing dialogue.  And if the problems 

can't be solved to the satisfaction of staff, then they'll 

come back either to us or to historic, or whoever is the 

appropriate party.   

          I also want to thank the proponent very much for 

responding to the church so quickly, and to changing those 

hours on Sunday.  I know that it's not always an easy thing 

65

to change your business plan, but it shows that you're very 

responsive to the community, as does the rest of your 

presentation.  So I really appreciate that as well. 

          I like the artwork very much -- the fact that 

those panels are moveable I think gives you some 

flexibility.  It looked really nice the way it was set up.  

But, you know, again, it's flexible.  But I think working 

with that group is going to make your storefront very, very 

interesting. 

          So I don't have a lot of concerns.  I mean, the 

queuing is always a concern in general.  But I think, again, 

that's something that will get worked on over time.  And as 

far as the tables outside, I think it's one of those things 

you just have to monitor it -- you know, both yourselves and 

the city.   

          And if -- you know, hopefully it will work out an 

be a place where people can just, you know, sit for a few 

minutes maybe before they go into the store.   

          But if we do find that there's loitering or, you 

know, violations of the law, then -- you know maybe, we'll 

have to reconsider and take them out.  But I think right now 

they're important for the streetscape.  So I would be

inclined to leave them in. 

          In terms of the aluminum versus the black, I could 

go either way.  I happen to love black.  I think I've said 

that before.  So, you know, that would always kind of be my 

first preference, but I understand the need to sort of keep 

the continuity with the storefronts as well. 

          So great job.  I wish you a lot of luck with your 

business, and I'm in support of the project.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve, why 

don't we turn to you next?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Hi.  I guess I always have an 

unusual approach to these things.  I've been around long 

enough, as many of the other members have been, to see 

marijuana transition from being vilified by society and by 

government, and it's now transitioned to the other extreme 

as somehow being glorified.  And, yeah, I think both 

extremes are inappropriate.   

          I've mentioned before that these new marijuana 

dispensaries should be treated more or less like in any 

other retail establishment.  And that's really the per 

verbal skills that I take.   

          And looking at it from that perspective, I have

very few comments.  The interiors are nice, but I don't 

think that we should be terribly interested or concerned 

with the interiors. 

          I basically have no criticisms.  I don't feel the 

need to micromanage the designs, I think it'll be a fine 

addition to Central Square, as any new retail establishment 

would be.  So I really have no further comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, any 

comments to share on this one?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Aluminum or black, I think 

either is good.  But I think the aluminum will make some 

continuity.   

          And I can't walk away from the problem I think is 

going to occur in the queuing area.   

          Just looking at it, it doesn't help with 

activating the street front.  You're only going to see 

probably one person, if the queue is full.  It just seems to 

congested.  I think there's going to be a problem.  But 

we'll let that go as it may.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Notwithstanding Hugh's careful 

observation, I did not [2:02:53 audio unclear] appreciate

his bravery going out in a pandemic with a tape measure, and 

that's public service at another level. 

          I stand by my comments before -- it's a complete 

application, so I concur with Mr. Cohen that it should be -- 

that cases increasingly seem like relatively routine retail 

establishments.   

          As far as the mullion color, I don't know what the 

public interest is, but if the clear aluminum matches the 

existing building -- works contextually, then I would be in 

support of that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Just double 

checking my list here, to make sure I didn't miss any Board 

members.  Looks like I've got everyone in attendance.  All 

right.   

          So then I think -- it sounds to me like the Board 

is prepared to take action on this item, and that there is 

at least a majority who would be prepared to grant the 

special permit with conditions after making findings.   

          And I'll just quickly run through the findings and 

make sure that folks concur with them, but I'll do them -- 

I'll read them quickly all at once, and then get everybody -

- see if we have -- if I've missed anything.  So again for a

cannabis special permit:  

          Site design provides convenient, safe and secure 

access and egress for clients and employees arriving to and 

leaving from the site, using all modes of transportation.   

          Location and design of the use will not detract 

from the sense of activity, with an open and unwelcoming 

façade.  

          Loading refuse and service areas are designed to 

be secure and shielded from abutting uses.   

          Building and site are designed to be compatible 

with other buildings in the area, and to mitigate any 

negative aesthetic impacts that might result from required 

security measures.    

          And the facility will provide programs to assist 

qualified patients in obtaining services under the 

Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana program.   

          So I believe I've heard that we can make those 

findings, and before I ask for a motion on that, just I'm 

looking to see -- Board members -- if there's general 

agreement on that?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Let me put it another 

70

way, to make it easier for the record.  Is there any 

objection to making those findings?       

          COLLECTIVE:  No.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So then 

do I have a motion to grant the requested special permit 

with the conditions mentioned in the memos?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  To the Chair, before there's a 

motion I just wanted to cover the conditions a little bit.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I've been -- we haven't had a 

chance to discuss, but aside from the conditions that are 

laid out, I've been advised that there may be some 

clarification on conditions on the Traffic and Parking --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh!  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- memo.  So I'm going to ask is 

Adam Shulman present, and are you ready to speak to that?   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  I'm -- hi Jeff.  This is Adam 

Shulman from Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department.  I am present, and I can hear you.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  So Adam, do 

you want to walk us through any clarifications on the 

conditions listed in the Traffic and Parking memo?

          ADAM SHULMAN:  So I don't know if there's much 

clarifications to be made.  I will say -- first, I do 

actually, since I have a moment to talk here, I do want to 

just also compliment the applicant for their presentation.  

I thought it was very, very good.   

          And regarding the queuing concerns and things 

which are coming from many of these projects, I've talked a 

lot with Rebecca and the team.   

          And I'm pretty convinced that they're going to 

certainly do everything they can to sort of avoid any 

negative transportation impacts, using every measure -- 

every tool that they can. 

          So I'm less concerned about that becoming an 

issue. 

          And then I think regarding Jeff's point, so I did 

hear recently there's about -- a question about the notion 

of the -- in terms of the transportation conditions 

recommended in the Traffic Department memo, there is the 

common request for a $35,000 contribution to pay half at 

building permit, half at occupancy permit.   

          And so, I did hear recently that there's been 

raised concerns about -- you know, it's hard to know when 

72

this project might come online, and it's hard to know 

because of the economic impact of things like the COVID 

crisis and so forth, that there's a concern about that 

funding, and any flexibility to sort of accommodate that. 

          And so, I think the notion is potentially instead 

of paying half a building permit, maybe it's waiting six 

months for some type of flexibility, just to make sure that 

that's -- you know, not going to get in the way of making 

that a successful project.  And that's something that the 

traffic Department is very comfortable with for sure. 

          So I think that might be what Jeff was alluding 

to, and he could correct me if I'm wrong.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I was hoping you could correct me, 

but the -- what I had understood is that there was a request 

to modify -- and the applicant can verify this too -- there 

is a request to modify the timing of that payment so that it 

would come six months after the initial opening of the 

establishment.   

          Is that -- can somebody on the applicant team 

confirm whether that's agreed to?   

          RICHARD HARDING:  Yes [-- Richard Harding --] I 

can agree to it.  So yes, so we've been -- as you all know -

- affected by COVID.  Our business plan and -- you know, all 

of the things that have happened, you know, kind of stopped 

in our world.   

          So we just were asking for some flexibility that 

we could work with Traffic and Parking, understanding that 

the fee would be paid, but just working with them for some 

flexibility in either installments or six months after we 

were open. 

          I'm looking forward to -- and I know he's not on 

today, but talking with a representative from Traffic and 

Parking just to make sure that we can come to some accord on 

that understanding.   

          But I'm grateful for the flexibility, and I think 

that it'll help GreenSoul get off on the right foot, as we 

will give back to the community through the Traffic and 

Parking donation.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Okay.  So 

then, it sounds to me, Jeff, that as opposed to adopting the 

condition as it is written in the staff memo, the 

recommendation -- and Adam, please also chime in if I get 

this wrong -- is that the applicant is willing to make the 

contribution and on a schedule to be worked out with Traffic

and Parking, but paid in full no later than six months after 

opening.  Is that correct?   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  That's my understanding.  I think 

that's what I said?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.  I've just --  

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Maybe Jeff heard something 

different, but definitely we're open to being flexible on 

this, absolutely.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you.  

All right.  So with that change, then I think we are looking 

to -- other than that, we're adopting the conditions as laid 

out in the memos from Traffic and Parking and Community 

Development, and looking to grant the special permit with 

those conditions, making the findings that I earlier read, 

and there was no objection to making those findings.   

          Do I have a motion?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Madam Chair?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, sir.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  In virtually all of the other 

applications, we've required a reservation only period at 

the start.  Are we doing that in this case, or are we giving 

them a pass on that requirement?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That has typically 

been something we have either -- has been worked out in 

their Operations plan.  In some cases, I think you're right, 

Hugh, that we have specifically required it.  But Rebecca, 

is that something that you have in your plans, or would 

object to as requiring for an initial period?       

          REBECCA ADAMS:  Yes.  So in our application, we 

requested that we are not appointment-only to begin with.  

We do feel confident using the Dutchie software system, you 

know, to mitigate any queuing in lines.  Obviously, you 

know, we'll work with the Planning Board, but we are 

requesting to not have appointment-only.   

          We do feel that we would be able to have customers 

come in and out of the facility faster with the Dutchie 

system, versus appointment-only.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.    

          RICHARD(MOKEY)HARDING:  Madam Chairwoman, just if 

I may on this really quickly?  Richard Harding?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.    

          RICHARD(MOKEY)HARDING:  Yeah, so also -- and 

Rebecca was there, but Dutchie's is the best technology out 

there, the standard -- you know, platinum service.

          But also, we have met with commissioner Bard some 

time ago, who also - we sort of asked this question, and he 

assured us that we could work with him if necessary, for 

detail offices early on.   

          So I think we're confident that we at least have 

the right contingency plans in place, should we have lines 

that are unmanageable.   

          Also, we think that with all the activity in the 

Square around cannabis, I don't think that this will be a 

Brookline situation at all.  I think that this will -- as 

one of the Board members said -- be much more like a normal 

business than we would think.  But we are prepared to take 

whatever necessary mitigating steps to make sure that the 

lines are manageable.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Do Board 

members have any questions on that issue in particular?   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, Madam Chair this is Steven 

Cohen.  I seem to recall in one or more of the earlier 

applications that we discussed this subject, and then we had 

a reviewer, a six-month review on the subject, and that if 

there were problematic queuing and lines in the sidewalks, 

that adjustments might have to be made in operationals.

21

22

          Do you recall it that way?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I believe we've done 

a variety of things on this; everything from requiring an 

appointment-only system until it is determined by the city 

that it is no longer required, to having it required for a 

six-month minimum period and then reviewed, to having it be 

okay to implement as needed.  But the needed would be worked 

out in coordination with Traffic and Parking. 

          So, frankly, I think as is appropriate, given the 

variety of locations that we have reviewed these sites at, 

we've done a variety of different things with regard to 

appointment-only, but I do not specifically recall what the 

other Central Square locations' requirements were.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah.  Just as an aside, it's a 

shame that we don't have consistency on that.  But it does 

seem there should be some sort of mechanism -- some sort of 

failsafe, just in case there is a problem.   

          And maybe it's not a failsafe mechanism that we 

exercise, but that we want the city agencies or Traffic and 

Parking be asked to review at an inappropriate period. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  To the Chair --  this is Jeff 

Roberts -- if I could jump in, I just would, this is

reiterating some of what you said, but I think the 

consistency in the special permit conditions throughout all 

of these cannabis retail stores has been the requirement for 

an Operations plan to be submitted and reviewed by Traffic 

and Parking and by the Police Department, and also, to have 

an ongoing monitoring program --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- to review ongoing operations.  

So that has been the case with all of the locations.  There 

have been some cases where additional kind of requirements 

for appointment-only have been put in place when there was 

particular concerns about sidewalk space or other areas of 

potential concern.   

          But this proposal, like any other one, if it 

includes the conditions in the special permit, would be 

subject to continuing review by Traffic and Parking and the 

Police Department in terms of its operations. 

          Ras also other -- you know, regulatory elements to 

cannabis retail stores.  There's the -- there's the local 

permit, there's the host community agreement, there's state 

licensing.  So there's really other jurisdictions where 

these kinds of issues can be reviewed.   

79

          [Simultaneous speech]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Please, I have a 

whole bunch of folks who are wanting to be heard on this 

matter.  If people can use the "Raise hand" button given 

that's the case, that'll help me make sure I'm getting 

everyone a chance to ask questions or give comments here.   

          Jeff, you want to continue, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  If I still have the floor, I'll 

turn it over to Swaathi Joseph, who maybe is correcting or 

supplementing some of what I said.           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Jeff, I apologize for 

interrupting.  Because I'm sharing the screen, I don't have 

the provision to raise my hand.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  I just wanted to point out that 

in the initial application materials they had provided, it 

did mention six months initially appointment-only service.  

So it might be helpful to check with the applicant's team if 

this is a change from that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Swaathi.  

So yeah, Rebecca, why don't we get a clarification on that.       

          REBECCA ADAMS:  I'm so sorry, I don't know how to

raise my hand electronically.  So I apologize.  I went old 

school on you.   

          Yes, it is a change from our initial Planning 

Board special permit application, and we had had proposed 

that we work very closely with the Chief of Police as well 

as Adam in the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department to ensure that there aren't any issues upon 

opening. 

          And so, again, we have done a lot of research on 

the Dutchie system.  I spoke with someone directly from the 

company, as well as other operators in the state of 

Massachusetts and the speed and accuracy is much faster for 

customers to be able to enter into the facility again -- 

pick up their product, and then exit the facility. 

          And so, appointment-only, it is a good idea, and a 

lot of municipalities do it. I feel extremely confident that 

we will be able to manage people in the process.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?  You have 

your hand up.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yep, excuse me.  I think 

there needs to be at least a minimum of some sort of 

appointment-only.  Why have to put out a fire?  Why not

prevent t fire from starting?  This is a pretty congested 

sidewalk in front of this coffee shop.  There are benches 

there existing already.  I believe the bus stop is very 

close by.   

          I think we need a little bit of protection.  I 

don't know if it's six months or three months, but 

considering they will allow walk-ins, this is a dangerous 

precedent.  There could be 50 people out there in the 

morning before they open.   

          I'm not comfortable without some at least 

preliminary appointment-only.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other Board 

members have comments?  Adam, did you have something else 

you wanted to add?   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Well, I was just going to reiterate 

what Jeff I think did a good job explaining and just 

reminding the Board that what he said is absolutely right.  

          The consistency that we've had for all of these 

retail cannabis stores is that they all need to do an 

operations plant that needs to be approved by the Traffic 

Department and Police Department.   

          And yes, I do believe some voluntarily proposed

appointment-only.  Some didn't.  Some the Board specifically 

was concerned and asked for it.   

          I think what I would say is that it's a moving 

target.  We still don't know exactly when the stores will 

open, which one will be the first one to open, how many 

might open at the same time?   

          These kinds of things are still -- we're kind of 

trying to all look in a crystal ball to figure out what 

might happen. 

made sense.   

          And when they do open, how many might already be 

up and running elsewhere in the region and stuff.  So the 

notion initially was -- you know, appointment-only.  And it 

          I think there is a little bit of a -- you know, 

change going on, as more and more open up.  And that seems 

to be less of a concern, but still a concern -- and also, I 

think in terms of other technologies besides appointment-

only, and that is things where people can get sort of, like, 

a restaurant.  Maybe you go and you get a beeper, and then 

you can go shop around in the area, and then it beeps when 

you can come in, and so forth.   

          So that's another major way to control people 

having to queue up and line up sort of these technology 

83

          And I think it's in the interest of any of these 

stores to not have long lines for their own purposes of 

making sure their customers are comfortable and come back.  

And I think the applicant talked a little about that as 

          So I think there's flexibility, and there's 

control either Traffic Department, by the Police Department, 

by the applicant themselves, by how they manage their 

queuing area, by how they manage their -- you know, systems, 

ways.   

well. 

I think. 

          So, you know, I just would say from the Traffic 

Department's point of view, we'll certainly do anything and 

everything we can at the appropriate time when any of these 

stores come forward to work closely with the applicant, 

closely with the police, and just make sure the issues are 

not -- you know, significant.   

          And I think if there is an issue, you know, and 

I'm certainly mindful of what one of the public speakers 

said who lives in the building about -- also concerns about 

queuing people inside.  And I think it's just going to be

addressed pretty quickly.   

          And we're seeing, for instance with this 

applicant, that they're very, very amenable to working with 

the city and their neighbors, and just making sure that 

whatever happens is not going to be a problem.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted, you do 

comments?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, yes.  Well, I think we do 

need to have some sort of consistency amongst all of the 

licenses, special permits we're granting.   

          And a question for Adam:  Do you feel that if we 

say nothing about appointment-only, that Traffic and Parking 

can insist upon an appointment-only time period in the 

Operations Procedure plan?   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  So I don't know if we want to have 

to even make the decision one way or the other.  I think 

what we want to do is come up with a plan that is 

appropriate for that site at the time that that site's 

opening up.  So, you know, I don't think --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think, Adam --  

          ADAM SHULMAN:  -- I don't think we'll have a 

problem saying what we think is necessary to make sure that

Operations plan is going to be successful.   

          I don't think we'll have a problem saying if we 

take appointment-only -- if what we learn is appointment-

only is just critical, then we're not going to have a 

problem saying that.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  If I could continue, I 

mean I'm willing to concede that the Dutchie system may be 

fabulous and may work completely, but I agree with Lou that 

they're talk about having walk-ins in addition to the 

Dutchie system, and so there might be a problem until 

everything gets worked out.   

          And I'm comfortable with going with the standard 

language that has been used about the Operations Plan that 

has to be reviewed by Traffic and Parking and the Police 

Department, but I guess I might suggest that we put in that 

standard language that the plan -- you know, could require 

an appointment-only period, and then leave it up to Traffic 

and Parking and the Police Department to determine -- you 

know, it may be they don't start out with it, but after a 

month or a couple of weeks they decide, "We really need to 

do something else," they would have the inherent power to do 

it.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Are there other Board 

members who want to comment on this?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, this is Mary.  I don't 

think it hurts to add it, as Ted said.  I think, you know, 

if the idea is to be sure that the permit language regarding 

the Operations Plan is as inclusive as we need it to be, so 

that we're comfortable that Traffic and Parking does have 

all of the ability to use these various techniques or 

require these techniques -- you know, I think yeah, it's 

just -- it's one tool.   

          So I don't have a problem with adding it to the 

list.  I don't think we need to require it as part of the 

special permit.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, you did 

want to speak again?  Yep.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Just a quick one, if anybody 

knows this -- and I'm sure someone in the room or wherever 

we are knows this -- how many have actually -- how many of 

these either medical or adult-use businesses opened in 

Cambridge?   

          I can never seem to get an accurate number, and 

that's kind of going to be a determining factor for me.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, we don't have 

any adult-use.  That number we know accurately right now.  

We have not yet had one of those open.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And to the Chair -- this is Jeff 

Roberts again -- just I was looking back at some old records 

on this while the discussion was going on, there have -- so 

you're correct, there has not been any adult-use or 

nonmedical establishments that are open.   

          We only have medical cannabis establishments at 

this point.  This is, as Tom pointed out, the tenth 

application for adult use. 

          I did look at the other three adult-use special 

permits that were approved by the Planning Board in Central 

Square, and they have the standard language for the Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation Department, along with the Police 

Department, to have an Operations Plan in place.   

          They don't have a specific period of time -- a 

specific six-month or three-month or any period of time for 

appointment-only.   

          But if my recollection is correct, they have -- 

those other establishments did similarly implement -- have 

an online system to do ordering and to sort of have a

queless entry system.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I definitely 

recall the kind of -- the -- you know, light up, vibrating 

coaster concept was mentioned by more than one of them, so, 

you know, I personally think that the language to let the 

Operations Plan be worked out with Traffic and Parking and 

Police is sufficient.   

          I have no problem with adding a specific mention 

of including, if necessary, a reservation-only period, as 

determined by Traffic and Parking.  But, you know, I think 

it sounds like in this location it may not be necessary or 

certainly not consistent with their neighbors if we were to 

do that.    

electronically?       

          Rebecca, figured out how to raise your hand 

          REBECCA ADAMS:  I did.  I'm so excited.  I'm sorry 

that I used you guys as my guinea pig on that?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's okay.       

          REBECCA ADAMS:  I just wanted to add something 

very quickly just for the Board to know.  I just helped open 

the first dispensary in Rockland, Massachusetts, and we were 

extremely diligent, as we will be in the city of Cambridge,

to work with the Police Department.  And, you know, you 

didn't see them on the news, they weren’t lines outside, and 

that was a big concern with the town of Rockland.   

          We did what we call a, "soft opening," so 

therefore we could work out all the kinks -- because there 

are always kinks -- ahead of time.  And to make sure that we 

figured out -- you know, how the traffic flow was going to 

come into the space -- you know, which is a little 

different, obviously than the city.   

          However, you know, it went off without a hitch.  

And, you know, we made sure that our Operational Plan was 

reviewed by the town and the Police Department.   

          And so, I do hope that helps reassure the Board 

that, you know, we will do everything in our power to make 

sure that, you know, there's no detrimental effect.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All 

right.  So I'm going to ask is there an objection to 

including the language -- the standard language regarding 

Operational Plans with the specific mention that it may 

include at Traffic and Parking's discretion a reservation 

only period as necessary?   

          Any Board members object to that language?

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, great.  Ted, 

thank you for kind of coming up with that solution.  So now 

that we've discussed that, unless -- Jeff am I missing 

anything else we need to go over before I entertain a 

motion?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No, nothing that I can think of.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Then, I would like a motion to grant the special permit with 

the conditions listed in the memo, as amended by tonight's 

discussion after making the findings that we went over 

earlier that the proposal conforms to the applicable 

criteria in the zoning ordinance.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steven Cohen, so moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mary Flynn, second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Roll call vote?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On granting the requested special 

permit, Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm assuming the conditions in 

91

the CDD memo were also included, but yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, I had mentioned 

both memos, but yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Continuing with the roll call, 

Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Mary Flynn?   

          [Pause]      

          Mary Flynn, I didn't hear your vote.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Sorry, yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Present.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Catherine Preston Connolly?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's six votes in favor and one 

member voting present.              

          [SIX VOTE IN FAVOR, ONE VOTE PRESENT]               

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We have 

been at this for two hours.  Do Board members want to take a 

brief break before we go onto the next item on our agenda, 

or keep rolling?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  five minutes?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Five minutes it is.  

So I'll give you six.  We'll be back at 8:40.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, good.  So we are 

all back.  Wonderful.  So we will  move onto the next item 

on the agenda, which is a public hearing on a zoning 

petition by the City Council to amend the green building 

requirements in Section 22.20, by requiring the submission 

of a plan that uses alternative and renewable energy sources

and an analysis of the feasibility and cost of installing 

such a system, compared with a fossil-fueled energy system 

for city and public review. 

          And again, we'll start with CDD staff summarizing 

why this is before us at this time.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  This is Jeff Roberts 

once again.  This is a zoning petition referred by the City 

Council to the Planning Board and Ordinance Committee back 

in June, and the Ordinance Committee will hold its public 

hearing on August 26. 

          The Planning Board's action with zoning petitions 

is to make an advisory recommendation to the Council.  The 

CDD staff provided a memo with some background information 

on the section of the zoning that's proposed to be amended.  

That's all for me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you, Jeff.  The presenter on this is City Councillor Dennis 

Carlone, who I note, Jeff, is in the Attendees section of 

the webinar here.  He's the lead sponsor of the petition.  

Can you unmute him, so that he can give us some background 

on this petition?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I apologize.  I'm just correcting

that now --    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Gotcha.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- and making sure that Councillor 

Dennis Carlone is in the meeting and able to turn on his 

audio and his video at this point.  Can you please confirm 

that you're able to do that?        

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Yes, I'm actually in 

the meeting, and thank you for doing that, Jeff.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  

Councillor Carlone, the floor is yours.          

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Thank you, Madam Chair 

and members of the Planning Board.  I want to open up my 

comments by saying that the memo I received from Community 

Development on August 13 shed a broader light on what the 

city is doing.  And prior to that, I had put this proposal 

together.   

fossil fuels.   

          As you all know, costs for different forms of 

clean energy are equal -- in some cases even less than 

          And as you know -- you've helped it with City 

Staff -- Cambridge has set a building standard for utilizing

clean energy in their non-zero buildings to minimize adverse 

environmental impacts, and as examples for private industry 

and for all public facilities designed to replicate. 

          And it is of utmost importance that new and 

renovated projects seriously explore the environmental and 

likely cost advantages of using alternative and renewable 

energy resources during their design development. 

          So what we have done is just add a simple 

paragraph, and I'm going to alter it a little bit based on 

the memo that Community Development did.  They said 

alternatives should not be in this -- the word, 

"alternative" should not be in, that's fine with me. 

          "A plan shall be -- " this is part of the green 

buildings requirements and of the adding number (sic) d) and 

replace of d), and would be inserted within existing 

language, which wouldn't change.   

          And d) would say, "A plan shall be submitted to 

Community Development and Inspectional Services Department 

that uses renewable energy sources and an analysis of the 

feasibility and the cost of installing such a system 

compared with the fossil fuel energy system for city and 

public review."

          This would not require anybody or mandate any 

developer to use that system.  It's more of an educational 

system, not just for them, but even for all of us to stay 

up, in regard to what is current and what is good practices. 

          Now, I should also tell you that -- just for quick 

background, and this will be a short presentation without 

slides -- I did a Passive House in 1984.  It was actually 

all masonry, very well received, but the important thing is 

the whole heating cost for the first winter was $50.   

          Now, it mandated that the owner got up at 4:30 in 

the morning and put wood into the Swedish furnace, but that 

was mind-bending for me.  It was heavily insulated.  The 

walls were a foot thick on the north.  But the lessons it 

taught me are remarkable.   

          Years later I did a green building for the 

Appalachian Mountain Club, and during construction we heated 

the whole building with one portable heating heater blowing 

hot air, and the whole building was heated enough for 

workers to work.  We had used heavy insulation -- SIP 

panels; structural panels.  And again, it amazes me. 

          So when looking at what we required as a city back 

in the spring, we didn't require any applicant for a special 

97

permit to actually analyze -- I could be wrong in the way 

I'm wording this -- but analyze a green system. 

          And having worked recently with a developer who is 

doing a building that we used 50 percent less fossil fuels, 

I was designed with Design Review in the neighborhood.  Once 

again, this whole notion that not every developer is 

thinking that way.  And Silver LEED is one thing; I'm glad 

we're at Gold, but I can't wait until we get beyond that as 

well. 

          And part of it is the cost. The costs are 

relatively minimal for the benefits. 

          So what we've proposed I believe is compatible 

with the city's renewable energy policies and Net Zero 

goals.  Any change where we make the process faster, where 

people move forward with greener energy systems and cleaner 

air are good.   

          I suffer terribly from asthma, and it took doctors 

eight years to figure out what was wrong, and in the end, 

they said it's bad air -- in Cambridge, mind you, bad air.  

And now I'm on the right medication, which helps. Eight 

years of coughing -- maybe you might remember some meetings 

that you might have been in in the winter.

          So engineers and developers don't do additional 

scope unless they're required to, unless there's an 

additional fee for the engineer.  The architects and the 

builders in the room and probably the lawyers as well and 

planners know that fees are tight -- very tight in the 

design profession.  It just doesn't happen. 

          So unless you hire an engineer who's proficient in 

that area and you want to do it, you really stick with what 

you've always done.  Yeah, you tinker with it, as the city 

has made restrictions.   

          But I can tell you one very noted architect who 

you see a lot of says he does everything he can to play with 

the system so he can maintain his over 50 percent glass in 

the façade, which is one of the worst things you can do if 

you want to reduce energy consumption.  Engineers actually 

say 40 percent is the ideal number in façades.  It's part of 

ASHRAE.   

          So all we're trying to do here is promote 

advantages of non-fossil fuels and energy systems.  As you 

probably also know, the potential is huge.  There's enough 

wind energy capacity off Massachusetts to provide 19 times 

the energy the state uses now.  But you have to have, you

have to push for that.  Yes, we're in the court, but you 

have to push. 

          So I read the city -- Community Development's 

comments.  I am not a literalist in that it has to be my 

way.  The city is beginning to look into what we're 

proposing, as I understood in this memo. I never knew that 

before I read the memo, and honestly, we thought on the 

Council that we were promoting something that wasn't being 

looked at as quickly as it is needed.   

          So I'm done.  That is my presentation.  I welcome 

any input and any modifications and any ideas that Community 

Development has based on the memo and any future 

discussions.  It's just something that we need to do as soon 

as possible. 

          And it seems to me that in special permits if we 

require traffic studies and different drawings that are 

required, and now energy work, why not require what our goal 

is, green energy, just as a comparison to what they're doing 

with their more standard energy systems. 

          Thank you, Madam Chair and Planning Board.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  This is a 

public hearing, and so, we'll now turn to public comment.

          Any members of the public who wish to speak should 

now click the icon at the bottom of your Zoom screen that 

says, "Raise hand."  If you're calling in by phone, you can 

raise your hand by pressing *9.  As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, 

the Board had not received any written comments from the 

public on this case.  And written comments received after 

5:00 p.m. yesterday will be entered into the record.    

          All right.  I'll now ask staff to unmute speakers 

one at a time.  And you should begin as usual by saying your 

name and address.  Staff will confirm that we can hear you, 

and after that you have up to three minutes to speak before 

I ask you to wrap up.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Madam Chair, this is 

Jeff Roberts again.  The one speaker with hand raised is 

City Councillor Quinton Zondervan.  You can begin speaking.  

Thank you.   

          COUNCILLOR QUINTON ZONDERVAN:  Thank you.  Quinton 

Zondervan again, 235 Cardinal Medeiros Avenue, and speaking 

in support of my colleagues' zoning petitions, and we did 

vote on it at the Council.  But I did want to speak to it 

individually as well.   

          And, you know, I've read the CDD memo.  I agree

that it makes sense to require this as a special permit.  I 

wasn't aware that it wasn't asking for that.   

          But I do want to draw a little bit more of a 

distinction with the Net Zero narrative that we did add to 

the Green Building Ordinance, because Net Zero and non-

fossil fuel are of course related, but they're not the same 

thing in terms of the building itself, because it's possible 

to make the building Net Zero emissions by buying renewable 

energy off the grid. 

          And what this provision is after is to make sure 

that the building developers have considered the possibility 

of on-site renewable generation.  And that's a really 

important piece of the puzzle. 

          And of course, I would much prefer that we went 

straight to requiring all buildings to be -- new buildings 

to be fossil fuel free at construction, and in fact that's 

what we asked for seven years ago when we filed the Net Zero 

zoning petition.  So, you know, falling behind on that.   

          But I think this is an important incremental step 

that we can achieve tonight, while we would at least require 

the developers to consider local renewable energy sources as 

part of the building.

          And, you know, we're seeing this every day, 

including right now acutely in California where they're 

experiencing a massive heat wave and ironically the 

utilities now have to do rolling brownouts because the 

energy use is spiking when people are trying to run their 

air conditioners.  And of course, as we all know, when the 

sun is shining the most is when the solar panels produce 

most electricity.   

          So it's really critical that we start utilizing 

that local energy source and maximizing it by implementing 

solar on a building, by implementing geothermal on our 

buildings.  That the city is doing, and we're leading by 

example in our schools and instruction, and offset that 

energy use from the utilities. 

          And we have now today all the technology to do it.  

It's all economically available.  We're seeing some projects 

already in affordable housing, the Finch Building.  And now 

with the new project in Central Square that's market-rate, 

it's proposing to be an all-electric building. 

          So these technologies are available to us, and we 

need to start utilizing it.  I am pleased to say that after 

years of work at my own family home in Cambridge, we are 

103

very, very close to Net Zero.  We're able to do that in part 

because we have photovoltaic systems on the roof that 

produce now about 80 percent of the total energy consumption 

of our home. 

          So, again, the technology is there.  The economics 

work.  There's really no reason not to do it.  And so, this 

is the minimum that we can ask of our developers to at least 

consider doing it and give us the analysis for what they 

have come up with in terms of reasons to do it or not. 

          So, again, I'm in full support of this petition, 

and I hope that you will find in favor of it.  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'll just make one last call.  If 

there's anybody that hasn't spoken who would like to speak, 

now is the time to push the "Raise hand" button or push *9 

on your phone.     

          [Pause]  

Chair.    

          I'm seeing none, so I'll turn it back over to the 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We will 

now move from public comment to Board discussion.  If this 

hearing is continued to a future date, additional

information is received, there will be another opportunity 

for public comment on the additional materials.  Additional 

written comments may also be submitted to the record.   

          We did receive, as was referenced, a memo from 

Community Development staff, who are available for 

questions.  So let me start the discussion from Board 

members.  Mary, why don't you start us off with any 

questions you have or any other comment you want to make on 

the petition?       

          MARY FLYNN:  So I think this is another 

incremental step forward, and every step forward is a good 

one when it comes to trying to save the planet.  So thank 

you to the City Council for filing this. 

          I guess I'm a little unsure what we do with the 

data when we receive it.  If the intent is just to collect 

the data right now and not require developers to actually 

implement these things, I think the Community Development 

memo mentioned that staff may not have the expertise to 

actually respond to the analysis.   

          So is there a plan for what we do with all of this 

information as we get it?  And who else besides CDD staff 

would review it?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY: Councillor Carlone, do 

you want to respond to that?       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Thank you.  Yes, Madam 

Chair.  Inspectional Services would get it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  And the goal is to set 

up this analysis so that there are explanations of what it 

does.  We haven't talked about that.  I don't know enough 

about it, but to get principles out of it, and if the cost 

is comparable, the question is why aren't you doing this?  

But it's also a learning process.   

          It's all how it's set up.  You can take a course 

by a terrible professor and you go, "What the heck was that 

all about" but if it's structured the right way and it's 

done in a way where it's useable, in addition to the 

analysis, here's what we've learned, here's what makes 

sense:  you build knowledge.  You know what to look for.   

         More importantly, the developer sees it, and you 

can challenge the developer and say, "Well, if this makes 

sense and it saves money, why aren't you considering it?" 

You can't force them -- I get that, we're not going that 

far, although, like my colleague, I wish we were.  It's

public health.  And one step at a time.  We're not there 

now, we're not doing that now. 

          So it's knowledge, it's organizing it in the 

correct way, and it's comparison.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  And I think data is always 

useful.  Again, I think it's really over time probably  

it'll become clearer as to the mechanism for really 

reviewing all of it, as we see -- you know, how much data we 

actually get in -- you know, whether Inspectional Services 

and CDD together with the City Council can then propose 

additional zoning changes or whatever, or maybe we need to 

bring in some other experts over time to help us analyze all 

of that.   

          But I understand what you're saying.  Right now 

it's really to just gather the data for the future, and in 

those cases where it's, like, really obvious that a 

renewable source is more affordable, then press the issue as 

much as possible, but not require it.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Madam Chair?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.  The Council -- 

for any upzoning, the Council has pushed, and the city is 

now doing this -- to start charging developers for increased

land value.  And the question was, "How do we figure that 

out, how do we do it?"   

          Well, the city has hired a consultant through 

Community Development to do that, to figure out what the 

increased value is, the impact on the city -- how to soften 

that impact by investing that extra money.   

          This is the same kind of thing.  So we've done it 

before, and as a Planning Board member mentioned, we can do 

that again.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, thank you so much.  I think -- 

yeah, that answers questions.  And I think it's -- you know, 

with the changes that were made to the language that 

Community Development was concerned about, I think it's a 

good thing to move forward.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Tom?  Do 

you want to comment on this one?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, I sat on the Net Zero 

committee with Quinton a few years back.  I'm well versed in 

the issues.  I think data gathering -- I agree with the 

Councillor and Mary -- is a very, very good thing.  And 

further, you know, daylighting this potential way of 

thinking about how one powers a building is a very, very

good thing. 

          I don't worry so much about the expense of 

producing this report.  It is added fees, as the Councillor 

referenced, but we are in a very fortunate situation in the 

city, as you well know, that this is a very desirable place 

to building buildings.  And so, I think we can ask for 

people who have participated in this community in this way 

to give us the data.   

          I -- you know, there's always the devils in the 

details.  Just two weeks ago, of course we were reviewing 

affordable housing proposals.  We wonder about creating 

barriers to addressing the critical housing shortage we have 

in this community.  That would be my -- I suppose my one 

concern about this, although housing is a relatively easy 

thing to power -- relatively low energy use. 

          I worry about creating an additional burden for 

those in the community that are trying to address that very 

issue.  So that may be something that the Ordinance 

Committee can banty about when they meet next week.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Madam Chair?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, go ahead, 

Councillor.       

109

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  I just wanted to say 

that, as Tom knows, affordable housing is some of the 

greenest residential buildings we have.  

          And this in no way is meant to affect that, and an 

exception in that -- given what, how they produce buildings, 

that would certainly be entertained by me, and I think many 

of the Council.  I won't keep interrupting I just -- there 

was a point I wanted to say I agree.  I'll be quiet.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, how about 

you next?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'm going to disagree with 

Councillor Carlone.  I don't think there should be an 

exemption for affordable housing developers.  I'd also like 

to see the comparison.  It would have been nice to have some 

comparisons to look at already. 

          Don't know what the cost of this will add to a 

project.  I'm sure the smaller developers may have a little 

bit to say about how much this extra study will cost.  Also 

the coordination.  I think there's a little bit more here 

than meets the eye.  And that's all I have to say.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I was listening to Councillor

Zondervan's comments, and I wondered, is it the supposition 

that renewable energy sources would be on site of the 

building that's being built?  Or could one contract for 

renewable energy? 

          And my second question is, does a ground source 

heat pump qualify as a renewable energy source?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.  Councillor 

Carlone, you're allowed to interrupt for those kinds of 

questions.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Okay, thank you.  

Windmills in the ocean would not be on site.  And I realize 

Councillor Zondervan is more of an expert -- I'm certainly 

not in this area -- but my feeling is clean energy is clean 

energy.  Geothermal would be clean energy, relative to 

fossil fuels -- no question.   

          So I think it could be offsite.  My colleague, I 

suspect -- and I shouldn't speak for him -- would want as 

much on site as possible, that's feasible.  I'm flexible on 

that.  But you can help decide what that is.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Hugh?  

Any other comments or questions?              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  No, I guess it's that it's -- maybe

the language needs to be clarified as to whether they're to 

look at onsite options as well as offsite options?  I don't 

know.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  That's I think 

a valuable point to include in our recommendation that the 

language should be clearer as to whether it's acceptable to 

have no on site options looked at, or if both need to be 

considered. 

          Oh, sorry.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I would add that every week I go 

over and look at those two new buildings going up at 

Cambridge Crossing.  And, you know, that density of building 

-- that amount of energy usage can't possibly gather energy 

on site to solve that.  On the other hand, we don't want to 

let them off the hook.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Right.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.  Yeah.  I think 

it's a really valid point that, you know, on site may not be 

feasible for everyone, but we want them to at least look at 

it and, you know, rather than just say they're going to -- 

you know, contribute money and do it all off-site.  The 

language and the zoning text may need to be tweaked, to

reflect that both options need to be considered.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Madam Chair, forgive me since I 

was part of the original committee -- Quinton was as well, 

but -- the idea was to create a market for renewables.  That 

there was no way within the boundaries of the city of 

Cambridge that we could solve all our energy requirements.  

         We can go some distance, as Quinton has referenced, 

but it's also a pretty clear conscience if you are able to 

create a market for renewables that are produced in 

windfarms offshore or in Vermont or wherever, you know -- 

that that also -- global warming is, you know, a national 

problem.  It's not going to be solved within the boundaries 

of Cambridge.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Very true.  All 

right.  I'm going to turn to Steve.  Lou, I see you have 

your hand raised.  I do want to hear from everybody once 

first, and then we'll come back to you.   

          So Steve?   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, I think this is really 

appropriate transitionally -- a step.  It would be 

premature, I think, to actually be requiring anything in 

particular at this stage of the technology.

22

          But to require that studies be done and that both 

the developer and all of us be educated as to what the 

operations and the relative -- this is a totally appropriate 

transitional step.   

          I would also mention that a project that I 

completed a couple of years ago -- it was a Whole Foods 

anchored shopping center -- under the state code, and I 

can't remember exactly what it was, but I think it was the 

Energy Code, I had to perform a study very much like the one 

being proposed here.   

          And I had to evaluate a number of energy efficient 

options, including solar, roof and a few others.  And we did 

make some modifications in our project, as a result.   

          So I'm not sure exactly how this works with the 

analogous state codes, and those state codes may only have 

been applicable to certain types of projects.  But I think 

as part of the study of this proposal, somebody should 

really evaluate the similar and analogous state code, and 

see if we can coordinate appropriately. 

          But in general, again, this is a study that 

[3:09:08 audio unclear] required here, and I think it's very 

appropriate.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thanks, 

Steve.  Yeah, I think your point about the state energy code 

is a good one, and I think points to why Councillor Carlone 

is right, that the data really does belong with the Building 

Department in terms of understanding how the codes apply, 

and how this would be evaluated.   

          But obviously CDD can be closely involved and help 

with any consultants that we need to eventually evaluate the 

efficacy of these options down the road as we get the data.  

So that's a really good point, Steve, thank you. 

          Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, it seems to me that it's 

an excellent idea that ought to be implemented.  And if it's 

just for data collection for future use, the way it is 

written -- and I think where it is in the zoning ordinance  

-- is fine.   

          However, if we do want to use it to try to 

convince a developer or proponent to switch away from fossil 

fuels, then I think the data and the information about a 

particular project ought to be obtained earlier in the 

permitting process.   

          As CDD mentioned, this is going -- this data is

just going to go in at the building permit application time, 

and they’ve already gotten the special permit, or variance, 

or whatever permitting they need.   

          And I think their plans will already have been 

done, and it will be a near impossibility to convince them 

at that point to change how they're going to provide fuel or 

whatever for their building.   

          So I think it -- you know, other than just for 

data collection for future use, for current use it ought to 

be moved into a different place in the ordinance. 

          On a particularly picayune issue, there is 

currently an existing section -- subsection D -- to the 

zoning ordinance.  And so, if it is amended this way, there 

needs to be a reference at the existing D gets renumbered, 

relettered -- whatever, to something else. 

          Other than that, I think it's a great idea.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.   

          Lou, let me circle back to you.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Another quick one.  I'm not 

sure what's included to be studied.  It would be kind of 

interesting to get a reliability and longevity part of this 

in the study.  Those costs are incredible.  We've sat

through some pretty chilly nights at the Planning Board.  I 

would hate to see us recommend some of this.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah so for my own 

thoughts, I agree with Steve that this is, you know, an 

appropriate time for us to be gathering the information.   

          I also agree with Ted that once we have enough 

information to know what we want to be actually requiring, 

this is probably not the right place for a requirement, but 

I don't think we're there yet.   

          And I think the first step in getting there is to 

know what those costs and differences are, and this this is 

a -- you know, incremental, as Mary said, an incremental 

step towards making that difference.  So I would be in 

support of it as well -- you know, again, including some of 

the clarifications that my colleagues have mentioned during 

this discussion.   

          All right.  So I think that means that we are 

prepared to make a recommendation is what I'm hearing, and I 

think it sounds like there's a consensus that we're 

recommending that the petition be adopted, although we had a 

couple of comments on language changes that we would 

recommend the Council look at, either to clarify on-site

versus off-site, what do you actually want studied?   

          What else did we want to clarify?  We do want to 

make sure that the numbering in the zoning ordinance doesn't 

create conflicting references, as Ted notes. 

          Are there other tweaks or bigger changes we would 

like to recommend that the Council look at, as we send these 

forward with a favorable recommendation?       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Madam Chair?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  It is our intent to 

work with Community Development on the wording --       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  -- based on their 

memo, and based on the research that a number of members 

have asked us to look into.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  We appreciate your 

support and your recommendation, but you've raised a number 

of issues that to do it right, we're going to have to go 

back and work with staff.  And so, I don't think this is a 

finished product by any stretch of the imagination.  And I 

just wanted to make that clear.      

118

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So then 

maybe what the recommendation should take the format of is a 

favorable recommendation, but with an acknowledgment that 

there are some tweaks, and that the proponents will be 

working with staff to achieve the goals that the proposed 

ordinance has articulated.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Do I have 

a motion to give such a favorable recommendation?  NA 

meetings            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So move.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Roll call

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On the motion for a favorable 

recommendation -- let me get my list -- Louis Bacci?       

          [Pause] 

          You're still muted.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I heard -- could you say that 

again?     

          [Pause] Lou, could you say your vote again?

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Maybe I was too timid 

in my proposal.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  You know, it sounds 

like it's a good first step.  And sometimes those are the -- 

if we make lots of small steps, we'll get -- sometimes get 

there faster than if we make a bold one that we don't get 

agreement to support.  So thank you.       

          COUNCILLOR DENNIS CARLONE:  Thank you.  Good 

neighbor.  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So that 

concludes everything on our agenda.  Are there any 

additional comments from staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I have nothing else at this time, 

unless one of the other staff members interrupts me.  

Doesn't sound like it.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.  Not giving them 

too much of a chance to do that.  [Laughter]  

          Any Board members have any questions or comments 

before we adjourn?  Nope?  All right.  Then the meeting is 

adjourned.  Thank you all.     

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you, goodnight.
