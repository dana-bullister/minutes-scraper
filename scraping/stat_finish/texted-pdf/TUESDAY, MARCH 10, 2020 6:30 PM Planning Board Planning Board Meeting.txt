Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, Hugh Russell, 

                  Tom Sieniewicz, Mary T. Flynn, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Steven A. Cohen, and Louis J. 

                  Bacci, Jr.                            

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  We're going to 

get started with our usual preliminaries.  This is the March 

10 meeting of the Planning Board.  As usual, we are being 

audio and visually recorded, so we ask all speakers to use 

the microphones.   

          And we will start off the meeting this evening 

with an Update from the Community Development Department  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Madam Chair, I'll take 

over for today.  Iram is out of town at the National League 

of Cities conference this week, in terms of what they're 

talking about.   

          The -- just for a quick schedule update, so 

tonight we have on the agenda a public hearing on a new 

zoning petition.  It had to do with the definition of 

"family" in Article 2, we'll be hearing that shortly.

          And then a continued hearing on proposed 

development at 97 Cambridge Park Drive.  So welcome to 

March. 

          Next week we have another Planning Board meeting 

where there will be a hearing on a cannabis retail store 

proposal at 701-703B Mount Auburn Street, and we also will 

be reviewing a proposed amendment to the transportation 

conditions on the MIT soma PUD- development, and the Design 

Update on -- potentially a design update on a previous 

Planning Board case #57 JFK Street.   

          And then March 24, we have a meeting scheduled 

where there will be a continued hearing on 1686 Mass Ave.  

That was postponed from another -- from a previous date, and 

there will be a new public hearing on a proposed hotel 

development at 727 Mass Ave in Central Square, plus there 

will be a preapplication conference on the Cambridgeside PUD 

development proposal.   

          This was the zoning that was adopted by the City 

Council last year, and as part of the zoning, they have to 

have a preliminary meeting with the Planning Board before 

they submit their application to present their general 

concept and get initial comments and answer questions from

the Board. 

          So that is March.  Again, we are hoping to keep 

that last Tuesday in March clear of new public hearings, but 

of course if there is for any reason anything that needs to 

be continued, we may need to still schedule continued 

business on that date. 

          We have -- the Ordinance Committee will have a 

hearing on this "family" definition zoning petition on March 

17 at 5:00 p.m., and there's a special event on March 25, 

which I'm going to let Khalil talk about in a second.   

          Just looking ahead a little bit to April, because 

things are starting to schedule into April, April 7 is when 

we anticipate a public hearing on the Affordable Housing 

Overlay that was recently filed by the Council, and there 

are Ordinance Committee hearings scheduled on that same 

petition.   

           April 14 at 5:00 p.m. and April 15 at 3:00 p.m., 

and I do not know this for sure, because I haven't gotten 

confirmation, but I suspect there may be one meeting that 

will be a presentation and a public comment, and then 

another one for Council, or Ordinance Committee discussion.  

Don't quote me on that, but that's what I'm guessing is

intended by having the two hearing dates. 

          So that's the calendar.  And Khalil, do you want 

to talk about the march 25 event?                   

          KHALIL MOGASSABI:  Sure.        

          THE REPORTER:  Could you spell your name for me, 

for the record?                 

          KHALIL MOGASSABI:  Khalil, Khalil Mogassabi, CDD.  

We have -- I think this is a follow up on several 

conversations that I think we had with the Board here 

regarding the last façade design and sustainability.   

          So this is a panel discussion that CDD will be 

hosting March 25 at 6:00 p.m., 6:00 to 8:00 at the library.  

That's 449 Broadway.  There will be some flyers in the back 

there or in the front.                   

          Again, this is kind of having three panel experts 

to kind of give their perspective on energy efficiency and 

what goes into the design of building envelopes (sic) 

specifically to the façade.   

          And also, this is to shed some light on the latest 

energy conversation code.  There was a recent amendment that 

will be in effect.  We are in what they call concurrency 

period from February 7 until August 7, and then after August

7 this year the new code with the amendment will be in 

effect.  So this is really tiring to govern, give us a 

perspective on the -- on all the factors that come in in the 

design façade, so meeting the energy dependence.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And just one more thing that popped 

into my mind, because the Planning Board didn't meet last 

week, but there was a Council meeting on March 2, at which 

the Council adopted two zoning petitions that the Planning 

Board had reviewed and made positive recommendations on.   

          One is the Harvard Square petition that amends the 

provisions of the Harvard Square Overlay District, and the 

petition by Alexandria to create a Grand Junction Overlay 

Zoning District, which will enable additional development on 

what's known as the -- what used to be the Metropolitan Pipe 

Site, and in exchange has provisions for the conveyance of 

land to complete an important section of the planned Grand 

Junction pathway -- pedestrian bicycle pathway. 

          So that will -- those are, at least in the case of 

the latter petition, that will result in a development 

proposal we expect will come before the Planning Board, and 

Harvard Square.  We'll just have to see.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

8

much.  We do have two transcripts for adoption for February 

4 and February 11, that have been certified as complete.  Do 

we have a motion to adopt those?

HUGH RUSSELL:  So moved.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Second?     

H THEODORE COHEN:  Second.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor?  

That's unanimous, all right.  So then we can move to our 

first public hearing of the evening on the Family Definition 

Amendment, and do we have someone who's going to be making a 

presentation?

CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  Thank you very much.  

Christopher Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street.  S-c-h-m-i-d-t is the 

last name, and I am the petitioner in this case on changing 

the definition of "family" within the zoning code in Article 

2.   

So the current definition of "family" in Article 2

says that a "family" is one or more persons occupying a 

dwelling unit and living as a single, non-profit 

housekeeping unit, provided that the group of four or more 

persons who are not within the second degree of kinship 

shall not be deemed to constitute a family, followed by some 

language about handicapped persons, which is not relevant 

right now. 

          So what does this mean to us?  You know, everyone 

in a household has to be a single, non-profit housekeeping 

unit, it seems to make sense, but dwellings can't be 

occupied by more than three unrelated individuals, which 

means that a pair of student couples can't actually legally 

occupy a two-bedroom unit under the Cambridge zoning code.   

          This also puts limits on more distant relatives 

living together.  So for example cousins are not within the 

second degree of kinship, and the language is a little bit 

unclear about households which are partially split between 

kinship and non-kinship -- would be treated, for example 

could a fiancé move in with, you know, a household of 

children? 

          And this language explicitly has an exception of 

for persons who were added presumably after the Fair Housing 

10

Act addressed this in the 1980s.   

          So the reason why -- and these definitions exist 

across the country.  They're not -- this is not an uncommon 

language for Cambridge to have -- you see these all over the 

place.  And historically, these guidelines were defended and 

discussed in the Supreme Court cases as necessary to address 

family needs. 

          It says that, "Zoning should provide a quiet place 

where yards are wide, people few and motor vehicles are 

restricted -- are legitimate guidelines and land-use 

projects address the family needs."  This is the Supreme 

Court decision from the 1974.   

          And while that might be an ideal that some 

communities are looking to provide, families in Cambridge 

are not exactly held to places where yards are wide, and 

although I wish there were fewer motor vehicles in 

Cambridge, as many of us do, that's not the reality that is 

certainly enforced by that language today. 

          Families live in apartment buildings, families 

live in all kinds of housing situations, and that's just not 

a description of Cambridge as we see it. 

          So these types of restrictions take many forms.

In many different cases, though, they have been struck down 

-- everything from the U.S. Supreme Court to the state 

courts, and more all up and down the system. 

          The legal concerns typically include providing 

appropriate due process under the Constitution, matching the 

definition of language to the primary intent of zoning, 

privacy concerns about invading people's privacy to 

determine what their relationships and kinships are, as well 

as conflicts with state code.   

          So degree of kinship as a way to restrict families 

has actually been explicitly regarded as a likely violation 

of due process by the Supreme Court. The tradition of 

uncles, aunts, cousins and especially grandparents sharing a 

household has roots equally venerable and equally deserving 

in Constitutional recognition.   

          So this Supreme Court case effectively established 

that the degree of kinship language was likely 

unconstitutional.  It just should not apply in a 1977 case -

- Moore versus the City of East Cleveland.   

          Many of these cases are cases very similar to what 

Cambridge has today, where they have a number of students or 

other unrelated individuals who are living together as a 

12

single, non-profit household. Sharing an apartment has 

brought some of these things up.   

          So court cases have tried to establish, like, what 

is the primary consideration of the zoning.  Cambridge was 

actually sued in 1928.  One of the first Supreme Court cases 

on the zoning -- Necktie versus City of Cambridge, which 

established that zoning should be to establish the general 

welfare.  

          And in New York, you know, the restricting 

occupancy of single-family housing, based generally on 

biological or legal relationships, establishes no 

relationship to the goals of reducing parking, traffic, or 

controlling population density, because you can have eight 

people living in your house if they're related -- if you -- 

that doesn't make -- you're not restricting this based on 

some -- you know, objective criteria. 

          In California, courts have ruled against language 

like this, because it infringes upon the right of privacy 

guaranteed by the California state Constitution.   

          Obviously, this is -- California is not 

Massachusetts, but a strict standard -- scrutiny, like 

standard or review, the city doesn't demonstrate a 

13

22

compelling public interest to justify the restriction to 

just family members.  You're invading people's privacy by 

asking them to demonstrate that they are -- you know, blood 

or kindred relationships. 

          I mentioned earlier this also includes an 

exception for handicapped persons.  This was established in 

the 1980s into the Fair Housing Act, and our language 

specifically address that.   

          If you are a handicapped person, you can have more 

than four handicapped people sharing a single-family 

household.   

          And this eliminates the concerns of 

discrimination, which is appropriate, but when your law has 

an explicit clause that says, you know, this is the law 

except if you're handicapped and has to make a special 

exception, it does make you question a little bit, is the 

law really doing what you are attempting to have it do?   

          So, to take a step back, what should our goal be 

within this language?  Our goal should be to promote the 

health, safety, convenience or general welfare of the part 

of the city affected?   

          Again, from the Supreme Court case against the 

14

City of Cambridge in 1928, and whether individuals living in 

households are related by kinship or not does not really on 

its own effect the general welfare of the city.   

          It is not really my business or my problem if the 

people living next to me are married or not, that's not a 

question that has an effect on the general welfare.   

          So another goal is to protect households from 

risky situations, right?  Like, overall our law should be 

set up to prevent people from being put at legal risk -- 

something that happens when you have living situations which 

are not allowed by the laws that they can be at legal risk. 

          So Cambridge's goal for families isn't a quiet 

place where yards are wide and people few; our goal is to 

provide safe, legal housing options for traditional and 

nontraditional families that meet their needs -- the people 

who live in the city. 

          So all types of different households exist in 

Cambridge today.  You have individuals living alone, 

traditional families, married -- you know, or single parents 

of children; foster families, for example; parents with 

children -- with or without children, caring for foster 

children; long-term cohabitation, so two or more unmarried

22

individuals in a relationship, possibly including children; 

transitional living situations such as group living or 

supportive housing, and communal living, where unrelated 

groups of individuals live as a single household.   

          We already going to have a number of households 

like that throughout the city with shared cooking, cleaning, 

et cetera duties. 

          Another thing that -- one thing that we want to do 

is make sure that we can match households to home sizes.  

It's best to have a number of bedrooms and scales that lead 

somewhat to family size, as I can say from having my two 

daughters have their own bedrooms.   

          It was very important at various points of their 

life.  That doesn't mean every household member have their 

own bedroom -- my wife and I are happy to share -- but 

maximizing options to provide appropriate-sized housing is 

important in the city. 

          But no strict definition of individuals is going 

to match a given household.  So every family unit from a 

single individual up to extended families of a dozen may all 

be appropriate for some homes in Cambridge. 

          And defining a household size strictly would 

16

12

13

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

conflict with that general welfare.  You want to be able to 

match homes to people who live in them, and so, like, no 

strict number is really going to make sense. 

          So Cambridge is host to a large number of 

apartments on the rental market. 5 percent of the listings 

on Zillow today have five or more bedrooms.  12 percent have 

four or more, which -- again, if you're talking about not 

having four unrelated individuals seems like it might not 

work out so well. 

          And even the average family size in Cambridge is 

only 2.8 individuals. You know, most of it is parents with a 

child on average.  And the average household size is even 

smaller; it's actually only 2.1 people. 

          And with a limited number of families with 

children, homes like this largely result in over housing, if 

they're used solely by blood relations; you know, people 

within the second degree of kinship. 

          So opening up larger housing to nontraditional 

living arrangements to actually better match these large 

apartments to the housing need that we have. 

          More than 100 of Cambridge's single-family homes 

have more than six bedrooms.  Those homes are really poorly

suited to the typical Cambridge family, and really most -- 

the median property value for these homes is $3.3 million 

dollars.   

          A two-income family would need two adults making 

$320,000 a year to make this an affordable purchase; 

obviously not exactly the median income. 

          So they may not be good -- a fit for any but the 

wealthiest of traditional families, but again for 

nontraditional households living together, you can have an 

appropriate fit there.   

          Nontraditional households with no options other 

than this are really not legally protected.  I've talked to 

so many friends in the area who have been told by their 

landlord, "No, you can't put a fourth person on the lease," 

"No, you can't have another tenant here, but of course they 

can visit as much as they'd like."  

          Landlords are aware of these restrictions and will 

seek to -- you know -- skirt these rules, or, you know, 

follow the rules, but then leave tenants being -- you know 

unprotected, not covered by leases, not covered by tenant 

protections if something bad comes up.   

          So tenants would have a limited legal resource or 

18

people living there, because they are no longer tenants, but 

have limited legal resource in those cases. 

          And these families are sometimes threatened with 

enforcement action when they have this come up, that having 

these types of living situations that are not legally 

protected can be used as a form of kind of attacks from -- 

you know, badly behaving landlords against tenants to, you 

know, "Do this" and they'll tell ISD and we're going to have 

problems here. 

          And arbitrary enforcement has been used as a 

threat against tenants in several cities, both in Cambridge 

and Somerville that I have heard stories of, as well as in 

other states where it's come up as a legal issue.  

          There's been some concern or discussion about 

turning apartments into lodging houses.  Lodging houses can 

be an actual positive in my opinion for affordable housing 

in the community.   

          In the 1900s, this was actually a way a lot of 

people found affordable homes, but they probably deserve a 

different standard of treatment than individuals. This 

language does not affect the definition of lodging house, 

which is defined in this zoning language separately.

21

22

          Habitability standards are an issue, and then 

overall housing supply concerns.  So lodging house is the 

current definition in families as living as a single, non-

profit housekeeping unit.   

          That text would provide -- like lodging, house 

type situations which are not a single, non-profit 

housekeeping unit, and so, like, that's really not the same 

language that would apply. 

          Habitability standards, these set minimum 

standards as a statewide standard for how big a space has to 

be in order to have, you know, a number of people living in 

it. So for every dwelling unit, it has to be at least 150 

square feet.  For every additional occupant, you have to 

have another 100 square feet.   

          As you can see here, buildings that have been 

permitted in Cambridge are down to 347 square feet, and I 

know that there's a proposal currently making its way 

through the city to have some units as small as 260 square 

feet.   

     So these minimum standards that we're looking at for 

some of these places are actually, you know, very similar to 

the minimum statewide standards.

          And so, like, you know, in the same way that we 

allow micro carbons to fit people's -- you know, budgetary 

and other needs, you know, saying, "Well, we don't want to 

have too much crowding."   

          You know, like, yes these are different 

situations, but people should be able to kind of scale their 

living style to what works best for them.  And we do have 

minimum standards that are designed to afford safety and 

minimum, you know.   

          Housing supply, I mean this is a big thing that 

people come up with.  They say, you know, if you do this 

one, then we'll have, you know, too much -- too many people 

competing for these houses, families won't be able to get 

them. 

          Overall not doing this, and setting the standard 

as the default seems likely to result in overhoused students 

-- you know, if we talk about having to have, you know, 

these four or five bedroom houses, or six-bedroom houses, 

you know, it's hard to imagine exactly what type of family  

-- how many families can actually fill these units. 

          The more appropriate use of larger homes can 

actually better match the overall housing that we have to

the families and residents that we have looking for housing 

here.  And we know that Cambridge is currently drastically 

underproducing housing relative to demand.   

          So anything that we can do to make sure that these 

homes are being used to their, you know, best ability, is 

going to help cut down on some of the housing need that we 

have. 

          So if we look at all the things that we have, I 

would say that adjusting this definition seems like it's 

correcting for a number of issues that are both legal and 

social in benefit, and say that families should be, you 

know, one or more persons occupying a dwelling unit and 

living as a single non-profit housekeeping unit.  Full stop. 

          The rest of that language is simply not necessary 

in the world that we have today.  We have other standards 

that guide various aspects that we're concerned about, and 

we should stop there. 

          So some response to the CDD memo, which you 

probably received -- may have received, some concerns were 

raised by CDD around legal review.  I will say feel free to, 

you know, ask the Solicitor for legal -- or the City Council 

can feel free to ask the Solicitor for a legal review.

          I will say that it seems clear from the current 

language is certainly not in compliance with what I expect 

to be a Constitutional standard, and so, this language 

probably deserves revision at this point, no matter what. 

          But it was also brought up that there might be 

competition between different definitions in the zoning 

code.   

          There's currently three kind of significant 

definitions of housing in the zoning code; family housing, 

which is what we're talking about here, sort of single -- 

what is the definition of a family?   

          Group quarters, which is defined but nowhere used 

in the zoning code, seems like it would define a definition 

for these types of larger living arrangements for groups 

containing four or more persons not related. 

          This orphan definition that has no use in the 

zoning code can effectively be eliminated, I think, if we 

were to change "family" in this way.  There may be some 

other change that could be proposed, which would do a 

similar thing.  But since this wasn't used in the zoning 

code, it wasn't exactly obvious what to do with it. 

          And then lodging house is different from single-

23

family houses, and they're not a single, non-profit 

housekeeping unit.  So I think that in general, you would be 

looking at a different type of zoning there.   

          It's also worth noting that the definition of 

"lodging house," which is used in both the state code and in 

the Cambridge City Code has also been invalidated to some 

extent in a 2013 case in the city of Worcester, which 

basically said that you can't justify these things based on 

kindred, because that's going to lead to arbitrary 

enforcement, and this court won't accept arbitrary 

enforcement as the way that we, you know, decide whether 

something is appropriate or not.  It can't just be you 

decide to enforce when you decide to enforce. 

          So existing enforcement, from what I can tell, 

seems mostly nonexistent.  I've talked to a lot of friends 

who say, "That's weird, I've always lived like that in 

Cambridge." 

          I've also heard a very small number of cases where 

this has come up, and it's certainly problematic, but it 

doesn't seem to be widespread.  And there's a recommendation 

of legal review; certainly always open to more legal review, 

but it's just not clear exactly what direction that would

go, and so, I defer to city staff on that.  But…   

          And then unclear distinctions between the current 

housing types certainly exist today.  This language does 

little to change that standard in my mind, so. 

          Thank you very much and yeah, that's all I have.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Does anyone have 

questions for the petitioner at this time?  Niko?            

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay, thanks.  So could you talk a 

little bit more about current enforcement?  So I'm not 

entirely clear who is being harmed by the current zoning.    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  Yeah.  So I think that -- I 

can't speak to enforcement from experience, right?  Like, I 

don't think that actual enforcement is the current harm.  

What I think is the current harm is both the threat of 

enforcement and the actions that are taken by, you know, 

landlords and others around enforcement.   

          So, for example, my personal example is when I 

moved to Cambridge, I moved here as part of a group of four 

adults as well as two children, and when we moved into our 

apartment, our landlord said, you know, "I can only have 

three people on the lease."   

          And didn't explain to us why, didn't explain to us 

25

what was going on there, but we had to choose somebody and 

say, "Well, is that something we're willing to deal with?" 

or whatever, and I've heard that story from a number of 

different people.   

          That wasn't a problem for us, because we never got 

into a situation where it would have been a problem with the 

landlord.  But I think not being on the lease is something 

which, had we needed to go to court or something along those 

lines, could have been a problem. 

          The other significant thing that I've heard 

stories of -- and I don't want to get people in trouble 

unnecessarily, but where landlords have refused to perform 

repairs for example on an apartment building, and when the 

tenant complained, the landlord's response was, "Well, 

you're not legally allowed to live there anyway, so if you 

complained to, you know, ISD, who's enforcing this, I'm just 

going to report that you have too many people living there, 

and you're going to get in trouble instead." 

          I have no idea what would be done in a situation 

like that, I have no personal experience with it, but those 

threats were enough in at least one story I heard for them 

to say, "Okay, we're just not going to, you know, deal with 

26

this in any way, and we're going to deal with the broken 

stove, and then we're going to move out at the end of our 

lease and find someplace else to live." 

          So those are the two things that I see as really 

harmful right now is kind of discouraging that type of 

living from being potentially legal, and the potential 

retaliation risk from landlords.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  So sticking with the first 

example, suppose the city changes the ordinance to meet the 

petition, is there anything that would prevent a landlord 

from declining to lease property to more than three people 

who are unrelated?    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  I don't -- I mean, I think a 

landlord can decline to rent to people for almost any 

reason, just so long as it's not a protected characteristic.  

So I would expect that that continues to be the case here.  

But I don't know the details of that very well.              

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So would this affect the first 

harm that we're identifying?    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  I think that it would -- 

because I think that that choice was one that was specify 

designed to live within the definition of the zoning 

27

language, it was designed for the landlord to protect 

themselves, if that landlord who I had a great relationship 

with, like, had not felt that they were at risk from leasing 

to us, they still knew that four of us were moving in and 

didn't have a problem with it.   

          So if it had not been something they considered 

themselves at risk for, I think that that lease would have 

had four names on them. 

          It's hard to know because, you know, it happened 

15 years ago and she's dead now, and -- you know, but that 

was -- that would be my guess.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  So in the example that we gave about 

the two married couples --   

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- they --   

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  Two unmarried couples.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Unmarried, okay, sorry.  That's the 

difference, because I was going to say, it seems to me it's 

only three.    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  It is --     

          MARY FLYNN:  But it's unmarried, okay.

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  It is unclear to me exactly 

how -- I would assume that two married couples would be 

fine, but two unmarried couples -- you know, when you're an 

undergrad you're usually not married yet. And so, that would 

be the case.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you for clarifying.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Any other questions 

for the petitioner?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sorry.  Can I ask another 

question?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sorry, I had a third question.  So 

you quoted from Belle Terre decision.  So as I understand 

the facts behind that case involved the village trying to 

keep out Stony Brook students.  So what effect would you 

anticipate that the change in the ordinance would have for 

student living?   

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  Yeah.  So overall, my 

expectation is most people who live in the city today don't 

even know this is there.  Most landlords don't act based on 

it.  I expect the changes would be relatively small.   

          However, for those who are more aware, or for 

29

those who are considering the potential of having larger 

agglomerations of students being able to take advantage of 

larger housing, I think that this could play a role. 

           When I brought this up to several, you know, 

friends of mine who are in the community, they said, like, 

"I've always wanted the opportunity to have a bunch of us 

get together at your house -- that, you know, we see these 

houses or apartments go by that are much bigger, but I know 

that we're not allowed to do that."   

          So it would open up opportunity for some of the 

kind of larger housing in Cambridge to have that be more 

open to larger groups of students.   

          But overall, I think this to the impact in, like, 

the two to three-bedroom range would be minimal, and you 

could see some shift around the kind of larger homes in 

Cambridge, where it really shifts from just. "We're just 

sharing a bedroom" to a more communal or group living 

situation for some people.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  And so, responding to this 

specific fear of the Village of Belle Terre, what would 

prohibit in the current zoning ordinance as amended by this 

petition.  What would prohibit, like, one of the houses on

Brattle Street from being turned into a frat house?    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  So I think that my 

understanding, and I don't know this as well, is that frats 

and dorms are specifically called out in language elsewhere 

in the zoning code.   

          That is -- but if someone were to turn -- but, and 

I think that the key thing to me, having never I lived in a 

frat I can't speak to this -- dorms are not usually a single 

non-profit house, right?  You're not cooking or cleaning 

together, you're not, you know, acting as a single unit. 

          And the same is true as far as I understand for 

the most part of frats.  People sign individual leases; they 

are individual and separately having an arrangement with the 

person who owns the property.   

          If eight students wanted to get together and 

decide that together we are going to engage as a single 

household in renting a property, this language would no 

longer permit that. 

          If someone were to take one of these eight-bedroom 

units on Brattle Street and say, "16 of us are going to live 

together, and we're going to all -- you know, sign a lease 

together and create an LLC together and we're going to --

you know, be one group," I don't think that that would be 

ruled out either.  That would be allowed under this zoning 

in a way that it is not today.    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  And so, --                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So that particular concern, if 

that is a concern, that, you know, we feel we would have, I 

think is not -- is explicitly allowed under this in a way 

that it is not today.  That's not an accident, that's, like, 

an intentional design.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?               

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Do you know, is a non-profit 

housing unit described -- defined anywhere in the zoning 

ordinance?    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  It does not appear to be.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  Jeff and Mike, I don't 

see it in the zoning ordinance, is that correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's my understand that that is 

correct.  It may -- as we've sort of suggested in our 

report, it may be relative to other laws, codes that -- you 

know, would need to be studied more thoroughly, but in the 

zoning ordinance itself --

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  As a partial response to 

that, in the City of Worcester case in 2013, the same 

language existed in the City of Worcester's lodging house 

language, and in that particular case, the court referred to 

kind of dictionary definitions of, "non-profit" and 

"household" in order to kind of inform their view.   

          This doesn't mean it's not defined somewhere in 

the state language, but I think that this language, which is 

kind of common, I think has historically been interpreted by 

courts using common intuition, or, you know, the meaning of 

the word as written, and not by statute.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you very 

much.  So this is a public hearing, and we will hear public 

comment on the petition.   

          Swaathi is going to get me a list to see if anyone 

has signed up, but if you haven’t, don't worry, we'll still 

give you the opportunity to speak.   

          When you're recognized, please come forward to the 

microphone, give your name and address and spell your name.  

You'll then have three minutes to speak, as signified by our 

lighting system, which will turn green once you've given 

your name and address; yellow when you have 30 seconds left,

          So the first person who has signed up to speak is 

Allan Sadun.        

your address, please?   

          THE REPORTER:  Could you spell your name and give 

          ALLAN SADUN:  Allan, A-l-l-a-n Sadun, S-a-d-u-n, 

at 17 Pleasant Place.  I'm going to be fairly brief.  Thank 

you, members of the Planning Board, Madam Chair.   

          I just wanted to say that I live in a 

nonconforming household, as Chris described.  Most of my 

friends live in nonconforming households of usually four 

people.  In my case, it's six people.   

          And I just wanted to, you know, talk about what 

we're talking about when we're talking about these 

situations that we're considering legalizing. 

          These are places that are fit for human 

habitation.  You know, nobody's sleeping in the living room 

or anything.  We have six bedrooms for six people.  This is 

true of most of the situations -- all of the situations that 

I know about in Cambridge. 

          This is generally kind of the only way that young 

people can live in Cambridge with semi-affordable rents

often.  By teaming up, we're able to pay and live here in a 

way that we wouldn't be able to otherwise.  And so, it's 

kind of -- when I look at the current language, it says, 

"Oh, no more than -- you can't -- this situation can't 

happen," I kind of think this language is telling me that 

I'm a second-class citizen in Cambridge.   

          And so I -- you know, from a symbolic point of 

view, that's why I support this petition, even though I have 

not been materially harmed by it, but by the current 

language. 

people.   

          And the other thing I just wanted to testify to 

the presence of is that these situations are widespread 

throughout Cambridge.  It's not just me and my friends, it's 

also our neighbors.  You know, I know our neighbors are six 

          And so, you know, as Chris said, we're kind of in 

an arbitrary enforcement situation that only comes up when 

someone wants to weaponize this restriction in order to come 

at someone else, whether that's a landlord or code 

enforcement situation.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Robert

          ROBERT WINTERS:  Robert Winters, plural of the 

season, 366 Broadway.  And I'm not really here to speak 

either for or against the petition here, but I do want to 

say here that if something is common practice, and if a 

property owner wants to rent to four or five or six people 

who are unrelated, as they apparently do. And as far as I 

know, they’ve always done it, I've lived in that situation.   

          My house -- I was one of four roommates when I 

first, none of us were related -- I don't, I think from a 

landlord's point of view, because I'm a landlord now too, be 

allowed to do that without anybody saying, "Well, you're 

breaking the law."   

          I think that's completely appropriate that 

landlords should be permitted to have such arrangements at 

their discretion.  I think that's a perfectly good thing. 

          By the way, my house also was a rooming house.  

So, you know, where I live now was once a rooming house, you 

know, once upon a time.   

          The one thing I do want to say somewhat in 

opposition, is there's something about the linguistic 

calisthenics that are going on here -- of defining the word, 

"family" in a way which absolutely makes no sense, and

actually borders on ludicrous.   

          I love my housemates Frank Farris and Paul 

Hurljack and Ray Chipman -- I still love Ray Chipman, 

because now we live together today, 20 years later.  But the 

truth of the matter is, is that I would never have, you 

know, thought of them as my family. 

          So if you want to rewrite the rules, rewrite the 

rules.  But could you please come up with different words 

for it and let's call it a housing unit or something like 

that.  Let's not call that a family.  I think that's not 

really right, just wanted to say.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  That's 

everyone who's signed up.  Is there anyone else present who 

wants to be here on this matter?  Okay.  Nope?  Okay.  Then, 

I will turn to the Board for discussion.  Let's see, Tom is 

already moving the mic in place.  So that nominates you to 

go first, Tom.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I'll be careful of the body 

language.  Certainly, I'm interested in figuring out a way 

in which young people can afford to be housed in the city of 

Cambridge.  I'm a little bit troubled by this.  We do live 

in the City of Boston.  It's actually the fourth largest

population of students in the country, you know, after New 

York and other places.   

          But what that means is there's the possibility -- 

there's the huge pressure, you know, every June and 

September to house that population of over 350,000 students 

in the metropolitan region.  We all know that, and so 

Cambridge is different.   

          And so, setting the national precedence, we are 

special, because we are unique because of this situation.  

You know, I worry about changing the definition and then 

that being the possibility for abuse too.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Not from most landlords, but some 

landlords and some of the ones that I used to rent from 

probably would have done this if it had been allowed to, to 

rent to as many students as they possibly could.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.   

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Because actually that's -- 

students are actually relatively rich, it turns out, 

especially if you pack them all into an apartment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So I'm worried about opening the

floodgate necessarily.  So at the risk of speaking out of 

both sides of my mouth, I want to right away support 

nontraditional housing arrangements, nontraditional families 

absolutely, and figure out how young people can afford to 

live here.  Maybe there's some way in which vendors would 

allow occupants, rather than units.   

          I'm a small property owner myself.  I actually 

have used -- since I'm a student of the zoning code, I've 

used this regulation to protect my property.  They are two-

bedroom units, but with five rooms in a unit, and what 

happens is people end up using the dining room and the 

living room as bedrooms, and it's overcrowded. 

          And so, you know, explaining is simply is out of 

my hands and I'd prefer that you not do this, and 

furthermore, it's not concurrent with the zoning code, which 

I'm sworn to uphold to do.   

          So that's what I'd like to do is try to figure out 

a way to probably match residents with occupants.  There's 

probably a good way to do that.  If I find out -- I think 

there's some risk in loosening the regulation, loosening the 

definition.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve?

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  First of all, I want to 

congratulate the applicant.  That was one of the more 

coherent and intellectual presentations that we've had.  But 

I also wanted to go along with Tom's inclination to speak on 

both sides of my mouth.  I think this issue was sort of -- 

draws one to that approach.   

          I think in principal, it's absolutely -- you're 

right, there shouldn't be distinction between family units, 

however they may be defined and limited in other living 

arrangements.  So that's the one side of my mouth.   

          The other side of my mouth, I happen to be living 

next to a triple decker, the one I purchased -- my house -- 

that triple decker in each unit, there was one or two 

people, and maybe one kid in each unit.  I had one car.   

          Right now, each of the three units in there is 

occupied by five or six people -- three bedrooms, and each 

bedroom is occupied by a couple.  They're all grad students.  

They're wonderful people.  But there's an incredible number 

of people there now, an incredible number of parties, which 

I envy. 

          And an incredible number of cars on the street.  

I've had a whole lot of difficulty parking now that I never

really use to.  And so, in principal, I'm still there.  In 

principal, there shouldn't be any restrictions or 

distinctions.  They should be able to live there in whatever 

form they want, that's in principal. 

          In practice, it's really changed the neighborhood 

and my life, and sort of in principle I wish that there 

weren't so many people and so many cars, and so many parties 

next door.  So that's one item of observation.   

          And another I make -- it's interesting, you make 

the point that if it weren’t for the ability to get a number 

of fellow students or friends or what have you, the 

apartments here wouldn't be affordable.  And that I totally 

understand.   

          But interestingly, it's precisely because so many 

nonrelated folks can be living in one unit that contributes 

to increased rents.  And frequently, family units can't 

afford -- traditional family units, all right, cannot afford 

to rent some apartments, because they're competing with 

three or four Harvard or MIT grad students, who as a group 

of four can pay a whole lot more rent than a family. 

          So again, it's one of the sorts of unfortunate, 

unintended consequences, and it puts me, as is, on both

sides of this issue, and speaking both sides of my mouth, 

because in prison, I agree with you.  In practice -- this is 

frequently the case -- there are some unanticipated, 

unfortunate consequences. 

          For me, as a practical matter, this restriction, 

as you pointed out, is not generally getting enforced.  And 

while I really don't have any issue about your proposal in 

principle, I guess because of some of these practical 

considerations, I'd be inclined just to leave well enough 

alone, and let it die out over time. 

          Anyway, it seems like a very simple issue, but I 

think in practice it's kind of more complicated than it 

seems.  So I'll leave it with the two sides.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I think it's actually a 

very interesting issue, that goes from one definition to 

another.  I mean, I think the problem -- just looking at the 

zoning ordinance quickly, is that we don't have a definition 

of single, non-profit housekeeping unit.   

          So I'm thinking of a situation where some -- a 

landlord has a two-bedroom apartment and rents out to two 

unrelated roommates.  Do they constitute a single, non-

profit housekeeping unit?  They're unrelated, and presumably 

you would have three unrelated people in your two rooms.   

          But I don't know what is -- you know, whether they 

and the landlord then are in violation of the zoning 

ordinance, if they're not a family.   

          And I've gone back and looked at dwelling units, 

and dwelling units are intended to be occupied by a family 

living as a housekeeping unit.  And so, it gets very 

circular. 

do.   

          So I think this is an issue that ought to be 

looked into, and I think we have to look at the entire 

zoning ordinance.  I mean, I think to account for 

nontraditional families I think is a good thing for us to 

          But simultaneously, there may be a lot of things 

we want to keep, such as not letting large houses be turned 

into -- you know, be filled with many, many students, which 

one issue is going to be, you know, a family with you, say 

with many, many children would probably only have one or two 

cars.  But if you suddenly have a half dozen or eight 

students living, maybe you've got four or five or six cars. 

          And so, that's just one area where -- and I'm not

saying it's an unintended consequence, it would indeed be a 

consequence -- and there may be areas, you know, where we 

don't want group homes, or we do want to put them in certain 

districts.  So I think there are a lot of issues this 

raises.   

          And I, you know, I think it's a good issue to 

think about, and for have somebody to -- for some of the 

staff to look at and see what -- where do the issues arise, 

and what do we do about it? 

          So I thank you for bringing it to our attention, 

but I don't think it's the very simple fix that you 

suggested.  It may be that that's fine, but then we have to 

add some other definitions somewhere to clarify exactly what 

can and can't be done.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I think Mary 

was signaling first, so.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, I agree with my 

colleagues.  And, you know, thank you for bringing the issue 

forward.  I think you did present in a very clear way.  But 

I do believe Ted is correct, it's a little bit more 

complicated than changing one definition. 

          The concerns I have were similar to what's been

raised.  Number one was the parking.  Now, not every student 

has a car, and more and more families are having multiples, 

but still if you have eight people and eight cars, where 

generally was a family unit remaining one or two, that is a 

difference.  And maybe it's a big difference, maybe it 

isn't, but I think it's something to think about. 

          And as you think about changes in the ordinance, 

I'm thinking not just definitions, but maybe it's the kind 

of thing where particularly where we're trying to limit the 

number of cars in Cambridge, we have to change parking 

ratios, and other requirements, for living situations to 

accommodate. 

          And I am also concerned, as Steve said, about the 

impact on rental prices.  And we're already struggling with 

trying to find more affordable family units.   

          And I know this is not directed at affordable 

units, so to speak, but it does I think put pressure even on 

sort of middle-income households that might be able to 

afford some places, that suddenly may not, because -- again, 

we might have six or eight students who collectively can 

start paying more.  And that is something that has happened 

in a lot of communities across the country.

          So I think, again, it's a very valid point, and 

worth exploration.  So that would be my recommendation, to 

spend a little time to study it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So I'm trying to pare down my 

comments and not tell too many stories, but --          

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I have three stories that in 

each instance, the Building Department did the right thing, 

although the facts may have suggested something else.  So 

the first is my own situation, when I built two additions on 

my house, took in another couple, and then I found that I 

was coupled, and so now we have a structure which has four 

people living in it.   

          We have two married pairs.  I don't know how that 

works with the definition.  And we have two kitchens.  So is 

that -- and we don't cook together all the time, in fact we 

rarely cook together.   

          So I'm, you know, the Building Department gave me 

building permits.  What we were doing was perfectly clear in 

terms of the number of kitchens, they didn't have a problem, 

46

22

it's a single-family house.   

          Okay, maybe thirty years ago, there was a 

fascinating case before the Zoning Board, which I was on, in 

which a married couple, that were maybe roughly 60 years 

old, came to get a permit to subdivide their house so that 

they could each live in half of the house, but not live with 

each other.          

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter] 

          And the other -- right, and the other fact was 

that one of them had a serious illness, and the other one 

wanted to be around to care for this person.  And actually, 

they couldn't live together, but they liked each other.   

          So this would have probably gone through, except 

there was a Partner of a major Boston law firm who lived 

across the street who said creation of two-family houses 

were in flagrante.             

          The impasse was broken when Charlie Sprague, the 

Commissioner of Building, said he didn't care how many 

kitchens were in a house, and if they would just shut the 

doors in between the two portions they wanted to be in, he 

had -- there was nothing wrong about a husband and wife 

sharing a house that had two kitchens.

21

22

          And so, they didn't get the zoning relief they set 

up, but they got the answer that they could be in a 

nontraditional household.   

          So the third one is a building that was renovated 

a couple years ago on Harvard Street.  It's one of the big 

bowfront buildings that was originally -- I think eight, 

just like four stories, two flats, they were big flats, with 

big residences. 

          A friend of mine was the General Contractor, which 

is how I found out.  So the person who's doing that looked 

at the unoccupied basement and said, "Gee, I'd like to -- 

you know, use that space. I'd like to rent that space."  And 

then he was told he'd have to get a zoning variance, and 

that somebody advised him the chances of him getting that 

zoning variance weren’t so good.   

          So he created two eight-bedroom apartments 

combining the first floor in the basement space into a 

single apartment.  And the building was rebuilt and 

finished, night and presumably has an occupancy permit.   

          So nobody at the Building Department would have 

imagined that there were only going to be three unrelated 

people in those eight-bedroom apartments, yet they are.

22

          So there are lots of different stories.  And we 

think in one of these cases -- I mean there's no parking on 

Harvard Street anyway, so it didn't make any difference.   

          So my suggestion to this petition is to leave all 

the present language in place, whatever it means, and add a 

new exception that says that you could have, you know, in a 

dwelling with multiple bedrooms, it's okay for as many 

unrelated people to live in a dwelling unit as there are 

bedrooms.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That will address what I think is 

the intention here, to legalize a common form of habitation.  

Put some limits on it, but --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I mean, and I guess I'll talk about 

say a fifth case, which is the Norris Street conversion of a 

French high school into as many rooms as can be packed into 

that very large building.  Some people will try to beat the 

system, and do something that really isn't right.   

          We attempted to restrict that to what seemed to be 

a reasonable number of dwelling units, and -- but I think we 

had received communications that the developer didn't 

49

actually follow the approved plans.  I don't know what 

happened to that complaint.   

          I think this is a -- it's a huge mess.  I think it 

would be good to legalize more households that are customary 

and not take on the big case because if we try to take it 

on, it will take forever to do it.  And I believe the 

present solution is worse than the status quo, present 

housing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Niko?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So I support the petition, and 

would probably go further than the petitioners and just 

delete the entire provision in the definitions of family.   

          So I don't think that the City of Cambridge should 

be in the business of defining a family, particularly not in 

the zoning code, or the zoning ordinance.  I don't think 

it's the legislator's place.   

          I think it's constitutionally vulnerable to start 

trying to decide what is a family, other than any definition 

that includes any group of people that constitute a family 

or live like a family or call themselves a family.  So 

attempting to get any more specific than that I think would 

be constitutionally vulnerable.

18

20

21

22

          And the work that this is doing in the ordinance 

is not obvious to me either, because to the extent that the 

current definition of "family" includes an undefined term 

that itself is not intuitive, like a single, non-profit 

housekeeping unit, which, to be honest it would never be my 

definition of a "family"--          

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]              

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  -- then it's not clear to me what 

role the current definition is playing throughout ordinance.  

So if the "family" provision of the zoning ordinance was 

simply deleted in its entirety, first it would be very 

similar to other terms in the zoning ordinance that are 

undefined, like, "multipurpose."   

          You know, there are some terms you don't need to 

define, because there are dictionary definitions of it, or 

there's intuitive definitions of it.  I think "family" is 

the archetypical example of something like that. 

          So then the net result is that everywhere else in 

the zoning ordinance where "family" is used would not be 

linked to something in the zoning ordinance, it would simply 

be intuitive or dictionary understanding of a family. 

          So everything that currently requires a family -- 

51

11

12

13

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

so, like, the definition of a dwelling unit or the car 

requirement or anything else wouldn't be referring to the 

zoning ordinance's definition of a family, it would just be 

a family.   

          And if anyone wanted to know more, they would 

think, "What is a family?"  And that would be probably 

better than whatever definition that the zoning ordinance 

itself would come up with. 

          So to the extent that the zoning ordinance should 

be further amended to incorporate other suggestions like, 

you know, making the parking requirement more restrictive or 

something, I think that can wait until a future ordinance, 

but I don't think that eliminating the definition of 

"family" here would actually do anything, other than remove 

what has been represented as doing harm. 

          So I don't see why this -- so I would just delete 

this entire definition, rather than keep some ambiguous 

phrasing on some non-profit unit and just say a "family" is 

what we think a family is.  We don't need the city to define 

it in this context, and I really just don't think there 

would be any negative consequences to that throughout the 

rest of the Zoning Board.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So I would say 

in general I agree with Ted, that it is an interesting 

issue, and I agree with everyone who says its an issue worth 

addressing and solving.   

          I think what I've heard from the Board is everyone 

agrees that the problem that has been brought to our 

attention is worth the attention of the City, even if it 

sounds like I'm also hearing that the exact proposal we have 

before us no one is interested in recommending it as written 

currently. 

          Niko, I heard you say you wanted to go further and 

just delete it altogether.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I mean, I would vote to recommend 

that the City Council adopt it with further deletion of the 

rest of --           

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.  So, but it -- 

I for one don't feel like I -- it's an interesting point.  I 

have not looked at the zoning ordinance enough to be 

personally satisfied that it really doesn't have any impact 

to take it out, although I like the simplicity of what 

you're saying.

           If that's all it takes, I think I could get on 

board with that, but I don't know that's all it takes, and I 

guess that's what I'm struggling with, is I haven't dug 

enough into all of the different places "family" appears 

within the code to get there. 

          I think -- so where I was coming to this evening 

was I think I would personally want to forward a 

recommendation that says we don't recommend adopting as 

proposed.  We do recommend that the CDD and the Law 

Department working together to figure out exactly how this 

plays out throughout the ordinance. 

          If it is as simple as just deleting it, do that 

immediately. And then I do think that the questions about 

parking and congregate housing. 

          And lodging house, it is deeply troubling to me 

that we have, you know, three different kinds of housing 

definitions in our zoning ordinance, and we're hearing that 

at least two of them are constitutionally questionable.  

That to me says that we should be taking this matter 

seriously and addressing it.   

          So I guess where -- I want to kind of circle back 

to what do we tell staff to write up?  I've heard a couple 

54

of good possible suggestions, but also some more nuanced 

opinions saying that even if we could enact the will of 

this, or the intent of this petition tonight, there are 

people who have hesitation about it if it doesn't include 

some other looks at, you know, matching with bedrooms or 

restricting parking and things like that.   

          So I'm definitely hearing that we don't want to 

support it as is, but I do want to kind of gather us around 

a consensus of, do we just convey the diversity of opinions 

and things, and ask that staff in the Law Department look 

into it more fully?   

          At which point, presumably an amended petition 

gets filed, and it all comes back to us and we say, "Okay, 

here are our options" or do we want to try to get kind of 

more consolidated around something that met?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  This is ultimately a political 

judgment to be made.  And then one possibility is that we 

could present legal counsel with the pros and the cons of 

this approach and let them make the political call.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think we as a Board don't have 

all the skills and the time to do the thinking through.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I think it's appropriate that 

the general form of the motion that we consider tonight 

would be as you stated it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And I guess the question is, you 

know, what are the ideas we think they should be studying?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That we've got one excellent idea 

from Niko, we've got my own attempt at an idea, which really 

came from the petitioner in a sense, for this presentation.  

Are there other ideas that we want to make sure get 

included?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I was just going to say I 

did not agree with Steve's proposal --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- because I think it may 

ultimately be a political decision for the City Council to 

make, but I don't think there's been enough examination yet 

to tell them what the pros and cons are.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I agree with you.

22

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And as attractive as Niko's 

suggestion is, you know, I just looked up "family" 

definitions, and the first one that pops up in Google is a 

group consisting of parents and children living together in 

a household, all the descendants of a common ancestor.  So 

presumably we don't like that definition.  Miriam Webster, 

you know, starts out with the same thing, but then goes into 

nontraditional families. 

          So I don't really think we want to just eliminate 

"family" and leave it up to a court at some point in time to 

determine what the City of Cambridge really meant. 

          And so, I think the issue needs to be studied, and 

a determination or proposal made as to what the city wants 

to -- position the city wants to take on it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So yeah, 

please, Niko.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So I also looked up dictionary 

definitions.  So the issue, though, is that the due process 

clause promotes a minimum floor, so the definition of what a 

"family" could possibly mean.   

          And for the city to engage in defining it any more 

specify than a group of people who are related, or who 

57

choose to live together, I actually don't even know if, 

"related" would be constitutionally satisfying, so. 

          To the extent that the definition goes undefined, 

the Constitutional four is satisfactory to me, and I think 

would be to the rest of the Planning Board too.  Because it 

would essentially just be people who are living together as 

a family.   

          So right now, what the petitioners are attempting 

to get rid of is this clause that's constitutionally 

unenforceable, because it's attempting to define a "family" 

by the second degree of kinship.   

          So no matter what, this clause is not doing any 

work, because it's not being possibly enforced, consistent 

with the federal Constitution.  So I would recommend that we 

recommend this petition, while also suggesting further 

changes, because at the very least, this clause is currently 

not -- it cannot be doing any work.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So rather than the Constitution 

arguing, I really appreciate the beauty of the thinking.  I 

go back to the preamble of the zoning here and the enabling 

acts, which suggest that the purpose of zoning -- one of its 

purposes -- is to prevent any crime.

22

          And so, that's why I find Hugh's suggestion 

appealing.  It would take physical limitations on the 

structure, maybe defined by bedroom, and then somehow equate 

that to the number of people.  It may or may not be on the 

permit to live there, irrespective of the relationship to 

one another.  I think that's -- I agree, I think we should 

move on that, absolutely. 

          And if there's some way to do that, it's like 1.  

5 persons per bedroom, how do you deal with the fact that 

people couple naturally -- that's a beautiful thing, and 

we're in support of that too.  So at this hour, I can't 

really figure out the right equation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think to get to the 

kind of Niko versus Ted dichotomy here, I think what I hear 

ted saying is that we should be looking for a word other 

than "family."  It is -- it's not -- and maybe that's me 

putting my own spin on it, but it's not that we should be in 

the business of defining families.   

          It's not that we necessarily -- you know, when we 

talk about the single non-profit housekeeping unit, it's -- 

comes closer to a value-neutral definition, but it's not -- 

I don't know what a housekeeping unit is.  My husband and I

don't cook and eat together more than, like, twice a month. 

And, you know, that -- are we a housekeeping unit?  

Probably.   

          But I do agree that we shouldn't be in the 

business of providing family.  I guess for me at least, and 

rather than speak for Ted, I think that means that we should 

be looking at the whole zoning ordinance and figuring out 

what is the definition that gets to occupant density, and 

what is the right way of addressing that.   

          And it may be that right now as a stopgap measure 

before we get to that, we say, "For now, eliminate the 

definition of "family" what kind of forces the issue and 

says, "You want to address this, you have to -- you know, 

take deliberate steps and not delay on figuring out what 

that alternative is."   

          But I think that we have to -- I do think we have 

to come up with an alternative to "family" if we're not 

going to define it.  I guess that's not -- and by "we" I 

mean the city, not this Board.   

          Yeah, Niko.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So I -- Ted can speak for himself, 

but I didn't interpret Ted's point to be necessarily that we

should look for an alternative to "family" --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Or at least I wouldn't advocate 

that personally, because I think "family" does do intuitive 

work when we talk about a single-family home.  I have 

something in mind, as I'm sure everyone else does.  The 

question is, do you get any more specific, then.   

          And so, I agree that a two-step solution seems 

good to me, and I would advocate, again, recommending this 

ordinance, but then adding a further modification, and then 

also suggesting to the extent that this does raise any 

concerns at the City Council here with things to 

investigate.  I think that would be a --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  -- a good solution there.  But I 

would prefer that solution to one that says we're going to 

leave this unenforceable, arbitrary and undefined definition 

of "family" in place until a better solution comes along, 

and in the meantime it still doesn't do any work.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, we've been 

speaking for you.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right, right.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We should get back to 

you.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm not saying that "family" 

shouldn't continue to exist, and there may --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- it may be that there's some 

alternative, and I certainly, you know, respect Niko's 

knowledge and point of view --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  But if we were going to say 

this is unconstitutional and unenforceable, I want the City 

Solicitor to tell me that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I agree, yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Rather than my own opinion, or 

any other Board member's opinion.  Because I think that's 

the City Solicitor's job and role is to advise us.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And I mean, I'll assume for a 

moment that Nike is 100 percent correct, but I --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  But she's also been 

clear it's her role to make those kinds of --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes, yes.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- announcements, and 

we should refrain from engaging in legal analysis.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So, where does 

that leave us?  We have certainly a list of potential ideas 

for how this can be studied, amended and researched, that 

I'm sure both CDD and the Law Department staff will be 

excited to undertake.   

          But I think we now have kind of two potentially 

competing visions of a recommendation, one that says "We're 

not recommending adoption," and one that says that we're 

recommendation adoption with a further change, essentially 

to eliminate the definition of, "family" with -- at the same 

time we're recommending that the impacts of this be further 

studied.  Where do Board members kind of fall on where we 

should end up on that?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, let me throw another 

possibility onto the equation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Couldn't we just ask the Law 

Department for their take on this legal question of "family" 

and whether or not this is still valid?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So we could.  My 

guess is by the time the Law Department answers that 

question, this petition will have expired anyway, and if the 

City Council were to wait for that, they would end up 

refiling something.  So it probably makes sense to pair that 

request with anything else we would like studied at this 

time.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Then I move for the second option.  

I move for the second option.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  That -- 

understood.  Other folks want to weigh in on what kind of --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I would simply observe the law 

and zoning aside for the moment, on the ground, the way real 

life is playing out --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Everything was just fine for the 

most part, the way we use things are not enforced in any way 

which compromises anybody's interest.  This is sort of an 

intellectual enterprise that we enter as a matter of 

principle, and perhaps political and moral entertainment. 

          And it's complicated, because every option seems 

to have certain consequences, and maybe unintended

consequences.  And it takes a lot of time and energy as 

well.  I would be inclined, as I said, you know, just leave 

things the way they are, and if and when there's actually a 

problem, our job is to address problems.  Now, there doesn't 

seem to be a problem. 

          And one thing, I'd also -- you mentioned about 

Hugh, your suggestion of one person bedroom:  Again, I 

remind you of the situation of the triple decker next to me.  

Three units, three bedrooms in each unit, two people live in 

each bedroom.  So suddenly I have six vehicles, it's 18 

people in the building. 

          And, you know, actually if we're going to do this, 

it's -- maybe you should just look at a purely practical 

basis, like that.  If that's okay, then who cares whether 

they're related or married or not?  If it's okay to have 

that many people, adults in a unit, then let it be.  

          I just think this is such an -- a challenging 

moral and legal and practical sort of thing, I think things 

are fine the way they are.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So I hear one 

for recommending against it option.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Two.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Two for recommending 

against it operation.  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Three.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, I'd be against it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

All right.  So Hugh?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I realize that my suggestion is 

actually counter to expressed city policy on certain 

grounds.  A married couple with one child can legally occupy 

a two-bedroom apartment, according to the Affordable Housing 

Authority, et cetera, et cetera.   

          And then there's the guy who lives next to me now 

with his wife in one unit of three units in the other 

building.  But when he was a kid, he lived with seven 

siblings in the house on the other side of me, and it was 

only the top floor of that house, which as far as I know, 

has five, maybe six rooms.  It must have had at least 10 

people living there.  That wasn't changed. 

          But -- and I think maybe that's the point.  

Families are constantly changing from the statistic, when 

each family changes, and the -- what's typical in one year

is different in 10 or 20 or 30 years back or forward.  So we 

need -- so I think I'm asking that my suggestion become more 

generic than just one for one, because it doesn't actually 

work.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  On the arithmetic, you're 

thinking about the zoning with its charts.  Could it be -- 

you know, this is -- I'm, I don't think we're going to 

reasonably figure this all out tonight, but it could be, you 

know, sort of number of bedrooms plus one.  So the two-

bedroom could have a three -- three bedroom could be four, 

and then a seven-bedroom…  I don't know --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah.               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- you know, maybe there's an 

exponential curve to it, but -- and then you get into, we 

should vote for however we want to call it, you know, so.   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah.              

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So something has to be done.  I 

wouldn't adopt this petition per se.  It addresses a real 

need for many people and who are nontraditional families, 

that this community absolutely endorses all kinds of --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  And I do take the kind of liberty 

that Niko has on our issue.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, so then what --

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I'm going to listen.  I hope you 

don't think that this is -- what did you call it, political 

and moral entertainment?  I think the fact that this 

petition has been brought suggests it's the exact opposite.  

People are feeling like the city as a matter of law is 

excluding them and passing them and it's nontraditional or 

alien to think we ought to do something about that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I didn't interpret this proposal 

that way.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Well, I think 

what I am hearing is that there are -- there is even within 

this Board a pretty wide swath of views on whether there's a 

problem and how big a problem, if there is.   

          But it sounds like we have a majority of the Board 

who's favoring a negative recommendation on the petition as 

drafted, but thinks it is appropriate to request that staff 

in the Law Department look at the issue seriously. 

          There have been several good suggestions here in 

terms of looking at occupancy based on number of bedrooms,

not defining, "family" at all, looking into the definition 

of "non-profit" housekeeping units.  What am I missing?  Oh, 

parking -- looking at whether parking ratios would need to 

be adjusted.   

          But analyzing the potential impact of addressing 

this important issue, so that a comprehensive petition could 

be drafted and brought back, which we recognize takes time.  

          But I think there are several Board members here 

who recognize this there is a harm being done by having a 

definition of "family" that is exclusionary in its language, 

whether it's intended to be or not, and we do need to 

address it.   

          So, with that summary of what I think I've heard 

from the Board as a recommendation, does someone want to 

move that we forward that recommendation to the Council?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So moved.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Seconded.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor?  

What is this?  Four -- seven voting in favor.  All those 

opposed?  All those abstaining.  One abstaining.

Ragno, R-a-g-n-o.  Mr. Ragno is the Founder and Principal of 

King Street Properties and his colleague, Tyson Ronoso, R-o-

n-o-s-o, a high-level executive with the company -- I'm sure 

he's got a title.   

          So we were last here on December 17.  We may look 

familiar to you.  There was a holiday spirit in the air, the 

hearing was going great.  We started at this end of the 

room, we were really getting excited, and then we kind of 

took a corner here, and things kind of slowed down.   

          But we got the coal out of the stocking, and we 

started looking at the issues that you challenged us with.  

And the good news is we've had three months to engage in 

such a review.   

          And I'm pleased report that we've made good use of 

the time.  A number of significant events have occurred in 

the life of this application since we were last before you.   

          Most notably, we have amended the application to 

include the special permit for retail, because in this 

office district that was not allowed use, notwithstanding 

all the retail benefits that are cited in the Envision and 

Alewife plans, we need a special permit to have it therapy.  

          But perhaps more significantly, we now have a PTDM

plan approved by the PTM Planning Officer.  We have an 

agreed upon Traffic Mitigation Package with the Traffic 

Department.               

          There was appropriate concern about the 

appropriateness of the parking supply, and we came up with I 

think what might be seen as a bit of a novel approach here 

on the parking supply.   

          You may recall there is an existing building that 

has leases on parking, and then we have the new building, 

and we've worked out a phasing schedule that actually 

contemplates a reduction of parking in the future, as leases 

turn over. 

          Just as importantly, we received on January 27 

approval from the Conservation Commission for an Order of 

Conditions.  The project, as you are aware, is in the flood 

plain.  We are seeking a flood plain special permit, as part 

of the special permits in this application. 

          You'll also notice in tonight's presentation that 

the application has been able to improve the sustainability 

level of the building.  The building which was before you 

last, reaching for Silver certification, is now targeted as 

Gold certification under the LEED standards.

          So Mr. Ronoso will take you through all of those 

things, but the other big component that we will hear about 

tonight is the challenge that we received around trees and 

the opportunity for the creation of trees.   

          There is one issue about the plan that I want to 

draw to the Board's attention, and that is the proposed 

Multi-Use Path.   

          When we originally filed the application, the 

Multi-Use Path was proposed on our property.  We were 

challenged by the Community Development Department to see if 

arrangements could be made with the MBTA to acquire access 

across their property and get a more advantageous alignment 

of this path. 

          And King Street did success in acquiring a license 

from the MBTA, and what's before the Board tonight are 

actually two proposals involving that path.  The license is 

no longer in question.  The issue is one of jurisdiction at 

the Conservation Commission.  The area of the MBTA land 

constitutes a separate filing, separate and apart from the 

NOI associated with this application. 

          And candidly, we received some mixed reaction when 

this was first broached at the Conservation Commission, 

73

which was somewhat surprising, but upon reflection 

appropriate.  We did have an opportunity to make an 

information presentation to them a few weeks ago, and we are 

scheduled to return, and Doug Hartnett will be happy to give 

details. 

          But it is a case where there is a riverbank here, 

and there was concern -- there is concern about it.  Suffice 

it to say, this seems to be a balancing of some interests.  

The Bicycle and Pedestrian Committee, and certainly the 

Planning Staff at CDD encourage us to get the path as soon 

as possible out of the parking lot, remove the conflict with 

the vehicles, particularly the delivery that’s occurring in 

the rear of the property. 

          So we remain enthusiastic about the proposal to 

use the license that we've acquired from the MBTA.  I just 

wanted to point out to the Board's attention in the event we 

do not receive the necessary approval from the Conservation 

Commission, we would ask that the decision reflect the 

ability to use the path.  That's what we are calling Option 

B or Plan 2.   

          So that is one unique component of this thing, 

that there is an alternative path on our property in the 

74

event the Conservation Commission doesn't provide the needed 

approval for the path on that property. 

          And Mr. Hartnett could go through some of the 

specifics of it.  It would be a boardwalk-style path across 

some wetlands area or resource area that’s important, but it 

would be very consistent with the path network that's out in 

the reservation now that goes out to Discovery Park and 

other parts.   

          So, as I said, it's been designed.  Its width and 

particularly its alignment is lined up to be right in line 

with the path across the street.  And we think it's an 

important component of the bicycle network.  So it will 

exist.  The question is whether it exists on the MBTA 

property, or exclusively on our property. 

          So having said that, if there are no questions, 

Mr. Ronoso would be happy to take you through the changes.     

          TYSON RONOSO:  Good evening.  Tyson Ronoso.  Good 

evening.  My name is Tyson Ronoso with King Street 

Properties.  Address is 800 Boylston Street, Boston.  So Jim 

stole most of my thunder as usual, but we'll -- in the 

spirit of keeping the presentation short and concise 

tonight,  I know we like to keep it under 20 minutes --

we've structured the presentation to just cover the major 

categories, comments we've received from the Board at the 

last Planning Board hearing on December 17. 

          You can see the outline here.  I will speak 

through the first few items here.  I'll turn it over to 

Randy Kreie, Principal of Randy Kreie, Principal of Dimella 

Shaffer, to speak to a few following -- myself, and then 

heal turn it over to Doug Hartnett, Principal of High Point 

Engineering, to cover the last item.   

          So general categories we received for comments 

were the Multi-Use Bike Path, and where we stood with the 

Conservation Commission; retail space in our building and 

enlarging that; parking; PTDM; sustainability, streetscape, 

façade design, trees, and the last flood resiliency. 

          So just to give you context, I think everybody 

probably knows the site pretty well.  But just to refresh 

everyone's memory here, the subject site is highlighted in 

orange, with the building that is sited behind the subject.  

          The new building is 87 Cambridge Park Drive, and 

the proposed development site is on a parking lot in front 

of 87 CPD.  This site is located in the Triangle District, 

right adjacent to the Alewife T station.

          So I'll be a little repetitive here to what Jim 

just said, but touching a little more on the details of the 

-- of both bike path options we've included in the proposal, 

and Mary's both. 

          So what you see on the left here in the slide is 

our base, Multi-Use Path Connection Plan, which is the 

preferred option.  We agree with the Board that this is the 

preferred option.  And this involves the path crossing over 

the MBTA property at the upper right corner of the site.   

          So it's the point at where they could point to 

this more specifically, but as you follow the bike path up 

on the right side of the plan, you see that it transitions 

across the property line to a small section that's 

highlighted in brown; that’s the elevated section of the 

path to clear the critical component of the riverfront area.   

          And so, the path is in an elevated boardwalk 

section at the point, and then transitions down to grade.  

From there as it curves to the northwest, and then 

eventually connects up to the Fitchburg Cutoff Path. 

          A portion of that on grade path in the MBTA 

property is actually pervious pavement.  A portion of the 

path up here is actually pervious pavement.  This is the

elevated section of the path right here. And as part of this 

proposal, we would be removing some select trees in this 

area to put the path in place.   

          As compensation for that mitigation, we would be 

proposing to plant quite a few new trees and shrubs -- 

native plantings in this area. 

          You can see the circles with the -- more of the 

circular green shapes, or the existing trees, and the fluffy 

looking, colored trees are the new plantings. 

          So quite a bit of new plantings we're proposing to 

remove -- invasive species in the area -- clean up the 

debris that's back there today, really make a nice visual, 

safe connection between the Bike Path and Cambridge Park 

Drive. 

          On the right side, you see the alternate, I'll 

call it fallback option for the Bike Path.  And this -- the 

reason the plan up here, everything from here down is the 

same as this plan.   

          So the only difference here is the Bike Path, how 

it stays on our site and on our property, instead of 

continuing straight through the MBTA parcel, as the plan on 

the left shows.

          I did want to point out one improvement we made to 

this plan since the initial filing was that initially 

bicyclists and pedestrians stayed on this shared driveway 

connection.   

          Whereas the new plan, we've actually -- it's quite 

subtle, but right here you can see that we're creating a 

separated pedestrian path from where this splits, so that 

pedestrians would continue on and actually connect with the 

existing footpath that's in the MBTA land today. 

          So pedestrians would not be -- would not walk out 

onto the shared driveway with bicyclists to get back to the 

Fitchburg Cutoff Path.  Again, the right-side plan is the 

fallback option, but we wanted to include both in the 

filing. 

          The next comment we received was on the retail 

space.  And we have addressed that in a few ways.  So the 

first way that we looked at the this was we engaged a retail 

consultant to study the retail supply in the Triangle, 

including both existing and future retail establishments, 

and what you see in the red or orange circle is the existing 

retail establishments on the street. 

          And in yellow is the future retail space on the 

79

street.   

          So after doing this analysis, the existing retail 

on the street totals about 24,000 square feet, and the 

yellow circles show, you know, future retail space coming to 

the street totals about 16,000 square feet. 

          Given these facts and that Cambridge Park Drive 

today is not a destination retail location, the conclusion 

is that our retail space plan for 101 Cambridge Park Drive 

is appropriately sized as is, given the existing and the 

future retail space coming to the street. 

          However, we did not stop there.  We took that 

information, we tried to take it a step further in improving 

our plan.  So we did a couple things.  We slightly increased 

the size of the retail space, we acknowledged this minor 

increase, but it is an increase. 

          We moved the door from the retail space from the 

east-facing side of the first floor of the building around 

to the south-facing side of the street.  And one of the 

bigger improvements we made was converting this entire 

retail space on the left side of the plan into future 

retail-ready space. 

          So I don't know if you recall the prior filing 

80

didn't have pedestrian access right here along the building.  

We've created pedestrian access, both with a stair here and 

an accessible access, and added doors here.  So if the 

demand is there in the future for retail on this side of the 

building, then these can easily be converted into a retail 

tenant.   

          The next comment was just generally parking supply 

and our status with the PTDM plan.  So Jim touched on these.  

I'll just -- let me say them one more time.  A PTDM plan was 

approved January 14, includes a novel concept to reduce the 

parking supply for 87 Cambridge Park Drive, the existing 

building, as leases roll over in that building. 

          Our parking supply for the project was reduced for 

the new building to the zoning minimum, 0.95, and we've 

agreed on the mitigation package with TP+T. 

          And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy to go 

over the next three items.   

          RANDY KREIE:  My name is Randy Kreie, K-r-e-i-e, 

Principal at Dimella Shaffer Associates in Boston, 31 Summer 

Street.  As we started looking at the questions that came up 

last time regarding sustainability, there were several 

improvements that we decided to explore.  And the first one 

81

being we are now going to LEED Gold, so that was mentioned 

by Jim, and that's a significant improvement.   

          We're changing the glazing too.  As we went 

through all the exterior façade development and reworked 

some of the details, and so forth, we worked really hard to 

try to reduce the total amount of glazing, but still get the 

look and feel of the building we had before.   

          We reduced it from roughly 55 percent to 38 

percent now, which is a significant reduction, which helps 

us in our energy points.  We've reduced our energy 

consumption with improvements to the building envelope, as 

well as to some of the equipment and so forth.   

          So we're working hard to make as many improvements 

as we can on the energy, given the type of building this is. 

          Streetscape came up with a lot of comments, both 

some comments here and some comments from staff.  And to 

start with, on the front streetscape, there were some 

discussions about having accessibility, whether you come 

from east or west of the building, and how does that work? 

          One of the big questions that we were able to 

solve was before we had an area way intake here, which 

really prevented us from really using that space.  We 

82

actually pulled the storefront back just a little bit right 

here, and that gave us enough area to pull that into the 

corner. 

          And you'll see when we looked at the elevations, 

that that's now integrated into the building footprint in a 

nice way, as it buries itself in the landscape, the way it 

feels like part of the building.   

          But it frees up this entire front façade now for -

- as Tyson mentioned -- the retail entries into the 

building, as well as this new stairway, and the successful 

walk, the sloped walk, not a ramp, up to the main entry, as 

well as then the rise to get you up to the floor retail 

level of the space. 

          And we also have that same opportunity over on the 

other side, with the entry facing now the front, and the 

retail, the sloped walk having underneath the cover of the 

building.   

          All of this design now is integrated with the 

design of the landscape that's between the two buildings, 

between 87 and 101 Cambridge Park Drive.  So it's all of a 

similar style and design.   

          So we still managed to keep all of the kind of 

83

activity on the street at the corner, which we think is 

really important to connect with the retail and give the 

retail an opportunity to succeed with outdoor seating and so 

forth. 

          And then one other big improvement was the 

addition of the cycle track.  This came as a suggestion that 

we include that in the project, we have done that now.  And 

a couple of comments that we've heard since then is we may 

need some better connectivity between the sidewalk and the 

parking areas to the sidewalk. 

          So we've tried to enlarge those tree wells to help 

those trees survive, but we might have to have a few more 

connections there.  So we'll work on that with staff, 

continue to work on that with staff. 

          This is just an exterior view of what that starts 

to look like as the streetscape, showing again this 

opportunity for activity here at the entry, and the entry in 

the distance here, and the sloped walk here, and the entry 

now facing the street. 

          This is that areaway that allows us to get intake 

air to the garage.  So you can see how that's integrated 

into the base of the building and feels like it's part of

the building basin, and fits within the style of the 

building from the western side. 

          As we started looking at some of the comments 

about façade detailing, we tried to step through those and 

just walk through the major items that were discussed.   

          One of the items that came up was making sure that 

all the columns fell behind solid elements of the building, 

which we have done that now everywhere in the building, 

except for where we have, like, the glazed elements of the 

glass boxes, the retail spaces and so forth.   

          So that happens all the way up there through the 

building, even though the building moves -- these building 

elements moved side to side, the columns are always behind a 

solid element now.  So we've taken that comment to heart, 

and really solved that problem. 

          There was a comment about can we do something to 

mitigate the scale and the size of the penthouse enclosure?  

We've done that by actually stepping the penthouse enclosure 

back in multiple ways.   

          And one of the big benefits of that is when you 

step it back on the most prominent corner of the building, 

it really starts to make the penthouse look shorter.  So by

stepping that back, it has a big impact on what that starts 

to look like. 

          In looking at some of the finer details, there is 

a question about -- you know, I think this was interrupted 

previously by the glass box feeling like they intersected.  

We want to make sure that that now rises over the top of 

that box and continues on, and the box slides in from 

underneath it. 

          Some of the finer details about how these -- the 

banding works -- is the brick slides up underneath the 

banding and sits on top of the banding as if it's a beam.  

So that continues to be part of the detailing language of 

the building. 

          And then that's carried through to the base, to 

make sure that -- I think there was a comment about does the 

brick sit on the base, or does it overhang?  I think the 

last rendering made it feel like it overhung, but the 

intention was always to make sure it sits on the base. 

          And then in a similar way, the way the banding 

works, that happens at the top of the building as well. 

          So as you start to think about what the building 

looks like now, this is just a series of views.  We took the

trees away, so you can see a broader view of the building 

without the trees in the way and how that works.  This is 

the bike path that connects to the estuary on the Bluebikes 

station and the space between the two buildings. 

          We started to detail the guards around the 

openings of the deck areas, and then just further detailing 

of how this starts to look in the space between the 

buildings. 

the project.   

          There have been -- there were a few comments about 

trees last time, and I know that's an important element of 

          This latest site plan suggests a few things.  One 

is even though these don't count towards our totals, there's 

opportunity to plant three street trees along here to fill 

in some gaps that exist in the streets.  They're doing that.  

One of them happens to be where a curb cut was that's being 

removed.   

          And we've added trees up along this side of the 

site, and we know that we have to be very careful with the 

size of those root balls, because there's utilities going up 

there.  So we're in discussion with the City Staff about, 

you know, how big those trees can be and so forth, but we're

coordinating that.   

          There are now six trees back here that are being 

transplanted, rather than four before, and then even though 

these don't count for a total of two, as Tyson mentioned, if 

we have the opportunity for the MBTA parcel, we'll be able 

to add plantings back there as well. 

          The net result of this, though, is a huge 

improvement.  Our deficit was 118 inches -- caliper inches -

- now we're down to 75, which is a 70 percent improvement.  

So that's a huge improvement on the caliper inch approach. 

          I'll let Doug talk about resiliency.   

          DOUG HARTNET:  Thank you, Randy.  Doug Harnet, 

High Point Engineering.  There we were a couple of comments 

from the Board members at the last meeting, that was clear 

that the presentation that we did may not have been entirely 

clear as it related to flood resiliency, but perhaps more so 

as it relates to how the flood compensation, the groundwater 

and the stormwater all kind of interrelate. 

          So what we've done is we've created a few slides 

to help clarify some of the questions the Board may have 

had.  This first slide is basically a section of the site.  

You're looking at the parking garage ramp and entry in this 

88

area here.   

          This is the plaza area here, and then this is the 

entry vestibule on the 87 Cambridge Park Drive side of the 

building.  So you're basically looking north of the 

vestibule as you step out onto the plaza area. 

          Based on the soils investigations that we've done, 

we know that the site is underlain by basically an 

impervious layer of clay that’s many, many, many feet thick.  

And above that clay is a sand and silt layer, approximately 

six feet.  And within that sand and silt layer, our 

groundwater table -- it's really a perched water table that 

rides on top of the clay.  And it varies in elevation, 

depending on time of year and rainfall and so forth. 

          Above this area is the proposed work, as it 

relates to the plaza.  And this area here is our underground 

attention system.  What that does is that collects 

stormwater from the building and the site and the parking 

areas, and it controls the peak rate of runoff to comply 

with the Cambridge DPW Stormwater Management Regulations. 

          Above that is some general fil and stone, it's 

about three feet thick between the top of the system and the 

-- what would be the surface of the grated area below the 

89

deck.   

          And then up here is the actual elevated deck 

above.  And if you recall from our presentation in December, 

the area in here, between the finished grade and the deck, 

is the area that we provide compensatory flood storage to 

meet both the special permit requirements for the flood 

plain, as well as the Wetlands Protection Act requirements 

for protection of that resource area. 

          So again, you can see the water table in here.  It 

fluctuates within the sand and silt.  The clay is in here.  

This is our drainage system.  This is under kind of a 

normal, non-rainfall type of day.   

          This slide may not look like it changed much when 

I flipped it over, but we're looking -- we're calling this 

our normal rainfall slide.  So you get a rainfall of a half 

an inch to three or four inches of rain. 

          The way it's designed is that the underground 

attention system for the stormwater -- again, collects water 

from the roofs, collects water from the surface of the plaza 

area, and the adjacent parking and driveways, collects it, 

controls the outflow, and discharges it to the street.   

          And you can see in here, you would get some water

within the plaza underneath the decking, as is per the 

design.  And that water would flow down into the base -- 

into the underground attention, through basically lawn 

drains, if you've seen a lawn drain.  You see them outside 

and some of the commercial spaces are maybe a little of the 

universities.  And then -- so that's the way that would 

look.   

          Under a 100-year event, which is really the design 

parameters that we're bound by to meet the requirements for 

the bylaw, as well as for the Wetlands Protection Act, this 

shows you the relevant elevations of what would be the 100-

year flood elevation at elevation 18'4", the graded 

elevation underneath the decking of elevation 17.6 you have 

basically 10 inches of water level within that space below 

the decking. 

          And then the water level itself is approximately 

11 inches below the deck under the 100-year event. 

          The underground detention area would be fully 

filled with water, because under that event it's -- the 

whole area is just basically underwater, and it's all 

interconnected with the drainage system within Cambridge 

Park Drive and with the Alewife Brook, which is adjacent to

the site.   

back to normal. 

          And those floodwaters would add, obviously, once 

the rainfall time period had expired, and everything gets 

          What we wanted to show you is that it was never 

intended that this floodwaters and stormwater were 

interconnected with the groundwater.  That's not the way it 

was originally designed.  I think that might have been one 

of the problems we had, we were trying to clarify for the 

Board.   

          This detention system is designed to be slightly 

above the seasonal high-water table, as it was established, 

and actually has an impervious liner to keep the water from 

the stormwater coming down into the ground.  And that's a 

requirement for the DPW in terms of the design of it. 

          So I hope that that clarifies how the 

interrelationship of groundwater, stormwater and floodwaters 

all work within the site.  That concludes my comments on 

this.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          DOUG HARTNETT:  Thank you, Jim.   

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  That effectively concludes our

presentation, which was focused on all the supplemental 

information.  Just a reminder to the Board, our Traffic 

Engineer, David Black from VHB, is here.  He presented and 

answered questions at the last hearing.  We didn't have 

anything new.   

          The TIS has been certified, but there is the memo 

from the Traffic Department that reflects the change in the 

parking supply and agreement upon mitigation, including 

infrastructure improvements related to the form that the 

Traffic Department is now settled upon in the area, and King 

Street is a willing participant, and sees the wisdom and the 

benefits of making such contributions. 

          So that concludes our presentation.  Of course, we 

are available for any questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Do Board 

members have questions for the applicant?  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So this is a question prompted by 

Doug Brown's memo to us.  As I see it, the floor elevation 

in the new building is principally a 22.6, the other is an 

electric vault, an electric drain at those elevations.   

          And the floor elevation of the existing building 

is several feet lower, I believe. 

93

          So the Public Works memo was that they gave you 

design elevations to work for for the 2070 condition.  But 

they really didn't tell us what those elevations were, and 

so, I'm curious to know do they represent a -- what event in 

2070 does a 22.5 resist?   

          DOUG HARTNETT:  I'm sorry, I didn't catch the very 

end of what you just said, but are you asking for the 

elevations of each of those?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I'm asking what storm event, 

what elevations --  

          DOUG HARTNETT:  Yeah.     

          TYSON RONOSO:  Madam Chair, the Commissioner's 

mic's not on.    

on?  Nope.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Can you turn your mic 

          TYSON RONOSO:  Yep, so if you look at the floor 

plans in the package, and can flip to them -- So if you look 

at the floor plans in your package, you'll see that the 

predominant elevation of the first floor of the building is 

22 foot six inches.  That’s the elevation of the 2070 one-

hundred-year flood event.   

          So we've -- we're passively protected against the

2070 one-hundred-year flood event.  Does that answer the 

question?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That answers the question, and I 

guess I want some comment about what happens to the existing 

building that's several feet lower?     

          TYSON RONOSO:  It's -- we acknowledge the existing 

building is lower.  That was not part of our proposal.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Do you own the existing building?     

          TYSON RONOSO:  Yes, we do.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions for 

the petitioner?  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Could you just bring up the slide 

which shows Plan B, the two path points.  I just have a 

quick question about that.   

          So in looking at the scripting, maybe I'm a victim 

of the fact that it's on two different scales, but the 

alternative Multi-Use driveway appears to be a smaller 

dimension -- is that simply because I'm looking at two 

different scales? And it seems to get down there and be 

smaller.   

          And to this Planning Board member's -- that's more 

desirable than the one on the left-hand side, which shows a

-- works for you, then I mean --    

          TYSON RONOSO:  So what you're seeing here is 

actually the same width as this plan, but this actually has 

a painted line striping in green, to signify that that's the 

shared bicycle portion of the driveway.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Any further 

questions?  Okay.  Yep, Hugh?            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So on that same slide, he said that 

the bikes were separated from the pedestrians. It appears 

there is a footpath through the woods.  And so, that's what 

would remain for pedestrians, an unimproved -- if the 

Conservation Commission, or something else that the 

Conservation Commission will approve?     

          TYSON RONOSO:  Correct.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay?  Okay, then we 

can move to public comment.  Has any -- no one has signed 

up.  If there -- is there anyone present who wants to be 

included on this matter, then?  Okay.  Seeing none, going 

once, twice.  All right.   

          So we move to Board discussion, questions, further 

comments and whether or not we're ready to move forward with

this petition.   

          Who wants to kick us off?  Steve, how about you?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure.  I'm not going to comment 

on the engineering.  I defer to all of the experts and the 

engineers.  Tonight I will only comment on what I see in the 

slides.  And that is a very positive commentary.  I really 

like the interplay of glass.   

          And there's a certain irregularity related to it 

which is very appealing, and I think it's more than anything 

that's going to come our way, to my eye, anyway.   

          So based primarily on those aesthetics, and even 

through the other materials, and the other issues, the ones 

that have been addressed to my mind, I'm -- you know, 

thinking very positive on the application at this point, and 

I would be ready to vote tonight.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  So I'm happy with either of the Bike 

Path connections, although I do prefer the first one 

suggested.  So I'm hopeful the Conservation Commission will 

agree.   

          And I think the design is improved, and the only 

thing I still have a concern about is the size of the

mechanicals.   

          And here you've done a very nice job of trying to 

step it back and make it more fluid, so it's not a solid 

block.  And I really appreciate that corner. 

          But it still seems just really big.  So I would 

just encourage you as you go through further variations of 

this with the CDD, you know, if you can help with any other 

ideas for trying to reduce or minimize the mass of that, it 

would be appreciated.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And I think you've done a 

great job on the rest of the plan.  I'm just curious about 

the groundwater still.  What impact will the existing 

building and all the extra around the existing building do 

to your numbers?  Have you calculated al that into your 

drainage?   

          I'm curious, you're very close to Freeport on that 

deck.  Worried that this will flood when it gets a little 

bit more rain than you're expecting from your side.  It gets 

it from the other side. 

          Roof liters, that roadway, where does it drain, 

where does it drain, what is the general pitch of this whole

site?  I'm curious area of the elevations.   

          DOUG HARTNETT:  Sure.  This is a good plan to 

refer to.  So essentially, the building, the plaza, and the 

driveway all discharge to the underground attention area 

that I showed on the prior slide.   

          And the underground attention area essentially 

falls within this footprint, and slightly up along the east 

side of 87 Cambridge Park Drive.   

          So from the stormwater perspective, the design 

complies with the mitigation from the two to twenty-five-

year storm, as required by DPW for the Stormwater 

Management, especially for the Alewife area. 

          And so, we're confident that we've been able to 

achieve that, and the initial review of our calculations 

from the DPW seems to support that.   

          Regarding the floodwaters, elevation 18.4 is the 

100-year flood elevation.  That's the FEMA flood elevation.  

The plaza deck is elevation 19.6.  And so, to your point on 

the freeway, that gives you an additional 11 inches of flood 

storage, if you will, within the plaza, that would not be -- 

so you would not impact the plaza with the additional 

floodwaters.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  What happens if you include 

all the -- and does it pitch back, or does it pitch to the 

existing building, to the roadway from your new project back 

to your delivery area for the existing building?  Where does 

that water go?   

          DOUG HARTNETT:  We've collected the water from 

about to here, and we've -- what we've done is we've taken 

the 87 Cambridge Park building, and we've bypassed that 

drainage down and through.  So we've mitigated for our site 

up to where we've made the improvements.   

          And then the 87 basically connects downstream of 

the underground detention area, and then discharges out to 

the Cambridge Park Drive the way it does do that.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I guess the calculations 

include both the new pipe size and so forth.   

          DOUG HARTNETT:  Yes, absolutely.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Because if one's going the 

other way -- thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, I'm at the corner, but let 

me see if I can turn this.  3 months, big difference.  I 

appreciate the effort both to refine the details of the

architecture, strive for reduction in the amount of glazing 

so a higher performance on the EUI and in review of the 

detail of the planning, the analysis here is pretty striking 

in how low the amount of energy the building actually is 

going to be using for not building, it's pretty laudable. 

          So, you know, I think that's terrific.  Relocating 

the extra trees, making an effort to steward the inventory 

that's there is very much appreciated.  I think you will 

regret that you're still running a deficit in terms of the 

quanper inch, but I'm sure I'm being told that that's 

because we're eliminating the invasive species.   

          So I'm pleased with the effort that the 

petitioners put in, and actually it makes me feel good that 

the Planning Board can come to have a positive effect, 

despite its limitations.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So my -- can almost just second 

Tom's comments.  I think it made a significant difference, 

reduced the amount of glass by 31 percent.  That changed.  

I'm a little sad, because I think the original building 

looked a little slicker, but it's right thing to do.   

          And the way I count trees, they're actually ahead,

because the city calculation doesn't allow them to count the 

trees that that are off their site.   

          So they’ve really met the spirit, and exceeded the 

spirit I think significantly.  And I mean I challenged them 

to do everything they could do, and it seems like they've 

done that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And so, I'm happy to support this 

project at this point in time.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I really have nothing to add.  

I mean, I was comfortable with it last time, until that end 

raised a lot of issues, and then I see what's been done.    

          And, you know, yes it is one of -- an open space 

right now that we'll be losing, but on the other hand, 

there's a lot of open-air parking that's being eliminated.   

          So I think in the long run it's a good project, 

and I like the possibility of additional retail on the other 

side of the building in the event there is a demand for it. 

          So I'm fine with it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Niko?

also second Ted's comment about the retail.  I was pleased 

to see that addition to the plan, and I was glad that the 

extra time you were able to spend with Traffic and Parking 

and the PTDM officer led to a way forward that would allow 

you to honor the existing leases, while still coming up with 

a future plan that allows you to step down the amount of 

parking as those tendencies change over time.   

          I thought that was a really good approach that 

addressed your legitimate real estate interests, but still 

achieved the city's goals of getting towards that parking 

ratio that's been talked about in Envision Cambridge and 

before that. 

          So I think one of the things that Traffic and 

Parking's memo specify asks that the Board -- we often 

reference PTDM plans and incorporate them, but Traffic and 

Parking specifically asked that we explicitly say in our 

conditions that they are allowed to reduce the parking over 

time without coming --        

          COLLECTIVE:  Yes.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- back to us within 

those guidelines.  So I want to get that on the record that

we are supportive of that, that we appreciate the work 

you've done with staff to get to that point, so that we have 

a way forward on that.   

          Like my fellow Board members, I like the base 

Multi-Use Path connection, but certainly I understand the 

alternate is a viable alternative in the event Conservation 

Commission says that they need you to do that.  Yeah.  

That's all I have to say on that. 

          Other than the continuing Design Review items in 

CDD's memo and the conditions -- the agreed upon conditions 

that are in Traffic and Parking's memo, are there other 

conditions or things we want staff to keep an eye on going 

forward on this?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Just the mechanical.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I think the -- 

right, sorry.  You were saying talking about the rooftop 

mechanicals --      

          MARY FLYNN:  The rooftop mechanicals, yeah.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right, as opposed to 

the ones that are at the base level, and they have to pay 

attention to flooding.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  The rooftops?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, rooftops.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Got it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  And I think, you know, again, 

you made tremendous strides but, you know, a little tweaking 

here and there sometimes can help.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.  That -- I think 

that's a good reminder to we'd always like to see them 

smaller, we'd always like to see them magically disappear 

and against the background.  But anything you can do; it is 

amazing how those continue to grow and mushroom after a 

project leaves here.  Okay.   

          So with that, I can walk through the findings for 

the various special permits.  Jeff, I'm not seeing 

immediately in the criteria that we have one for allowing 

retail.  Do we have separate criteria for that, or is that a 

general special permit?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the retail, along with the FAR 

height and yard will be --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- are all part of the Alewife 

Overlay District.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And so, the criteria are -- 

actually if you look on page 2 of the memo, it's the second 

row from the bottom that lays out the -- just the --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- standards for retail, and the 

main finding is the project for most of the general interest 

of the larger commercial and residential neighborhood.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you.  I 

was looking at the -- not the memo itself, but your summary 

document of the findings.  Okay.  All right.   

          Then I will quickly walk through these, remind the 

Board of all the findings that we need to make with regard 

to the various special permits requested. 

          So the project will have no substantial adverse 

impact on city traffic within the city area upon review of 

the traffic impact indicators analyzed by the TIS, and 

including the mitigation efforts proposed. Traffic and 

Parking is certified to that effect.   

          And the project is consistent with the Urban 

Design objectives of the city.   

          The project promotes the general interest of the

larger commercial and residential neighborhood, as noted in 

Section 20.92 and is consistent with the goals, objectives 

and guidelines established in the Concord Alewife Plan. 

          I'm not going to go through the individual sub 

bullets on that, but Board members have seen those before 

and have them in front of them.   

          Construction in the flood plain Overlay District, 

no encroachment of the floodway displacement of water 

retention capacity is allowed unless fully offset.  I have 

the DPW's memo to that effect.   

          Floodwater systems shall not cause nuisance, 

hazard or detriment.   

          The development is consistent with zoning area 

plans and guidelines and applicable laws, including Wetlands 

Protection Act, and has been reviewed by the City Engineer 

and the Conservation Commission.  So they have each been 

reviewed already and will continue to have review as the 

project more fully goes through with design and engineering. 

          For all uses listed in Section 4.35, that's the 

retail section, no individual establishment exceeds 10,000 

square feet.  It's located on the first floor of the 

basement.   

107

          Total floor GFA does not exceed 10 percent of the 

building, and we can waive any of those limitations if it's 

in the general interests of the neighborhood. 

          And then we have our general Special Permit 

Criteria, which everyone should be able to see. 

          So just to confirm, the Board feels comfortable 

that we can make all the necessary findings?  Yes, Hugh.     

          COLLECTIVE:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So as the parking in the 

underground garage is decreased --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- I think the PTDM plans says we 

have to block the office spaces.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Would it be possible to block off 

spaces and break through to the retail and combine using the 

top floor of the garage for issuing the retail on --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- what's now parking, and --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, I see --              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- providing there's a way, could 

that become additional retail?  And is the permit that we

grant all that, or do we think that they may have been 

reaching out to us for the amendment?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  They would come back 

to us for an amendment.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, that's fine.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So with that 

clarification, everyone is good on the findings?     

          COLLECTIVE:  Mm-hm.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  And we 

have gone through the conditions.  Jeff, anything else I 

need to include in a motion here?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No, I think that items that are 

listed in the CDD memo and the TP+T memos would be 

referenced, and that would be appropriate.  There is the 

matter of the timing, which we can get to.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We can go with that 

after.  So don't run away.  We have administrative votes to 

take after this. c 

          Okay.  So based on the findings that we have just 

detailed, subject to the conditions outlined in the CDD, 

Traffic and Parking Department, and DPW memos, do I have a 

motion to grant the requested relief, or special permits?

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor?   

          [ ALL VOTE YES ]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's unanimous.  

Okay.  Now, Jeff, the timing issue.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, so this given the timing 

expires on I think sometime next week, so we would ask for 

an extension of that time, just for filing.  And it really 

is just to make sure that we have enough time.  We'll file 

it when it's done, and gets reviewed and improved by the 

Chair, and then filed. 

          We have -- just as a standard practice with any 

extension, we've been asking for 90 days, which I think the 

applicant can respond to that.  If that seems like it's too 

long, we could split the difference.  But it'll be filed 

whenever we can get it filed.      

          CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER:  As soon as you can get it 

done.  So based on that, I would say 90 days is not what you 

would prefer.  Can you tell us what would be acceptable to 

you?

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Well, we make our living on being 

cooperative to you, but I did want to point out 90 days is 

double the length of time, so it does feel a little 

excessive, and there are some financing issues.   

          So we were hoping, and Mr. Roberts is a hard 

worker -- in the 45 to 60-day range between now and then, we 

would defer to what end of the spectrum he would prefer that 

to.  I have a hunch it might be closer to 60, but I would 

hope that that might be adequate to get the decision written 

in the files.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So why don't we 

propose that we'll do a 60-day extension with, as Mr. 

Roberts noted, he and his staff will work on getting it done 

as quickly as possible, and hopefully we're filing it closer 

to that 45 days?   

          But rather than have you have to come back here 

and ask for another 10-day extension, it seems like we'd 

rather the addition.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  That sounds like a great idea, 

Madam Chair.         

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  So can I 

111

have a motion to extend the deadline for filing for 60 days?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Second?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor? 

          THE BOARD: [ ALL VOTE YES ] 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  And that's unanimous.  

All right, Jeff, are there any other administrative matters 

I need to keep people here for?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Then 

we're adjourned.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you very much.
