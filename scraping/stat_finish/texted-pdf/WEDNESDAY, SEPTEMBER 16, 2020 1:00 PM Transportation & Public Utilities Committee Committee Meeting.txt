Councillor Quinton Zondervan  expressed disappointment that big trucks cannot be banned in Harvard 
Square and the city could not build protected bike lanes. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked Mr. Barr if the truck safety ordinance is something that the council could start 
to move forward. 
 
Joseph Barr, Director of Traffic, Parking & Transportation, explained that the city has been working on 
draft language internally, and that it will be presented to the council soon. 
 
In response to a question from vice Mayor Mallon, Mr. Barr stated that there will be modification to 
Church street to increase safety. 
 
Ms. Watkins  stated that construction on the kiosk will start sometime in November. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan, Mr. Barr explained that in order to limit truck traffic in 
Harvard Square to certain times the City would need approval from the Massachusetts Department of 
Transportation.  He stated that overnight restrictions on residential street were more likely to be approved. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan, Mr. Barr explained that the City did have the regulatory 
authority to close a street at certain times of the day as long as the closure applied to all traffic. Mr. Barr 
explained that there can be pushback from residents about street closures. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  stated that she was excited by and supported pedestrianizing parts of Harvard 
Square. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:16:05 
Thank you come through to me, is there anything you'd like to add? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  stated that he would like a concise and simple document explaining the 
council’s authority to regulate traffic on city streets. He expressed support with moving forward with a 
truck safety ordinance. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Toomey, Mr. Barr stated that he was not aware of any progress 
in the creation of truck depot to allow cargo from larger trucks to be transferred to smaller trucks when 
entering Cambridge. 
 
Mayor Siddiqui stated that she agreed that the administration should get the truck ordinance to the 
Council as soon as is feasible. 
 
Councillor McGovern  stated that it was his understanding that most of the businesses in Harvard Square 
were not receiving deliveries from big trucks. Mr. Barr stated that he did not have any specific 
information about the percentage of the trucks making deliveries to versus passing through the square. 
 
Councillor McGovern expressed concern about the possibility of diverting trucks down smaller side 
streets.  He urged the council to carefully consider how changes will affect where truck traffic will be 
directed. 
 
Mr. Barr stated that City should be clear about the expected benefits when it chooses to close streets. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  stated that Denver, Santa Monica, Charlottesville, Chicago have closed streets 
and New York City is beginning to design closed streets. And San Francisco is planning to close its main

street, which is Market Street to traffic and allow only mass transit and special vehicles delivery. He 
stated that he supported making Harvard square more pedestrian oriented. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Ms. Watkins explained that a raised crosswalk 
encourages pedestrians to cross at any time, but the preference is to have pedestrians cross the street when 
indicated by traffic signals. 
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about closing traffic to Harvard Square on certain 
days, Mr. Barr stated he would consult with the public health department about that in terms of 
encouraging gatherings during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon, Kathy Watkins that the paver cross walks in Harvard 
Square are not historic.  The issue with the existing cross walk is sightlines in terms of visibility. The 
current plan is to add high visibility markings. 
 
In response to Councillor Nolan’s question about moving forward on a pilot, Mr. Barr stated  that the city 
must notify local businesses and ensure residents have some awareness of closure, even if the closure is 
just for the weekend.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about closing Harvard Square portion 
of Massachusetts Avenue to truck traffic or all traffic, Mr. Barr explained that Massachusetts Avenue is a 
state route. Therefore, closures to all traffic or daytime closure to truck traffic are unlikely to be approved 
by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation.  He added that there was a concern about this traffic 
being diverted down smaller streets should this portion of Massachusetts Avenue be closed to traffic. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler moved to 
suspend the rules to extend the meeting 
to 3:20PM
