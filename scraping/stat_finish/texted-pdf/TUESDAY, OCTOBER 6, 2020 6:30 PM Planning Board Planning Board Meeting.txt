          MARY FLYNN:  Good evening.  Welcome to the October 

6, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My name is 

Mary Flynn, and I am the Vice Chair acting as Chair for this 

meeting.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

September 22, 2020.  

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online 

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their name before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will then give 

instructions for public comment at that time, and you can 

also find instructions on the city's webpage for remote 

Planning Board meetings.  

          I will start by asking Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, this is Jeff Roberts 

from Community Development just doing a quick attendance

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Present, and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Steve.  Hugh Russell, 

are you present, is the meeting audible to you?   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'm present, and the meeting is 

audible to me, although my Internet connection seems to be a 

little ragged tonight.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you for pointing that out, 

Hugh.  We'll keep that in mind.  You are audible to us.  Tom 

Sieniewicz, are you present and is the meeting audible to 

you?  

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I am present, and the meeting is 

audible to me.  And similar to Hugh, I've been having a 

little wonky Internet connection today as well. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Tom.  You are audible to 

us.  Corinne Espinoza, are you present, is the meeting 

audible to you?             

audible to me.       

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I'm present, and the meeting is 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Corinne.  Just a quick 

check for members who said he would be absent.  Nikolas 

Bowie, are you present?

          [Pause] Niko is noted as absent.  Catherine 

Preston Connolly, are you present?    

          [Pause] 

          Catherine is noted as absent.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And Mary Flynn is obviously 

present.  Can you just confirm that the rest of the meeting 

is audible to me?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, it is audible.  Thank you, Jeff.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay, thank you, Mary.  I'll turn 

it back over to you.       

                  MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thanks.   

                          * * * * *

Sitting Members:  Mary T. Flynn, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven 

                  A. Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, 

                  Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza 

          MARY FLYNN:  The first item is an update from the 

Community Development.  Please also introduce the staff 

present at the meeting.  Jeff, I don't know if you're --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  That is, as 

again, always performing double duty here.  So I'm Jeff 

Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development for CDD.

          With me from my division are Swaathi Joseph, who 

is operating the slide deck, as always.  I also have Daniel 

Messplay, Liza Paden and Sarah Scott from Zoning and 

Development.   

          We have Erik Thorkildsen, Urban Designer in the 

Community Planning Division and CDD.  We have Iram Farooq, 

the Assistant City Manager for Community Development and the 

head of our department.   

          And from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department we have Joe Barr, the Director of Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation; and Adam Shulman, Transportation 

Planner with that department. 

          So I believe that covers all the staff that are 

present right at the moment. 

          Just for a quick update for the Board, I hope 

everyone had a nice week off.  We are now going full into 

October, and we have a number of meetings that are set to 

go.   

          Tonight, we have a public hearing on a PUD special 

permit development proposal, which we'll be getting to on 

October 13, that's next week.  We have a public hearing 

scheduled on a case at 56 Creighton Street in Cambridge.

This is a case that -- a site that previously had a special 

permit granted and had some changes that need to come back 

for the Board's approval. 

          On October 20, that's two weeks from tonight, we 

have a public hearing scheduled on a development proposal at 

325 Binney Street.  That's also known as the former 

Metropolitan Pipe Warehouse site that is in the Kendall 

Square area. 

          And October 27, we do have a meeting scheduled.  

We have a tentative item of business which should be pretty 

interesting to the Board, and I'll talk about that next week 

-- that's a tease. 

          So -- that's still being finalized.  So that is 

it. And just as a reminder, on November 3 there is no 

Planning Board meeting because of the election.  We will 

have some meetings scheduled in November.   

          I will note that we have a -- we have some public 

hearings that are scheduled at the Ordinance Committee.  I 

mentioned that I would give you an update on that last time. 

          On November 12, we have a hearing.  The Ordinance 

Committee will have a hearing on the Canal District Kendall 

PUD District Petition.  That's what's known as the

Constellation Center Site in Kendall Square.   

          The Board had a hearing on that last month, and 

will have another hearing on that as well.  Because it -- 

there was a procedural item I talked about the last time.   

          November 19, there is an Ordinance Committee 

hearing scheduled on another zoning petition, which would 

amend provisions in the MXD Zoning District that's also in 

Kendall Square.   

          We will be having a hearing on that at the 

Planning Board as well.  Those hearings -- the Planning 

Board hearings are probably going to line up pretty closely 

with the Ordinance Committee hearings, given the timing.  

And I'll provide more information about that as we get 

there. 

          I will -- oh, actually I'll mention one thing 

which may be of interest to some members of the Board and 

you're probably aware -- last night, there was a lot of 

activity at the City Council, but one notable piece of 

business is that the City Council voted to ordain the 

Affordable Housing Overlay.   

          That's a provision of the zoning ordinance 

providing an alternative set of development standards for 

10

projects that are entirely income restricted affordable 

housing -- you know, permanently restricted affordable 

housing units. 

          The Planning Board gave a positive recommendation 

on that, and now it's enacted.  So, as Board members might 

remember, the Planning Board is an important part of that 

zoning, because developments that are coming under the 

Affordable Housing Overlay will need to come to the Planning 

Board for a process of Advisory review and report. 

          So that's something we expect we'll be seeing at 

some point in the future.  And I will actually end it there.  

Thanks.  I'll turn it back over to you, Mary.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  If there are any 

questions from Board members, would you please say your 

name?     

          [Pause]   

          Okay.  Hearing none, I will go onto the next item, 

which is approval of the meeting minutes.   

                          * * * * *

          The Board has received a certified transcript for 

the meeting held on September 8,2020.  If there are any 

questions from Board members, please say your name.     

          [Pause] 

          Okay.  Hearing none, is there a motion to accept 

the transcripts as the meeting minutes?            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So moved -- Tom.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Tom Sieniewicz, thank you.  Is there 

a second?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.  Steve -- second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Steven Cohen seconding.  Could we 

have a roll call vote, please?

                  Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza 

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Moving on to agenda item 

number 1, this item is a public hearing on Planning Board 

#364, a Planning Unit Development proposal by New England 

Development to redevelop and expand the existing 

Cambridgeside property. 

          CDD Staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us, so turn it back to Jeff.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  Last one from me 

for a little while.  So this is a PUD special permit 

application.  This follows upon a lot of review that was 

done by the Planning Board and City Council over the course 

of about a year or so to review and amend the zoning for 

this area, which enabled the submission of a PUD development 

proposal. 

          The purpose of this first hearing -- so the PUD 

review process is a two public hearing process; there's two 

separate hearings sort of baked in. 

          And the purpose of the first hearing is for the 

Board to review the proposal at a conceptual level, and to 

make a preliminary determination on whether it is in general 

conformance with the zoning and the planning for the area. 

          So this is largely -- this first hearing largely 

is a gatekeeper step.  If the preliminary determination is 

approved, then that authorizes the applicant to submit a 

final development plan, and that plan must respond to any 

detailed requests for modification or additional information 

that is included by the Board, if it's noted by the Board in 

making its preliminary determination. 

          If the preliminary -- the development proposal is 

14

disapproved, then the process stops here, and the special 

permit application is considered denied.   

          So the criteria for approval of a PUD development 

proposal as a preliminary determination or included with the 

staff memo that was provided along with other comments on 

the proposal. 

          The one other procedural piece to note here is 

that along with the application for a new PUD special permit 

is a request for a minor amendment to the current special 

permit, PB#66 that was previously granted for this site.   

          For good measure, we included that item as a 

separate agenda item tonight.  It's essentially kind of part 

of the same application.  This minor amendment was 

contemplated when the new zoning for the area was adopted 

last year.   

          And our station is that the Board essentially wait 

on considering the minor amendment until it's ready to make 

a final decision on the new PUD development plan. 

          So that's it for my explanation, and I'll turn it 

back over.  Thanks.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  So the presenter 

this evening is Richard McKinnon on behalf of the applicant.

You will have up to 30 minutes for your presentation, though 

the Board may allow additional time at our discretion.  

Please introduce your project team and begin the 

presentation.     

          RICHARD MCKINNON:  Thank you, Chair Flynn and 

members of the Board.  Can you hear me okay?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, we can hear you.     

          RICHARD MCKINNON:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  

Chair Flynn, whatever you or Catherine are chairing a 

meeting, I'm always wondering whether or not I've picked the 

right Chairman.   

          No reflection -- no reflection of you, addressing 

you.  I figure I've usually picked the wrong one of the 

three that are available.  And I hope I didn't tonight. 

          My name is Richard McKinnon.  I live at One 

Leighton Street in Cambridge, in East Cambridge.  I'm the 

Development Consultant for New England Development. 

          With me here tonight are team leader John Twohig 

and our architect, David Manfredi.  We very much want to 

thank the Board for scheduling us tonight.  All of our 

schedules got turned upside-down, of course, with the 

pandemic, and it's very many impacting Cambridgeside, as any

of you that have gone through there can see for yourselves. 

          So I need to move forward tonight.  It's become 

more critical than ever. There's another time and issue 

tonight.   

          We had about 20 of our friends and supporters 

offer to speak tonight, and we thought that in the interest 

of keeping the meeting more under control and giving the 

Planning Board more time, that was just way too many.  So 

we've cut that really more than in half.  And of those that 

are speaking, we asked them to be very, very brief.   

          The images on the screen tell a story.  If you 

look at the parking lots on the left, that's what Steve Karp 

working with Steve Fishman were presented with over 30 years 

ago, when they were assembling the land.  And if you look at 

the image on the right, that is what they transformed those 

parking lots into.   

          When the Galleria was closed and then opened, it 

was praised by our Pulitzer Prize winning architectural 

credit from the Boston Globe as really being innovative and 

a beautiful job done on a very tough assignment. 

          I think what the slides do show is that as tough 

as the project is that's before you tonight, we've really

shown an ability to take tough challenges and deal with them 

and come out with an excellent result. 

          It's rare when an applicant comes before the 

Planning Board with a 30-year plan for the future, but also 

a 30-year history for the Board to examine.  Our major 

universities, of course, are one exception when they come 

in.  But even there we differ. 

          Our doors are open every time we are.  And since 

1990, tens of millions of people have come inside our 

building, -- many of them are our neighbors and mine.  We 

always try to welcome them with kindness and respect, 

whomever they are.   

          And I think our record shows that we can handle 

the next 30 years, and do it in a way where we maintain the 

values that Steve Karp has really asked us to follow in 

terms of how we respect and meet those people that come into 

our building. 

          If we can go to the agenda slide?  Here we go.   

          Tonight, we're going to try and give you a brief 

presentation.  Those of you that have been looking at our 

Planning Board application know that there's a lot there, 

and we really had to pick what we're going to use tonight.

          We reached a point, Chair Flynn, that we were 

measuring our application in palms rather than pages.  But 

we wanted to be thorough.   

          John is going to speak.  John Twohig will speak to 

the development proposal and the requirements that Jeff just 

mentioned earlier ago (sic).  He's also going to describe 

how it responds to the zoning, which the Planning Board said 

to the City Council and the Council approved just this past 

          David, our architect, is going to speak to the 

design challenges that he faces, and there are many, as 

          The architecture challenge has really been to 

January. 

he'll explain.   

            st

design a 21  century building, but to know at all times 

where that building sits and its history.   

          And it sits in a masonry district that has a 

history of using masonry and being classic in its 

presentation, and has always tipped its hat to what is 

masonry history that we find in the City of Cambridge.  You 

know, there are buildings throughout -- obviously Harvard 

Yard being one of the earliest examples.   

                                               st

building with a building that conforms as much as possible, 

to the 1987 guidelines.  And I think he's been able to do 

that in a way that's natural and doesn't seem forced. 

          All right, if we can go to the next slide?  Thank 

you.   

          So before John starts, this is the community 

engagement that we've had in Cambridge and in the state as 

well.  I promise you I'm not going to read through all of 

these.  I think, though, what they show is that there's been 

a tremendous amount of review that's happened before we come 

before you tonight.  And it comes from many, many places.   

          But there's been a terrific emphasis on making 

sure that our neighbors from East Cambridge and especially 

the East Cambridge Planning Team has had a chance.  And 

we're happy having read their letter to know that they’ve 

weighed in and expressed their opinion to the Planning Board 

tonight. 

          So with that, I'm going to get out of your hair 

and I'm going to ask our team leader, John Twohig, to take 

over from here.     

          [Pause]  

          John, are you able to hear us okay?

through, I am not sure that I see John.     

          SARAH LEMKE:  He's with David Manfredi.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, he is.  Okay, yes, now I see him.  

Thank you.  Are they having a problem connecting?  Yeah, it 

looks like they have no connection.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Is there a way to get in touch with 

them?     

          SARAH LEMKE:  Yeah, if you could give me -- this 

is Sarah Lemke at NED -- if you can give me one minute, I 

will figure this out.  Hold on.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you so much.      

          RICHARD MCKINNON:  Thanks, Sarah.     

          [Pause] 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff.  I do see John and 

David in the office.     

          SARAH LEMKE:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Your phone is on mute, so if you 

try pushing *6, that might put you off mute.     

          [Pause]    

          JOHN TWOHIG:  Well, how did that work out?  Thank 

21

you, Jeff.     

          RICHARD MCKINNON:  Oh, there we are.     

          JOHN TWOHIG:  There we go.       

          MARY FLYNN:  That works out perfectly, thank you.     

          JOHN TWOHIG:  Thank you so much for that Jeff.  

Because David and I were staring at each other to make sure 

that was going to happen, members of the Planning Board, 

Vice Chair Flynn, thank you so much for having us, as 

Richard said tonight. 

          We're very excited to be here.  I think as Richard 

said in that community engagement slide, we spent a lot of 

time, really in the past couple of years engaging with the 

community.   

          And I wanted certainly the Planning Board to know 

that in recent times we've met with the ECPT a few times, as 

recently as a couple of weeks ago.   

          Also, we did have, as you know, our prefiling 

meeting with the Planning Board, our prefiling meeting with 

the City Council, as well as a community meeting that we had 

about 80 attendees associated with that.   

          So this has really been a robust process.  As it 

related to the zoning that we got last December, but also

even since then. 

could move to that? 

          As you look at the next slide --  Swaathi, if we 

          A little bit of timeline; Richard sort of focused 

on the last year or so.  But this is really, 2019 was our 

focus on the zoning.  And really in the past sort of seven, 

eight months at prefiling and preparing our application and 

our materials, and then filing that and working very closely 

with staff to be sure that our filing was responsive and 

appropriate. 

          And that brings us to tonight, which is really -- 

and I -- Jeff did a far better job than I ever could about 

what we're talking about as far as the development proposal 

and asking for your preliminary support to move that 

forward, knowing that a final development plan and the 

special permit and the specifics will be brought forward as 

we move through hopefully the fall of this year, with the 

hope to start our first two buildings -- one, the former 

Sears building and the former Macy's building, 2021. 

          So that just gives you in a very broad brush the 

timeline that we have. 

          If we could move to the next slide, the proposal -

- we called it the proposed plan.  And I guess, I just want 

to say one thing.   

          We had to make some really big decisions, and we 

made them actually I think with the community and with you 

folks about what we would do -- namely keeping them all 

open, keeping it the vibrant gathering place that it has 

always been, but keeping the retail center, the retail core 

as part of this and keeping the jobs and the activity 

continuing. 

          The second sort of big decision was First Street.  

The idea that we would actually knock down two of our 

buildings, the Upper Garage and the Lechmere/Best Buy 

building -- knock those down, move them and rebuild them -- 

was sort of a big idea, a big concept to move us forward.   

          The third is the open space.  How could we make 

that open space really more viable -- something that is 

something good for the community for the next 30 years?  We 

have a lot of open space; how could we update it? 

          And then finally, sustainability and resiliency.  

Now, most people use those words really in connection with 

environmental factors.   

          But in this particular case, I would suggest to

you that sustainability and resiliency is about the 

environment certainly -- and there are a lot of things, and 

David will speak to them -- but it's also about economics, 

it's about community benefits, it's about inclusion, it's 

about maintaining this place as a key center for East 

Cambridge. 

tonight's discussion.   

          As we move to the next slide, a little bit about 

          As I said, Jeff did it far better than I ever 

could, but I think our goal -- at least my small portion of 

this -- is going to focus on three things:  Describe the 

project and how it relates to the approved zoning. 

          The second thing -- very briefly -- describe the 

design as it relates to the approved guidelines, which will 

be more David, but I'll touch on that as an introductory 

matter. 

          And third, the proposed benefits, and how they 

relate to the commitment letter and how they relate to the 

project as a whole. 

          If we could go to the next slide, you get a sense 

for of -- and you know this better than we do -- for what we 

must show as part of this development proposal.  And Jeff

mentioned it briefly. 

          We have to show to you that this project that 

we're presenting conforms with the PUD-8 development 

controls; that which we all worked on last year. 

          The second thing we have to show you is conforming 

with the policies related to East Cambridge. And we'll talk 

a little bit about that -- Riverfront plan and the like -- 

and then thirdly the benefits.  So that's sort of our 

proposal standards that we have to meet and demonstrate to 

you tonight. 

best we can.   

          As you move to the next slide, and it's really 

sort of the first part of this -- I guess we'd say this as 

          The development proposal that we submitted in our 

four volume set is really what was anticipated in the zoning 

amendment.  And that was shaped through the meetings with 

you, with the community, with the City Council.   

          The heights that we have presented to you -- that 

range of 85 to 155 feet stepping back from the Canal; the 

uses that we have presented to you -- retail restaurant, 

office, lab, residential; the net new area that we had 

presented -- 575,000 square feet, the residential commitment

of 175,000 square feet resulting in 200 units that would be 

65 percent affordable and middle-income, the reduction of 

the Upper Garage parking and elimination of that, but 

maintaining the roughly 1700 spaces underground and 

enlivening and continuing, and actually in some cases 

increasing the amount of open space. 

          So what David is going to walk you through tonight 

is in fact what we showed you as part of the zoning 

amendment, as we spent those months talking about it. 

          As we move to the next slide, a little bit about 

the development controls.  And again, David will speak to 

this.   

          But if you look at the left and sort of see our 

core mall, see where our buildings are, and the Sears Upper 

Garage, Lechmere, Macy's, and then look to the right in the 

massing diagrams:  The issues of height, the issues of step 

back, the issues of setback -- how this is going to fit into 

the community and fit into the plan, those were the 

development controls that we focused on. 

          As we move forward, the next thing that -- and 

it's one of the standards for us, is to look at the city 

planning policy documents.

22

          And that was something we talk about a lot, as I'm 

sure you recall, as part of our zoning by looking at the 

1978 East Cambridge Riverfront plan, which talked about 

mixes of uses, which talked about strengthening a pedestrian 

environment, which talked about diverse urban focus, and 

active urban focus; the details. 

          And I think when you see David's design and what 

his team has done, we really believe that fits very well 

into what was thought about as long ago as the 1978 plan. 

          Also, the Riverfront plans in 2011, the earlier 

one in DCR -- again, bringing people to the river, 

activating it, changing what that experience is going to be, 

focusing on trees, focusing on sidewalks, on the lighting 

and furnishings, creating real sidewalks of greater size -- 

again, very much in fulfillment of the Riverfront plan. 

          And then Envision Cambridge.  Certainly fitting 

into the neighborhood, but focusing on public transit, 

focusing on tax base, focusing on housing.   

          Again, we took all of those points that we talked 

about in the zoning, wrote much of it into the zoning, but 

took it very seriously as we were moving forward with the 

plan that you're going to see here tonight.

22

          And I guess the third prong, if we could move to 

the next slide? is really -- and it's two parts, I think the 

way we divided this up.  You know, the community benefits.  

          I think there was a lot of talk about this -- you 

know, since -- as part of our work with you, late last year, 

but also with the City Council about the community benefit…  

the things that people focused on, the East End House: a $9 

million-dollar commitment to the East End House, $4 million 

dollars of which has actually already been paid in July to 

help them continue to be that 150-year plus community staple 

and moving that forward. 

          A second thing, the transportation improvements, 

not only committing a fund for transportation improvements 

and a fund for TDM, but also the First Street Corridor.   

          And I think Joe Barr would say -- and I don't want 

to take words out of his mouth, but years of discussion 

about doing that First Street Corridor, which we have agreed 

to fund, to really understand pedestrian, bicycle, vehicle, 

bus -- how does that all work in this Corridor for the long 

term of the connection up to the station, and then down into 

Kendall Square. 

          There are some things such as the Tree Fund, which

a lot of them are cash payments in addition to planting 

commitments; contribution to the arts.  Again, some of them 

are cash payments.  Some are how to program and have 

opportunities for local artists -- scholarship funds for 

East Cambridge, a 30-year commitment for the scholarship 

fund, which has actually adjusted over time to deal with 

inflation -- those are more sort of cash payments; things 

that were clearly community-focused that we can help through 

dollars.   

          But in addition to that, and if you look at the 

next slide, which we term sort of "diversity, equity and 

inclusion" these were items that I'd say we were a little 

bit -- and I say, "we" all of us -- ahead of our time in 

thinking about key issues in Cambridge that people have been 

talking about for years, but looking at the affordability, 

looking at affordable housing, the commitment to 65 percent 

of that being affordable -- the commitment to having larger 

family units were all things that we talked about and are 

included in our plans today. 

          Things like affordable child care space -- things 

like local retail space, things like affordable non-profit 

space, support for minority and women-owned business,

support for local retail, creating community meeting space, 

the Charles River program for students and for seniors to 

activate what goes on in the heritage of the Charles River, 

jobs for and in the community, both as to the project to 

build it, to maintain the jobs that we have in the core and 

the jobs that we'll have through construction… 

          Which is really probably the last thing that -- I 

don't think we ever got a chance to talk to you folks about, 

but the Building Pathways program providing access to the 

trades for low-income residents, whether people of color, 

individuals, disabilities, returning veterans who are 

transitioning to provide opportunities to people in that 

trade. 

          So as I conclude my remarks, really on the next 

slide, I guess I would conclude with this:  The development 

proposal that David's going to walk you through we feel 

clearly complies with the requirements of the approved 

zoning -- both as it relates to the requirements of the PUD-

8, which are more dimensional and related, but also the 

policy plans on the goals that were set forward, and then 

what we deem as an extraordinary benefit -- series of 

community benefits -- for the community that really touch on

so many issues that we've talked about -- certainly over the 

last couple years and we've talked about for years -- in 

Cambridge.   

          So with that, I'd like to turn it over to David to 

talk about the design that we're bringing forward to you 

tonight.  Thank you.       

          DAVID MANFREDI:  Thanks, John.  Good evening, 

everybody.  As Rich McKinnon mentioned at the very 

beginning, when Cambridgeside opened 25 years ago, it really 

was hailed as innovative urban retail.  You think about it.  

It's -- oh, I'm sorry we should be on the next slide.   

          It's anchored by open space.  It's anchored by the 

Charles Park on the south and Canal Park on the north.  It's 

three levels of retail, which wasn't done 25 years ago. 

          And its major anchor, Macy's: Actually their first 

floor was on the second floor.  But if you look at the 

diagram on the left, you realize that what exists today is 

very inward looking.   

          And one of our goals is -- our biggest goal -- is 

break open the superblock, make the edges far more porous, 

make an important connection to the East Cambridge 

neighborhood, and put more front doors on First Street and 

32

on Cambridgeside Place and even wrapping the corner on to 

Land Boulevard:  Create a more authentic urban block. 

          If you look at the diagram on the right, we will 

transform First Street by setting back the two new buildings 

and additional 10 feet to make 20-foot sidewalks.  By 

creating three distinct buildings with step backs at 65-85 

feet above the street of 10 feet, and then again at 135 feet 

above the street, another 10 feet. 

          Next slide, please? 

          So First Street today is really quite inactive, 

and without uses that truly engage pedestrians.   

          Next?   

          So the proposal is for First Street with shops and 

restaurants -- everything you see in the orange is active 

uses that will engage pedestrians, that will spill out onto 

those wide sidewalks. 

          Two new pocket parks that from face of building 

East are 60 feet deep over to the curb then -- over 80 feet 

deep.  These can be passive; they can be active as the 

photographs in the bottom show. 

          They can be play areas, they can be restaurants 

that spill out, they can change over the course of the day.  

33

We've actually held back from a final design year with the 

opportunity to engage the community on what they should be, 

and they should be different. 

          Next, please? 

Nicely detailed, but blank walls. 

          Next?   

          Today, First Street is largely blank walls.  

          First Street will be entirely transformed -- as I 

said, lined with uses that will engage pedestrians, the 

residents in the middle block, the 80-90 block with 

entrances to office, to residential with a mix of uses and a 

          One of the great things about mixed-use is that it 

will attract people on sidewalks 365 days seven days a week 

mix of users.   

and 18 hours a day. 

          Next?   

          Call this First Street transformed.  We propose 

three distinct and separate buildings.  And I'll go from 

left to right.  At the left, 60 First Street, the old Sears, 

will be a five-story building with retail at the base, lab 

and office above. 

          In the middle 8090 First Street, the old parking

use vertically mixed-use with retail at the street, three 

levels of office, and the residential that John mentioned 

          And at the right, 110 First, which is the old Best 

Buy Lechmere building -- again retail at the base wrapping 

the corner onto Cambridgeside Place, with office and lab 

above. 

above.   

          I want to point out the setbacks at 65-85 feet.  

They vary.  And that's part of an authentic and organic 

street.  And then again step backs at 135 feet in the middle 

building and the building at the corner of Cambridgeside 

Place.  This affords more daylight to the street, and widens 

the street corridor and makes a better public realm.   

          Next, please?   

          At 60 First Street, this is the Sears building 

reinvented with two additional floors, entirely new building 

envelope and entirely new building infrastructure.  We're 

basically gutting the interior of this building, putting in 

a new floor, putting in all new systems.   

          The architecture is clearly inspired by the 

warehouse manufacturing buildings of East Cambridge -- stone

masonry, a zinc attic story, the industrial frame of the 

windows, the detailing of brick on the spandrels between the 

floors, the depth of brick, the face of glass.   

          And look at the drawing on the right.  You can see 

again multiple retail tenants, a new office entry in the 

lavender color, and a new arcade that will connect the 

neighborhood First Street into Cambridgeside, a new front 

door creating a new front to this entire block. 

          We've had really productive meetings on both this 

building and on 20 Cambridgeside with CDD staff, which has 

been extremely helpful as we think through the more full 

design of both of those blocks. 

          I want to talk a little about Thorndike Way -- the 

improvement on Thorndike Way intended to make it more 

welcoming -- to actually do what it was intended to do, 

which is to be a gateway to Canal Park beyond to the 

waterfront to the Charles River.  And how do we do that?   

          Some of it's architecture.  A lot of it's use by 

taking retail restaurants, spaces, wrapping them around the 

corner, letting that retail restaurant spill out onto those 

sidewalks, bringing that energy around the corner and making 

the connection to the Charles River.

          We plan improvements -- next, please? -- on Canal 

Park.   

          Canal Park will have new furniture, will have new 

paving, will have new boardwalk and lighting, making it feel 

safer, more welcoming, more activating. 

          You all know -- next -- the Land Boulevard Bridge 

today.  It's really kind of dark and dreary, and frankly 

doesn't feel very safe.   

          Our plan is to reinvent this -- again, without 

changing the bones -- but with lighting, with wood planking 

as flooring, the opportunity for public art, to transform it 

into an important linkage of public realm. 

          Lighting is really important.  It can enhance the 

entire area.  It can be public art.  It can change over time 

and it can make it a place -- Canal Park -- the walkway 

under the Land Boulevard Bridge; all of these spaces feel 

safer, more welcoming, more secure. 

          20 Cambridgeside, which is the other building in 

the First phase with 60 First Street, is on the Macy's site.  

And long view -- obviously looking north on Land Boulevard -

- and again, you can see the metrics of what we are 

planning, so that at the fifth floor there's a step back.

It's at 85 feet.  It's 11 feet deep.   

          On the -- I'm sorry, on the eighth floor there's a 

step-back.  It's 11 feet deep, it's 125 feet off of the 

street level.   

          And then at the roof there's another step-back, 

it's 13 feet and the mechanical above.  The mechanical is 

clad in channel glass, really all the way around that 

mechanical space, the intent being to make it as light as 

possible, to actually make it as translucent as possible and 

lighten the impact on the building below. 

          Next?   

          Land Boulevard -- a long view of Land Boulevard, 

looking south.  And again, you can see 20 Cambridgeside in 

the context of existing hotel in the foreground, the bridge 

that we just walked under and the impact of those step-

backs.  Again, they widen the street.  They bring more 

daylight onto the sidewalks, and they don't overbear the 

public realm. 

          We have a whole series of long views.  I think 

there's about 10 of them.  I'm only going to show you a 

couple.  But know that they're here, and they're available 

if you want to see them.

          We wanted to show you the view from the Longfellow 

Bridge -- obviously looking north across the river, and you 

can see the upper levels, the penthouse levels of 110 First 

Street, which is the building at the corner of First and 

Cambridgeside Place, and 20 Cambridgeside, which is on the 

Macy's site. 

          Another long view on Otis -- on First Street at 

Otis looking south.  And again, you can see three buildings, 

where really there is one continuous street wall today at 60 

First, at 80 and 90, and then you can see beyond to 110.  

You can see how those step-backs matter.  And you can see 

the diversity and kind of organic quality of those step 

backs.  They don't perfectly align.  They have the 

authenticity of an urban street built over time. 

          And then from -- looking north on first from 

Rogers Street with the Lotus building -- the former Lotus 

building -- on your right, and 110 First, 80 and 90 and 60 

First.   

          And you can see again the importance of creating 

these street frontages, these kind of bases, and then the 

step-backs, and then the diversity in material fenestration 

patterns, and the legibility of residential versus office

canal.   

          We have just to my left here -- you can't quite 

see it, but we can zoom into it -- is the model that you see 

photographed.  This is a view obviously looking from the 

southwest.  You can always orient yourself by finding the 

          And we're happy to, when we finish our 

presentation to zoom in to it, to walk around it.  But you 

can see where the front door Cambridgeside Galleria is 

today, Land Believed, the buildings in their context and how 

the buildings set down in height to the canal. 

          The next view is from the northwest.   

          Again, First Street, Cambridgeside you can see.  

The fact that we have broken apart the superblock, we've 

created three separate buildings with light and air in 

between the building. 

          And then another model shot looking over Canal 

Park -- you can go to the next one -- and this is obviously 

a view from the north.   

          You can see the canal, you can see the hotel, and 

then the existing Mall and the buildings as they step down 

to the north.

          Next to last slide is the environmental benefits, 

and I want to go through these very quickly, but they're 

important.   

          The project is committed to LEED goals core and 

shell.  CDD has in fact certified our Master Plan green 

building report.  Both 20 Cambridgeside, the former Macy's 

site, and 60 First, the Sears site, will achieve LEED goals 

core and shell certification.   

          We're very focused on carbon emissions, reducing 

carbon emissions and a path to Net Zero.  All of our 

rooftops, existing buildings and new buildings will be solar 

ready.  Our residential will be all electric, no fossil 

fuels.  And we are evaluating the residential for Passive 

House design. 

          Obviously, mixed-use has a big impact on 

transportation.  It reduces vehicle trips.  It provides 

housing near jobs and services and makes everything more 

compact and more walkable.   

          There are a series of transportation improvements 

that we can go into as well as our DDM measures.  We'll 

collaborate with the city on the First Street Corridor plan.  

Transportation, Parking and Traffic has certified our GIS,

our Transportation Impact Study.   

          There are improvements in infrastructure and 

especially in flood mitigation.  The separation -- including 

the most important being the separation of storm and sewer 

on Land Boulevard that will improve drainage and stormwater 

measures, and protect the environment and streetscape -- the 

buildings, the improvements and people from extreme weather 

events. 

John?     

          And then finally, all of our landscape 

improvements in Canal Park create the kind of cooling oasis 

that reduces heat island effect in the city, and will 

transform that space in a very measurable kind of way.  

          JOHN TWOHIG:  David, thank you.  And again, thank 

you members of the Planning Board for letting us finish I 

guess the last thought we'd just leave you with was really 

that, you know, our development proposal we hope you will 

agree is what we'll have worked so hard on, with respect to 

the zoning amendment.   

          And those big ideas of transforming First Street, 

Canal Park, a sustainable design and mixing uses, affordable 

units, a community benefit package that we could all be very

proud of is really what our focus was.   

          So we're there, our project team is certainly 

available.  We have the various disciplines. As David 

mentioned, we have the model, and we'll stop there, and 

again thank you for the time, for allowing us to present 

this to you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, thanks to you and all of the 

team for that very good presentation, and also, for the 

quite detailed submission for the PUD application.  I'm sure 

that there will be many questions from the Planning Board 

with regard to details, but what we're going to do right now 

is what we've been doing since we've been doing the Zoom 

meetings, and that is going first to public comment, so 

we'll take that, and then we'll come back to the Planning 

Board. 

          So this is a public hearing. Any members of the 

public who wish to speak should now click the button that 

says, "Raise hand."  If you are calling in by phone, you can 

raise your hand by pressing *9.   

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board has received 

written comments from Major R. Douglas Hart, Dunc F. 

Sheehan, Cecily Cushman, Steve Aliano, Maryellen Doran,

          And I apologize to anyone whose name I 

mispronounced or butchered.  

          Written communications received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will also be entered into the record.  So with 

that, let's see -- we definitely have hands for public 

comment.   

          So let me ask staff to unmute the speakers one at 

a time.  Each speaker should begin by saying your name and 

address, and staff will confirm that we hear you.  After 

that, you will have up to three minutes to speak before I 

ask you to wrap up.  So Jeff, let me turn it over to you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  The timer's up 

just in time.  So I also apologize for any mispronunciation 

that may occur.  I'm going to read two names, so that I'll 

read the person who's up next and then the person following 

that person, so that they can be ready to speak. 

          Please always start by giving your name and your

address.  The first speaker is James Henry.  Please unmute 

yourself and start by giving your name and address.  After 

that will be Alfred Fantini.         

          JAMES HENRY:  Good evening.  This is James Henry.  

I live at 93 Playstead Road in Medford, Massachusetts.  I 

work for Senator Salvi Dominico, who represents East 

Cambridge.  I've testified on his behalf at previous 

hearings in support of this project.   

          The Galleria and their team:  They have been an 

amazing, incredible, helpful group of people always out to 

help the community, and the Senator wanted me to come here 

and just voice his support for the project, and I appreciate 

all the time.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Alfred Fantini, who will be followed by Christopher Schmidt.  

Alfred Fantini, you can unmute yourself if you're available, 

and begin by giving your name and address.     

          ALFRED FANTINI:  Yes.  My name is Alfred Fantini.  

I live at 4 Canal Park, Unit 203.  I'm speaking in support 

of the Cambridgeside 2.0 application.   

          As an abutter and as someone who has watched the 

Cambridgeside being built, I've come to know them well, and

I've always been impressed by their willingness, flexibility 

and genuine desire to be good neighbors to my building, but 

to all of the Cambridge community, as I'm sure you will hear 

tonight.  It's just part of their DNA. 

          We received a letter of provisional support from 

the East Cambridge Planning Team, and I'm confident that the 

Cambridgeside will respond reasonably, as they always have.  

Cambridge is a better place with a vibrant Cambridgeside 

here.  Thank you very much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Christopher Schmidt, who will be followed by Tanya Hayes 

Lee.   

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  Thanks.  Christopher 

Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street.  I just wanted to say that I saw 

this presentation at East Cambridge Planning Team a couple 

weeks ago and counter to my expectations, I was actually 

super excited by this.   

          I really think that the look of this, the redesign 

of First Street moving from -- you know, blank walls and 

parking garage to an active first-floor retail area and all 

this other stuff, it's just really -- really seems like an 

exciting project to me.

          I -- you know, I don't have a full understanding, 

and I know the Planning Board will go into this on kind of 

phasing and other elements like that.   

          You know, as someone who is concerned about 

housing and cost of housing and everything else in the city, 

I'd love to have a better understanding, which is just hard 

for me of kind of like when housing would be available, when 

that would come. 

           I know this is all covered in the PUD, but I just 

didn't get a sense of that.  But overall, like really just 

think this seems like a really nice development.  I don't 

typically get excited about commercial or retail 

development, but this just seems like such an improvement 

over what's there today. 

          So -- you know, I guess I don't really have 

anything else to say.   It looks great.  I hope it goes 

forward.  Thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Tanya Hayes Lee, who will be followed by James Spencer. 

          TANYA HAYES LEE:  Hi, this is Tanya Hayes Lee.  As 

an artist and a resident of Cambridge for many decades, I'd 

like to take this opportunity to speak on behalf of

Cambridgeside's interest in the arts.  When my work was 

selected for an inclusion in a virtual art show at the Mall, 

the professional of the staff was outstanding, and it was 

clear that Cambridgeside team truly cares about local 

artists.   

          I believe that the plans for revitalizing 

Cambridgeside will help ensure that the arts play an 

important role in building a vibrant community and 

neighborhood.   

          I'd like to read a statement by Steve Bennett, who 

is not able to attend tonight.  Steve says, "I've worked 

with Cambridgeside for the past three years on multimedia 

art projects, and I'm truly excited about Cambridgeside's 

plans to expand its arts program.   

          "Cambridgeside has worked closely with the city 

for at least a decade, and has been a wonderful, supportive 

partner in the arts.  It's helped make Cambridge an ideal 

place to develop and practice arts in all forms and genres. 

          "I'm particularly impressed by how carefully the 

Cambridgeside team considered its arts projects, so that 

they meet the needs of the Cambridgeside patrons, the 

surrounding community, and local artists.  I look forward to

a renewed Cambridgeside that can integrate art into the 

experience of visitors and residents.  

          Thank you." 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  And can you give your 

address, please? 

          TANYA HAYES LEE:  38 Linnaean Street in Cambridge.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

James Spencer, who will be followed by Fabrizio Gentili.   

          JAMES SPENCER:  Hi, this is Jim Spencer, lifelong 

Cantabridgian.  My family has been in Cambridge for 

generations.  I've been involved in the Cambridge community 

for decades.  Recently I retired from the Middlesex 

Sherriff's Office.  I am now the Executive Director of the 

Cambridge Black History Project. 

          The Cambridgeside Project is essential to 

Cambridge in these times, creating jobs, needed affordable 

work, workforce housing and millions of dollars annually to 

the City of Cambridge in revenues -- monies that can be used 

to improve our schools and provide more municipal services. 

          The project also will provide millions of dollars 

of transportation improvements, millions of dollars of 

contributions to community organizations, including $9

million to the East End House, $1.3 million to the East 

Cambridge Scholarship Fund, and significant contributions to 

the local arts community. 

          Please include the special permit application.  

East Cambridge surely needs this project.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Fabrizio Gentili, who will be followed by Heather Hoffman.  

          FABRIZIO GENTILI:  Hello, Fabrizio Gentili from 72 

Sciarappa Street, so a few blocks away from the development.  

I want to speak in favor.  Can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

          FABRIZIO GENTILLY:  Okay, I'm sorry, I didn't see 

the timer.  And I just want to speak in favor.  In the last 

15 years since I moved here, I've only seen the Mall and 

their developers engage with the community.  And it seems 

like in one of the examples in which they understand the 

community benefits it's an investment with a higher return 

even than the zoning that they're getting, because it gives 

them just the success. 

          And this is going to be a great addition to the 

neighborhood and to the city and the regional together.  So 

I hope it moves forward, and quickly.  So thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Heather Hoffman.  Actually maybe I have you on here twice.  

And I have you on mute.  Can you give your name and address?

          [Pause]  

          Heather Hoffman? 

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  I was just asked to be unmuted.  

I am not Heather Hoffman, but I'm --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is the trick of Zoom.  The 

names are -- the name that comes up is Heather Hoffman, but 

please give your name and address.   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah.  And we are often confused 

in the real world.   

          My name is Chris Matthews.  I live at 26 Sixth 

Street.  I've been a Board Member of the East Cambridge 

Planning Team for 18 years, but I'm speaking in a personal 

capacity here to support the letter that the -- the positive 

letter that the East Cambridge Planning Team sent.  I do 

very much support the project. 

          And I'd just like to take the opportunity to say 

that I don't view Cambridgeside -- the development of 

Cambridgeside is something coming -- being imposed upon us.  

I view Cambridgeside as our neighbors.

          I think I've worked tirelessly over the last 20 

years to really understand the community and to become a 

part of the community.  And as such, they've brought a lot 

of life down to Riverfront.  I would like to see that happen 

for another generation or two.  So I enthusiastically 

support the project.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

George Summer, who will be followed by Tom Joyce.  George 

Summer, you can unmute yourself and begin by giving your 

name and address.   

          GEORGE SUMMER:  Okay.  My name is George Summer, 

and I live at 29 Otis Street, Apartment F 208.  And I want 

to go on record at this Planning Board hearing as being in 

full support of the Cambridge style renovation.   

          Also, I'm representing three of my neighbors -- 

Rodman Comsey, Ali Maleehe, and Joseah Streller [all names 

phonetic], who also support the project.   

          The project is in full compliance with the zoning 

and regulations of the city, and was approved last year.  

We'll generate substantial financial support for 

transportation improvements, a variety of contributions for 

community institutions, and needed revenue for the City of

Cambridge.   

          This development will have a major impact on the 

East Cambridge neighborhood, particularly First Street.  It 

is clear that we cannot allow this area to become a dead 

zone.  Rather, it needs to be reinvigorated to remain an 

active city center.   

          Cambridgeside has always been a multiuse area, 

offering not just shopping, but also general recreation 

where families, friends have met to enjoy the access to the 

Canal and river, shop or have a meal together.   

          Most importantly, and we're going through this 

right now, Cambridge businesses and residents have been 

badly hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.   

          This development will provide urgently needed job 

opportunities and the increase in shoppers and diners will 

help to revitalize the many small businesses in the area 

that are now suffering financially.  Let us get this project 

started and revitalize East Cambridge, creating the vibrant 

atmosphere that we all see.   

          This is a project that is good for the community, 

and good for Cambridge at large.  We need to move forward as 

fast as possible to approve this development.  Thank you

very much for your time.   

          JOSEPH OKPAKU:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Tom Joyce, who will be followed by Stephanie Couch.   

          TOM JOYCE:  Hello, this is Tom Joyce.  I have 

worked in Cambridge -- East Cambridge specifically -- since 

1984, and have lived here since 1994.  So I've witnessed 

sort of the whole life of the Mall.   

          And the whole time that I've been here the façade 

has been very intimidating to the neighborhood.  So I was 

very concerned when I heard of the redevelopment.  I wanted 

to see what was going to happen.              

          And I have to tell you that I'm very happy with 

the streetscape across First Street -- that's something I 

mentioned to Rich McKinnon on day one is that I love the 

façade facing out towards the Canal and wanted to see that 

wrapped around onto First Street.   

          This design is doing that the best they can.  I 

like the fact that the mechanicals, the access for the 

trucks has now been reduced to only one entrance on First 

Street, that's terrific.  And I think that that brings this 

development alive along First Street. 

          I currently live at 270 Third Street, at the

intersection of Binney.  So I know all about plank walls and 

barren areas being brought to life by a new development.  

And I want to see New England Development do for First 

Street what Alexandria has done for Binney Street. 

          And one concern I have with the initial design was 

the height of the tower at 20 Cambridgeside on the Macy's 

site.  It seems very high in the initial design.  It's much 

better now.  In particular, the channel glass on the top 

brings the height down.  It's now in scale with the 

buildings around it.   

          At the East Cambridge Planning Team, we always 

hear, "Oh, we'll only be one or two stories higher than the 

neighbors."  And that's a lousy precedent.  But New England 

Development is staying in scale of the neighbors, and that's 

great to see.  That's what the neighborhood needs. 

          And although I live here now, I used to live on 

Spring Street within a block of the Mall, moving from 

apartment to apartment in East Cambridge to try to stay 

someplace affordable.   

          Now I'm very lucky to have an affordable unit here 

at 270 Third Street, and I'm looking forward to seeing 

people like myself get affordable units in this development,

because this unit is the one and only reason why I'm allowed 

to still live in Cambridge.  So I love the opportunity that 

other people will get the great bonus that I got.  Thank you 

very much.   

Heather Hoffman. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Stephanie Couch, who will be followed I believe by the real 

          STEPHANIE COUCH:  Hi, this is Stephanie Couch.  

Like others have said, I do believe that the design and 

planned improvements along First Street will be a big 

benefit.  I live at 10 Rogers Street.   

          I don't own a car, so I'm regularly walking from 

the Lechmere Station down First Street, and without the 

activation that’s proposed sometimes later at night it can 

be a bit intimidating, and I find the design and the plans 

to be warm, welcoming and I think will ultimately make me 

feel safer as I walk down First. 

          I also appreciate the flexibility that has been 

demonstrated by the changes in the community benefits to 

represent things we as neighbors find to be higher value, 

like the investment of East End House, and also, making sure 

that there are arts and spaces for non-profits that can be

activated, those sorts of things. 

          And the third, which I don't see on the slide that 

I have been reassured many times, is the commitment that 

these wonderful activities that are part of the community 

benefits will be coordinated with others set to come online 

at the Foundry, which is nearby, and also potentially at 

other sites like the Canal District.   

          So all in all, couldn't have asked for a better 

outcome from the dialogues that have been happening now for 

quite some time, and appreciate the way this process has 

worked, and urge you to support this proposal.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Heather Hoffman I 

believe is next, or you can correct me; and followed by 

Michael Doucette.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hi, Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley 

Street.  I will agree with people that there are many, many 

good things about this.  The improvements to Canal Park --  

that crushed stone has long since become a barrier to water, 

making that -- making the Canal be on the land as well when 

it rains; and the improvements to First Street I also am 

happy to see. 

          But since you have a whole bunch of cheerleaders

ahead of me, I can talk about what I don't like.  As I have 

observed many times, their model is quite expansive, and it 

shows that giant middle finger that's right in the heart of 

my neighborhood.   

          This is going to be Towers marching ever closer to 

that big middle finger.  They're bringing Kendall Square 

closer and closer and closer to surround my neighborhood.  

That does not improve the livability for me, as someone who 

has lived here a long time, or for my neighbors, many of 

whom have lived here generations longer than I have. 

          Wet labs:  I think that putting wet labs this 

close to people's home is a very, very bad idea.  Wet labs 

are not good neighbors.   

          The improvements to the Land Boulevard Bridge:  I 

guess that I must be strange, but I've never had a problem 

walking under there.  There did used by artwork under there, 

but it got covered over.   

          I was being happy to see new artwork, and I think 

that they will probably do something really cool, but I hope 

that the lighting is not garish, and respects the fact that 

the natural world needs some dark.   

          So I hope that it will be only as bright as it

needs to be to make it so that you can see where you're 

going, and that it mostly leaves the water dark at night.   

          And then there's the issue of the noise that comes 

with all of the programming and excitement and everything.  

There are people's homes here.   

          So I hope that -- and in fact they are planning on 

building a bunch of homes.  That's a wonderful thing, but 

people do want to sleep at some point.   

          So I hope that they will remember that people live 

around there, and that they will tone down the music and 

otherwise make this the good neighbor that they aspire to 

be.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker and 

the last with hand raised is Michael Doucette.  I'll just 

use this opportunity to remind folks that at this point, if 

you would like to speak and you haven’t spoken yet, please 

push the button that says, "Raise hand" on Zoom.  Or if 

you're connected by telephone, you can press *9 on your 

phone.  Thanks.   

          Michael Doucette, you can unmute yourself and 

begin with your name and address.

Doucette.  I'm located at 195 Old Colony Ave in South 

Boston.  I've been looking after this project for some time.  

I do appreciate the research that's gone into it, they've 

considered some of the different logistics of the area. 

          My background, just so you understand -- I'm a 

business agent with the Ironworkers Local 7, representing 

many men and women that live in that Cambridge community.   

          We stand in support of this project.  I think 

they've carefully looked at the it with the arts, trying to 

fit in with the neighborhood.   

          The newly expanded Green Line should readily move 

the people to and from work and living…just some of the 

housing, the responsible development, along with the labor 

agreements that are in place…  You know, the people working 

there…  local jobs, local people will come out of there with 

good health care, a pension plan and a means to retire.   

          So all around, I think it's great for the 

community.  And thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  So the next speaker and 

the last is Phil Rhinehart [phonetic.] Please start with 

your name and address.     

          PHIL RHINEHART:  Hi.  My name is Phil Rhinehart,

17 Otis Street. I speak in support of this for all the 

reasons that have been mentioned so far.  I'm curious, 

though, about the economics of this project, since COVID-19 

appears to have cut the demand for office space going 

forward.   

          And I would like to hear from the petitioners if 

they do have a chance to respond at some point what they 

feel about the market for office space in Cambridge going 

forward.  Because I'm afraid that with the construction of 

this and the other projects going on that a number of these 

buildings may be unoccupied for some period of time.  And 

I'm just curious if there are any thoughts on that.  Thank 

you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  This will be the last 

call if you haven't spoken yet and would still like to 

speak, please push the, "Raise hand" button in your Zoom 

window or push *9 if you're on your phone.  I'll give you a 

few seconds.     

          [Pause] I'm not seeing any additional hands, so 

I'm going to assume that that's all for public comment at 

this stage.  I'll turn it back over to the Chair.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you, Jeff.  So the next 

61

part of the hearing is the -- we move from public comment to 

Planning Board discussion.   

          It's 7:45, and my guess is this to the discussion 

will take a little bit of time, so may I suggest that we 

take just a five-minute break and come back at 7:50 to 

resume the rest of the meeting?    

                         * * * * * 

(7:50 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  Mary T. Flynn, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven 

                  A. Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, 

                  Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza 

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So we will resume.  I'm just 

checking to see if we have all of the Planning Board back, 

and it looks like we're going to have to wait another minute 

or two.  We're still waiting for some members to return. 

          In the interim, I see that the model is up on 

camera, and so perhaps before we begin the Board discussions 

-- unless the other members are back, you could just take us 

on a tour of the area via the model?  

          Let me just make sure -- let me see who else.  

You, Ted; Lou…  Okay.  We're still waiting on Steven Cohen 

and I think Corinne might be back.  But I can't really tell.

So let's begin that yes, okay.  And if Board members have 

questions while the model is being shown, just state your 

name or raise your hand, and I will recognize you.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I have one quick question for 

the developers.  Will any of the retail that fronts First 

Street have access into the core retail in the center, or is  

all the access going to be through the connectors and off 

the Canal, and off of the other side streets that's name is 

escaping me at the moment?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Let me see here, Jeff's come 

back.  Okay.  So would someone from the Development team 

like to just address that question?     

          DAVID MANFREDI:  Oh, yes.  This is David Manfredi.  

So I believe the queue is the new retail -- the street front 

retail, will it have connection into the Mall?  So some of 

the retail on First Street, the front doors will be on 

First.   

          Some of the retail will -- new retail will be on 

that connector going through what is currently the old Sears 

building, and it will have frontage on that arcade that will

lead you into the Galleria -- actually into the food court. 

          And some of that retail we anticipate could have 

frontage on Thorndike Way as well as frontage on that 

arcade.   

          So it will enhance the porosity.  There will be a 

number of ways to come through a storefront on Thorndike 

Way, but also have an entrance on that arcade and bring you 

directly into the Mall.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Mary, this is Tom.  I have a 

question about the model.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Actually, what I need -- I don't 

know if it's a question about the model, but it's a view 

that I want to see more closely on the model, and it's the 

relationship between the hotel and the proposed laboratory 

building at -- on I guess it's 20 Cambridgeside.  Just that 

joint -- exactly that.   

          David Manfredi spent quite a lot of time 

explaining the virtues of the urban condition of the new 

street on First Street, and I wanted to -- and it related to 

a rational arrangement of the proposed buildings.

20

21

22

          And I wanted to understand the way -- his thinking 

about this very great change in scale between the hotel and 

the proposed building and how is that resolved 

urbanistically? (sic)      

          DAVID MANFREDI:  So there are several things that 

are going on in that theme.  One is that is a curb cut today 

-- will be a curb cut to parking below grade.  What we've 

done is we've set back even further that bay of building, 

which is 33 feet wide, between the new building and the 

hotel.   

          And if you look at the model, and maybe you can 

point to it Brian, you have the base and then a kind of 

middle, and then the top -- actually that's clad in metal in 

a bronze color, and it wraps down in plane down to the 

street, and then wraps around onto the north and west side 

of the building. 

          And so, our goal there was not just to collide 

into the adjacent building, but to allow the hotel building 

to return and have a corner and have a little bit of 

breathing room.   

          And you can see the hotels -- basically I think 

were within about two or three feet in height in terms of 

our street frontage zone and the height of the hotel.

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay, great.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Are there any other 

questions father Board pertaining to the model?  Okay.  

Hearing none, let me just back up a bit then, before we 

continue.  So thank you to everybody from the public who 

commented.   

          And I just want to say if this hearing moves to a 

second public hearing, there will be another opportunity for 

public comment at that time.  Additional written comments 

may also be submitted. 

          We also received memos on this application from 

staff at the Community Development, Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation Department, and the Department of Public 

Works.   

          So with that, let me return to the Board, and are 

there questions from the Board members regarding the overall 

proposal or any particular part of it.  Lou?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.  I'd like to know the 

range of sizes in the housing units.  There seems to be 

quite a large group of sizes.  I'd like to know either maybe 

minimum to maximum or?         

66

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Who from the team would like 

to answer that?     

          RICHARD MCKINNON:  Can you hear me?      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.         

          RICHARD MCKINNON:  This is Richard McKinnon.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          RICHARD MCKINNON:  Oddly enough, Lou, this is one 

of the things that has to be deferred, because there's a 

long process that we go through with your Housing Division, 

and part of that is not only setting up the units that are 

affordable in the 65 percent, but also working on what the 

sizes of the unit are.   

          So that's a process that typically goes on after 

the special permit has been issued, but has to be resolved 

before the building permit is issued. 

          So we've already begun working with Linda 

Prosnitz.  But I'd be getting ahead of ourselves if I 

answered the question definitively now, because she is not 

bashful about having a lot to say about it.     

          DAVID MANFREDI:  Well, this is preliminary, as 

Rich says.  The current range that we are working with is 

from 500 square feet to 100 square feet.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.  That's more of 

what I was looking for.  I knew we were a little ahead of 

ourselves, but there's quite a long list of different 

apartment units, so I'm just curious.     

          DAVID MANFREDI:  Yeah.  And it's heavy on the -- 

as we agreed in our commitment letter to do heavy on the 

three -- you know, on the family units, what we call three 

bedroom units, which obviously will be the larger size 

units.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Any other questions, Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Not right now.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, very good.  Questions from 

other Board members?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Sorry, Mary.  I have a question 

which perhaps I should have started at the outset.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.    

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  And this is Tom.  Jeff Roberts 

explained that we're doing a conceptual level review, 

preliminary for the PUD special permit application.  The 

application materials that I received delivered to my house 

also include a detailed Article 19 Design Review of two

buildings, and I wanted to understand how I should point my 

questions and comments here.   

          Should it be towards comments around the general 

conformance, or are we getting into Design Review on the two 

buildings that were also submitted in support of the 

application?       

          MARY FLYNN:  My sense is that we are focused on 

the preliminary project review, and not doing Design Review 

this evening.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  That's great.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I think it's too soon to do that.  

And Jeff, if I'm incorrect in stating that procedurally, 

please pop in.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  I heard my name, 

so I sort of popped in.  [Jeff Roberts, from Community 

Development.] So I think the procedural point to keep in 

mind -- the package, as you noted, is pretty extensive 

because it kind of reaches, you know, from the -- you know, 

from the concept plan all the way into much of the design.  

          But there is a process -- a decision-making 

process that the Planning Board has to go through.  The 

first is this conceptual preliminary determination on the

whole plan.   

          Then the next would be a special permit for the 

development plan, which would have conditions as to the 

mitigation phasing and Design Review procedures for each 

individual building, so that would be the next step. 

          And then after that step would come the design 

approval for individual buildings.  So the Board is, you 

know, free to make comments on whatever the Board wants to 

make comments on, but our suggestion is to try to follow the 

decision-making process so that, you know, we can get 

through it smartly.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, you're not proposing to 

do all of those steps tonight, I hope?  Right, we're just 

doing the PUD special permit?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  There has to be --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Conceptual level?         

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, there has to be a 

preliminary determination at this hearing, and then a second 

hearing has to be scheduled --     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- filed with the plan.

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  That's clear, thank you -- and 

a great relief.              

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Can I follow?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I do want to follow up on 

that, because most of my comments really go to design.  And 

if we don't talk about that this evening and, you know, move 

on to a later hearing, I don't think it's fair either to the 

Board or to the developer to then talk about some design 

issues, when they will have moved forward and, you know, 

they've done much more extensive plans I assume, to then be 

hit with, "Well, did you think about this or did you think 

about that?"  And so, I just wonder whether we don't need to 

say some things that can then be addressed at a further 

hearing?       

          MARY FLYNN:  So my understanding is that it's 

totally appropriate to discuss design issues or points this 

evening, it's just that we are not going to be giving 

signoff on Design Review, to say that it's complete.   

          So I think anything that the Board wants to see 

and explore in addition to what is already presented is to

be put forth, and we can -- if we do agree to move this 

forward, then we'll just -- you know, put all of those 

things that are of concern to us on the list of things to be 

addressed at the final development hearing -- Development 

Plan hearing. 

          Let's see.  Okay.  Any other questions before we 

move on?  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes.  All right.  So I have a 

lot of feedback as always.  And I want to take a minute to 

first thank the petitioner.  As some people might remember, 

I opposed this zoning when it came up.  And I felt some of 

my complaints during that process were that this was being 

presented as a way to, "save the Mall" which is something 

that we already did in a previous approval of allowing the 

third floor of the Cambridgeside mall to become office 

space, understanding that changes in economics for retail 

were threatening the finances of the Mall. 

          So I noticed that all the materials here have left 

out that language.  That language has largely been apart 

from this conversation, and I really appreciate that. 

          I also really appreciate the report, the pounds of 

reading that we have.  I think that this is a really great

example of the things we need to see from other 

developments.   

          So for example I appreciated rather than just 

saying something like, "This will create jobs" I appreciated 

seeing how many jobs it will create, and at what point in 

time. 

          I do want to say that I find the Mall to be a 

respectful and good neighbor.  I do think that it is 

exemplary in Cambridge in terms of welcoming and respecting 

all people.  I appreciate that there are public restrooms 

for example, and that someone could hang out in the Mall and 

be cool on a hot day or warm on a cold day without being 

bothered by security guards or police or anything like that. 

So I do appreciate that. 

          I want to push a little more on some of the 

details.  So for next time, some of the things that I need 

more information about -- I'm going to call this accounting 

-- I want really clear and explicit accounting so that we on 

the Planning Board can make decisions we're required to 

consider; for example, whether this provides benefits to the 

city, which outweigh its adverse effects to the setback. 

          So I would like to see what I'm going to call 

73

"time accounting." I'd like to see a timeline that helps me 

understand dates.  When would housing be delivered?  You 

know, does construction start in 2021, and housing is 

delivered in 2027, or is housing delivered in 2021?   

          I would like to know more about when jobs are 

delivered, so I would like to see on that timeline if we're 

expecting to close the Mall at any point in time and lay 

people off for example, how long would that last?   

          Or are those jobs consistent through the entire 

timeline, understanding that construction will be part of 

the timeline resulting in 3000 construction jobs -- how long 

can those last? 

          I would like to know in the timeline when money is 

delivered.  I appreciated having some detail on that with 

the East End House funding, and I appreciate that that money 

has already started to be delivered to the community.   

          Because as soon as we start construction, we are 

starting to create nuisance to the community.  So it's 

important that we're not doing that first, and then giving 

mitigation much later.   

          So I'd like to know when we can expect those 

different taxes inflows, when we can expect some of the

different community benefits that were outlined in the 

project plan.        

          So I would like to ask for a timeline to the best 

of the petitioners' ability before we meet next, 

understanding that some of those details can't happen until 

this meeting allows a project to move forward, et cetera. 

          I have questions about space accounting.  And this 

might be a question for Jeff.  But in all of this 

conversation, we're erasing the recent approval of the 

changes on the third floor of the Mall, which were approved 

last year.  I would like to know why that square footage is 

sort of buried in this, and I would like to specifically 

know where I can look at that square footage. 

          I also want to know why we keep talking about 

575,000 square feet -- net new square feet, when really this 

is an 805,000 square feet project.   

          I understand that the Garage is considered 

existing square footage, but that feels -- it feels 

inaccurate to not call that, "new" because a garage being 

changed into lab space in every sense of the word in English 

is a new use.  So I would like clarification whether that's 

from staff or from the petitioner.

          I would like more nuance in the community benefit 

-- what I'll call, "community benefits accounting."  So we 

talked about $90 million dollars in community benefits.   

          The presentation and the materials specifically 

outline $18 million dollars in community benefits.  So I 

would like to see how we're getting to this number of $90 

million.  It may be that we're talking about tax revenues, 

which is fine, but I would like to see how that works out.   

          I would like to see all the finances, with time to 

review them prior to the next meeting.  So my back of the 

envelope calculations project $100 million dollars of the 

rental revenue per year.  I would like to see a petitioner's 

calculations.  I would like to see expected rents broken 

down by building and type.   

          I understand there may be some subsidized retail.  

I want to understand reasonable expectations of market-rate 

retail, market-rate lab space, market-rate housing, expected 

income for inclusionary rentals for the middle-income 

rentals.   

          And I guess I would say that in general just to 

make sure that for zoning under 12.34.3 we have most of 

these materials, but not all.   

76

20

21

22

          So for example, I want to see written materials 

that talk about the future selling or leasing of all or 

portions of the PUD such as land area, dwelling units and 

public facilities.  I want to see the statement of the 

financing plan, including projected sources and amounts of 

funds.  We have one sentence about that, but I would like to 

see more. 

          I would like to talk more about projected rent 

levels or selling price by unit size, and that's also 

covered under that part of the zoning as well.   

          I also want to be really explicit and understand 

how to Judge afford and workforce housing.  We keep calling 

it, "affordable and workforce housing," but I would like to 

see explicitly in the materials that come to us and also to 

City Council tables that help us remember what those 

salaries are.   

          Because I think when most of the public thinks 

about affordable and workforce housing, they're not 

understanding that we're talking about a family earning 

$140,000 a year getting this housing.   

          And we do know that we have a need to make sure 

that we protect middle-income folks here.  But because

22

income inequality is so high here, I want to make sure that 

the public really understands that this housing is not going 

to largely benefit people who are making minimum wage; that 

a person who works at the mall in retail would probably not 

be able to afford to live in the--quote, unquote-- 

"workforce housing" unless I'm wrong about that.  And I 

would like to see those details. 

          I also want to see the draft Letter of Commitment, 

or at least the materials that are helping to form the 

Letter of Commitment.  I realize it might be too early in 

the process to have an actual draft Letter of Commitment.  

But I would like to see more of those details. 

          I would like to see something that I'm calling, 

"equity accounting."  So job types:  I'd like to know what 

kind of jobs we have in general on the acreage now, and when 

it's closed for construction -- again, how many layoffs are 

expected. 

          And then when everything is open, how many jobs by 

type do we expect.  My assumption from reading the materials 

is that we actually have a really nice example here of 

employing people from all different backgrounds, all 

different educational levels, and that this really is going

to be exemplary of a development that would be a great place 

to work.  But I want to see that laid out for our review. 

          And I understand that it's not appropriate to show 

the construction plan now, but in the construction plan when 

we are looking at it, I would like to know when construction 

would start specifically, how long construction would last, 

how and when streets will be closed, and for how long?   

          What bike lanes will be closed and for how long, 

which sidewalks will be closed and for how long?  Who will 

be affected by construction noise and construction traffic, 

and how they'll be supported during that process? 

          I would remind us that one of our public speakers 

said, "You know, people live around here." And I would like 

to also remind Planning Board members of our recent meeting 

where we denied a request to change because we cared about 

the rights of a neighbor who would hear noise on a 

playground and see light from that project.  And we 

protected the peaceable enjoyment of their property.   

          I have not -- I want to make sure that we're using 

those same words and values for neighbors all across 

Cambridge, not just people who live in multimillion-dollar 

homes or who own multimillion-dollar homes, I want that same

peaceable enjoyment for people who rent at market rate, or 

people who have subsidized housing.   

          We all deserve to enjoy our homes and our streets.  

And I think one thing that we don't talk about enough with 

these big projects is how construction impacts our 

enjoyment.  It might look beautiful and fantastic when it's 

done, but if it is a 10 year construction project, that's 

impactful and harmful along the way. 

          So none of those are questions for tonight, but I 

would like to see that before our next meeting, please?       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you Corinne.  That 

was quite a list.  You are always very, very thorough, and 

I'm thinking about all the additional pounds of reading. 

          I'm not sure that all of that information can be 

provided by the developer.  I think he has some of it in 

terms of the questions regarding affordable housing or 

workforce housing may be more appropriately directed to our 

Housing staff, but I'm sure we can have them explain to you.   

          So we've been taking notes, so as much as we can 

get from the developer and the team, we will strive to do 

that.  Okay.  So any -- let's move on them.  Let me just 

keep going through the Board members, and if you have

questions, ask questions or -- you know, just we can also 

comment at this point.   

          So Steven Cohen, why don't you go next?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Okay.  Well, given that this is 

the preliminary step, I do not want to get into the details.  

And I will frequently defer to the architects on the details 

in any event.   

          But, you know, our ideal when we -- you know, deal 

with proposals for any development in Cambridge -- in the 

ideal world, we would want to -- you know, approve projects 

that are commercial; certainly offices and what have you, 

but in the ideal world we'd also like to see projects that 

contribute to the community.   

          More often than not -- much more often than not, 

we don't really hear much about community benefits.  We're 

focusing on the commercial, on the building itself.  We want 

to make sure that it's aesthetically positive, and so forth.   

          But I'm frequently skeptical about how much it 

actually contributes to the welfare of the community and the 

residents of the community.   

          This proposal is a model of the opposite.  

Obviously, it's aesthetically appealing, and obviously it

has commercial benefits for the community and the city.  But 

it really contributes to the community as well in so many 

ways.   

          And I just have to acknowledge that and really 

respect that this project and this developer.  And this 

developer has a history of caring about communities, and I 

have to acknowledge that and respect that.   

          But it really, it's here in spades that this isn't 

just an office building or retail building.  This is a 

developer that cares a lot about contributing to the 

community.   

          And, you know, as I said, I -- at this stage, I 

don't want to dwell on the details, I'll defer to others, 

but for the big picture here, I think it's a fabulous 

proposal.  I respect the developers, I respect the proposal 

and I'm very pleased, certainly at this stage of the process 

to support it.         

          MARY FLYNN:  All right. Thank you very much.  

Hugh, would you like to go next?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Sure.  Just let me wet my 

whistle.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Sure.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So the big picture is that it's 

basically the project we've been shown evolving five times.  

And this is not much evolution of use or massing -- really 

basically what we looked at the last couple of times.   

          There is an evolution in the architectural 

character of the buildings, and I think it's wonderful that 

they're using brick as a primary planning material, using 

different bricks, using different kinds of detailing.   

          They've really taken advantage of a lot of things 

you can do with brick to get a real richness to the project 

and, as David said, make a relationship to many of the other 

buildings in the area. 

          So I think there's more information in the 

submittal -- more detail than I think I've ever seen in a 

PUD project.  I remember that things like University Park 

and the Cambridge Crossing project, you know, had only the 

diagrams of massing and statements of use.   

          This goes way beyond that, and I think there's 

enough detail to really understand the intent.  Yes, there 

will be more work needed in monitoring it. 

          I think the staff reports are also more thorough 

and more detailed than I can remember seeing before.  And

some of the -- you know, much of the material in the review 

is really aimed at later phases of the review process.  But 

having it out there up front I think is an advantage.  

Because we can see -- you know, we know what we're going to 

be doing.   

          Yeah, I would love to see the way the housing 

works out.  And I would feel free to comment on that, but I 

don't think we're going to see that for several years, just 

because of the timing of the schedule. 

          So I have a few things that I would like to see.  

And I'm not going to really state what will have to be done 

in the PUD section, but I just want -- things I've noticed.  

          I would like to see some slopes and elevations 

added to the Garage plans, so that I could understand what's 

going on down there I understand it's there, and they're not 

proposals to change that, but I'm just very curious.    

          Suppose I could take a big bicycle trip and try to 

figure it out myself, but I don't think we want me riding my 

bike in the parking garage. 

          I'm wondering where the small kids in the new 

housing are going to play; i.e., Tot Lot or appropriate 

things. And I don't know where those opportunities exist.

Some of them may actually exist offsite.  There's a DCR park 

that abuts this property, and maybe that might be an 

enhancement to that park. 

          I think there should be -- I think you should 

think about the pocket park next to the housing entry at 90 

First Street.  I think in some sense, we have to think about 

that pocket park as the front yard of that building -- yeah, 

well, it's really a side yard -- and think about the uses 

that would be particularly welcome for the residents of the 

building. 

          You know, I don't think there's room to use it all 

for a Tot Lot, I think that would be not right.   

          But there's a rendering we saw tonight that showed 

lots of laughing young kids, but there were a lot on the 

sidewalk about to run into the street.  I'm not sure that's 

where we want to encourage that. 

          So I think it's -- ultimately it's a decision -- a 

design decision that gets -- maybe there's an intent 

expressed at the PUD level that gets worked out in the 

Design Review of the housing building. 

          I would note that if you try to dig into the 

bicycle parking, there are many plans, but they aren't all

very consistent.  As an architect, I can make a guess as to 

which one is the one way they're headed, but that's 

something that probably can get fixed in the resubmittal.  

          Now, there are 10 bays of windows facing Land 

Boulevard that back up to the loading dock.  And there seems 

to be a four or five-foot wide space behind them that's not 

being used by the trucks.   

          So I'm guessing that's some kind of a display 

space that could have art in it, that could have history in 

it, it could have, you know, stories of what's happening up 

above, and then in the buildings up above.   

          I just would like that clarified as to what the 

intent is, and maybe some more thought given as to what is 

the -- are they trying to enliven that relatively dead 

pedestrian street, and it's dead because there really aren't 

a lot of strong desire lines right along that side.  So 

think some more about that.   

          The mall connector -- some of the spaces in 

existing malls get pretty deadly, and it has it's very 

important to have that connector, because I understand 

that's the only opportunity to connect from First Street 

into the Mall -- loading docks, and the service strategy for

the retail essentially making impossible to cross from the 

retail on First Street into the Mall. 

          So enlivening that connector -- another thought I 

had is, what happens if there are some, like, shadow bay 

windows, maybe 18 inches sticking out of the connector, that 

allow you to see into the retail stores, so you get a -- 

instead of having to look sidewalks, you look forward and 

you see those stores?   

          There's a -- perhaps the largest space I'm aware 

of is down on the St. James Avenue, the horizontal 

skyscraper that dates from the 1920s -- I've forgotten the 

name of the building, but there's a retail corridor 

lengthwise down that block. 

          And they've done all of things there in terms of 

architectural detail -- small detail.  I think it would be -

- there's a bicycle room serving the, I don't know Lechmere 

Building 60, that fronts onto the Mall corridor.   

          And I can understand you don't want to, you know, 

put big windows to show parked bikes.  But you could save 80 

feet of walking if there is a door from that bike room 

straight into that corridor that more or less aligns with 

the door of the Mall corridor into the office building 

87

lobby.   

          And as a matter of convenience for the bike riders 

who may be willing to go along on wheels, it will make the 

foot distance shorter as something you ought to consider.  

Maybe there are security reasons or other reasons that make 

it difficult. 

          And I guess I'd make one last comment.  It 

actually has a shallow outdoor terrace that’s a curved 

section facing the Canal.  And I think that's a very, very 

strong move that breaks down the scale a little bit there, 

where the 60 Building is taller than the retail corridor 

building, and creates some life.   

          Apparently, there's a material change there and 

I'd like to see in the next go-around a rendering that shows 

that transition in greater detail. 

          So again, I think we can easily make the finding 

that we need to make to send this off to the final 

development plan tonight.  I hope we can do that.  Thank 

you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Let's go to Ted, please.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  Well, I -- you know, I 

think this is a wonderful project that hopefully will save

the retail, and I think it will definitely enliven First 

Street, and to an extent Land Boulevard.   

          I have absolutely no problem whatsoever with the 

height or the massings of any of the buildings.  I assume, 

you know, I think CDD staff and Traffic and Parking have 

raised lots of issues that I assume will be addressed in the 

future. 

          And yes, the amount of reading material was 

overwhelming.  I applaud you for everything you've done. 

          I am concerned about the success of the core 

retail.  That was why I asked the question about whether 

things will access off from the retail on First Street.  I 

think there's very little to tell people that there is 

retail inside and that they should go inside and look for 

things.   

          I don't know whether -- obviously it's much too 

early to determine who's going to be there.  But, you know, 

I'm hoping that there is some sort of anchor store or stores 

that will be -- will attract people to come to the area. 

          You know, retail's in a very difficult time right 

now.  And, you know, I don't know where it's going, and I 

definitely would like to see it saved, and whatever you can 

89

do to save it I think is important.  I think it's certainly 

important that from Cambridgeside Place there's some 

wonderful entrance into the interior. 

          Now, we are being asked, or will be being asked to 

comment upon, you know, 20 Cambridgeside and 60 First 

Street.   

          So I'm going to make a couple of comments.  I may 

be a voice in the wilderness, nobody else on the board may 

agree with me.  Staff -- Design Staff may not agree with me, 

but I'm just going to tell you what I think. 

          And I think you've got a wonderful site here with 

so much possibilities.  And I think, you know, you've been 

too timid.  I know what the '85 -- you know, Design 

Guidelines say and I think, you know, talking about 60 First 

                                                     st

Street, it's a handsome building.  But why in the 21  

                                  th

century are we building a faux 19 -century mill building?  I 

just don't understand that.   

          If that had been an existing building and you 

renovated it into an office building, wow it would be 

spectacular.  But why start out from the floor up and build 

something that looks like it was built 200 years ago? 

          You know, even in 1985 we were in a different

place from where we are now.  Retail's different, offices 

and labs are different.  We're dealing with, you know, 

environmental issues.  We're dealing with lots of other 

issues that were not envisioned even 35,40 years ago.  And I 

think we ought to have a modern building that looks like a 

modern building.   

          Yes, you can tip your hat to the historic 

buildings around it, and in fact on this particular -- on 

these streets there aren't an awful lot of historic 

buildings around it.   

          You know, the Foundry's a couple blocks away, the 

Athenaeum's several blocks away.  The buildings on Land 

Boulevard, the buildings now on First Street, you know, are 

not historic buildings, with few exceptions.  And so, I 

would suggest you might rethink that a little bit.   

          When we get to 20 Cambridgeside, I think it was 

interesting that your earlier filing that was on the website 

kept talking about that this was a gateway to Cambridge.  

And I know I kept thinking "Why is this building a gateway?" 

It seems to me it's fairly generic-looking as an office 

building.   

          You've got a fabulous site.  You've got that

fabulous corner, rounded edge.  I can't tell where the 

entrance is.  There's got to be something you can do with it 

to really decorate it to make it something special that will 

lead into, you know, make people want to go there, make 

people want to walk around it and look at it.   

           I know the Guidelines say they should not be -- 

you know, buildings that, you know, call themselves out as 

individual things, but I think you can do more.  I remember 

back I think your first proposal had a spectacular building 

there, and it kept getting changed and changed, and, you 

know, just became less interesting to me. 

          The thing that’s the most interesting about that 

building is actually the -- I guess it's the enclosure 

around the utilities on the roof.  I think that looks 

fabulous.    

          I know Staff suggested it could be smaller.  I do 

applaud that all the buildings show the utilities being 

completely enclosed.  And I think that's great.  And I 

appreciate that. 

          You know, I know we don't have them before us 

today, but I just think you can do more.  I mean, I know, 

you know, David and your firm can do, you know, really

spectacular things.  And I just think that this is a site 

that really could use some work.   

          Because there aren't a lot of people who walk on 

Land Boulevard right now, and I think it would be great if 

there was a reason for them to go there and say, "Hey, look 

at this. You know, this is a building I'm interested in and 

I want to look at, and I want to have a spectacular 

entrance."   

with them. 

          And, you know, you also need a spectacular 

entrance right next to it into the core.  You know, they're 

handsome, they're fine, but I really wish you would do more 

          Having said that, I'm all on board with the 

project.  You know, I think it's a great thing for this 

neighborhood and for Cambridge as a whole, and I'm really 

supportive -- you know, hope that retail is a big success 

there.  You know, that would be my fondest dream and hope.  

Anyway.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Ted.  I think I would just 

note that this is probably the only time since I've been on 

the Board that we actually sang the praises of a mechanical 

enclosure.  It's --

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It's true [laughter].       

          MARY FLYNN:  Let's see.  Lou, would you like to go 

next?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I'd like to start off 

with one quick question.  At the end of the story here, when 

you're at full buildout, will you be able to maintain a 

public parking garage at your facility?  Do you have enough 

capacity?     

          JOHN TWOHIG:  Based on -- John Twohig -- based on 

our numbers and anticipated demand, we will have excess 

parking for the site.  You know, exactly where numbers are 

and where they may go in a post COVID world short-term, 

long-term, our sense is it's 1700, based on all the data we 

have and the anticipated uses.  I think we will have 

opportunity for spaces. 

          Thank you.  I have to agree with Ted on one thing:  

The original rendition of the building on Land Boulevard was 

gorgeous with the sweeping sides, but you needed to change 

that in response to our request, so I figure that's on us.  

          I have to disagree with Ted on the use of all the 

masonry.  I think it adds some permanence and some strength 

and a little nod to history.  I like the other mix of

materials that you've included. 

          And you've -- like I said, the Mall has always 

been a good neighbor and I think you've come a long way, and 

still trying to finish up the last little bits of reading 

from all of this, and thank you for     all the information.  

I'm glad you didn't have a foldout section on this one.  But 

I think you're ready to pass this on, and good luck.     

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you, Lou.  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Mary.  And thank you 

to the applicant for the description of the all the 

engagement -- lots and lots of it public engagement and 

process; I appreciate that.   

          But it's an enormous proposal.  So it needs that 

kind of engagement I think to get it right.  I would say the 

proposal's very clear, and it's consistent with what we saw 

before.   

          I -- just to cut to the chase, I think that this 

conceptual level plan review certainly passes the test, in 

this Board member's opinion for consistency with the zoning 

that we helped craft for this site. 

          Thank you also for the model.  At least for me, I 

learned some things from it tonight, and very helpful even

now in it's digital presentation.   

          So just quickly, in no order, I was hoping to do 

this in powers of 10, large-scale to small scale, but it's 

too late for me at night for me to be able to organize my 

thoughts that way. 

          But the parks on First Street -- the pocket parks 

which you describe, David, as not yet designed -- you're 

going to have community input to make sure that they're 

different. 

          And I would go back to what I said in an earlier 

hearing: The buildings need to be different, and the 

renderings seem to be promising that.   

          So as we go into further review, the review of the 

architecture I'm going to be seeing as an ensemble, and you 

I think emphasized that in your presentation.   

          Some issues on the sustainability promises.  Solar 

ready:  I don't know, heck, put the panels up there.  You've 

got a massive roof.  I think that would be terrific if you 

could perhaps move that way and just the housing is a long 

time in the future, but you were saying you were evaluating 

it for Passive Housing.   

          It has relatively low, as you know -- energy

needs, NEUI -- and so it's relatively straightforward; not 

straightforward, but something that's been proven over and 

over again that housing can do -- achieve Passive House 

standards pretty readily.  So I would encourage you to not 

strive for it, but to actually do it. 

          I would say -- yeah, I -- sure, I don't know, it's 

a crystal ball when is the housing coming?  I'm with Corinne 

on that.  I'd sure like to know when in the sequence it 

comes, and thank you for the elevations that show your 

buildings both with the garage and without the garage, so 

you are acknowledging there's an interim condition where we 

won't have the full housing. 

          Some details on 20 Cambridgeside.  This is where I 

agree with my fellow Board member Ted on that building.  

Some of the things that caught my eye as I reviewed it, 

thinking that I might have to do Design Review tonight  I 

already talked about in the questions about the joint to the 

Marlowe Hotel, and whether we got that right?   

          Marlowe Hotel, no matter what you think about it, 

there is a kind of jarring change of scale there, and that 

connection I think stands out and could use some more work.  

You've obviously thought about it pretty carefully, but to

make a good street side just moving to the west.   

          The loading dock curb cut's enormous, with a huge 

radius, and that may have to do with the structural grid 

that I see in that loading dock and how the trucks maneuver 

in there.  But that's unfortunate, I think, if there's some 

way to detail that so that that isn't so much of a barrier 

for pedestrians. 

          Hugh was onto my other comment about that side of 

the building.  It's -- and it would be sheet 1.25 in Volume 

3, that elevation looks pretty uninteresting.  And I worry 

about that first floor. And he was saying, "Well, maybe 

there's an opportunity to do something with the activity and 

the experience on the first floor, to give it some variety 

at that loading dock." I think it's a great suggestion, 

ground-floor east elevation curb cut.   

          Mall connector comments have been covered.   

          So to Ted's other comment about this being a 

primary gateway and a primary site, and I can't find the 

entrance:  The way the massing works, in my opinion 

emphasize the garage entrance, the car entrance, which makes 

architecture that celebrates that that's bracketed by the 

park.

          And, like, that's a -- doesn't seem right to me.  

It seems like the wrong emphasis to me and the massing in 

that building.  Maybe the doorway that -- the entry to the 

building might address the park rather than the parking 

garage.  Just conceptually, I find that troubling.   

          But other than that, it's a remarkable and 

staggering amount of work, and I look forward to further 

discussions on all of it, but especially on the 20 

Cambridgeside, which is the building that needs the most 

work in my opinion.   

          That's where I am.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Tom.  All right.  So my 

thoughts on it are similar to many of those that have been 

expressed by my fellow Board members.   

          I do appreciate all of the design and time and 

thought that has gone into the project.  There is a 

tremendous amount for us to review at this point, and even 

though we have reviewed it, I'm sure we're going to continue 

as we move into the next phase. 

          I, like Ted, do have concerns about the Mall.  

Looking at the various renderings, my sense was that you 

just -- it gets lost now.  It has beautiful new architecture

all around it, and yet the -- even though I know you've 

upgraded the mall over the past several years, it now looks 

a little too sedate in comparison to what is surrounding it. 

          I like the connection off of First Street.  I 

understand the barriers to doing more, so I think that puts 

more onus on really making that connection very lively.  I 

like Hugh's idea about the bay windows.  I think that would 

really help. 

           I know the staff memos go into a great amount of 

detail into the additional information that we do need on 

phasing, on all aspects of the project, but belong on the 

housing.  I think it's very, very critical for us to 

understand where that fits in and why.   

          And I also appreciated the comment that the member 

of the public made about the economics coming post COVID.  I 

think, you know, the world is going to be a different place.  

          And I think despite the fact that we may at some 

point be able to go back into offices, I'm not sure that we 

all will.  So, you know, retail is changing, office is 

changing.   

          So if you could just provide, and -- you know, 

just based on what you're learning from the markets or

market projections going forward, if you could just, you 

know, pass some of that information along to us, I think it 

would be helpful in just making it clearer how this same 

building does work economically.   

          My other thought was the roof of the Mall is now -

- you're going to have several buildings overlooking it, and 

I know we are talking about maybe doing some sort of energy 

-- urban sort of green roof.   

          But I'm most concerned about the views out from 

the residential units and, you know, just what are they 

looking at?  So if there's a -- if you could possibly give 

us a rendering of what it's like to look out back of that 

over the space?  I mean, maybe you look right above to all 

of the mechanicals and everything.  But that would be 

helpful to me. 

          So in general I really -- I do love the project, 

like my colleagues.  I think it's really -- it's really a 

wonderful addition.  It does bring the 30-year-old project 

back into the present day, and hopefully will get us into 

the future. 

          And based on what I heard from my fellow members, 

it sounds to me like we are in a position to take action,

and to give a positive preliminary determination on the 

proposal.  If there is anyone who disagrees with that, 

please let me know right now.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Hi, it's Corinne.  I disagree 

with that, but I'm close, so I'd like to see more 

information as requested.  Thank you.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.  Well, we will be asking.  This 

particular approval will include some additional 

information.  I'm not sure that we can absolutely get 

everything that you asked for on your list, but some of it 

is already included in the staff memos, and as I said, some 

may -- could perhaps be provided by the housing staff.   

          So then -- okay, so this is where it gets 

complicated for me.  So if you will just bear with me, okay.  

          So in order to get preliminary approval, we need 

to make the findings that were given to us in the memo from 

the CDD staff; and also, given to us as a separate handout -

- which includes the objectives for a PUD-8 special permit, 

which is Section 13.102.4.  It's very lengthy, so I'm not 

going to read it, since you all have it.   

          It also references several policy plans, including 

the East Cambridge Planning Study, the East End Cambridge

Design Guidelines, the East Cambridge Riverfront plan, East 

Cambridge Development Review process and guidelines and the 

Cambridge Riverfront plan.  We have to find that the 

application is responsive to those things as well. 

          And we have to find the following:   

          That the PUD proposal conforms with the general 

PUD Development controls and district development controls, 

conforms with adopted policy plans or development guidelines 

for that portion of the city, provides benefits to the city, 

which outweigh its adverse effects; considering quality of 

site design, traffic flow and safety, adequacy of utilities 

and other public works, impact on existing public facilities 

and potential fiscal impacts.  And that is Section 12.353. 

          In addition, we will add in the request for 

additional information that is in each of the memos from the 

CDD, Traffic, Parking and Transportation and DPW, and add in 

a request for, or a response to the information requested 

this evening by the Board to the extent that it's within our 

purview. 

adding to a motion?   

          Jeff, is there anything else that we should be 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No, I think you've -- this is Jeff

-- you've got it I think right.  The point is to make the 

findings --        

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  But the findings are contingent, 

and it's just a preliminary determination, so the findings 

are contingent on that final development plan submission 

that includes the information that's requested, you know, as 

you referenced in the staff memos.   

          We didn't get to talk about those much, which is 

perfectly fine, we're happy to have it all in writing and 

save time, but we are here in case Board members have any 

questions about that before moving forward. 

          And then the -- and then the -- I think we have a 

good record the Planning Board members made tonight.  And 

so, we would incorporate those into the preliminary 

determination as requests for additional information.   

          And so, that would be -- that would go along with 

the Board's findings, and then would -- we'll go back to the 

applicant so that they can send a response, which would be 

heard at the future hearing.  That's when the special permit 

could be granted.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you.  So is there a 

104

motion, then, to make a preliminary determination approving 

the development proposal based on the stated findings and 

request for modifications and additional information, and 

subject to future review and approval of a final development 

plan? If a member of the Board would like to make that 

motion, please state your name.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom -- so moved.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  That was Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, so Tom and Lou.  Could we have 

a roll call vote, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's six members voting in favor 

and one opposed.       

MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you to everyone, both the Board 

and the Development team.  It was a lot of information to 

get through, and a lot of information to prepare.  So we're 

not done yet.  We're steps coming, but thank you all very 

much for that.

          Now we're going to move on to agenda item number 

2, which is a requested minor amendment to PUD special 

permit PB #66, and CDD Staff will summarize why this is 

before us.  So I'll turn it back to Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hi, thanks Mary -- Jeff Roberts.

Again, this is kind of a pro forma exercise.  As I noted 

before, we added this to the agenda, because technically it 

is an amendment to a separate special permit.  So we wanted 

to make sure it was indicated there. 

          The application for a minor amendment which is 

anticipated by the zoning that was enacted last year, that 

was packaged along with the development proposal.  It's 

largely become a procedural note to authorize the minor 

amendment. 

          As noted in CDD's comments, we do have some 

suggestions for clarification on that minor permit 

application that we hope we can deal with in the interim 

time.  But for now, we're recommending that the Board 

continue this matter, and then take it up again at the time 

of considering a final decision on the new PUD application.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Are there questions 

from any of the Board members?  Okay, hearing none, is there 

a motion to continue this matter to a future meeting?  

Remember to state your name if you are the one making the 

motion.     

the matter.

favor.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I don't have any, I'll just give a 

pause to see if anybody else on staff has anything they want

to jump in with.     

          [Pause]  

          It doesn't sound like it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  It doesn't sound like it.  Okay.  Do 

any of the Board members have additional comments?  And I'm 

not hearing anything either.  So I want to thank everyone 

for your participation this evening, and the meeting is 

adjourned.     

Appreciate it.
