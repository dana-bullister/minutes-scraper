Flynn, and I am the Vice Chair acting as the Chair for this

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within 

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

          I will start by asking Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible. Jeff? 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you Mary, it's Jeff Roberts 

from Community Development.  I'm just going to quickly take 

Board member attendance and make sure the meeting is

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  So that is seven 

Planning Board members present.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you very much.  The 

first item this evening is an Update from the Community 

Development Department.  I believe Iram is going to do that 

this evening.  So if you would also introduce the staff 

present at the meeting, that would be helpful.               

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Mary.  Good evening.  

Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager, Community Development.  

I will -- I just want to walk through the upcoming schedule 

for the Planning Board for the coming weeks.  We are meeting 

pretty much every week, trying to take one week off before 

the end of the year. 

          Today's meeting the principle item is a public 

hearing on the Kendall Square Canal District PUD, which is a 

zoning petition by BioMed Realty.   

          I'll just say that I have been -- my entire 10 

years with the city, which has been a long time -- I have 

been looking at the stretch of Third Street that is going to 

be impacted by this petition, and trying to think through

how that Eversource gas transfer station could be moved away 

so that that space could be liberated, and that gap tooth 

could be filled with something that is more of an animating 

presence along Third Street. 

          And so, I'm excited to see that this petition is 

here before the Board, and it will address that parcel 

amongst others. 

          There's also a General Business Item, a BZA case 

for 56 Creighton Street on tonight's agenda.  

          And then the Board's next meeting is next week, 

November 17.  And the public hearing on that agenda is 

another zoning petition for the MXD District in Kendall 

Square.   

          This is another important petition for the city, 

because you might recall that there was discussion of the 

Eversource substation that was to be -- that was planned to 

be located on Fulkerson Street. 

          And after a lot of discussion and negotiation, the 

city worked with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority and 

Boston Properties to come up with a proposal where the 

substation could be located not on Fulkerson, where it would 

be right adjacent to an elementary school and playground,

but instead more in the heart of Kendall Square. 

          And this -- and that petition is going to be to be 

able to bring that change in location to fruition. 

          And then on November 24, which is the next meeting 

of the Board, there is a public hearing planned for the 

zoning petition, which is a City Council zoning petition 

related to cannabis delivery in Cambridge.   

          And December 1, we will have a public hearing on 

yet another zoning petition, which has actually come about 

from work of staff in our Economic Development Group as well 

as our Zoning and Development group, and will focus on 

changes to our retail -- the use table related to retail, as 

well as home occupations and really try to bring our -- that 

aspect of our zoning ordinance in line with more modern day 

retail and small business uses. 

          So those are the hearings coming up between now 

and December 1 at the Planning Board, and in related 

discussions at the Council -- the City Council's Ordinance 

Committee will take up the Canal District Kendall Square 

PUD, which you are discussing today, on November 12, which 

is the Thursday. 

          On November 19, next week, the Ordinance Committee

will take up the MXD amendment.   

          And on December 9 they will be -- they will hold a 

hearing on the cannabis delivery rezoning. 

          And the one last item I'll mention is that on 

Thursday, November 12, we also have the first meeting of the 

Net Zero Action Plan five-year review, which has informed a 

lot of the -- well, all the green building aspects that are 

in the ordinance right now, and also, some other non-zoning 

ordinances that the city has, like the Building Energy Use 

Disclosure Ordinance and such. 

          Tom Sieniewicz is the Planning Board's 

representative on that committee, so with that, I am going 

to stop and turn it back to you, chairperson Flynn.       

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is -- and if I could actually 

-- this is Jeff Roberts -- if I could add just a little bit 

of business, I noticed that Nikolas Bowie has joined us.  

Can you just confirm that you're present and the meeting is 

audible to you?                

          [Pause]  

          If you can, I hope.  We can't hear you, so Niko if 

you're with us, can you just let us know if the meeting is 

audible to you?                

10

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Can you hear me now??   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  We can hear you now.  And can 

you hear us?                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  So I will -- so that 

resolves that business.  And just very quickly, just to 

introduce other CDD staff members who are present for the 

folks in attendance, along with Iram and myself:  Swaathi 

Joseph, Daniel Messplay, Erik Thorkildsen, and Liza Paden 

are present.  Thanks.  That’s it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Thank you so much to both 

you and Iram.  Do any of the Board members have questions on 

the Update?       

          COLLECTIVE:  No.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mary?         

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I have a question, I guess 

either for Iram or for Jeff:  Just curious, does the 

transfer of the gas station -- is that tied together with 

the MXD zoning petition at all?               

          IRAM FAROOQ:  So -- through you, Madam Chair -- so

the gas transfer station relates to today's zoning petition.   

          That is not related to the MXD rezoning, which we 

will discuss next week, but there is the whatever source was 

planning on Fulkerson Street, that relates to MXD. So both 

these petitions have a component that relates to Eversource.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  I understood that, but 

they're not tied together at all?       

          MARY FLYNN:  They are not.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great, thank you.  Are there any 

other Board member questions?    

          [Pause]  

          Okay.

                  Espinoza       

          Hearing none, then we will move onto the next item 

on the agenda, which is a public hearing on a zoning 

petition by BMR Third, LLC, a subsidiary of BioMed Realty LP

to create a new Overlay Zoning District entitled, "Planned 

Unit Development at Canal District, Kendall" with 

regulations contained in a new section 13.200. 

          CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us, and I believe Jeff will be doing that.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  I will try to get 

everyone up to speed quickly.  This is a zoning petition 

that was heard by the Planning Board back in September.  We 

discussed at the time that a new hearing had been advertised 

after that petition was referred again, so this is sort of a 

second hearing for the Planning Board on a refiled petition. 

          At the previous hearing, Board members raised some 

issues for the petitioners and staff to work on further.  

Those issues are summarized in the memo that was provided by 

CDD staff. 

          The petitioner also submitted a revised zoning 

petition text, which has some additional -- and they also 

have some additional information to present tonight. 

          Just as a note, the Ordinance Committee hearing 

will be held on Thursday, I think Iram already noted that.  

And then the Planning Board's action with zoning petitions 

is to make an Advisory Recommendation to the City Council.

That's it!        

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Thank you, Jeff.   

          The presenter this evening is Salvatore Zinno from 

BioMed Realty.  We will have up to 30 minutes for your 

presentation.  We would like you to be as concise as 

possible.  Please introduce your project team and begin your 

presentation.  Thank you so much.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Thank you very much.  I'm Sal 

Zinno from BioMed.  I appreciate everyone being here 

tonight.  I'm excited as well to speak to you again about 

our project.  I do hope that there aren't 5000 people here, 

but I'll do my best anyway. 

          With me today I have Geoff from DLA Piper -- Jeff 

Howell, and he's going to be presenting.  We also have a few 

other members of the team -- Kishore from CBT that we've 

brought in case any specific questions come up that he might 

be better positioned to answer. 

          So today we're going to take you through just a 

brief refresher, and then we're going to address some points 

and questions that we heard the last time we were here in 

September.  We will start by reorienting you to the project.  

          The next slide?  So, as many of you know, we

purchased the Parcel C site in 2018.  It's one of the last 

remaining undeveloped sites in Kendall.  So this is the -- 

next to it you can see the GTS site, the gas transfer site 

that’s owned by Eversource. 

          And unlike the substation, it's actually gas 

infrastructure instead of electric.  So this is just the 

view of the gas transfer station from Third Street.  We are 

closer than ever to having the ability to relocate this.  

The cost is significant, but I have a hard time envisioning 

the project happening without this piece.   

          It's unsightly.  It's plagued Third Street for 

decades -- plagued the street that has become a significant 

pedestrian thoroughfare. And unlocking it would allow us to 

create even more in terms of the community benefits that 

we're able to offer here, because of the fact that we're 

creating a larger project with more density. 

          But timing on this front is critical.  The GTS has 

approached -- the equipment within the GETS has approached 

the end of its useful life.   

          So Eversource is going to be -- you know, at a 

point in the relatively near future where they have to 

decide to either renovate the existing facility or move 

15

forward with allowing us to move it.   

          But we are on track to move it.  We have the 

agreements in place with Eversource and Vicinity that secure 

the site and the relocation site, and we've made significant 

progress with the permits, so I'm very optimistic that this 

is going to be a part of the project.   

          So the building that we're proposing today totals 

$525,000 square feet -- that's 250 feet tall, and you can 

tell from the rendering, from the onset we've wanted to 

create a building that creates a place that brings together 

the performing arts component, culture and a community space 

within a very vibrant and unique shell. 

          We also wanted to diversify the amenities being 

offered in Kendall.  We have plenty of restaurants and 

grocery stores, cafes and outdoor activities, but we wanted 

to bring more arts and culture to Kendall. 

          So this is that stretch there I mentioned earlier.  

The roughly 200-foot stretch of Third Street.  That would 

change dramatically if we're able to move forward with this 

project.  Can you imagine what it would look like with the 

ability to complete the street wall along that stretch? 

          And this is a view of the ground floor of our 

16

project.  You can see both indoors and out.  The project 

incorporates about an acre of green and open space.   

          Our vision for this space is to have it be a 

community hub that offers small-scale retail, flexible 

seating, gardens, performances and other events.  It's a 

perfect spot for something like indoor movie night or a 

fundraiser for non-profit.  Or a place to just have lunch 

and a coffee. 

          So the space above that you're looking at is the 

theater, and the theater would accommodate somewhere in the 

range of 250 to 300 seats. And it actually spans the second 

and third floors of the building.  So now we'd like to touch 

on a few questions that the Board raised during our last 

meeting.   

          And there are a lot that related to The Arts and 

culture portion of our project.  Specific questions that we 

heard related to the size of the space; how we would ensure 

that it would be welcoming and inclusive, and whether a lab 

building was the appropriate complement to achieve this 

vision. 

          So from our earliest conversations with community 

stakeholders, even before we purchased the property in 

17

August of 2018, we heard this to the failure to build the 

much-promised theater on this site was viewed as an 

unfulfilled commitment.  So one of the first things that we 

came out with was that we were -- our intent was to fulfill 

that expectation. 

          So from an early stage, we tried to make this arts 

and culture piece the centerpiece of our proposal.  And over 

the last two plus years, I've learned that creating a space 

like this is difficult, and it's given me an incredible 

appreciation for those who keep these types of spaces open 

and alive and thriving. 

          So, you know, the desire to provide The Arts and 

culture amenities of Kendall is really founded at -- you 

know, the desire to have this be more than a corporate 

office park.  It's driven our design for the site, it's 

driven our design -- excuse me, our programming efforts on 

the site.   

          In addition to the ice skating rink and the kayak 

launch and the farmer's market that we've hosted for almost 

two decades now, we've forged a number of partnerships with 

local groups that will help to support the activities in the 

physical spaces that we will bring to 585 Third, all with

the goal of making it a place that's approachable that 

offers a diverse range of programming for residents, 

visitors and so many of the employees that we see there 

every day.   

          So, as everyone knows, Cambridge is experiencing 

an arts crisis.  So many of our institutions and cultural 

hubs -- especially in Central Square -- are shutting down, 

struggling.  These include the EMF Building, Green Street 

Studios, the Cantab, T.T. the Bear's, River Guard -- excuse 

me, River Gods, and a few more. 

          And the loss of these institutions has led to 

significant displacement in The Arts. 

          The Arts desperately need our support. And we 

believe that a large investment in arts infrastructure, one 

that supplements our Cambridge-based arts and culture 

facilities like the Foundry and The Dance Complex and 

others, would help to reverse this trend. 

          The project that we're here talking about today 

would emphasize Cambridge's status as a destination to 

experience The Arts, which I think is equally important. 

          We spent a lot of time over the last two years 

listening, and what we've learned is that many people want

something different than what was originally envisioned for 

the site.   

          People are looking for a space that's more 

intimate, that is able to accommodate community-oriented 

events, and allows for flexible programming and a diverse 

range of arts and space that provides both indoor and 

outdoor gathering areas, and a space that really makes 

everyone feel like they're welcoming, and is above all 

sustainable and affordable.   

          People are looking for a ground-floor program that 

provides space for art installations, exhibits, outdoor 

activities, free events like movie nights, which you saw in 

the earlier renderings.   

          People asked about flexible indoor space where 

rooms can be repurposed to accommodate a wide range of 

activities -- hosting podcasts, dance recitals.  Feedback 

that we've heard has been really helpful in informing our 

plan for the space. 

          So while the arts and culture program certainly 

needs to be refined over time, we see our program today as 

one that's -- just flip to the next one, Robin?  Sorry. 

          So you see even the one that's unique and brings a

lot of value to a wide range of individuals.   

          So this leads us to one of the other questions 

that came up the last time we met, and it was whether or not 

a lab was the appropriate complement to an arts and culture 

facility.   

          Ultimately, our proposal needs to support our 

vision -- one that allows us to relocate the gas transfer 

station and also provide a substantial and sustainable arts 

and culture space.  And the cost to deliver the vision is 

just with the GTS alone on the order of tens of millions of 

dollars. 

          And the only way to provide -- excuse me, the only 

way to provide such an expansive and diverse array of spaces 

is by pairing this arts and culture center with the lab 

building above.   

          We all know that there's an incredible amount of 

value in what's happening at Kendall Square, and this vision 

allows us to harness that value and to put it to work to 

create the space that we've been talking about. 

          With your support, you know, we can guarantee that 

the space will not sit as a gravel lot for 15 years.  We 

don't want it to happen, and we know that the community

doesn't either. 

          So another question that we heard -- another topic 

that came up at the meeting in September was in regard to 

BioMed's efforts around diversity, equity and inclusion.   

          We know that recent events surrounding human 

rights have prompted us to make some changes in the way we 

operate, both corporatewide and locally, and to recognize 

the need for more leadership, to think about -- you know, 

where we failed, where we can do better, where we're falling 

short. 

          We've made some changes to our corporate 

structure.  This year for the first time ever, we've made 

diversity and inclusion key metrics in our employee 

performance reviews.  We've incorporated unconscious bias 

training into our expectations for all of senior management.  

We've increased their support.   

          This is -- more recently we've increased our 

support of organizations both in Cambridge and beyond -- 

organizations that specifically focus on social justice; 

provided those organizations with tangible support. 

          These include the Equal Justice Initiative and the 

Cambridge Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund, which has been a

lifeline for some of the most vulnerable members of our 

community, as they struggle through COVID. 

          Fortunately, it seems like it's going to continue 

for a while.  That said, I think it's also important to 

acknowledge that we can do more, and in some cases, we've 

failed to put these values into action.   

          Personally, within BioMed we need more women and 

people of color in senior management.  We've been trying to 

diversify our staff.   

          As a company, we need to incorporate diversity and 

inclusion better across all our properties and projects, and 

we need to do more to build trust for most people, and for 

most communities. 

          The project at 585 Third is my responsibility.  

It's a local effort.  From day one, I've deliberately set 

out to incorporate a wide range of voices in the planning 

process, and I feel that this project that we're discussing 

today is representative of the Cambridge community -- not 

just East Cambridge, but the entire Cambridge community.   

          From our outreach, the residents in East Cambridge 

and the Port, to listening sessions with regard to color, 

they've all had a significant influence on what you're 

23

seeing here today, and I think this project accomplishes 

that more than any other BioMed project ever has. 

          You know, we were asked in September if we've 

completed any projects that were comparably diverse.  And 

the answer to that -- I've thought about it a little bit -- 

the answer to that is no.  But I'm confident that the 

process that we've led here with 585 is going to be a model 

for a company and potentially beyond. 

          The partners that we've talked about tonight will 

have a seat at the table during our ongoing planning 

process, and will hold us accountable for the commitments 

that we've made.  It's simple, they're not going to be 

sitting in on the sidelines; they will be a part of the 

process. 

          So this is a slide that we actually used in one of 

our earliest community meetings.  From those early 

conversations with the community, we realized that in order 

to get it right, we had to establish a few planning 

principles that would guide our thinking as we move forward 

with the project. 

          As you can see here, one of the earliest goals was 

to be welcoming and inclusive, and to intentionally 

24

diversify Kendall Square.  Creating a sense of belonging for 

those in the community is also important.   

          We committed to these principles at the very early 

stage, and we expect to be held accountable to these 

standards, as we move forward. 

          So how do we get there?  We brainstormed with 

various artists -- cultural groups to craft these DEI 

operating principles that are in front of you today.  This 

doesn't just relate to the performing arts venue, but also 

to the public and open space that we'll provide as part of 

the project.   

          Some of these principles were reflected in some of 

the programming that we were actually doing pre-COVID, when 

people were able to gather and get together outside.  We 

offer free space for non-profits to host their meetings and 

events, space for artists to showcase their work, partnered 

with a number of organizations to bring diverse programming 

from all walks of life to Kendall.   

          We were actually on the phone earlier today with 

Chris Hope from the Loop Lab and Peter DiMuro from The Dance 

Complex talking about getting them into some temporarily 

unoccupied retail space that we have in Kendall.  So that's

an ongoing effort. 

          So as you can see, we've developed -- taken it a 

step further; we've developed this four-pronged approach to 

help us get there.   

          First, we have, and will continue to have -- to 

solicit input from artists of color.  We've encouraged 

performances from underrepresented groups and artists.  We 

plan to staff our arts and culture center with people from 

diverse backgrounds, and finally we'll market our programs 

to traditionally underserved communities.                       

          But you don't have to take my word for any of 

this.  Despite our best efforts to reach out to artists of 

color and BIPOC led organizations, I think we've only 

scratched the surface.   

          We started by mapping out a number of resources in 

the community -- people, organizations, institutions and 

groups that can shed light not only on what's missing from 

Kendall Square, but how we can provide what's missing in a 

way that's truly inclusive for all.   

          And the goal is to continue to strengthen these 

relationships with these groups, as we continue to plan and 

think about how it is that we're going to operate in the

space.  This will be an ongoing effort. 

          So now, you know, there are a lot of other 

questions relative to the zoning, and I'm going to turn it 

over to Geoff to speak to some of the changes that we've 

made.  Geoff?   

          GEOFF HOWELL:  Thank you, Sal.  I'm Geoff Howell 

from the Law Firm of DLA Piper, joined by my colleague, Mark 

Tang.  I'm going to start off by showing folk an image 

you've seen before to frame the scenarios that we're talking 

about -- the potential redevelopment of Parcel C and the gas 

transfer station, versus the redevelopment of Parcel C only, 

in the hopefully unlikely event that BioMed's only able to 

proceed without the gas transfer station.   

          We heard two things at our last meeting from you 

related to this.  First, you asked whether we could refine 

the zoning petition to permit just a single scenario with a 

combined Parcel C and GTS.   

          And unfortunately, as Sal mentioned at the 

beginning, we're very close, but we're not quite at the 

place where BioMed can commit to having both parcels 

included.  Consequently, we've kept the possibility that it 

diverges, and there's two scenarios in the zoning.   

27

22

          But we did make changes that we think help 

simplify and clarify what those scenarios would look like, 

and we have some images to show you what a Parcel C only 

scenario might look like. 

          So if we can go to the next slide, Robin?  Thank 

you. 

          So for the Parcel C only scenario, we made two 

significant changes to zoning, at your request.  And there's 

a third change that followed further Design Review, as we 

thought about the C only alternative.   

          First, if you look at this chart, which is part of 

the revised zoning petition, we simplified the arts and 

culture descriptions, so that it's clearer that a difference 

between the C only proposal, which is the up to 420,000 

square feet inclusive row, would have community arts uses.  

     And above that, in the over 420,000 up to the maximum, 

you would add the theater component, the performing arts 

uses most notably in our commitments the 250- to 300-seat 

theater that Sal's mentioned. 

          Second, we worked with the numbers and the texts 

around this chart to make it clearer that there's a 

proportional relationship between the size of the arts 

28

22

facility and the size of the project. 

          And the third change that you may have already 

noticed is we lowered the size of the project, both the 

bigger project, which shrunk slightly from 550- to 525- and 

the Parcel C scenario, which shrunk from 450- to 420-.  

That's just a function of further design refinement; what 

would actually be feasible on the Parcel C only site in 

particular. 

          So when you think about proportionality, think 

about it as a continuum here between the minimum arts 

facility of 15,000 square feet in the top row to the maximum 

40,000 square feet in the bottom row, with a switch from 

when you get to the maximum 420- and into the next row down 

for over 420- at 30,000 square feet. 

          So on one end you've got 40,000 square feet with a 

maximum size project, which is the combined alternative 

you've seen; on the other end you have the 15,000 minimum.  

And you could come up with a formula between, but we felt 

that that was too rigid and not responsive to some of the 

things we heard from staff.   

          So as a result, in the text below this chart in 

the revised petition you have, we gave the Planning Board 

29

22

the discretion to address proportionality without a formula, 

so that it can do things like take into account other 

factors -- enhancement of open space, programming 

flexibility and the other special permit criteria that we 

created for PUD-CDK. 

          Now, if you want to understand visually what a 

Parcel C only alternative looks like, we've prepared the 

massing that you see now in front of you.  This is not the 

kind of advanced concept you've seen for the combined 

parcels; it lacks the design refinement. 

          But it gives you a sense of the building envelope, 

which is your fairly standard, rectangular lab building 

envelope.  Also 250 feet high still even in this version, a 

commitment of no new parking. 

          If you could go to the next slide?   

          In that scenario, where you're using the footprint 

of all of existing Parcel C, but don't have the benefit of 

the gas transfer station parcel to the left as you look at 

the screen, you would still have arts and culture uses on 

the first floor.   

          They'd be shared with the back of house space and 

the lobby space so it's reduced as a function of the

22

footprint.  That reduces some of the opportunities you have 

for the kind of public open space combinations that we have 

with the bigger project. 

          And then if you go to the next slide for floor 2, 

you see there's still room for performance space on the 

second floor; the reality is it wouldn't be anywhere near 

the size of a 250-300 seat theater.   

          We haven't given great thought as to how you could 

use this performance space most effectively, and you have to 

give consideration to the existence of the Foundry and some 

other, smaller theater spaces in Cambridge, to make sure 

you're not cannibalizing what they do.  But it is 

theoretically feasible to have some performance space on 

that second floor. 

          So all of those changes and that imagery should 

hopefully help you understand better the Parcel C 

alternative versus the combined site alternative.   

          If you go to the next slide, in addition -- go 

ahead, skip one more, Robin. 

          In addition, there were other changes that we made 

in response to comments.  One is the clarification to 

incorporate the design standards that are already out there 

31

that are important and will help you hold the proponent 

BioMed to standards that you have promulgated in the past 

and the city's promulgated in the past from a design 

perspective. 

          That includes the Mayor's Arts Task Force 

recommendations for the Arts piece, K2 planning study and 

design guidelines, the Kendall Square design guidelines, the 

Connect Kendall Square Open Space Plan. 

          In addition, based on some feedback we got from 

the Ordinance Committee, we've incorporated Volpe Working 

Group design principles that we found appropriate for this 

particular infill location.  So we think those tools will be 

useful to you as you review a special permit proposal down 

the road. 

          And then onto the next slide?   

          In addition, as summarized in a letter that Mark 

had sent to staff, we made other changes and clarifications 

in response to your comments and comments from the public, 

including simplifying the height definition, consistent with 

other districts; eliminating the proposed interstitial 

mechanical space exception that clearly was unsettling for 

some folks.  We committed to provide a full traffic study 

32

instead of the abbreviated study that had been described in 

the prior petition. 

          At staff's recommendation, we established parking 

maximums on the site -- still with commitment for no new 

parking, but to be consistent with other PUDs.  There's a 

maximum allowed, in any event. 

          We increased the open space requirements to 

memorialize the 20 percent open space that exists today and 

continue that, and as you've seen from the presentation to 

enhance it quite a bit in the larger scenario. 

          And we've clarified how PUD-CDK relates to the 

existing PUD-3.  We've simplified the language somewhat.  

Hopefully, it makes sense to you.  We're happy to answer 

questions about that if needed, but with a lot of help from 

staff we've pared that language down quite a bit. 

          And so that, in short, captures the changes we've 

made.  And I'll turn it back to Sal for the wrap-up.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah, thank you, Geoff.  So 

that's all we offer tonight.  I will turn it back over to 

the Board for questions or anything else we can do.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you very --

          MARY FLYNN:  Appreciate your presentation.  Right 

now, we are going to go to public comment; this is a public 

hearing.  So any members of the public who wish to speak 

should now click the button that says, "Raise hand," which 

is at the bottom of your screen.  If you're calling in by 

phone, you can raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had received 

written communications from Joseph Rose, in addition to the 

communications that were received at the time of the first 

hearing.  Written communications received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will be entered into the record.   

          So let's see.  Just looking -- I am not seeing -- 

and Jeff, can you confirm that -- I'm not seeing any hands 

up, are you?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I am starting to see hands now.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Maybe people needed their memory 

jogged.

will be unmuted one at a time.  Please begin by saying your 

name and address, and staff will confirm that we can hear 

you.  After that, you will have up to three minutes to speak 

before I ask you to wrap up. 

          Since this is a continued hearing, we ask that you 

keep your comments focused on the new materials that were 

received and presented tonight.   

          All right, so Jeff, we'll turn it over to you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  Jeff Roberts from 

Community Development again.  A couple hands are up -- the 

first is Heather Hoffman.  You can unmute yourself and begin 

with your name and address.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  I wanted to start with one historical note.  

There's an amazing amount of ignorance as to what the 

constellation center was intended to be.  A lot of people 

who describe it as a baroque opera house do not know what 

they're talking about.  And I'm really sorry that it has 

been denigrated in the way that it has. 

          That being said, I -- and I should also disclose 

that I am a member of BioMed's Arts Advisory Committee, and 

anyone who knows me knows that that will not stop me from

saying what I believe to be true.   

          I believe that BioMed is trying its very, very 

best to make a fabulous art center here.  And my problem is 

with having yet another giant building. 

          And I understand all of the stuff about paying for 

this, and I will point out that they spent an awful lot of 

money on this land, knowing everything about what was 

supposed to be there, what it was going to cost to do it and 

all of this. 

          So I am not totally sympathetic to the cries of, 

"Well, it's going to cost a lot of money to build this" and 

all of that stuff.   

          So I hope that you will be very skeptical about 

the need for this big a building.  There's just no question 

that this arts space is a long-awaited benefit for everybody 

in the area, and that it will enhance the value of 

everything around it.   

          So I -- as I said, I just hope you'll be 

skeptical, and that you will do your very best to make this 

mostly Arts and much less lab.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next hand that's 

raised is Scott McBurney.  You can unmute yourself, begin by

saying your name and address.   

          SCOTT MCBURNEY:  Thank you.  This is Scott 

McBurney, I'm representing Vicinity Energy, addressed as the 

Kendall Green Energy Plant, Kendall Square.   

          We have had over a decade-long relationship with 

BioMed, as an abutter to our site in Kendall Station, and 

also, as a partner in business for the last 10 years for 

over one million square feet in Kendall. 

          They've always been focused on sustainability, and 

appreciate the recent commitments that Vicinity has made in 

our recent Clean Energy Future Plan nationwide, and then 

starting in Cambridge for achieving 100 percent carbon 

neutrality in all our operations. 

          Examples that we are going to provide out of our 

Kendall Station plan include zero carbon biofuels, electric 

boilers to take advantage of the greening of the grid, 

sustainable water practices, as we've done in the past. 

          And I think specifics of the project, we look 

forward to supporting BioMed and this project as another 

abutting building very near to our system, to make it a zero 

carbon building.   

          I think the intent is to have it be a zero

combustion building, and it further enhances the efficiency 

of our district energy system in Cambridge, and the 

efficiency of the plan. 

          Last point I guess I want to make is I've been 

working personally with Sal over the last four years to 

facilitate the relocation potential of the gas transfer 

station from the location on Third Street into our -- within 

the fence of our boundaries, so kind of consolidate some of 

the industrial support the City of Cambridge needs. 

          So we're fully behind that, and I think we've been 

working very closely over the last couple of months to get 

permits and those type of things to actually make that 

happen.  So I just wanted to speak in support of BioMed and 

Sal, and let everybody know that it's a real option to get 

that gas transfer station relocated.  Thank you.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The -- I'll just give 

this as a last call.  If there's anybody in attendance that 

hasn't spoken yet and still would like to speak on this 

case, please push the, "Raise Hand" button in your Zoom 

window, or if you're on phone press *9. Just give a few more 

seconds, in case anyone's still looking for the button.

          I think that seems like everyone.  I'll turn it 

back over to you, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  So 

we're now going to move from public comment to Board 

discussion.   

          If this hearing is continued to a future date and 

additional information is received, there will be an 

opportunity for public comment on the additional materials.  

Additional written comments may also be submitted. 

          We received a memo from the Community Development 

staff on the revisions to the petition, and they are 

available for questions.   

          So let's first start with questions from the 

Board.  Does anyone have questions for either the staff or 

the proponent?  And I see Ted's hand going up, so I will 

recommend his hand.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  So I 

have many questions.  And let me say that, you know, they're 

not criticisms and what's good or what's bad, they're 

questions so that I can understand exactly what is being 

said here, and they can either be for BioMed or for staff. 

          I'll start out in saying this revision is much

better, much easier to read and to understand what's going 

on, but there are still things I am not clear about, and 

still language that can be clarified and fit better into the 

zoning ordinance.   

          And so I will start out saying I support the 

staff's memo's comments that this Board ought to give staff 

direction to continue working on the language -- I guess 

both with BioMed and perhaps with the Ordinance Committee 

and City Council to come up with an even better proposal.   

          Having said that, you know, I'll just start out 

with all the references in Section 13202.3 about special 

permit requirements -- all the references to plans and the 

definitions of the plans all ought to be made identical.   

          They should all start, you know, out with the same 

phrase rather than jumping around from one type to another.  

It's just a word here or there. 

          But when I start getting into -- and there is, I 

think, a word or two missing in the subsection j) -- 

reference to the arts and cultural operations plan.   

          But now getting into the specifics, I don't 

understand why the reference to the arts and culture 

operations plan states, "To the extent and arts and culture

center is required by Section 13204 1b)" and similarly in 

the PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria in Section 202.4 that 

again says, "If Section 132041 overlay requires an arts and 

cultural center --," well, Section 132041 does require it.  

          So why is it put in the conditional in both of 

these places?  It makes it read as though it was an option 

rather than a mandatory requirement.   

          Again, the language in the Special Permit Criteria 

-- all of the subsections ought to be made to read the same, 

and I can -- you know, I'd be happy to send my comments on 

to staff about those, rather than taking up everything. 

          Getting onto Section -- well, it's still 202.4, 

subsection k). It says, "The proposed development is 

generally consistent with the policy objectives set forth in 

the then current -- " and then it lists the specific Kendall 

Square Planning Study in 2013, the K2 study, the draft 

Kendall Square Design Guidelines.  And so it identifies all 

of these. 

          But if we're specifying a particular date, then 

it's not going to be the then current one.  I mean, either 

you're going to say that you have to comply with those 

design criteria as of the day you submit your permit

application for a permit, which you do do in other places, 

or it should say that, you know, it would be the then 

current version or any substitution therefore in effect at 

the time you apply. 

          You know, I'm not saying which it should be, but I 

think it's unclear what it's going to be. 

          I still in Section 13202.6 about the applicability 

of requirements to the development proposal, where you talk 

about how to measure the GFA, I don't understand the 

reference in subsection i), where, "otherwise allowed in the 

PUD-CDK district" as to what constitutes a reallocation or 

reconfiguration.   

          Continuing on to the arts and culture uses, I 

assume in the definition of "performing arts use" which is 

subsection d2) performing arts I assume incorporates dance, 

but I have a question about whether it should or does 

incorporate cinema.   

          You know, Section 4.35 of the zoning ordinance 

does talk about a theater being a use.  I don't know whether 

that refers only to a live theater, or whether it would 

include cinema.   

          So now going onto Section 204.1, the dimensional 

42

regulations, which we just were shown.  You have -- well, 

there is -- the reference after the chart says, "The actual 

square footage shall be as approved by the Planning Board."   

          I assume you mean that the Planning Board cannot 

exceed -- you cannot accept less than the minimum or more 

than the maximum, in which case I know your plans are not to 

exceed, say the maximum, but why not allow it to be larger 

at BioMed's choice?   

          If you decide your ultimate plan works out with a 

performing arts center let's say 42,000 square feet or 

45,000 square feet, you would end up in a situation where 

presumably the Planning Board could not authorize that, and 

either you'd have to change your plans, or you'd have to go 

to the BZA for a variance.   

          I have no problem -- if 40,000 is the right 

number, I have no problem with saying that Planning Board 

could not require something larger than that, but I think it 

should be left open to yourselves to decide that, you know, 

you need a little bit more than 40,000. 

          Similarly, in the scenario where there is no gas 

transfer station, parcel included, I'm not sure -- again, I 

think you should allow yourself to say it could be -- it has

to be a community arts use, but at your option it could also 

include a performing arts use.  I just don't know why you 

want to restrict yourselves to certain things, rather than 

leaving it open. 

          In Section 204.3, the maximum building height -- 

as I read that, it says, "The maximum height of any building 

shall be the 250 feet.  You know, understand that and I 

understand the penthouse is above that.  

           If, however, as I read it, if because you have 

the requirement that if the Planning Board allows more than 

420,000 and the parcel will have frontage on Third Street, 

then you have to step back so that the first portion on 

Third Street does not exceed 85 feet. 

          If those two things do not occur, then presumably 

you could ignore the setback at 85 feet and I'm not quite 

sure that that's exactly the way -- I'm not sure that's 

really quite the way we want it to be.  I guess in the 

Section 204.4, "Other dimensional requirements" there's no 

minimum front, side or rear yard requirement.   

          I understand why you would like to say that, and 

it may be feasibly that's what it has to be.  But it seems 

to me you could theoretically create a sort of donut-shaped

building, actually a square within a square, that would be 

250 feet in height in all four sides hugging all the 

property lines.   

          Yes, you would have to stick in that case to the 

420,000 square feet and you would have to comply with the 

open space requirements, but it still seems it's 

theoretically possible you could end up with a building like 

that, and it's just a question about whether that's really 

what the city wants. 

          And so, you know, I'm just questioning that there 

are no yard requirements at all.  I mean, it may be that's 

the situation with the PUD-3, but I'm just curious about 

that. 

facility?   

          Going on to parking, since there is going to be an 

arts and cultural center of some form, should there not be 

some perhaps maximum parking space that relates to that 

          I mean, you've got a maximum for office and lab 

use, and a maximum for retail space, but I would think maybe 

if -- you know, if we have a would you say a 300-seat 

auditorium, perhaps there ought to be some maximum number of  

          parking spaces that relate to that.

I don't quite understand -- I think it understand it 

conceptually -- the reference in 205.2.3 that the final 

development plan does not substantially increase net new 

off-street parking spaces within the PUD-CDK district.   

          Obviously, if you add parking, you're going to be 

substantially increasing it.  If this relates back to your 

requirements for parking under the PUD-3, I think that could 

be clarified. 

          Getting down to 205.3 loading, you know, it's fine 

as far as it goes.  I'm just curious if you end up with the 

performance space, maybe either facility, will that not meet 

loading for moving in an out scenery or stages or this, that 

and the next thing?   

          You know, I'm just tossing that out, and how will 

that all work?  If you are able to load someplace else, are 

you going to then have to transport it back and forth? 

          The language in 206.1, the relationship to the 

PUD-3 I still find remarkably unclear, and would ask that 

staff ask the City Solicitor to really review that to make 

clear what the relationship is between the two PUDs. 

          And my last comment is whether -- you know, is 

there anywhere else in the zoning ordinance where a Letter

of Commitment as set forth in 206.3 has been incorporated 

into the zoning ordinance itself, rather than simply being a 

separate, stand-alone Letter of Commitment? 

          Anyway, those are my questions and comments.  You 

know, as I said I just really want to know exactly how this 

is all to be interpreted.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So that was a very detailed 

list.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Being quarantined, I have lots 

of time to --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Read.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- read and reread the 

proposal.       

          MARY FLYNN:  And your legal mind was fast at work, 

I can see.  So let me ask the proponent --     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yep, Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.  Sorry, I hate to interrupt, but 

-- this is Jeff Roberts -- I can try to -- I think some of 

these are probably questions for the proponent.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And some of them, though, I can 

maybe knock out the ones that are kind of broader questions

about --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Sure.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- art zoning, and then might be 

easier that way, so that the petitioners don't have to try 

to speak for the larger zoning questions.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  A couple of things -- well, there's 

a couple things to start with.  First, yes, as we noted in 

our memo, perfectly happy to take the Planning Board's 

comments on the text and go over it more carefully, and we 

consult with the Law Department when we do that.  So on all 

of those issues that were raised, that's something we'll do. 

          The question about theater use and how it's 

defined in zoning; actually, you're right that it's not very 

clear in zoning, but as we'll be discussing in a couple of 

weeks, maybe a few weeks, we are proposing some changes to 

our retail use definitions.  

          And that includes clarification of the fact that, 

you know, a theater for reported -- you know music or video 

is -- you know, is treated similarly from any other kind of 

theater in zoning.   

          So it's not fully addressed now, but we think that 

48

will be shortly. 

          In terms of -- I guess the setbacks, it's 

important to note that all of this is within the -- all the 

dimensional requirements in PUD zoning is within the 

construct of Planning Board review and special permit 

approval.   

          So it's fairly typical for PUD zoning to waive, 

you know, set -- the by lot type of dimensional standards of 

setbacks and other things. 

          And the implication is that that all gets replaced 

by the Planning Board's kind of holistic review and approval 

of a final development plan, which establishes what the 

actual setbacks would be. 

          So that's -- you know, sometimes we put that in 

the zoning.  That's something we can think about doing to 

clarify that all of those things are waived, but it's 

subject to Planning Board approval of the final development 

plan, and that helps to preclude those kinds of more 

unexpected kinds of outcomes, which, you know the Planning 

Board could certainly not approve something if it's 

completely out of character with what is planned for and 

what's anticipated on this site.

          And the last couple things I noted on parking:  

The question about not increasing off-street parking is -- 

well, I guess the petitioners can probably relate to that, 

and parking for the arts facility.  I would say that from a 

planning standpoint, really the concerns that we have are 

more around commercial, office and lab parking.   

          I don't know that we would want to be too 

constraining about regulating parking for a community arts 

use, especially since such a use might be able to utilize 

unused parking at -- you know, different times of day that 

are off of the peak times that office users would be using 

it. 

          So that's something that we -- I guess that's 

something we can look at with transportation staff.  But I 

don't know that -- I would want to be careful about being 

too constraining there. 

          The last question about the Letter of Commitment:  

It is fairly routine at this point for these types of zoning 

petitions for the Letter of Commitment to be incorporated by 

reference into the zoning ordinance.  That's something that 

the Law Department has consistently advised that we do as 

part of really connecting the public benefits to the new

zoning.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think that knocks out the 

questions that are for us to answer, so I can turn it back 

over.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  All right.  So one 

of the other questions that Ted had related to the setback 

at 85 feet that I think is proposed for Third Street.  But 

his question was, "Does that still come into play if you 

only do the constellation parcel?"  

          And I think your slide did show the setback at 85 

feet, but if you could just maybe explain that a little, it 

would be helpful.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  So maybe Kishore will have 

something different to say or add, but we always thought 

about the 85-foot step back as being Third Street related, 

in order to maintain the consistency with the rest of the 

street.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So is Ted correct, then, that 

the -- if you're not fronting Third Street, that there is no 

setback at 85 feet on the rest of the building?     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  I think that’s the correct 

51

interpretation of the way we wrote it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  As we mentioned, when we were 

showing you the massing for Parcel C, we haven't gotten that 

far in thinking about the shaping of the building.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yep.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  Kishore, did you have any thoughts 

on that?     

interject?       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Madam Chair, can I just 

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I guess what I was really 

getting at is that that two part thing says, "If the 

Planning Board allows more than 420,000 square feet of gross 

floor area" and, "the parcel will have frontage on Third 

Street."  

          So if, say, the Planning Board only approved 

410,000, or just the 420- as I read this, only one of the 

two parts of the requirement would be satisfied, and that 

therefore you could indeed eliminate the setback at 85 feet.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  So that's an absolutely fair 

comment, and a good read of something we didn't intend.  As

Sal has said before, the proponent wants to do the project 

that we've shown you that uses both parcels.   

          If for some unforeseeable reason the project 

shrunk significantly but still used the GTS parcel and was 

up against Third Street, I think we would intend to have the 

80-foot step back as well; 85-foot step back.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  Yeah, I'm not 

questioning your good faith in what you intend to do, I just 

want to be --    

          GEOFF HOWELL:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  But as I'm reading it, there is 

that possibility.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  Yeah.  No, that's a clarification 

we'd be happy to talk about.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And then in another 

clarification that Ted had -- or the need for clarification 

Ted had called out was the reference to the extent and arts 

and cultural district is required, where our understanding 

is that it is going to be a component of it; there isn't 

sort of a trigger in there that does require it, it's just 

expected.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  Right.  And it's part of the

commitment too.  So one way or another we're not doing this 

project without addressing that.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  That may be vestigial from early 

drafts.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          GEOFF HOWELL:  We could look at that as well.         

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  So that's just another 

language clarification thing, okay.  Let's see.  And then 

the relationship to the PUD-3; that I think is something the 

Board could recommend in the -- if it makes a recommendation 

tonight, can add in a request for the Law Department to take 

a look at that. 

          Do you feel like we covered all of them here?  You 

had so many points, Ted, I'm afraid I might be --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No, I think -- yes, I think 

between BioMed and staff, you know, some of them are just 

language things that I think can be looked at again, and -- 

you know, the issue about being over the 40,000 is something 

for them to -- BioMed to think about.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, very good.  Okay.  I see Tom.  

You have your hand up.

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I had 

three questions, but Ted covered one of them, which was 

relative to why the theaters are maxed out in terms of their 

size; why would we hem ourselves in that way?  I understand 

the minimum standard.   

          I don't understand why we would necessarily need 

to do that, but that's something that can be worked out 

internally; I'm glad that my fellow Board member also picked 

up on that.   

          Thank you also to the proponent for doing the 

model of the reduced size project.  I can tell, given its 

starkness, either you're trending towards a much more 

stripped down, modern version or your heart isn't in it, and 

I suspect that your heart's not in it, that it's just a 

demonstration of a future that you hope doesn't happen.  Is 

that a consistent reading?     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  That is 110 percent accurate.  

Yeah, absolutely.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, I'm glad.  We have 

concurrence here.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Because my heart's not in that 

55

scheme either.  But so quick question, you alluded to the 

fact of how close you are to the deal with the gas transfer 

station.  Can you tell us --    

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah, yeah.               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- just how close you are?     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Elaborate a little bit?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Sure.  So, you know, it took us 

a long time to get the two options in place; the options.  

So there was the one option with Eversource to acquire the 

site in exchange for --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  -- providing the new facility.          

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  And that was -- you know, that 

was complicated.  It took --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  -- a long time.  A lot of years 

-- four plus years.  Iram was a part of some of those 

conversations along the way.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yep.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  So we have that in place, and

that was --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  -- working out all the nitty-

gritty details with Eversource; how this happened, who pays 

for it, when it moves?  Everything down to drawing review 

durations and things like that.  All of that is in place 

with Eversource.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Similarly, we have an option in 

place with Vicinity that would allow us to secure a 

relocation site to --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Their site.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  -- relocate too.  That's there.  

So we have a place to put it.  You know, in the process of 

going through the permitting, we're in the process of 

advancing drawings beyond SDs and getting Eversource's 

          We're probably at about 30 to 40 percent right 

now, and you know things are advancing well with Eversource.  

I mean, they're comfortable with the envelope that we 

established, the design that we established originally doing 

approval.   

schematics.

          I have no reason to believe that we're going to 

have any issues on the Eversource or Vicinity side.  Scott 

mentioned earlier, you know, part of the arrangement with us 

moving the facility is also to continue to do business with 

Scott, and it's not a problem there.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yep.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  On the permitting side, you 

know, there are some future permits.  We're in the midst of 

getting through a few now, but there are a few additional 

permits that will fall in the city's court -- probably a 

variance and a special permit to allow the relocation site, 

or allow the GTS to be moved to the relocation site.   

          You know, we just realize that those are -- again, 

you know, we know that the site is pretty ideal, sandwiched 

between the back of our building a substation and a large 

fuel tank.  It's the right spot --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  -- for this infrastructure.  But 

those are discretionary permits.  And, you know, we just 

want to be able to get through all those and -- I mean, I 

would love to not have to consider the Parcel C only option.  

I look forward to that day and hopefully it comes soon.

But, you know, there is --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I guess given that your heart's 

not in the reduced building and you're this close to having 

the permits done, and I'm -- this Planning Board member 

doesn't really want to grant excessive additional 

development rights for a project that wouldn't really 

support the city, it wouldn't set back --    

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yes.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- it would have this horrible 

hold remaining on Third Street that Iram, you know, started 

with, you know, quivering lip describing this is something 

she's had her eye on for decades.   

          So why don't we just simply do this:  We just wait 

until you have certainty around the relocation of the 

utility?  And then vote on the disowning, and just deal with 

one particular scenario.  I don't understand why we would 

take the risk --    

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- of granting a huge amount of 

FAR in a reduced theater, and then end up with the hole in 

the heart of our emerging commercial district.  That doesn't 

make sense to me if we're this close to getting the deal

done. 

          So I think we should -- we're meeting --    

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- at twice the cadence then we 

usually are.  We're here every single week, so come back as 

soon as you're done.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah, yeah, I --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So we'll do the deal.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah.  You know, I understand 

that perspective.  I think, you know, I would add though 

that the Parcel C scenario and what we've presented there, 

there's still -- the Board, obviously has a lot of latitude 

to make adjustments to that massing.   

          I think we've tried to restructure the zoning in a 

way that creates an incentive for us to move forward with 

the GTS plus C version.  I think there's no question when 

you look at the two buildings, just not only from an 

aesthetic perspective but from a value perspective, you know 

this is the front door to our site.  It is -- it's certainly 

our preference. 

          But, you know, we do have -- we have a process to 

continue.  We have to be at a point with Eversource where we

can continue to advance the drawings, and then commit to 

actually paying the money for the relocation site, paying 

the money to Eversource and facilitating that relocation.  

And we have an option with them that expires in October of 

next year. 

          So we have to have all of those steps.  Everything 

has to fall in place by that time in order for us to take 

advantage of the -- you know, the opportunity that we have 

in front of us. 

          Eversource has been patient for a lot of years as 

we've worked through this.  Has continued to advance this 

process with us, but there's going to be a point in time 

where they need to pull the trigger on upgrades that they 

need to make to that station to ensure that there's reliable 

gas service in the city.  And that's, you know, of utmost 

importance right now.   

          So it's -- you know, it's a problem from us from a 

timing perspective.  It's critical.  You know, I would be 

open to, you know, discussing some other ways with staff 

that we can create that incentive, but, you know, I can't 

tell you enough how committed we are to the Parcel C 

district.

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  No, I definitely sense that, but 

-- anyway, I think I've made my point.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah, yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I think I'm clear on where this 

might potentially have to go.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah, yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Tom. Lou, you have your 

hand up as well.  Lou Bacci?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.: Likewise I wrote a bunch of 

the questions, but one question is, we haven't gotten 

anything from any of the arts groups in the city or anything 

that kind of requests what size spaces they would need?  I'm 

sure that there has been discussion among the developer and 

the city and so forth, but we have no idea.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And I also keep hearing that 

both sides are ready to move the gas transfer station, but 

nobody seems to be moving the gas transfer station.  And 

then we have this variable project.  I agree with Tom; I

think they need to come back with one project. 

          And also, I'd like to come back with Ted's parking 

and loading issue.  I think with a fairly good size 

performance space, we need some additional parking and 

loading.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah.  So we do have -- I think 

that part of that question relates specifically to the 

zoning text.  We do have in our ground-floor plan a loading 

dock --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  -- and loading area specified 

for the theater itself, dedicated to the theater itself.  So 

I think that's probably another one of those zoning text 

cleanup matters, to make that clear.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Tom, did you have another 

question, or did you just leave it there?  Okay.  All right.  

And let's see, let me just see if any of the Board members 

have questions?  No.  All right.  So I'm not seeing any 

other questions.   

          Let's hear from some of the other Board members on 

what you're thinking about the petition.  So Hugh, could we 

start with you?

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Sure.  My thinking in September was 

that this was a desirable deal to accomplish; that the 

proposed density was consistent with other projects at other 

sites in the vicinity.  You know, it's -- so that I didn't 

see any particular reason not to go forward.  Now, that's 

not to say that my colleague, Ted Cohen, hasn't, you know, 

looked more carefully at the language and identified things 

that need to be worked on. 

          I guess I'm not -- I haven't gotten to the point 

that Tom and Lou have, that this only works for the city if 

the GTS is moved.  I think if the GTS is not moved, then 

having a project that has a strong center that is within the 

dimensional parameters is probably worth doing.  Therefore 

leaving that option on the table if it's needed is something 

I think I would prefer to do.   

          But I think, you know, I was very curious to hear 

the location of the gas transfer station, because I was -- 

kept wondering, "Well, where is it going to go?" And to have 

it close by, which means the piping -- the underground 

piping is, you know, not horrendous, is not ruining some 

other part, it's simply taking a part of the power plant 

site and using it for this purpose.

          And, you know, I don't think that, you know, we 

want to see the gas transfer station not move and another 

biotech building built on that little piece of land on the 

power plant side. 

          So I think it's going to take away for the City 

Council to work this out.  Perhaps by the time that's done, 

the GTS deal will be struck.  And I think we should just 

send it forward, you know, with the instructions to fix the 

problems that the staff and that the other Board members 

have identified.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you.  Let's see.  Steven 

Cohen, what are your thoughts?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Well, I guess suddenly it's the 

gas transfer station which is -- you know, the issue of the 

moment.  And I understand the one perspective that they want 

to get the zoning in place, even though they have resolved 

the gas transfer station, and I understand your other 

perspective, that we -- you know, we really are reluctant to 

give approval, until we know that that gas transfer station 

is resolved and moved. 

          And it seems to me that we could address both 

concerns by simply proposing a zoning which is based on 

65

premise, on the fact that the gas station is moved, and that 

the entire parcel is available for development.   

          So with that perspective, we can go forward with a 

rezoning, and it will be effective, but only if the gas 

station is moved. 

          And we certainly want to make sure that all 

parties involved, you know, have the maximum motivation to 

in fact make that deal and move the station. 

          I don't even want to contemplate the situation or 

the possibility that station -- you know, is not or cannot 

be moved, but if God forbid that really turns out to be the 

situation -- well, the applicant will have to come back and 

will have to go back to the Planning Board.   

          But I don't want to make it easy to have that 

alternative.  I'd rather go forward with the assumption that 

-- you know, that station is resolved and moved, and that we 

are in fact giving approval for development of the entire 

site.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So you're recommending, then, 

that our recommendation be that there just be the single 

option, which is the large --  

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.

          MARY FLYNN:  -- larger section.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I don't want to make a second 

option that we're not thrilled about.  I would rather, you 

know, put the maximum incentive and pressure on all relative 

parties to resolve that issue and move that station.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  all right, thank you.  Let's 

see.  Corinne, do you have any thoughts on this?              

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you, Chair Flynn and 

thank you to the other Planning Board members for their 

thoughtful comments.  So I think sometimes our meetings can 

exclude people from the conversation because we speak in a 

lot of technical jargon and urban planning jargon.  So I 

just want to speak very plainly about this.   

          When we are considering a zoning change, we're 

considering a change to the rules.  And we want to think 

about whether a change to the rules is warranted.  So for 

me, the basic question is, should this petitioner -- do they 

deserve a change to the rules, and why?   

          And for me I'm still -- I appreciate the 

adjustments that have been made.  I do think this is better

than when we first saw it.  So I do appreciate that.  But 

I'm still not convinced that there is a reason to change the 

zoning there.   

          Our job and our recommendation to City Council is 

to consider whether this benefits the community overall, and 

I'm not convinced that when we think of all of our 

community, when we think of people who are unhoused, people 

who've lost their job in the pandemic who still have no 

income, who can't pay rent, who are having trouble eating, 

you know, it's hard for me. 

          My day job is working with people who are about to 

be evicted, people who do not have food to eat, people who 

have lost people due to COVID.  So I'm coming from a 

different perspective than maybe some of us.   

          So in my mind, this is an opportunity to create 

extreme wealth for one group of people, and it's not clear 

to me that that is not at the expense of other people in the 

community. 

          So I still don't see a reason to support this.  I 

do appreciate the major improvements, but that's where I 

stand right now.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Niko? Would you

perspective.  But I also agree with Steven about this.  I 

would like to see something built in this space, and I'd 

like to see it developed and be useful.  And I guess this 

strikes me as don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good 

situation.   

          And so, as much as I would just like to see a high 

rise of apartments, as far as a cultural space I think it's 

a good one.  I think it looks better than -- it looks more 

fleshed out than the first time we saw it. 

          And so, yeah, I mean, I have the same 

disappointment that Corinne identified the last time we met, 

just about sort of, like, what the space is -- like, who the 

anticipated users of the space are?  But I hope that with 

the, you know, commitment to ensuring that everyone from 

Cambridge feels welcome in this space, and that it will be 

useful.   

          I think that's important because -- especially 

when the framing of this case is this is going to be a

replacement for, like, T.T. the Bear's place or Middle East 

or all of the sort of -- you know, those are like clubs.  

Those are places where bands play.  It's not like you're 

looking at the theater where there's like a dance studio.  

That doesn't strike me as congruent. 

          And so if the lack of -- if the problem identified 

is an Arts crisis, you know, Arts come in many forms.  And 

Arts also includes, like, you know, a dance club or, like, a 

place where you go and have a fun time at night that's not 

just watching other people perform. 

          And so, -- and I don't see that in this proposal.  

That said, you know, as far as the zoning is concerned, I 

would like to see something.  And if this is what we've seen 

in the last, like decade and a half or two decades, then I'd 

rather see something than nothing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  All right.  So 

let's circle back a little bit.  Lou, you had questions.  Do 

you have any comments now, based on what you've heard from 

your fellow Board members?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I guess my comment would be 

I think there's maximum pressure on the developer and it 

sounds like the gas company needs new equipment, and they

need a new transfer station, and the developer is able to 

build the new transfer station on a very good piece of 

property.   

          I don't know why it's being held -- we're being 

held up with it.  They should have a plan set and do a 

single project here.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I don't know what all the 

negotiations -- continue.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Ted, did you want to add 

anything else, based on what you've heard?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Not really.  I mean, my 

comments were basically just to clarify the language.  I 

mean, I agree with Niko and I think with probably most 

everybody else.  I mean, I do understand Corinne's point of 

view.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  But this is such an eyesore 

right now in the middle of Kendall Square, which I think, 

you know, the lab and the performance center will benefit 

everybody in the city.  I don't think it's excluding people.  

          It may not be exactly what -- you know, some

people would prefer to have there.  And certainly I'd prefer 

to have housing, but I don't think that's likely to happen.   

          And so, I go along with the idea that I don't want 

to, you know, do away with the good in the hope that at some 

point in time we could have the perfect. 

          Having said all of that, I -- you know, I would be 

prepared to go forward with it as it's drafted now, but on 

the other hand I think the idea of holding everybody's feet 

to the fire and telling the City Council that, you know, we 

really strongly would recommend that there only be the one 

option.    

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And that, you know, if that 

can't be concluded right now, then don't vote anything and 

tell BioMed to come back when they have concluded things.   

          And I -- you know, I don't want to screw up their 

negotiations, but, you know, maybe they're going back to 

Eversource and saying, "Look, this is all the city will give 

us and so, we have to do this deal right now." 

          So I -- you know, I could go with the, "This is 

okay the way it is" or, you know, telling Council, "We don't 

think you should have the alternative in it and let's go

from there."        

thoughts?             

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Tom, did you have any further 

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, appreciating my fellow 

Board members' sentiments.  You know, there's an economic 

development component to what government has to do, right?  

So, you know, I appreciate Hugh saying, "Well, something 

there is better than a gravel site with some pipes sticking 

out of it on Third Street."  

          I'm really trying to be supportive here.  Is there 

some way in which we get the golden project which we were 

shown and dazzled by the last time we saw this? Rather than, 

you know, the phone blocks that we were shown tonight that 

the proponent -- which aren't great for the city.  It's not 

a great building. 

          And we're -- to Corinne's point -- giving an awful 

lot of FAR in order to get that.  And so, I'm just trying to 

argue for the best possible project for the city, both in 

terms of economic development, but also for city form here, 

so.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Yes, I agree that it seems 

like we should go for the full project; that it's -- you

know, it's clear that we see the benefits of that, and, you 

know, obviously it does not address all of the concerns that 

Corinne has.   

          But, as other people have said, you know, this has 

been going on for years, and it does provide some level of 

community benefit, particularly at the larger scale.  We're 

less convinced about the smaller scale.   

          So we have some options tonight.  We could make a 

recommendation that we -- that the petition be adopted and 

we could say, you know, that we would suggest that the 

Council try to get it to that single option. 

          We could recommend that it not be adopted and 

explain why, or we could just provide comments.   

          The other option is that we can continue this 

hearing once again, which would give the proponent and the 

city staff time to go through the language clarifications 

some more and also for the proponent to ponder how they 

could meet this single option scenario that we're talking 

about. 

          So are there any preferences from the Board?  It 

sounds as though we definitely want to propose a single 

option.  The question is do we want to just do that right

now as part of some sort of recommendation on the existing 

petition, or do we think it's better to just continue this 

for a bit?  Your feedback would be appreciated.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, it is a recommendation to 

the Council.  And I'm -- you know, mindful of a saying that 

my fellow Board member Steven Cohen often says, "What about 

the unintended consequences, you know, as we're --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- flashing this idea out here in 

the last 40 minutes.  They're obviously in the middle of a 

negotiation and that just got turned on its head, right?  

Because --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- now the utility will say, 

"Well, you have only one option, so --. "        

          MARY FLYNN:  Right, right.               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- that's an unintended 

consequence that the Planning Board here are trying to do 

the right thing by city form, and to fulfill the dreams that 

were shown to us last time. 

          So that said, I don't know exactly what to do, but 

that's certainly one of the unintended consequences that

might not have good effect here.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Correct.  Any other thoughts on 

making -- yes, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I guess I don't -- you 

know, maybe we need to hear from BioMed.               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  But from what they indicated, 

they have gotten -- it would sound to me like they've 

already negotiated the terms of the acquisition and the 

costs of moving --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Mm-hm.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And it doesn't sound like -- 

and it sounds like what has to happen now is the various 

permitting.  And so, it doesn't sound like whatever we do 

cuts -- you know, the legs out from under them in terms of 

negotiating, because from what I heard, and maybe that's not 

accurate, they've already reached agreement on the -- I 

guess the financial terms.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah, that's accurate.  That is.  

That's accurate.  It's the permitting, and it's just -- you 

know, having the flexibility and knowing that this is a 

lengthy process and trying to accommodate the worst-case

scenario.  It's just -- it's -- for us it's the responsible 

move.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  You know, I would -- I would 

ask, well we are closer than ever.  We continue to creep 

closer.  We have a full team working on the drawings right 

now, so they're relocating GTS.  We're not sitting on our 

hands waiting.  That's in process.  That's in process (sic).   

That's been in process at our risk now for a number of 

months since we executed the Vicinity option in -- you know, 

midsummer, and even a little bit before then.   

          I would very much appreciate the opportunity to 

advance the process with the recommendation that -- you 

know, that the C+GTS scenario is preferred.   

          And it's possible to --, you know, to leave that 

to the City Council further downstream with the hope that 

we've made more progress on the permitting front by then and 

have some additional flexibility.   

          I would -- any other questions on, you know, any 

other specifics I'm glad to answer, but that's -- you know, 

that's where it is.  We've -- you know, the option that we 

struck with Eversource initially gave us two years, and it

gave us two six-month extensions.   

          And we exercised the six-month extension in 

October of this year.  So we have another six-month 

extension once that one expires, and that gets us to October 

of next year. 

          My fear is that if we don't advance the process 

today, that we end up potentially going through another 

cycle or being at a point where we risk our ability to 

retain those options.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  You know, and I'd very much 

appreciate -- you know, having the opportunity to have a 

further conversation about this and hearing everyone's 

thoughts.  But, you know, that's where we are.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Thank you so much for 

that feedback.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  Lou, did you have something 

else?  Yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, quick ones.  We've 

heard several times tonight from the proponent that he 

really doesn't see the second plan coming to fruition.  If

this whole deal fell together, would you provide -- would 

you plan on doing a rethink on this petition?     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  I guess in what respect?  

Relative to the massing, or -- yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Without the gas transfer 

station, the smaller footprint.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah, I -- you know, I think 

we've thought through the arts and culture component and how 

that works.  And, you know, one of the drivers -- one of the 

significant differences between these two scenarios is the 

size of the lot, the size of the parcel, of the development 

area. 

          And so, you know, in the C plus GTS scenario, we 

have a core that's roughly the same size as in the Parcel C 

only scenario.  So that's what influences the scale of the 

arts and culture facility, specifically relatively to the 

performance space. 

          But, you know, I feel the performance space is 

important, but, you know, it may not be a focus of a lot of 

people.  But I think we -- you know, we'd have to come back 

to the Board via the special permit process, and I expect 

that the building would change dramatically as a result of

that, as everyone's pointed out.  You know, the Parcel C 

only scenario that we showed tonight is not a work of art.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I can see another hand.  Hugh, did 

you have something you wanted to say?  Yes, Hugh.  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  So we're the Planning 

Board, and we're advising the City Council on planning 

issues.  And it seems like we're in agreement that the 

project is much better with the gas transfer station, that's 

a really important part of the project.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And I think that should be the core 

of our comment, is that that's the way it should go forward.  

Without being particularly descriptive as to how you get 

there, that's the place you should be trying -- should be 

getting and leave it to the Council to get there. 

          Because I think our view is not going to change.  

You know, we've --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- there's a small spectrum of 

tactics, but I think the actual outcome we're pretty much in

agreement on. 

          The other comment I would make is that there are 

things about any biotech building -- inclusionary housing 

funds, which are pretty substantial; tax payments what are 

pretty substantial, and that those are both mechanisms to 

address the issues that Corinne is concerned about.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So it's not like they're not 

doing anything, it's just they propose to do what is current 

-- what everybody does.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And it may not be sufficient to 

grant, but it is significant.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Correct.  Okay.  So what I'm hearing 

is that we are generally all in favor of going with the 

larger option and expressing that to the City Council; that 

is much preferred and recommended.   

          So now my question is for Jeff, what's the best 

way to transmit this in the context of the current petition 

that we have?  Is it better to say that we're recommending 

that it not be adopted as currently drafted and explain why, 

and say what parts of it we like?  Or is it better to do it 

81

the other way around, adopt -- you know what I mean?  I just 

don't know, do you adopt sections and eliminate sections, or 

the other way around?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, I'm -- this is Jeff Roberts -

- I'm hearing two things from the Board.  There's -- just to 

go back to the beginning of the conversation, there are 

several additional language changes or language issues that 

need to be addressed, and that would be -- frames the 

recommendation.   

          I think it was commented that the language is 

generally better than the original petition, so the Board is 

sort of in favor of the revised version, but with some 

potential additional changes. 

          And then as to the last point, it really is a 

question of how the -- I think it's -- it appears to me the 

consensus is that the Board would recommend that -- or would 

express a strong preference for authorizing a development 

plan that incorporates sort of the entirety of that site, 

that block, and relocates the gas transfer station and, you 

know, incorporates the version of the development plan that 

goes along with that option. 

          And then the question -- I think the question for 

82

12

13

16

17

18

21

22

the Board is does the Board want to express that as a 

preference in the context of a broader, just broadly 

positive recommendation on the petition?   

          Or does the Board want to take the -- you know, 

possibly more -- you know, stronger statement of saying that 

the Board, you know, recommends what's proposed with that 

larger option, but doesn't recommend it with the smaller 

option.  I think that's the choice that, you know, Board 

members can come down on.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, all right.  So I think there 

were a couple of Board members who felt like they could -- 

they were open to either option, but they preferred the 

larger option and would recommend that.  But I didn't hear 

that they would vote against the other.   

          So maybe I should do a quick, informal poll before 

we propose the final motion and vote.  So is there anyone 

who would preclude the second option, and say that we're 

really recommending against that?    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, I would preclude that.  

The second option is the --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- the smaller version?

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah.         

          MARY FLYNN:  -- not going to -- you would not 

recommend that?  You would just recommend the first?  All 

right.  Ted, I saw your hand go up.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.  I thought Jeff's 

iteration of it that we recommend the large parcel, but not 

recommend the smaller on?       

          MARY FLYNN:  The smaller one, okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And, you know, I would say 

having heard everybody else I've, you know, moved from my 

earlier statement that I could go along with both.   

          I think, you know, since we are planning and since 

this isn't going to, I think really impact on their 

negotiation position, I think we could take the stronger 

position that, you know, we recommend what we think is the 

best for that site.  And if it becomes a political decision 

for the Council, then, you know, that's their issue.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Is there --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Can I?  Just 1 thing?         

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.

business point that that may increase the cost of purchasing 

that site from the utility.  And it's a good business point.  

And I would leave that decision actually to the applicant.  

You know, either do the -- you know, the single, you know, 

comprehensive approach or simply don't make a recommendation 

now if he thinks it will be detrimental to negotiations. 

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  I think what he has said -- 

Mr. Zinna has said --    

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Mm-hm.         

          MARY FLYNN:  -- and please correct me if I'm wrong 

-- is that he would prefer that we take some action to move 

this forward, and that the pricing, it's really down to 

permitting now, the pricing in all of the other negotiations 

have been completed.     

          SALVATORE ZINNO:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  That makes it clear, then, I 

think.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  So then, can I 

have a recommendation that pending further clarification of 

language -- well, we're going to say that this version of 

the petition we see is improved, compared to what was 

originally submitted.

          We do believe that there are still a number of 

language changes that need to be revisited and clarified 

more specifically, and that in addition to that, we would 

recommend that the petition basically support and only allow 

for the larger development plan, which includes the gas 

transfer station.  And we would not recommend there be a 

second option. 

          Does that sound like it has included everything?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So could I have a motion then 

to do what I just said and what Jeff has said?       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So moved.       

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I would certainly make that 

motion, and I assume that Jeff can clean up, and then 

clarify the actual wording.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  So I had Ted and  

--    

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Steve.  So I'm going to give that one 

to Steve, Ted, only because --  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Fine.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, all right?  And who just 

86

seconded it, Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I did, yep.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Lou?  Okay, and Lou is the second.  

Okay.  Can we have a roll call vote?  Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Roll?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Jeff, before we do that, are you okay 

with that?  Do you have enough clarity?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think so.  As we always do, we 

will combine the Planning Board members' comments into a 

draft that the Chair -- the Vice Chair will review and 

approve before it gets sent to the City Council.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Thank you.  All right.  

Then we'll --  

Louis Bacci?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  So roll call on that motion, 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes. 

          [7 votes YES, one vote NO.]   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So that passes with seven members 

voting in favor and one opposed.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Well, gentlemen, 

thank you very much for your time this evening and for 

letting us explore the options.  We appreciate the revision 

that we made and the presentation, and staff will be working 

on the recommendation, and we will get that to City Council.     

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you very much.  Appreciate your 

time tonight.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, let's see.  We only have one 

more item on the agenda, and I think it can go fairly 

quickly.  So I think we should just dive right into it, 

rather than taking a break.  So let me move into this.

(8:22 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  Mary T. Flynn, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven 

                  A. Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, 

                  Tom Sieniewicz, Nikolas Bowie and Corinne 

                  Espinoza       

          So the next item on the agenda is Board of Zoning 

Appeal case BZA 95066 seeking variances for the development 

at 56 Creighton Street.  And CDD staff will begin by 

summarizing why this is before us.  And I believe Liza is -- 

Liza Paden is going to do that for us. 

          Liza?  

          LIZA PADEN:  Yep, just had to unmute myself.       

          MARY FLYNN:  There you go.   

          LIZA PADEN:  So this is the Planning Board special 

permit, like you said, and what the developer was interested 

in doing is making some changes to the design, which created 

additional gross floor area that's outside of the existing 

volume, and this is part of the -- this is not part of the 

special permit that the Planning Board can grant.  So this 

is why they're at the BZA for head houses and outdoor roof 

decks.

          And I did send along a draft of the recommendation 

based on the comments made previously at the previous 

hearing from the Planning Board.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  I think -- yeah, I 

have seen that.  I assume everybody else has seen the draft 

as well.  Do any members of the Planning Board have 

questions for either Liza or the proponent?  No, okay.    

          I know we had talked about this before, and I 

think at the last -- at the hearing we had actually talked 

about making a positive recommendation, as Liza said, but we 

just felt it was important for them to come back closer to 

the actual BZA hearing. 

          So has everyone had a chance to review the draft 

as it was submitted, and are there any comments on it?   

Okay.  Are we prepared to vote to send it to the BZA? I 

believe we are.  I'm hearing no objections.  Okay.   

          So could I have a motion, then, to send the letter 

or the memo of support in regard to the project at 56 

Creighton Street to the Board of Zoning Appeals for their 

upcoming meeting and discussion?       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So move.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Hugh?   

90

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mm-hm.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Is there a second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Lou is the second.  Jeff, could we 

have a roll call, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Roll call on that motion.  Louis 

Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Nikolas Bowie?                      

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Corrine Espinoza?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And Mary Flynn?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.

          MARY FLYNN:  Excellent.  Thank you.  Thank you, 

Liza, appreciate it.  Mm-hm.  And thanks to the proponent 

for the changes that we made to the project.  It was very, 

very good.  Okay.  So that concludes the business on our 

agenda.  Are there additional comments from staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I -- this is Jeff Roberts -- I did 

want to mention one thing that I was -- I'm sure this will 

come up again before the Board, but I think it's something 

just to be mentioned.  Since the last meeting of the 

Planning Board, Richard McKinnon passed away.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Oh.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  He -- I'm not sure that everyone 

heard that.  I figure many of you have.  Rich was a regular 

fixture at Planning Board meetings, was involved in many 

projects around the city, including where he lived in East 

Cambridge for some time and also in West Cambridge and 

Alewife. 

          He was definitely a singular personality, and, you 

know, worked as a developer, but also strong community 

advocate for -- you know, for the lives of people in

Cambridge.  And, you know, he -- I am definitely going to 

miss seeing him.  I'm sure the Board members are going to 

miss seeing him too. 

          So I thought I just wanted to recognize that, and 

-- you know, he was involved in a project that's currently 

before the Board and will be coming before the Board later 

in December.       

          MARY FLYNN:   Yes.  Thank you for bringing that 

up.  I had heard about it; Liza had sent the article from 

the -- I think it was "Cambridge Day." Yeah, I mean most of 

us have known Rich for a very, very long time.  I remember 

him from when I started at the city when -- you know, which 

was, you know, 40 years ago practically.   

          And he -- you know, he was a guy from Cambridge.  

He grew up here.  He loved the city, you know?  He spent a 

lot of time working for the city, for the City Council and 

he really got to know the players and the people, and he saw 

everybody as a person, you know?  It wasn't just a game to 

him.   

          It was -- you know, his heart was always in the 

right place and I -- you know, he took that with him when he 

went off to the development community.  I think, you know,

of all of the developers that we know.  I mean, many of them 

do have community concerns at heart, but, you know, Rich I 

think saw the city as his home, right?   

          So he looked at it -- he really did look at it 

from the concern of somebody who was doing a project, but 

also lived here and grew up here and wanted to make 

Cambridge a better place. 

          So he was a little larger than life, I agree with 

you.  I think he's going to be very, very missed.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Was he ill?       

          MARY FLYNN:  I understand -- I think he had a 

heart attack.  I think he's had some health issue over the 

years, over the years, but from what I understand, it was 

heart failure.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  That was the report?         

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  Yes.  So thank you, Jeff.  

Okay.  Any other comments from the Planning Board side?  No?  

Okay.  Well, in that case I would say we are adjourned.  So 

the meeting is adjourned, and I'll see you all next week.       

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you, goodnight.
