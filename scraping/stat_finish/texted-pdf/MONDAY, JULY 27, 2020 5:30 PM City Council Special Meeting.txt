Electronic Poll Pads 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  Poll workers use poll pads to check voters in during in-person early voting.  For the 
2020 election, the state will certify at least one type of poll book for use on Election 
Day, which has never been allowed before.  The poll pads sync with each other 
during the day so that a voter can’t vote in more than one place and cast additional 
votes.  The poll pads also indicate whether a person requested a mail-in ballot 
(absentee or early voting ballots) and returned the voted ballot or not to the Election 
Commission.  The Election Commission downloads that information at the end of 
each day and uploads it to the state's software Voter Registration Information System 
(VRIS) so that the vote is accounted for. When the voter list is printed for Election 
Day, all voters who were checked in with the poll pad will be marked as having voted 
already so they can't go to the polls and vote on Election Day. The information in the 
poll pad is the information in VRIS:  voter name, ward and precinct, address, party, 
date of birth, and ballot cast or not. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Preventing waste, fraud, and abuse of City resources; 
•  Reducing voter fraud; and  
•  Simplifying and expediting the voting process. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The poll pads will be used at early voting locations; and also at Election Day polling 

places, if approved for use on Election Day by the Sec. of State. 

•  The City has used poll pads for early voting since the 2016 Presidential Election and 
is seeking to acquire additional pads to use for Election Day in 2020 and future 
elections, if the state approves their use.

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  The poll pads collect, record, retain and share information specifically associated 

with, or capable of being associated with, any voter, including voter address, whether 
a voter voted, date of birth and party affiliation.  They do not collect identifiable 
information related to how a person voted, only that they voted. 

•  Only Election Commission personnel can access the information stored by the poll 

pads. The poll pads are password protected also. However, the information stored in 
the poll pad is public record. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

•  Costs - $31,740 for 21 poll pads. Annual license charges (software and application 

warranty) of $300 per poll pad or $6300 per year for 21 poll pads. 

•  Funding Source - FY21 State Primary and Presidential Election operating budgets. 
•  Personnel costs - Election staff and poll workers will use the poll pads during training 
and early voting and, if approved by the state, on Election Day. The poll pads are not 
a substitute for the voting list. Early voting sites and Election Day will have paper 
voting lists available for use. Paper voting lists are required by state law unless the 
law changes. The use of poll pads does not impact staff or poll workers’ pay.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-16, regarding feasibility of eliminating Library 
late fines. 
 
The Library will pilot the elimination of overdue fines for the late return/renewal of materials, 
and the elimination of lost/damaged item fees for children’s and young adult materials. During 
the COVID-19 health crisis fees are being waived. A one year pilot will go into effect after a 
normal resumption of services to allow for review. 
 
The Library will continue to assess and collect lost/damaged fees for adult collection materials 
and fines and fees specifically related to our resource sharing agreements with other libraries 
(Comcat, ILL). The Library will work with patrons to ensure that items are returned so that 
others can enjoy them.  
 
As of January 2020, 5,748 Cambridge patrons are blocked from using their library card due to 
fines and fees in excess of $10. Certain neighborhoods are disproportionately impacted by library 
fines. Cambridge patrons with Central Square Branch as their home library account for 16% of 
all blocked cards, even though Central Square only comprises 9% of Library circulation. 
Similarly, Cambridge patrons with O’Connell Branch as their home library account for 9% of all 
blocked cards, even though O’Connell only comprises 5% of Library circulation. 
 
The pilot of an elimination of overdue fines will support City Council Goal #2 (ensure that 
Cambridge offers economic and educational opportunity to all). 
 
Background 

•  The Library currently imposes a fine of ten cents per day for adult materials returned or 

renewed after their due date.  

•  The Library currently allows each patron ten free pages of printing per day, and then 

charges fifteen cents per additional page.

•  Fines are not charged for children’s or young adult materials. 
•  Commonwealth Catalog and Interlibrary Loan items have fines of $2 per day. 
• 

In the FY20 Budget, revenue from Library Fines is budgeted at $65,000. This represents 
less than 0.01% of the total City operating budget. 
 

Impact Reports -- research has shown that libraries who have gone fine free have found the 
following: 

•  There is no significant difference in overdue rates between libraries that charged fees and 

•  Low-income families have identified fines and fees as a barrier and deterrent to use of the 

those that did not. 

library. 

•  Fines and fees disproportionately impact low-income families and neighborhoods. 
•  The administrative costs of collecting funds from patrons often equals or exceeds the 

revenue earned from library fines and fees. 

•  Eliminating fines typically led to:  

o  A major increase in number of lost items returned by patrons 
o  An increase in payment of replacement costs 
o  An increase in card registrations 
o  Patrons coming back - an increase in percent of people who were impacted have 

 

returned to use library services.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report 20-1, regarding report on the work that has been done to 
coordinate efforts to strengthen the local small business community and the arts through tourism, 
please be advised of the following: 
 
The Tourism, Economic Development, and Arts (TEA) group was formed by the City Manager 
in July 2019, in response to feedback from the Council received during the FY20 Budget 
hearings.   The group includes representatives from the City Manager’s Office, Arts Council, 
Community Development Department (CDD), Finance Department, and Cambridge Office for 
Tourism. The group meets monthly to discuss and develop streamlined opportunities for 
interdepartmental planning, shared marketing strategies and to foster increased opportunities for 
economic advancement for local artists and arts organizations based in Cambridge, as well as 
explore opportunities to further promote and support local businesses.   Strategies to implement 
these efforts include:  
 

•  Providing technical assistance to starting and growing arts organizations; 
•  Connecting artists and business to markets and pop-up opportunities; 
•  Promoting small business and public art events and promotions; 
•  Supporting commercial districts and business associations (e.g., events, marketing, 

•  Expanding web presence related to public art and local businesses 

technical assistance); and 

 

The TEA group produced and marketed three Winter Arts Markets designed to engage and 
support over 50 resident artists in selling their original work in different locations of the city, 
including at Harvard University’s newly redesigned Smith Campus Center, the former Out-of-
Town News kiosk in Harvard Square, and at the Multicultural Arts Center in East Cambridge.  
 
Cambridge Office for Tourism and Arts Council staff joined CDD staff at its summer 2019 all 
business association leadership meeting, which included a presentation by the Office for Tourism

on promoting commercial districts and marketing small businesses through their office. 
 
During the holiday season,  the TEA group coordinated efforts to market and support local 
businesses during Small Business Saturday and throughout the season by promoting local 
shopping, holiday strolls and other events, developing a more comprehensive listing of all 
holiday arts markets in the city and posting information on the City's website and social media 
platforms.  
 
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Community Development Department, Arts Council, and 
the Office for Tourism have continued to coordinate on a variety of projects to support artists, 
the city’s commercial districts and the city’s small business community. The Office for Tourism 
is a member of the City Manager’s Small Business Advisory Committee, which is working to 
support small businesses during their closure and while reopening.  This has included the Pick It 
Up Local Campaign to promote picking up take-out at local restaurants directly; and the Project 
Neighbor - Hello Again campaign to welcome businesses, customers, and the surrounding 
neighborhoods back by promoting health safety and positivity following the COVID-19 shut 
down.  
 
The Arts Council has assisted local artists and arts organizations by partnering with the 
Cambridge Community Foundation to provide direct financial support through the Cambridge 
Artists Relief Fund and convened and facilitated the Arts Recovery Advisory Committee to 
support a variety of critical needs as local arts venues and outdoor performances begin to resume. 
The TEA group will continue efforts to find creative ways to support the city’s commercial 
districts through financial and technical assistance during this challenging time. 
 
The group will also continue to collaborate on current and new initiatives, including additional 
marketing and opportunities; partnerships; promoting events; and small business and arts 
programming.

Re:  

Awaiting Report 20-08 regarding traffic calming measures on Eustis Street 

Date: 

July 21, 2020 

In response to Awaiting Report 20-8, dated February 3, 2020, regarding working with 
neighbors in the vicinity of Eustis Street to implement traffic calming measures on this 
street, we report the following. 
  
The Community Development Department (CDD), the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 
Department (TPT) and the Department of Public Works (DPW) have reviewed the request 
for traffic calming measures and roadway repair on Eustis Street.  
  
Typically, larger traffic calming infrastructure changes to streets are completed in 
conjunction with other roadwork such as repaving, street and sidewalk reconstruction. At 
this time no such roadway work is scheduled for Eustis Street. We have added the street to 
the list of requests for traffic calming interventions and these serve as considerations when 
developing the next Five-Year Plan for Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction. In the interim, 
we will monitor traffic speeds and evaluate the potential for implementing traffic calming 
measures when the street is scheduled for reconstruction.   
 
Once reconstruction is scheduled, CDD staff will coordinate a community process prior to 
construction to make sure neighborhood residents have the opportunity to participate in 
the discussion of possible improvements to Eustis Street. 
  
In the meantime, DPW will complete roadway patching on Eustis Street in early fall.  The 
work is being scheduled, recognizing the backlog that resulted from the construction 
moratorium that was adopted to mitigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
The goal of traffic calming is to reduce speeds on a street. In addition to the interventions 
noted above, Eustis Street will also have its speed regulations reduced from 25 MPH to 20 
MPH as part of a larger city-wide speed reduction program.  This change is expected to be 
implemented by early fall.

Awaiting Report 19-127 (dated October 7, 2019) regarding establishing a 
process to schedule load forecasting and infrastructure planning discussions 
open to the public  

Date:  July 21, 2020 

 
 
The information below is provided in response to Awaiting Report 19-127, dated 
October 7, 2019, regarding the establishment of a process for regularly scheduled 
public discussions between the City of Cambridge and representatives from 
Eversource, the Water Department, Comcast, Verizon and others in order to inform 
the City and the public about topics such as load forecasting and related 
infrastructure planning and improvements in Cambridge. The purpose of this 
process would be to ensure that long-range infrastructure planning is being 
undertaken consistent with City goals and in the best interest of Cambridge 
residents. 
 
City staff have spoken to utility providers and propose the following two-tier 
process to ensure strong and formalized collaboration and communication.  
 
Annual Public Presentations 
In a format similar to the Town-Gown report presentations by educational 
institutions, staff will coordinate with the major utility service providers to convene 
annual public presentations. The goal is to provide an opportunity to inform the 
public and facilitate dialogue about utility services in the city. The presentations will 
include service demand projections, load forecasting, infrastructure improvement 
plans, energy conservation programs, and other relevant topics. Public comment 
will be included. 
 
Given the specific focus and expertise of the entities, we propose that there will be 
two sets of public presentations: 
  
•  Planning Board – presentations by Eversource (gas and electric), the 

Department of Public Works (sewers and stormwater infrastructure), and the 
Water Department (water supply)

Bi-Annual Staff Meetings 
In addition to the annual presentations, City staff will schedule bi-annual meetings 
with the major utility providers to improve communication, cooperation, and 
coordination around long-term planning and development issues as well as 
anticipated infrastructure improvements in the city. These meetings would also 
serve to prepare for the annual presentations before the Planning Board and Pole & 
Conduit Commission and would include key staff from the Community Development 
Department, Department of Public Works, Water Department, Electrical 
Department, staff from the Pole and Conduit Commission, and others, as needed.

RE:  Report on Parking Restrictions Associated with the Port Infrastructure 
Improvements Project (Awaiting Report 20-28) 
 
Description of The Port Infrastructure Project 
The Project consists of over $35 million in improvements 
to sewer, drainage, water, street, sidewalk, and open space 
infrastructure in The Port.  The neighborhood is 
vulnerable to flooding and the City’s assessment of climate 
change has shown that the risk of flooding is increasing, 
due to the increasing frequency of short, very intense 
storm events in our part of the country.  This Project will 
reduce the frequency and severity of stormwater 
flooding and sewer backups in the neighborhood, and 
upgrade the neighborhood’s surface infrastructure, 
including streets, sidewalks, shade trees, landscaping, 
and open spaces.   
 
The Project is being implemented in 2 phases, described 
below and shown on the map at the end: 
 
Phase 1 
PL6 Stormwater Tank (yellow area on the map):  
390,000 gallon stormwater tank at City Parking Lot 6 
(PL6) off of Bishop Allen Drive.  The construction began in 
August 2018 and will be completed in the Fall of 2020.  This 
will result in immediate community benefits in terms of 
decreased flooding in the Port during heavy rainstorms. 
 
Phase 2  
Morgan Tanks / Utilities / Resiliency and Urban Forestry / Complete Streets (green 
and purple areas on the map): The design of Phase 2 is in its early stages, and includes 
ongoing field investigations such as soil borings, pipeline inspections, and topographic

survey.   The field investigations are expected to conclude in the Fall of 2020, followed by 
the detailed engineering design, which will continue through the Fall of 2021.  The 
construction of Phase 2 is expected to begin early in 2022 and extend to the end of 2024.  
Some construction by private utility companies, such as Eversource Gas, will begin in 
2021, in advance of the City project.  
 
Key Elements of Phase 2: 

Clement Morgan Park Tanks: Underground stormwater and sanitary sewage 
tanks will be constructed in the area of the basketball courts. The basketball courts 
and other areas of the Park impacted by construction will be restored at the 
completion of the Project.  There will also be opportunities to make other changes 
and improvements to the Park, based on community input. 
 
Utilities:  The Project will include utility work to ensure that stormwater and 
sewer pipes are in good repair, properly sized, and conveying their flows to the 
new underground tanks described above.  We will also take the opportunity to 
bring other public and private utilities, such as water and gas, into a state of good 
repair.  A number of these utilities are more than 100 years old and need to be 
replaced.    
 
Resiliency and Urban Forestry:  In conjunction with ongoing Citywide planning 
efforts, the Project will implement features to reduce the impacts of Climate Change 
in The Port; stormwater flooding and “urban heat island”.  Working with the 
community we will identify opportunities for green infrastructure and tree 
plantings. 
 
Complete Street Design: The streets, sidewalks and other public spaces in the 
Project Area will be reconstructed as part of the Project.  This presents an exciting 
opportunity to do more than simply repair and replace deteriorated asphalt, brick 
and concrete.   Working with the community, we can also incorporate street trees, 
green infrastructure, traffic calming, improved crosswalks, shared street elements, 
improved lighting, artwork, and street furniture including seating and play 
elements.  

 
Community Engagement / Communications Strategy for Phase 2:  In order to be 
successful, Phase 2 requires significant community input and guidance. We are planning a 
robust program of community events, neighborhood walks, and meetings beginning in the 
fall of 2020 and throughout 2021, “virtually” at first, and hopefully transitioning to “in-
person”.  We will also be establishing a Working Group to help guide staff and consultants 
throughout the process.  
 
Since 2017, we have engaged with the community in a variety of ways to raise the overall 
awareness of the project, distributing project brochures, tabling at community events such 
as Port Pride Day, Screen on the Green, and the City Manager’s Port Action Forum; and 
making presentations at community institutions such as Margaret Fuller House and to 
local clergy and other community leaders.  We have been developing an email contact list

(approximately 150 recipients at present) and established a project website at 
www.cambridgema.gov/theworks/theport .   
 
We hand-distribute Updates and Notices for key phases of construction and when an 
activity will have significant impacts on residents or businesses (such as when a street 
must be closed or restricted for an extended period of time).  Our hand-delivery of 
information has been challenged by the current COVID pandemic, but we continue to 
explore the best ways of getting information to the community in a timely and efficient 
manner.   
 
The Working Group will meet regularly with City Staff and consultants on the 
Project, and focus on: 

Community Engagement:  One of the first items we would like to collaborate with 
the Working Group on is how best to engage with the community.  How can the 
project team best work with the community, ensuring representative participation; 
make the best use of residents’ time; get input; and have a collaborative design 
process. 
 
Clement Morgan Park Tanks:  How/where can the basketball courts be 
relocated during construction?  Should other permanent changes be made to the 
design and features of Clement Morgan Park during construction? 
 
Resiliency and Urban Forestry: How can we best engage property owners and all 
community members about this innovative and important aspect of the project, which 
could involve improvements on both public and private property to mitigate the 
effects of climate change and enhance tree canopy and shade in The Port? 
 
Complete Street Design:  What changes would neighbors like to see as streets and 
sidewalks are reconstructed?  

 
Street and Sidewalk Closures and Parking Restrictions 
The City strives to minimize community impacts such as street and sidewalk closures and 
temporary parking restrictions; however, they are an inevitable part of major 
infrastructure projects such as this one, as contractors need space to efficiently and safely 
perform the work.   Many of the streets in the City and particularly in the Port 
Neighborhood are quite narrow, and it is simply not possible to safely maintain all of the 
existing pedestrian, vehicular and bicycle traffic, plus existing parking, while construction  
takes place.    
 
We require the contractors performing these activities to produce a Traffic Management 
Plan, with priority typically given to pedestrian traffic, followed by vehicle/bicycle traffic, 
followed by parking.  For some larger construction activities, contractors may need to 
close the street to through traffic in order to perform the construction.  We work with 
individual abutters regarding special circumstances, including business loading, funerals 
or other events, moving vans, meal or healthcare related deliveries, etc.

Limitations on Advance Scheduling of Closures and Restrictions 
Contractors working on City projects are required to produce construction schedules.  
However, on complex utility projects such as The Port Project, these schedules can be very 
dynamic.  Work at any one location can advance faster or slower than initially predicted, 
based on a number of factors, including: 

•  With infrastructure as old and complex as Cambridge’s, contractors can encounter 

unforeseen conditions despite extensive pre-planning and investigations  

•  Scheduling issues with third party and utility contractors (including emergencies 

elsewhere that they need to respond to) 
•  Contractor equipment or staffing issues 
•  Weather issues 

 
For these reasons, it is usually not possible to forecast, nor notify the community, more 
than a few days ahead of very specific construction impacts, such as elimination of 
individual parking spaces for example.  Instead, we aim to keep the community well 
informed of upcoming construction activities in a general area, and to emphasize that 
neighbors should be on the lookout for posted signs and additional detailed construction 
notices addressing the work more specifically. 
 
Non-Project-Related Closures and Restrictions 
There are also non-constructed related parking restrictions that occur in a neighborhood. 
These can include resident moving van permits (over 4,200 permits issued last year); 
development projects; a neighbor having a contractor doing work on their home; and  
other private and public utility work, including emergency repairs such as a sewer backup 
or water main leak.   
 
 
We understand that construction is frustrating and will be particularly challenging in the 
Port given the narrow streets.  The Project Team for the Port Infrastructure Project will 
include a Supervising Engineer, a Community Relations Manager, and the City Engineer.  
We will work collaboratively with the community to minimize surprises and work to 
address issues in a timely manner as they arise.  We will also look to the Working Group to 
work with us throughout the design.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-132, regarding a report on tree planting at Magazine 
Beach Park, Public Works Commissioner Owen O'Riordan reports the following: 
 
The Department of Public Works had expected to plant 10 bare root trees on Magazine Beach 
Park in the spring of 2020. However due to COVID 19 no bare root trees were planted this 
spring. 
 
Working with the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) it is anticipated at this time 
that these trees will be planted this fall.  DCR has indicated that they will take on the care and 
maintenance of these trees once they are in the ground.

Sydney retired from the Department of Public Works in January 2020 after dedicating 
45 years of his working life to the Department of Public Works and to the City of 
Cambridge.  The intention at that time was to celebrate Syd’s remarkable contribution 
to the city at a ceremony during Public Works Week 2020 and to unveil a plaque at the 
entrance to the maintenance garage dedicated to him immediately before the annual 
cookout at DPW. Unfortunately, as a result of COVID-19 this year’s events, to include 
the dedication ceremony had to be cancelled.  
 
At this time, the Department would like to unveil the plaque in the fall of this year at a 
time suitable to Sydney and his family and to further celebrate his remarkable 
contribution during next year’s Public Works Week festivities.

Re:   Brookline Special Town Meeting of November 19, 2019 -- Case # 9725 
 
 

Warrant Article # 21 (General)1 
 

Dear Mr. Ward and Ms. Goldburgh: 
 

In  this  Case  we  must  determine  whether  a  Brookline  by-law  prohibiting  any  permits  for 
construction of certain buildings with fossil fuel infrastructure (Article 21 of the Brookline Special 
Town Meeting of November 19, 2019) conflicts with the laws or Constitution of the Commonwealth. 
Because the State Building Code, the Gas Code, and G.L. c. 164 occupy the field of regulation and 
preempt local by-laws in their respective fields, we must disapprove the by-law.  

 
 
If we were permitted to base our determination on policy considerations, we would approve 
the by-law. Much of the work of this Office reflects the Attorney General’s commitment to reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions and other dangerous pollution from fossil fuels, in the Commonwealth and 
beyond. 2 The Brookline by-law is clearly consistent with this policy goal.  During our review of the 

 

1 In a decision issued July 17, 2020 we approved the remaining Articles from Case # 9725.  
2 For example, citing the threats of dangerous climate change to the Commonwealth, the Attorney 
General  has  filed  and  joined  legal  actions  seeking  to  compel  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Administration to secure greater reductions of greenhouse gas emissions from the electric power, oil 
and  gas,  and  transportation  sectors.   As  the  state’s  ratepayer  advocate,  the  Attorney  General  has 
advanced the transition of the Commonwealth’s electricity supply to renewable, non-carbon emitting 
sources of electric generation and the electrification of the heating sector.  In 2016, the Office opposed 
attempts by the state’s electric utilities to contract for gas pipeline capacity to anchor the construction 
of  an  unnecessary  new  interstate  gas  pipeline. See  NSTAR  Electric  Company  and  Western 
Massachusetts Electric Company d/b/a Eversource Energy, D.P.U. 15-181; Massachusetts Electric 
Company d/b/a National Grid, D.P.U. 16-05/ 16-07.  Most recently, the Attorney General petitioned 
the  Department  of  Public  Utilities  to  investigate  and  plan  for  an  energy  future  that  includes  an 
electrified  heating  sector  (see  Petition  of  Attorney  General  to  Investigate  Local  Gas  Distribution 
Companies, D.P.U. 20-80) and executed a settlement agreement that requires Eversource Gas to study 
and  report  on  the  steps  necessary  for  gas  distribution  companies  to  comply  with  the  emission

by-law we received numerous letters from interested parties urging our approval of the by-law for 
both policy and legal reasons. We appreciate this input as it has demonstrated the importance of the 
environmental policy goal that prompted the Town to adopt the by-law. 3 

 
However, in carrying out her statutory obligation of by-law review under G.L. c. 40, § 32, the 
Attorney General is precluded from taking policy issues into account. Amherst v. Attorney General, 
398 Mass. 793, 798-99 (1986) (“Neither we nor the Attorney General may comment on the wisdom 
of the town’s by-law.”). Pursuant to G.L. c. 40, § 32, the Attorney General’s by-law review is limited 
in  scope  to  determining  whether  the  by-law  conflicts  with  the  laws  or  Constitution  of  the 
Commonwealth. If it does conflict, the Attorney General must disapprove the by-law, regardless of 
the policy views that she may hold on the matter.  Id.   
 
 
conflicts with the laws of the Commonwealth in three ways:  
 

Under  this  standard  we  must  disapprove  the  by-law  adopted  under  Article  21  because  it 

1.  The  by-law  is  preempted  by  the  State  Building  Code,  which  establishes  comprehensive 
statewide standards for building construction and is “intended to occupy the field of building 
regulation.”  St.  George  Greek  Orthodox  Cathedral  of  Western  Massachusetts,  Inc.  v.  Fire 
Dep’t of Springfield, 462 Mass. 120, 130 n. 14 (2012);  

2.  The by-law is preempted by the Gas Code and G.L. c. 142, §13 in that it creates a new reason 
to  deny  a  gas  permit  and  would  “allow  a  locality  to  impose  additional  requirements  and 
second-guess the determination of the State [Plumbing] board.” St. George, 462 Mass. at 128; 
and  

3.  The  by-law  is  preempted  by  G.L.  c.  164  through  which  the  Massachusetts  Department  of 
Public Utilities (DPU) comprehensively regulates the sale and distribution of natural gas in 
the Commonwealth. See Boston Gas Co. v. City of Somerville, 420 Mass. 702, 706 (1995) 
(“[T]he [city] cannot use its limited authority to enact an ordinance which has the practical 
effect  of  frustrating  the  fundamental  State  policy  of  ensuring  uniform  and  efficient  utility 
services to the public.”)  (emphasis added).   

 
 
In  this  decision  we  briefly  describe  the  by-law;  discuss  the  Attorney  General’s  limited 
standard of review of town by-laws under G.L. c. 40, § 32; and then explain why, governed as we are 
by that standard, we must disapprove the by-law adopted under Article 21. 4 

 

reduction mandates of the Global Warming Solutions Act (see Joint Petition of Eversource Energy, 
NiSource Inc., and Bay State Gas Company d/b/a Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, D.P.U, 20-59). 
 
3    We  appreciate  the  letters  we  received  from,  among  others,  Town  Counsel  Joslin  Murphy  and 
Jonathan Simpson on behalf of the Town; Attorney Raymond Miyares on behalf of the petitioners; 
Attorney  Sarah  Krame  on  behalf  of  The  Sierra  Club;  Attorney  Aladdine  D.  Joroff  on  behalf  of 
Mothers Out Front Massachusetts and others; and Attorney Alyssa Rayman-Read on behalf of the 
Conservation Law Foundation.  
  
4 As we have done in the past, our Office conferred with certain petitioners and opponents at their 
request regarding procedural matters in connection with the by-law.  As is our practice, at no time did 
we offer an opinion as to the viability of the by-law or whether we would approve it.

Summary of Article 21  

 
 
 
Under Article 21 the Town voted to adopt a new general by-law, 8.39 “Prohibition on New 
Fossil Fuel Infrastructure in Major Construction.” The by-law establishes that “no permits shall be 
issued by the Town for the construction of New Buildings or Significant Rehabilitations that include 
the installation of new On-Site Fossil Fuel Infrastructure” with certain exceptions outlined in the by-
law.  
 
 
 

The by-law defines “On-Site Fossil Fuel Infrastructure” as: 

[F]uel  gas  or fuel  oil piping  that is  in  a building, in  connection with  a  building,  or 
otherwise within the property lines of premises, extending from a supply tank or from 
the point of delivery behind a gas meter (customer-side of gas meter). 

 
(Section 8.40.2, Definitions). The term “permits” is not defined but the by-law applies broadly to “to 
all permit applications for New Buildings and Significant Rehabilitations proposed to be located in 
whole or in part within the Town,” with certain exemptions as listed in the by-law (Section 8.40.3 
Applicability).  
 
 
The by-law includes a process by which applicants may request a waiver on the grounds of 
“financial infeasibility” or “impracticability of implementation.” (Section 8.40.5, Waivers). The by-
law directs the Selectboard to establish a “Sustainability Review Board,” comprised of at least three 
members representing expertise in affordable housing, commercial development, architecture etc., to 
review and decide on waiver applications. (Sections 8.40.2, Definitions and 8.40.5, Waivers). The 
by-law also establishes an appeal process for denial of a building permit: “An appeal may be sought 
from the SRB following a denial of a building permit.” (Section 8.40.6 Appeals).  
 

 
Attorney General’s Standard of Review and Preemption 

 
II.  

 
Pursuant to G.L. c. 40, § 32, the Attorney General has a “limited power of disapproval,” and 
 
“[i]t is fundamental that every presumption is to be made in favor of the validity of municipal by-
laws.”  Amherst v. Attorney General, 398 Mass. 793, 795-96 (1986).  The Attorney General does not 
review the policy arguments for or against the enactment.  Id. at 798-99 (“Neither we nor the Attorney 
General may comment on the wisdom of the town’s by-law.”)  Rather, in order to disapprove a by-
law (or any portion thereof), the Attorney General must cite an inconsistency between the by-law and 
the state Constitution or laws.  Id. at 796.  Where the Legislature intended to preempt the field on a 
topic,  a  municipal  by-law  on  that  topic  is  invalid  and  must  be  disapproved.  Wendell  v.  Attorney 
General, 394 Mass. 518, 524 (1985).    
 
 
In  determining  whether  a  by-law  is  inconsistent  with  a  state  statute,  the  “question  is  not 
whether the Legislature intended to grant authority to municipalities to act…but rather whether the 
Legislature  intended  to  deny  [a  municipality]  the  right  to  legislate  on  the  subject  [in  question].” 
Wendell, 394 Mass. at 524 (1985).  “This intent can be either express or inferred.”  St. George, 462 
Mass. at 125-26. Local action is precluded in three instances, paralleling the three categories of federal 
preemption:  (1) where the “Legislature has made an explicit indication of its intention in this respect”; 
(2) where “the State legislative purpose can[not] be achieved in the face of a local by-law on the same 
subject”;  and  (3)  where  “legislation  on  a  subject  is  so  comprehensive  that  an  inference  would  be

justified  that  the  Legislature  intended  to  preempt  the  field.”    Wendell,  394  Mass.  at  524.    “The 
existence  of  legislation  on  a  subject,  however,  is  not  necessarily  a  bar  to  the  enactment  of  local 
ordinances and by-laws exercising powers or functions with respect to the same subject[, if]  the State 
legislative purpose can be achieved in the face of a local ordinance or by-law on the same subject[.]”  
Bloom v. Worcester, 363 Mass. 136, 156 (1973); see Wendell, 394 Mass. at 527-28 (“It is not the 
comprehensiveness of legislation alone that makes local regulation inconsistent with a statute.  . . . 
The question . . . is whether the local enactment will clearly frustrate a statutory purpose.”). 

  
III.  The  By-law  is  Preempted  Because  it  Conflicts  with  Three  Uniform  Statewide 

Regulatory Schemes   

 

 
The  Supreme  Judicial  Court  has  frequently  held  that  in  determining  whether  a  statute 
“impliedly preclude[s] regulation by municipalities,” a court must examine “whether there is a need 
for uniformity in the subject of the legislation.”  Golden v. Selectmen of Falmouth, 358 Mass. 519, 
524 (1970).  Where there is “importance in uniformity in the law to govern the administration of the 
subject[, a] statute of that nature displays on its face an intent to supersede local and special laws and 
to repeal inconsistent special statutes.”  McDonald v. Justices of the Superior Court, 299 Mass. 321 
(1938) (discussing statute imposing uniform statewide regulation of alcoholic beverage sales).  Where 
a state statutory scheme demonstrates an intention to create a uniform statewide regulatory system, 
municipal enactments in the area are invalid. 

 
Brookline’s by-law implicates three statutory schemes that preempt local regulation: G.L. c. 
143, § 95(c) (creating the State Building Code); G.L. c. 142, §13 (charging the Plumbing Board with 
administration of the Gas Code regulating “gas fitting in buildings throughout the commonwealth”); 
and  G.L.  c.  164  (through  which  the  DPU  comprehensively  regulates  the  sale  and  distribution  of 
natural gas in the Commonwealth). 

 

 

 

 

 

 

A. 

The By-law is Preempted Because it Interferes with the Express Statutory Goal of Uniformity 
in the State Building Code. 

 
General Laws G.L. c. 143, § 95(c) expressly states a goal of uniformity with which the by-
law  interferes.  In  addition,  the  state  Board  of  Building  Regulations  and  Standards  (“BBRS”)  has 
exercised its statutory authority to prescribe the process for issuance and denial of permits, and the 
process for waivers and appeals from building officials’ decisions. The by-law here purports to create 
a new basis for denial of permits, and a new waiver and appeal process, all of which conflict with the 
Building Code and state law.  
 

1.  State Building Code and Board of Building Regulations and Standards. 

 

 

 

 
The  BBRS  is  established  by  G.L.  c.  143,  § 93,  and  charged  with  adopting  and  regularly 
updating the Building Code.  Id. § 94(a), (c,) (h).  The BBRS must administer the Building Code so 
as to further three “general objectives,” the first of which is: “Uniform standards and requirements 
for construction and construction materials, compatible with accepted standards of engineering and 
fire prevention practices, energy conservation and public safety.”  Id. § 95(a) (emphasis added). “In 
authorizing the development of the [C]ode, the Legislature has expressly stated its intention: to ensure 
‘[u]niform standards and requirements for construction and construction materials.” St. George, 462 
Mass. at 126 (citing G.L. c. 143, § 95(c).). As such, the Legislature established the Building Code as 
the  one  state-wide  building  code  and  rejected  the  premise  of  each  municipality  having  its  own

requirements. “All by-laws and ordinances of cities and towns…in conflict with the state building 
code shall cease to be effective on January [1, 1975].” St. 1972, c. 802, § 75 as appearing in St. 1975, 
c. 144, § 1.  Based on this express legislative goal of uniformity, and the abolition of local by-law 
requirements, the St. George court found “the Legislature [had] demonstrate[d] its express intention 
to preempt local action.” Id. at 129.   
 
 
relevant here) the issuance of building and occupancy permits: 

The  Building  Code  has  broad  application  regarding  building  construction,  including  (most 

 
780 CMR, and other referenced specialized codes as applicable, shall apply to: 

1.  the  construction,  reconstruction,  alteration,  repair,  demolition,  removal, 
inspection, issuance and revocation of permits or licenses, installation of equipment, 
classification and definition of any building or structure and use or occupancy of all 
buildings and structures or parts thereof…; 
 

101.2 Scope (emphasis supplied).  
 
 
It is the local building official who makes the determination whether a building or occupancy 
permit application complies with the Building Code requirements and thus whether a permit should 
issue:  

 
104.2  Applications  and  Permits. The  building  official  shall  receive  applications, 
review  construction  documents  and  issue  permits  for  the  erection,  and  alteration, 
demolition  and  moving  of  buildings  and  structures,  inspect  the  premises  for  which 
such  permits  have  been  issued  and  enforce  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  780 
CMR. 
 
105.1 Required. It shall be unlawful to construct, reconstruct, alter, repair, remove or 
demolish a building or structure; or to change the use or occupancy of a building or 
structure;  or  to  install  or  alter  any  equipment  for  which  provision  is  made  or  the 
installation of which is regulated by 780 CMR without first filing an application with 
the building official and obtaining the required permit. 
 

Further, the Building Code establishes the local building official as the decision-maker regarding any 
requested waivers:  
  

104.10 Modifications. Wherever there are practical difficulties involved in carrying 
out the provisions of 780 CMR, the building official shall have the authority to grant 
modifications  for  individual  cases,  upon  application  of  the  owner  or  owner's 
representative,  provided  the  building  official  shall  first  find  that  special  individual 
reason  makes  the  strict  letter  of  780  CMR  impractical  and  the  modification  is  in 
compliance with the intent and purpose of 780 CMR and that such modification does 
not lessen health, accessibility, life and fire safety, or structural requirements.  
 
Finally, the Legislature has designated the BBRS, sitting as the State Building Code Appeals 
Board,  as  the  entity  to  hear  appeals  from  local  and  state  enforcement  officials’  orders  under  and 
interpretations of the Building Code. G.L. c. 143, § 100:

There shall be in the division of professional licensure a building code appeals board, 
hereinafter  called  the  appeals  board,  to  consist  of  the  board  established  under  the 
provisions of section ninety-three. 

 

Whoever is aggrieved by an interpretation, order, requirement, direction or failure to 
act by any state or local agency or any person or state or local agency charged with the 
administration  or  enforcement  of  the  state  building  code  or  any  of  its  rules  and 
regulations,  except  any  specialized  codes  as  described  in  section  ninety-six,  may 
within  forty-five  days  after  the  service  of  notice  thereof  appeal  from  such 
interpretation, order, requirement, direction, or failure to act to the appeals board. 
 
2. G.L. c. 143, § 95(c)’s Stated Intention of Uniform Standards Preempts Additional Local 
Requirements.  
  
Where (as here) a statute authorizes a state agency to make a uniform statewide determination 
of what products and practices should (as well as should not) be allowed, a local by-law imposing an 
additional layer of regulation of the same subject is invalid.  Wendell v. Attorney General, 394 Mass. 
518 (1985).  In Wendell, the statute established a “pesticide board” within the state Department of 
Food and Agriculture and empowered a subcommittee of the board to “register” a pesticide for general 
or restricted use if the subcommittee found that the pesticide met specific statutory criteria.   Id. at 
526, 528-29.  In the face of this scheme, “[t]he Wendell by-law contemplate[d] the possibility of local 
imposition of conditions on the use of a pesticide beyond those established on a Statewide basis under 
the act.”  Id. at 528.  The court held that “[a]n additional layer of regulation at the local level, in effect 
second-guessing  the  subcommittee,  would  prevent  the  achievement  of  the  identifiable  statutory 
purpose of having a centralized, Statewide determination [and] …frustrate the purpose of the act.” 
Wendell, 394 Mass. at 529.     

 
In  determining  that  Springfield’s  ordinance  was  preempted  by  the  Building  Code,  the  St. 

George court relied on the reasoning of the Wendell decision:  

 
The  same  reasoning  applies  here.  The  Legislature  intended  to  occupy  the  field  by 
promulgating comprehensive legislation and delegating further regulation to a State 
board. The board’s regulations, in turn, set a Statewide standard as to what products 
and practices were permissible in a particular field, a process involving a discretionary 
weighing of relevant factors, such as cost and safety. In response the local government 
created  an  additional  layer  of  regulation  imposing  requirements  beyond  those 
contemplated by the board. There is no meaningful distinction between these cases, 
and  we  reach  the  same  conclusion  here:  the  code  preempts  inconsistent  local 
regulations.  
 

St. George, 462 Mass. at 133-134.  

 
Just as in St. George and Wendell, it is ultimately the BBBRS -- not any city or town -- that 
is  charged  with  determining  the  process  by  which  a  building  or  occupancy  permit  is  granted  or 
withheld.5  Local  ordinances  and  by-laws  that  second-guess  the  BBBRS’ determination  of  when  a 

 

5 As explained above, the initial determination is made by the local building official but any appeal 
from that decision goes to the Board sitting as the State Building Code Appeals Board. G.L. c. 143,

permit should (or should not) be allowed would frustrate the statutory purpose of having a centralized, 
statewide process for such matters.  See Wendell, 394 Mass. at 529. The Town’s attempt to second-
guess the BBRS, by prohibiting the issuance of a permit in a circumstance where the Building Code 
does not prohibit a permit, and assigning the waiver and appeal decision to a town board instead of 
the local building official and State Building Code Appeals Board, frustrates the purposes of § 95 -- 
including  the purpose of uniformity  --  and is  therefore invalid.6 As the St. George court stated in 
rejecting Springfield’s ordinance:  

 
If all municipalities in the Commonwealth were allowed to enact similarly restrictive 
ordinances and bylaws, a patchwork of building regulations would ensue…Allowing 
the  city’s  ordinance  to  stand  would…sanction[  ]  the  development  of  different 
applicable  building  codes  in  each  of  the  Commonwealth’s  351  cities  and  towns, 
precisely the result that promulgation of the code was meant to foreclose.  
 

St. George, 462 Mass. at 135. 7 

 
 
The proponents and the Town err in arguing that the Town’s additional layer of regulation is 
authorized by cases like  Lovequist v. Conservation Commission of Town of Dennis, 379 Mass.  7 
(1979), which held that “[s]ince the language of the [challenged] by-law parallels that of the statute, 
it appears plain that [the by-law] furthers rather than derogates from the legislative purpose embodied 
in the Wetlands Protection Act.”  Id. at 15.  That principle is inapposite here, because, as the Lovequist 
court emphasized, “we have specifically held that [the Wetlands Protection Act] sets forth minimum 
standards  only,  ‘leaving  local  communities  free  to  adopt  more  stringent  controls.’”    Id.  (quoting 
Golden v. Selectmen of Falmouth, 358 Mass. 519, 526 (1970)). 
 
 
Essential to the Golden court’s holding was its recognition that whether a statute preempted 
local regulation depended in part on whether the statute demonstrated “a need for uniformity in the 
subject,” id. at 524; and its conclusion that the Wetlands Protection “Act does not attempt to create a 
uniform statutory scheme.”  Golden, 358 Mass. at 526 (emphasis added).  Thus Golden and Lovequist 
cannot  be  applied  here,  where  the  statute  authorizing  the  State  Building  Code  expressly  makes 
“[u]niform standards and requirements” a principal objective.  G.L. c. 143, § 95(a). 
 

 

§ 100. 
 
6 Although G.L. c. 40A, § 7 and the Code (at Section105.3.1) authorize the local building inspector 
to withhold a building permit for non-compliance with local zoning by-laws or ordinances, they do 
not  authorize the withholding of a permit for non-compliance with  a general  (non-zoning) by-law 
such as Brookline’s.    
 
7 To illustrate how the by-law undermines the Code’s uniformity requirements: imagine one building 
project in Newton and one building project in Brookline, each with the same proposed architectural 
plans, construction and construction materials, and both proposing on-site fossil fuel infrastructure. 
Assuming the projects complied with the Building Code (and local zoning requirements) in all other 
respects, the Newton project would be entitled to a building permit, but the Brookline project would 
not.

The proponents and the Town are correct that the Building Code does not directly regulate 
fossil  fuel  infrastructure  as  defined  in  the  by-law.  However,  the  by-law’s  enforcement  and 
waiver/appeal mechanism -- withholding of a permit and waivers/appeals therefrom -- is directly and 
comprehensively regulated by the  Code. The BBRS asserts  that “the Legislature  has  intended, by 
M.G.L. c. 143, § 94, for the Building Code to govern the issuance of permits” [and] “a local ordinance 
creating a new basis for denial of permits would conflict with the Building Code.” (Letter from DPL 
Office of Legal Counsel to Hurley, p. 4). 8 As such, the by-law cannot stand.  
 
 
It is true that, with the 2008 passage of the Global Warming Solutions Act ("GWSA") the 
 
Legislature has also mandated economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions reductions, and the Supreme 
Judicial Court has twice affirmed that the emission reduction limits of the GWSA are mandatory and 
enforceable, Kain et al. v. Department of Environmental Protection, 474 Mass. 278 (2016); NEPGA 
v. Department of Environmental Protection. 480 Mass. 398 (2018) (upholding power sector emission 
limits).  Indeed, in NEPGA, the court observed: 
 

Its name bespeaks its ambitions. The Global Warming Solutions Act, St.2008, c.298 
(act), was passed to address the grave threats that climate change poses to the health, 
economy, and natural resources of the Commonwealth. The act is designed to make 
Massachusetts a national, and even international, leader in  the efforts to  reduce the 
greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. 

 
Id. at 399 (internal citations omitted).  While the by-law would further the purpose of the GWSA, it 
would, nevertheless, frustrate other express statutory purposes, uniformity in the Building Code, Gas 
Code  and  Chapter  164,  and  the  by-law  is  thus  invalid.  See  Take  Five  Vending,  Ltd.  v.  Town  of 
Provincetown, 415 Mass. 741, 744 (1993) (stating general standards for determining whether statute 
preempts local ordinance or by-law) ); see also Boston Gas Company v. City of Somerville, 420 Mass. 
702, 705-06 (1995) (local ordinance in furtherance of a valid legislative delegation must nonetheless 
yield to state superintendence if the ordinance has the practical effect of frustrating fundamental State 
policy). During the unprecedented reality of climate disruption, the Town has acted in an exemplary 
manner to attempt a bold step to tackle the problem locally. Yet, to the extent the Commonwealth has 
not yet taken the necessary steps to ensure the state will achieve the 2050 net zero emissions limit, 
the by-law proponents' remedy lies with the Legislature and the courts.  
 
B.  
in the State Gas Code. 
 
 
Just as with the State Building Code, the by-law is also preempted by the State Gas Code. The 
Gas Code is comprehensive, uniform, and directly regulates the gas piping targeted by the Brookline 

The By-law is Preempted Because it Interferes with the Express Statutory Goal of Uniformity 

 

8  As does the court, “[w]e afford substantial deference to an agency’s interpretation of a statute that 
it is charged with administering.” Boston Edison Co. v. Town of Bedford, 444 Mass. 775, 783 (2005) 
(internal citations and quotations omitted). Thus, where the BBRS, Plumbing Board (see pp. 16-19 
below), and DPU all concur that the by-law is preempted by the statutes and regulations each Board 
administers, those interpretations are entitled to great deference, particularly “[w]here, as here, the 
case  involves  interpretation  of  a  complex  statutory  and  regulatory  framework.”  MCI  Telecomm. 
Corp.  v.  Dep’t  of  Telecomm.  &  Energy,  435  Mass.  144,  150-151  (2001)  (internal  quotations  and 
citations omitted).

by-law. The Gas Code regulates when a permit may be issued and the waiver/appeal process for denial 
of a permit. Because the by-law creates an additional layer of regulation, a new ground for denial of 
a permit, and a new waiver/appeal procedure, all not found in the Gas Code, the by-law interferes 
with the express legislative goal of uniformity in the Gas Code.  
 

1.  The Fuel Gas Code and the Plumbing Board.  

 
 
The Massachusetts Fuel Gas Code (Gas Code) is comprised of a series of regulations adopted 
by the  Board of State Examiners of Plumbers and Gas Fitters  (Plumbing  Board), specifically 248 
CMR 4.00 through 8.00. The Gas Code’s authorizing legislation is G.L. c. 142, §13 which charges 
the Board with the duty to “alter, amend, and repeal rules and regulations relative to gas fitting in 
buildings throughout the commonwealth.” Id. Further said regulations "shall be reasonable, uniform, 
based  on  generally  accepted  standards  of  engineering  practice,  and  designed  to  prevent  fire, 
explosion, injury and death.” Id. (emphasis added).  
 
 
 

Chapter 142, Section 1 defines “gas fitting” as:  

[A]ny work which includes the installation, alteration, and  replacement of a piping 
system beyond the gas meter outlet or regulator through which is conveyed or intended 
to be conveyed fuel gas of any kind for power, refrigeration, heating or illuminating 
purposes  including  the  connection  therewith  and  testing  of  gas  fixtures,  ranges, 
refrigerators,  stoves,  water  heaters,  house  heating  boilers,  and  any  other  gas  using 
appliances, and the maintenance in good and safe condition of said systems, and the 
making of necessary repairs and changes. 

 
Thus,  in  regulating  “fossil  fuel  infrastructure”  (as  defined  in  the  by-law),  the  Brookline  by-law 
directly regulates the same gas piping regulated by Chapter 142 and the Gas Code.    
 
 
 
The  Gas  Code  is  enforced  by  Inspectors  of  Plumbing  and/or  Inspectors  of  Gas  Fitting, 
individuals who personally hold licenses issued by the Plumbing Board. G.L. c. 142, §11. Prior to 
commencing most work governed by the Gas Code, a permit must be issued by the plumbing and/or 
gas inspector. See 248 CMR 3.05. The Gas Code designates who may obtain a gas permit (a licensed 
plumber or gas fitter) as well as describes how permits are issued and, if necessary, terminated. Id. 
Finally,  a  plumbing  inspector’s  determination  that  a  permit  should  be  denied  is  appealed  to  the 
Plumbing Board per G.L. c. 142, §13 and 248 CMR 3.05, not a locally created entity as contemplated 
by the Brookline by-law. 
  

2.  G.L.  c.  142,  § 13’s  Stated  Intention  of  Uniform  Standards  Preempts  Additional 

Local Requirements.  

 
As an initial matter, pursuant to G.L. c. 143, §96, the State Gas Code is incorporated into the 
 
State  Building  Code.  Id.  (“The  state  building  code  shall  incorporate  any  specialized  construction 
codes…”) Thus, the Building Code field preemption found by the St. George court applies with equal 
measure to the State Gas Code. See St. George, 462 Mass. at 133-134 (“[T]he Legislature intended 
to occupy the field by passing comprehensive legislation and delegating further regulation to a State 
board.”).

In addition, G.L. c. 142, §13 mandates creation of uniform, statewide standards for gas fittings 
with  which the Brookline by-law interferes. By restricting  the installation of “On-Site Fossil  Fuel 
Infrastructure” (By-law, Section 8.40.2), the Brookline by-law is in reality restricting the installation 
of “gas fitting” -- work governed by the Gas Code. By way of example, if  a consumer in Brookline 
decided to replace an aging oil heater with a new gas furnace, the consumer could have the gas furnace 
installed and have a local gas utility bring a new gas line into the property to a gas meter, all without 
interference by the by-law. Where the Brookline by-law directly applies is when the consumer then 
hires a licensed plumber or gas fitter to install gas piping connecting the new gas furnace to the meter 
installed by the utility company. For that step, the consumer needs a licensed plumber or gas fitter to 
apply for a locally issued -- but state regulated -- gas permit and perform work exclusively governed 
by the Gas Code. The Brookline by-law would prohibit the state regulated gas permit and bar the state 
regulated plumbing work.  
 
 
The St. George court’s reasoning applies here and dictates the conclusion that the Brookline 
by-law is preempted by the Gas Code. The by-law and the Gas Code have different requirements for 
when gas fitting work can occur and have different appellate/waiver procedures governing relief from 
denial of a permit. As a result, “the [by-law] would frustrate the achievement of the stated statutory 
purpose of having centralized, Statewide standards in this area.” Id. at 129-130. The Gas Board asserts 
that the by-law is preempted by the Gas Code and G.L. c. 142, §13 because the by-law “attempt[s] to 
supplement  the  rules  for  permits  governed  by  the  Gas  Code”  and  “attempts  to  regulate  the 
performance of work that the legislature has deemed exclusively governed by the Gas Code.” (Letter 
from Plumbing Board Executive Director to Hurley, p. 6).  As such the by-law is preempted by the 
Gas Code.     
 
 
C. 
The By-law is Preempted by Chapter 164, Which Reflects the Fundamental State Policy of 
Ensuring Uniform Utility Services to the Public.   
 
 
 
The  by-law  is  also  preempted  by  G.L.  c.  164,  through  which  the  DPU  comprehensively 
regulates the sale and distribution of natural gas in the Commonwealth. The Supreme Judicial Court 
has repeatedly recognized “the desirability of uniformity of standards applicable to utilities regulated 
by the Department of Public Utilities.”  New England Tel. & Tel. Co. v. City of Lowell, 369 Mass. 
831,  834  (1976)  (citing  cases).    In  that  case,  a  city  ordinance  created  “a  burden  for  the  [utility] 
company  additional  to  those  which  it  carries  elsewhere.    To  the  extent  that  this  is  so,  there  is  a 
variation from the uniformity desirable in the regulation of utilities throughout the Commonwealth,” 
and accordingly the ordinance was invalid.  Id. (invalidating ordinance requiring registered engineer 
to  stamp  utility’s  street-opening  plans,  where  state  statute  exempted  companies  under  DPU 
jurisdiction from requirement that company’s engineers be registered). 

 
Similarly,  in  Boston  Gas  Co.  v.  City  of  Somerville,  420  Mass.  702  (1995),  the  court 
invalidated a city ordinance regulating repair of street openings by utilities because “the [city] cannot 
use  its  limited  authority  to  enact  an  ordinance  which  has  the  practical  effect  of  frustrating  the 
fundamental State policy of ensuring uniform and efficient utility services to the public.”  Id. at 706 
(emphasis added).  In Boston Gas Co. v. City of Newton, 425 Mass. 697 (1997), the court invalidated 
a  city  ordinance  imposing  street-opening  fees  on  utilities,  where  it  “would  impose  an  additional 
burden on the plaintiff, a burden which undermines the ‘fundamental State policy of ensuring uniform 
and efficient utility services to the public.’” Id. at 703 (quoting Boston Gas Co. v. Somerville). And 
in Boston Edison Co. v. Town of Bedford, 444 Mass. 775 (2005) the court invalidated a town by-law 
that would have imposed a penalty on pole owners for having double poles in the town, concluding

that, “[a]lthough there is no express legislative intent to forbid local activity regarding double pole 
removal, the ‘comprehensive nature’ of G.L. c. 164 implies that the Legislature intended to preempt 
municipalities from enacting legislation on the subject.” Id. at 781.   

 
The  Superior  Court  recently  applied  the  Boston  Gas  line  of  cases  in  overturning  a  Boston 
ordinance  regulating  the  inspection,  maintenance,  and  repair  of  natural  gas  leaks  within  the  city. 
Boston Gas Company v. City of Boston, 35 Mass.L. Rptr.141, 2018 WL 4198962.  The court ruled 
that “the [Supreme Judicial Court]’s decisions in City of Somerville and City of Newton  make it 
plain  that,  with  limited  exceptions,  non-incidental  local  rules  and  ordinances  affecting  the 
manufacture and sale of gas and electricity are preempted by Chapter 164.” Id. The court rejected the 
City’s argument that because the City ordinance was a “permitting” requirement (like the Brookline 
by-law here) the ordinance was not preempted: 

 
The fact that the City couches its inconsistent obligations as “permitting” requirements 
does not make them any less objectionable, or any less subject to preemption, because 
the net effect on Boston Gas is the same as if the obligations had been imposed directly. 
Cf. City of Newton, 425 Mass. at 699-706 (portion of ordinance charging inspection 
and maintenance fees as a prerequisite to acquiring a permit to excavate public ways 
and sidewalk was invalid). 
 
 

Id.  
 
 
Just  as  in  Wendell  and  St.  George,  the  Legislature  here  has  granted  to  the  DPU,  not  to 
individual cities and towns, the authority to regulate the sale and distribution of natural gas throughout 
the Commonwealth. The DPU views the by-law as conflicting with this legislative grant of authority 
because, “[i]n effect, the [by-law] restricts National Grid’s ability to add new customers in Brookline 
(particularly heating customers) and restricts National Grid’s ability to serve existing customers who 
perform significant renovations on their buildings.” (Letter from DPU General Counsel to Hurley, p. 
2).  Clearly  the  Town  could  not  directly  prohibit  National  Grid  from  adding  new  customers  in 
Brookline because such a move would directly interfere with the DPU’s authority. As in the City of 
Boston, the Town cannot do indirectly (through a permitting requirement) what it is prohibited from 
doing directly. See Boston Gas Company v. City of Boston, 35 Mass.L.Rptr.141, 2018 WL 4198962 
(“The fact  that the City couches its inconsistent  obligations as ‘permitting’ requirements  does not 
make them any less objectionable, or any less subject to preemption, because the net effect on Boston 
Gas is the same as if the obligations had been imposed directly.”) 
 
 
service throughout the Commonwealth. As the DPU explains:  
 

The by-law also interferes with the express legislative objective in Chapter 164 for uniform 

[The  by-law]  would  impose  non-uniform  service  among  its  residents  with  new 
customers forced to become residential non-heating customers (Rate Class R-1), rather 
than  having  the  option  to  become  residential  heating  customers  (Rate  Class  R-3). 
Article 21 prevents the uniform service that G.L. c. requires and, therefore, Article 21 
is preempted by the well-established, comprehensive scope of G.L. c. 164. 
 

Letter from DPU General Counsel to Hurley, p. 3. By prohibiting gas and oil service to the Town’s 
residents, the by-law interferes with the legislative intent in G.L. c. 164, § 105A that there be “absolute 
interdependence  of  all  parts  of  the  Commonwealth  and  all  of  its  inhabitants  in  the  matter  of 
availability of public utility services, [so that] all may obtain a reasonable measure of such services.” 
Pereira v. New England LNG Co., Inc., 364 Mass. 109, 120-121 (1973). To be sure, even without the

IV.  CONCLUSION 

by-law, residential and commercial property owners may choose energy systems that do not rely on 
fossil fuels. And the Town may consider adopting incentive programs to nudge property owners in 
that direction. However, the by-law here forces a decision on property owners and thereby interferes 
with  the  legislative  goal  in  Chapter  164  of  uniform  utility  options  statewide.    The  Town  is  thus 
preempted from utilizing this method to achieve its stated goals. 9    
 
 
 
 
The Attorney General agrees with the policy goals behind the Town’s attempt to reduce the 
use of fossil fuels within the Town. However, the Legislature (and the courts) have made plain that 
the  Town  cannot  utilize  the  method  it  selected  to  achieve  those  goals.  The  Town  cannot  add  an 
additional layer of regulation to the comprehensive scope of regulation in the State Building Code, 
State Gas Code, and Chapter 164.  This is true no matter how well-intentioned the Town’s action, and 
no matter how strong the Town’s belief that its favored option best serves the  public health of its 
residents. Because the by-law adopted under Article 21 is preempted, we must disapprove it.     
 
Note:  Pursuant to G.L. c. 40, § 32, neither general nor zoning by-laws take effect unless the 
Town has first satisfied the posting/publishing requirements of that statute.  Once this 
statutory duty is fulfilled, (1) general by-laws and amendments take effect on the date 
these posting and publishing requirements are satisfied unless a later effective date is 
prescribed in the by-law, and (2) zoning by-laws and amendments are deemed to have 
taken  effect  from  the  date  they  were  approved  by  the  Town  Meeting,  unless  a  later 
effective date is prescribed in the by-law.

9 We considered whether we could disapprove only the offending text (the withholding of a building 
permit  and  appeal/waiver  scheme)  and  approve  the  remaining  text.  When  a  portion  of  a  law  or 
regulation is found to be invalid, “[u]nless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted 
those provisions which are within its power, independently of that which is not, the invalid part may 
be dropped if what is left is fully operative as a law.” Alaska Airlines, Inc. v. Brock, 480 U.S. 678, 
684  (1987).  Here  no  fully  operable  by-law  would  remain  if  we  excised  only  the  offending  text.  
Therefore, we determine that the offending text is non-severable, and we must disapprove the entire 
by-law.

VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX

WHEREAS: Cambridge's Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge

residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding

impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to

avoid even worse impacts in the future; and

WHEREAS: Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and

transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate

crisis; and

WHEREAS: Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero

emissions no later than 2050; and

WHEREAS: In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and

cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by

electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and

WHEREAS: All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating,

and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and

WHEREAS: Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly

proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and

WHEREAS: Cambridge's aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent

danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand

from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it

ORDERED: That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the

Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby submitting for the City Council’s consideration a proposed restatement of and 
amendment to the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Account, entitled “The City of Cambridge Restated 
and Amended Mayor’s Disaster Relief Account” (“Account”) as set forth in the attached 
proposed Order. This restatement of and amendment to the Account would authorize the 
Account to provide funds to arts organizations with a principal place of business in Cambridge 
that have been affected by disaster in addition to individuals and families affected by disaster, 
including small businesses operated by individuals in Cambridge. 
 
Specifically, the restatement and amendment would insert the following language into the first 
sentence of the second paragraph of Article II (“Purposes”) of the Account to include “arts 
organizations whose principal place of business is in Cambridge”, which will allow the Account 
to provide emergency funds to Cambridge arts organizations that have been impacted by the 
COVID-19 disaster and other emergencies and disasters. I have also attached the proposed 
restated and amended Account for the Council’s consideration.

From:  Police Commissioner, Branville G. Bard, Jr. 

Date:  July 22, 2020 

Ref.:  CO 0-9 (POR 2020 #146) dated June 22, 2020  

 

Re: CPD – Itemized Statement of Materials, Tools and Equipment   

 
The purpose of this response is to address Council Order O-9 (POR 2020 #146) which requests  
the Cambridge Police Department, among other things, to [prepare] an itemized statement of all 
“materials, tools, and property” it owns in accordance with Chapter 2.52 § 090 of the Cambridge 
Municipal Code. The pertinent section of the Code was enacted prior to 1990 and there is no record  
of a previous submission of this type within the Department archives; therefore, the submitted format  
is original.  
 
The attached report is in excess of 90 (ninety) pages in length and is meant to comprise the entirety of 
the materials, tools and property owned by the Cambridge Police Department. Its appendix consisting 
of pictures of the catalogued items is approximately one hundred and sixteen (116) pages. In an effort 
to further adhere with the perceived spirit of the Council Order which uses nebulous terminology such 
as “military grade equipment” but specifically mentions a “Lenco Bearcat” (an armored multi-purpose 
emergency rescue vehicle used by the Department) and “high powered sniper rifles” (a type of 
“firearm” possessed by the Department), this cover letter will provide a summary of all armored 
vehicles and firearms (excluding less-than-lethal munitions). The summary of these materials is as 
follows:

Description 
An armored Multi-Purpose 
Emergency Rescue Vehicle 
(MPERV) which serves as a 
passive system that allows 
public safety professionals 
(Police, Emergency Medical,

close to a hazard as 
necessary while affording 
them time to further analyze 
and react to any particular 
threat.

Lastly, the Council Order inquires as to what options exist for disposing of the listed equipment  
“if no longer needed”. As it pertains to the weaponry, the need for law enforcement officers to rely  
on firearms as defensive tools will likely persist hereafter. This includes the use of both handguns and 
more high-powered, specialized long weapons; each of which, have distinct advantages in specific 
situations. The Department retains its own armorers who are capable of repairing weapons if needed 
and therefore most weapons are replaced only when necessary. As it pertains to the use of an armored 
Multi-Purpose Emergency Rescue Vehicle, its presence provides the City’s public safety apparatus 
with enhanced life-saving capacity; therefore, its continued use is desirable and necessary.    
 
Note: during the course of conducting this inventory a small quantity of tear gas (CS/CN Spray) was 
located. The gas was ordered destroyed and given to the Massachusetts State Police (MSP) for proper 
disposal in accordance with the applicable guidelines. [the exact quantities are listed in the report]. 
Tear gas is not authorized for use under CPD policy.  
 
I hope that you find this response satisfactory, at the time of the initial discussion of this report 
departmental armorers and weapons experts will be available to answer questions of a technical variety 
that may require advanced expertise.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr. 
Police Commissioner

City of Cambridge 

O-1 
IN CITY COUNCIL 
July 27, 2020 

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
COUNCILLOR CARLONE 
MAYOR SIDDIQUI 
VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

November 5, 2018 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

Re: Withdrawal and Re-Submission of Zoning Amendment Petition 

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance 
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey, 
and Zondervan: 

On behalf of BMR-Third LLC, a subsidiary of BioMed Realty, L.P., we are pleased to re-

submit for your review the enclosed rezoning petition for a proposed amendment to the Zoning 
Ordinance and the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, which, upon adoption, would result in 
a new Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) District CDK. As you know, on March 11, 2020 we 
submitted the enclosed rezoning petition to City Clerk, and the City Council referred the 
rezoning petition to the Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee at the March 16, 2020 
City Council meeting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Planning Board cancelled its 
meetings for the months of April, May and early June, and has since re-commenced remote 
meetings on June 16, 2020. Accordingly, we are simultaneously withdrawing the March 11, 
2020 PUD-CDK rezoning petition and re-submitting the enclosed rezoning petition. The 
enclosed rezoning petition is exactly the same as the March 11, 2020 petition other than any 
revised dates or references to this re-submission, as the case may be. 

As you know, we have worked closely with the City to see to the stewardship of what is 

now branded as Canal District Kendall (formerly Kendall Square and Cambridge Research Park) 
since completing the acquisition of the former Lyme Properties portfolio in 2007. Specific 
stewardship projects include ongoing improvements to the public realm (including renovation of 
the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the introduction of public art, improvements to the ice

skating rink and boat launch, a commitment to local retail, and the on-going redevelopment and 
dedication of Termeer Square) and the development of 450 Kendall Street. We now come to you 
with what we hope is the final step in finishing what Lyme Properties started in 1999 by 
realizing on the longstanding goal of having a significant arts and culture facility in the 
neighborhood. At the same time, we hope to replace the Eversource gas facility located along 
Third Street to make way for an iconic architectural building that enhances the public realm and 
the connections among surrounding open spaces. As you will see in the enclosed proposed 
Zoning Map amendment, the new overlay district covers the portion of the Canal District 
Kendall that was originally developed as Kendall Square plus the Eversource site (referred to 
here as the gas transfer station site, or “GTS Site,” for ease of reference). 

A. Background. We submit this petition after soliciting extensive public feedback 

through community open houses, surveys, deeply engaging with the arts community, and other 
means to determine what type of arts and culture facility the City wants to see at 585 Third 
Street, the former Constellation Center site (also known as “Parcel C”). As you know, 
Constellation acquired the site in 2002 and spent over 15 years trying to raise the capital for a 
theater complex at the location. In the interim, the rest of the area within the proposed PUD-
CDK has been improved to now include approximately 757,970 square feet of office and 
laboratory space, 75,500 square feet of retail and restaurant uses, and 465 residential units. 
Unfortunately, a standalone theater proved not to be economically viable on Parcel C. We 
acquired Parcel C in 2018, and have subsequently entered into an option agreement with 
Eversource that creates the possibility of combining Parcel C with the abutting GTS Site. The 
finite duration of the option agreement and the unique ability to  relocate the GTS in 
coordination with a development spanning both parcels makes this a one-in-a-generation 
opportunity. We continue to work diligently on establishing a new location for the GTS facility, 
and are nearer than ever to achieving our goal, but have not yet completed that effort. 

We and our affiliates are the owners of abutting first class laboratory facilities that serve 
as key locations for companies like Takeda, Alnylam, and Eli Lilly; the success of development 
on Parcel C was and is highly important to us and our shareholders. As majority owners in the 
association that manages the public realm of the Canal District Kendall, the public realm is also 
essential to us and to our tenants – both biotech and retailers alike. We are convinced that we can 
make a significant impact with an arts and culture facility in a way that fits into the 
neighborhood, is attractive to a diverse set of Cambridge residents and visitors, enhances the 
public realm, is economically viable, and otherwise furthers the development goals of the 
community, while being within the guidelines of our mission as a real estate investment 
company focusing on high quality life sciences space. 

B.  Summary of Petition. Our zoning petition memorializes the previously approved and 

constructed density at each site within the proposed PUD-CDK, and allows for additional 
development on Parcel C and the GTS Site to achieve the project concept described below. The 
proposed amendment permits a mixed use development project that is a new building containing 
an arts, culture, and public space component that complements the existing 465 apartments and 
commercial space, and, as noted above, creates incentives for incorporating the GTS Site by 
allowing for greater bulk and height, and public realm amenities, if the GTS Site is included. The 
height and floor area, under a scenario where the GTS facility is removed from Third Street,

would be 250 feet and up to 550,000 gross square feet, respectively. The proposed amendment 
does not grant further development potential to the existing buildings constructed within PUD-
CDK. 

C. Project Concept. Since acquiring Parcel C, we have worked tirelessly with our 
consultant team to unlock the full potential of the site. The renderings enclosed show the fruits of 
our labor. To accommodate the building and concepts shown, the proposed PUD-CDK allows us 
to combine Parcel C with the GTS Site and construct mixed use laboratory and office above 
approximately 40,000 square feet of arts, culture, and public space, all in a striking 21st-century 
building consistent with existing and other proposed building heights in the vicinity. This 
building will significantly enhance the open spaces surrounding it, and will help strengthen the 
pedestrian corridor that ties together Termeer Square to the north, the Broad Canal and Broad 
Canal Way retail to the south, and the future Volpe Center project to the west (across Third 
Street).  All of this can be done in a manner that meets the sustainability practices of modern 
construction and caters to a community as economically and culturally diverse as Cambridge. 

Compare the renderings of our proposed project to the existing condition, also shown in 

the enclosed renderings. Parcel C is the “missing tooth” in the Canal District Kendall, and the 
location of the GTS Site (the last remnant of an industrial zone on Third Street) exacerbates the 
problem from an urban planning perspective. We believe that the project facilitated by the 
enclosed rezoning is a massive improvement, and a welcome addition, to the Cambridge 
pedestrian environment. 

We note that we have every intention of including the GTS Site in our proposed project. 
Although the ability to move the GTS facilities is not entirely within our control, we have been 
working continuously with Eversource and others to reach agreements that are necessary for the 
exercise of our option to acquire the GTS Site and move its facilities to a non-residential 
location. However, some details remain to be worked out and, out of an abundance of caution, 
we have drafted the petition allowing for the possibility that the project might not include the 
GTS Site by providing for a more limited scope of improvements utilizing only Parcel C to 
advance the vision of a community arts facility on the ground floor of a mixed use building. 
While not our preference because its impact would be less transformative and enriching for the 
neighborhood, we believe it is a viable alternative project. 

D. Benefits. Our preferred proposed project, utilizing the GTS Site, will result in many 

benefits for the East Cambridge community, and the community close to PUD-CKD in 
particular. Those benefits, many of which will be memorialized in a commitment letter to be 
submitted to City Council, have an approximate value of at least Sixty Million Dollars 
($60,000,000), and include the following: 

 A commitment to use reasonable efforts to relocate the existing utility facilities 

from the GTS Site to a non-residential location. 

 An arts and culture component of 30,000 square feet, inclusive of a 250-300 seat 
state-of-the-art theater, if the GTS Site is included (and, in any event, arts and 
culture space of at least 15,000 square feet).
10,000 square feet of indoor all-season public space.

Practical  measures to support  a diverse,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  operatine
model  for the arts and culture component.
No new parking.
Use of best practices  for meeting  sustainability goals in areas  such  as energ).
emissions, water,  materials,  urban site reuse,  and landscaping.
No new  gas connection.

Our proposal  is the end result  of many  community  meetings  and public  presentations

with neighbors,  neighborhood  stakeholders, and with stakeholders  at City Hall, including  three
open  houses, multiple  meetings with an Arts Advisory Committee  comprised  of community  arts
advocates,  a public  survey,  and solicitations for public  comment  on presentation  boards  that we
displayed  at our open houses.  Key takeaways from  the public  process  included a focus on the
need for flexible performing  arts spaces  for small  and larger  productions,  community  arts  spaces
(such  as classrooms for leaming art and exhibit space),  public gathering  spaces  available  across
all four  seasons,  and relocating  the GTS facility away from  Third Street.  Our proposed zoning
overlay  text and map encourages  achievement  of these goals, with the publicly  accessible
facilities  within  and commanding  the lower  levels  of a unique  and beautiful  commercial  building
that will provide over an acre of new  landscaped  area (indoors and outdoors),  subject  to further
detailed  review by the Planning  Board  under the contemplated  special  permit process.

We  are excited to work with you in the formal  review process  for the zoning amendment
and again  upon  submission  of an application for a PUD-CDK  special  permit.  We  are committed
to East  Cambridge  and to doing all that we can to make Canal District Kendall  a shining  example
of the best of mixed-use  transit-oriented  development  for the 21st century.

Very truly  yours,

13.201

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 

Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use district that is 
comprised of high quality general and technical office and labs with diverse active 
commercial and community uses (including retail and restaurant uses, and arts and 
cultural uses), all of which promote, create corridors among, and enhance the existing 
open space network within and surrounding the district, and provide benefits to the 
surrounding community through community arts and publicly accessible interior 
gathering space. In particular, the district facilitates strengthening the public open 
space connections among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the 
Broad Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street. The PUD-CDK District creates incentives to 
(A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and culture facility that will further diversify the 
mix of uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade utility 
and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station on Third Street to 
enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street and provide an attractive 
connector corridor between the district and the East Cambridge neighborhood. The 
parcel on which the existing gas regulator/transfer station is located is referred to 
herein as the “Gas Transfer Station Parcel”. 

13.202

PUD-CDK Special Permit

13.202.1 Eligible Development Parcel. To further the purpose of this Section 13.200, an 

applicant may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the 
Planning Board approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel 
located within the PUD-CDK District that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK 
special permit, consists of at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the 
foregoing, the Final Development Plan for a currently vacant or undeveloped 
Development Parcel under this PUD-CDK overlay zoning shall include either an Arts 
and Culture Center or Community Arts Facility, as further provided in Section 
13.204.1(b) below. 

13.202.2 PUD-CDK Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-CDK 

special permit approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel upon 
finding that the Final Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, 
and all other criteria applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought. 

13.202.3 PUD-CDK Special Permit Requirements. Within the Development Parcel the 
locations of the open spaces, the quantities of proposed land uses, the building 
envelope, and heights shall be indicated in sufficient detail that the Planning Board 
can reasonably assess the impact of the PUD-CDK special permit and its general 
consistency with the PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 13.202.4 
below. At a minimum, a Development Proposal and subsequent Final Development 
Plan must contain the following components:  

(a) Site Development Plan: describing how the Development Parcel is divided 
into use areas and their development characteristics, including potential uses and 
Gross Floor Area.

Culture Center that may be required by Section 13.204.1(b) and strategies for 
programming and activating such spaces.  

(g) Sustainability and Resiliency Plan: describing: (1) how the sustainability 
requirements set forth in Section 13.206.2 below will be met; (2) how the proposed 
development will promote best practices for environmental sustainability and 
resiliency; and (3) how the proposed development serves nearby East Cambridge 
community-wide needs for emergency refuge or shelter during heat or storm 
emergencies in coordination with the Cambridge Climate Vulnerability Assessment 
dated February 2017.  

(h) Transportation Plan: incorporating: (1) a Traffic Study as required by Section 

19.20 of this Zoning Ordinance or a Transportation Assessment pursuant to Section 
13.205.2; (2) a shared parking study to demonstrate that the district’s parking supply 
can accommodate future anticipated demands at full build out; (3) a study of the 
impacts of increased demand on public transportation services in the East Cambridge 
area; (4) a description of the development’s relationship to future regional rail, bus, 
pedestrian/bicycle and other transportation system connections in the area; and (5) a 
Transportation Demand Management and Mitigation program describing measures 
which may be incorporated by the Planning Board into a condition of a PUD-CDK 
special permit to offset or mitigate the development’s impacts on transportation 
systems, including measures set forth in this Zoning Ordinance and the City’s 
planning efforts to be linked to milestones, thresholds or performance standards.

13.202.4 PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria. In approving a Final Development Plan, the 

Planning Board shall consider the following objectives with respect to any new Gross 
Floor Area or the construction of a new building:  

(a) If Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires a 
Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, such Community Arts 
Facility or Arts and Culture Center (i) takes into consideration the orientation of the 
uses, location of building entrances, pedestrian connectivity between such uses and 
adjacent open space areas, and the ability of such uses to promote diversity and serve 
all residents of the City of Cambridge; and (ii) creates a facility available for the 
neighborhood that supports or promotes small arts or theater organizations, 
independent artists, art co-working opportunities, or partnerships among the 
foregoing and the local community. Furthermore, the developer of such Community 
Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center shall have demonstrated a commitment to 
establishing an arts and culture operational plan for space within the new building 
that will be made available for teaching, learning, rehearsing, or idea exchange. 

(b) Contributes to the diversity of East Cambridge and Kendall Square through 

encouraging innovative uses, activities, programs, or opportunities that will be 
publicly accessible such as art galleries or community gathering spaces.

13.202.5 Condominium Property Regime. A developer may submit a building subject to PUD-
CDK to a condominium property regime. A violation of one or more conditions of a 
PUD-CDK special permit by one condominium unit owner (or its occupant) shall not 
be deemed to be a violation by another condominium unit owner (or its occupant). 

13.202.6 Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. A violation, with respect to an 

individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any 
provision of this Section 13.200 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any 
other individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel. A 
PUD-CDK special permit may specify that certain modifications to the Final 
Development Plan do not alter the concept of the PUD and such modifications shall 
be considered minor amendments under Section 12.37 of this Zoning Ordinance 
subject only to written approval of the Planning Board if the developer demonstrates 
that such modification(s): (i) constitute a reallocation or reconfiguration of Gross 
Floor Area among uses in the Final Development Plan or otherwise allowed in the 
PUD-CDK District, (ii) do not require a new type of zoning relief (other than the 
categories of relief previously granted for the proposed development project, whether 
by existing PUD special permits or otherwise), and (iii) maintain the same percentage 
of Minimum Open Space as approved by the PUD-CDK special permit. 

13.202.7 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a development proposal for a 

Development Parcel, the developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD 
Pre-Application Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site 
arrangement, building massing, and public space arrangement, as well as general 
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the Planning Board to 
provide the developer informal feedback prior to preparing the Final Development 
Plan materials. As set forth in Section 12.33.2 of this Zoning Ordinance, any 
statement made by the Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application 
Conference shall not be legally binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3 of this 
Zoning Ordinance, the developer shall present graphic and written materials as 
needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development alternatives.

increased to 250 feet if the proposed development project will abut and/or have 
frontage along at least 75 linear feet of Third Street or otherwise, at the developer’s 
option, provide an appropriate pedestrian corridor between the existing or planned 
open space in the PUD-CDK District and open space to the west of Third Street. In 
addition to the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its review of a special permit 
application under this Section 13.204.3, may except from the calculation of the height 
of buildings and structures in the PUD-CDK District chimneys, water towers, air 
conditioning equipment, ventilators, and other necessary features appurtenant to 
buildings which are otherwise typically carried above roofs and are not used for 
human occupancy, including mechanical floors within a building where for functional 
or aesthetic reasons such equipment, structures, or features are on above-grade levels 
of the building other than the roof level or above. 

13.204.4 Other Dimensional Requirements: There shall be no minimum lot area, no minimum 
lot width, no minimum frontage, and no minimum front, side or rear yard 
requirements for the Development Parcel or any lot within the PUD-CDK District. 
There shall be no minimum building setbacks or other minimum or maximum 
building dimensional requirements other than as provided by this Section 13.204. 

13.204.5 Open Space: Any Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK District shall 

demonstrate that, following completion of such development, there shall be not less 
than fifteen percent (15%) open space as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 in 
the PUD-CDK District except as modified below.  

13.204.5.1

13.204.5.2

The Planning Board, in its review of any special permit application for a 
development containing a Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, 
may consider indoor or covered pedestrian ways, decks, arcades, loggias, and 
gallerias appurtenant to the Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center, 
even if located on a different Development Parcel in the PUD-CDK District, to be 
open space provided that the same is publicly accessible during normal business 
hours. The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall make a finding that there is no net-loss of open space already existing within 
the PUD-CDK District (other than within any previously undeveloped or vacant 
Development Parcel). 

Open space, whether already existing within the PUD-CDK District or to be 
constructed by the developer or its affiliate, shall include, without limitation, the 
following: parks; plazas; lawns; landscaped areas substantially open to the sky; 
playgrounds; balconies; roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage; 
pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified 
by the Planning Board; and such other areas or spaces determined, or approved, 
by the Planning Board to be open space.   

13.204.6 Perimeter and Transition: Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an 
existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and 
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, 
height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-CDK District should 
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages 
between the Broad Canal and Kendall Square.

Parking and Loading Requirements.

13.205.1 Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the off-street 

Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as modified by 
this Section 13.205. 

13.205.2 Parking:  

13.205.2.1 Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements within the 
PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in approving a Final 
Development Plan may specify a minimum parking requirement based on review 
and analysis of Transportation Assessments and other relevant information on 
parking demand provided in application documents, and with the guidance of City 
agencies.  

13.205.2.2

13.205.2.3

13.205.2.4

13.205.2.5

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, shall 
make a finding that that the Final Development Plan provides adequate parking 
for the proposed uses and that the Final Development Plan does not substantially 
increase net-new off-street parking spaces within the PUD-CDK District. 

The parking requirements of this Section 13.205.2 may be satisfied (a) anywhere 
in the PUD-CDK District, or if located outside of the PUD-CDK District, within 
2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in part by an easement, lease 
agreement, occupancy agreement, license or other comparable legal instrument 
between the developer and the City, other public entity or private owner or 
consortium for use of parking spaces in the public or shared parking facilities 
within said area. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 6.000, this Zoning Ordinance 
shall not restrict the management and assignment of parking spaces in a way that 
will most efficiently utilize the existing and proposed parking spaces to serve all 
approved uses. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 19.20, the Planning Board 
may permit the Developer to substitute a Transportation Assessment in form and 
substance acceptable to the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department if the 
Planning Board otherwise determines that the materials submitted with the Final 
Development Plan adequately describe the impacts of traffic and parking on the 
area surrounding the Development Parcel.  

13.205.3 Loading: The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may 
waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities 
within the PUD-CDK District, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across 
various uses within the PUD-CDK District or the adjacent PUD-3 District. 

13.205.4 Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100 
of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the 
requirements in Section 6.100 may be modified by the Planning Board through its 
approval of a Final Development Plan.

13.206

Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to Development 
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK District.

13.206.1 Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s) shall remain 

13.206.2 Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District shall comply 

valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, all development 
projects constructed pursuant thereto and existing prior to the enactment date of this 
Section 13.200 for the PUD-CDK District, including without limitation with respect 
to rebuilding due to casualty. Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit 
shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-3 special permit, 
and the PUD-CDK zoning shall govern with respect to such additional rights, except 
however any rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit shall 
automatically supersede any undeveloped rights for the applicable development 
parcel as provided for under the PUD-3 zoning. Such undeveloped rights, and any 
associated outstanding obligations with respect to such rights, under a previously 
issued PUD-3 special permit shall be deemed automatically extinguished as of the 
date that the subsequent PUD-CDK special permit becomes valid and effective, and 
such automatic extinguishment shall be deemed to be a minor amendment of such 
previously issued special permit under PUD-3 under Section 12.37.2 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to the 
issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted hereunder and the provisions of 
such existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the PUD-CDK special 
permit, the provisions of the PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 

with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain documentation showing how the 
development at an aggregate level will comply with the requirements of Section 
22.20. The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the 
requirements of Section 22.20.  

The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development Proposal shall 
describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will incorporate a 
comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best practices for meeting 
sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero Action Plan, Climate Change 
Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and other sustainability plans and guidelines 
promulgated by the City at the time the Development Proposal is submitted. The 
conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be 
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall 
incorporate best practices in the following areas:  

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve building energy 
and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new 
building within the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for implementation 
of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may include rooftop 
solar pv) within the PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse gas 
emissions analysis for such new building and will implement energy efficiency

identified in such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial building 
shall include a study, prepared by the developer, considering the feasibility of 
connecting the proposed building to the existing district steam system, if available.

Re: Commitment Letter to accompany zoning amendment petition (the “PUD-CDK 

Zoning”) for PUD-CDK District (the “PUD-CDK District”)  

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance 
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey, 
and Zondervan: 

Following up on our July 9 re-submission of a petition to amend the City of Cambridge 
Zoning Code, we are pleased to enclose a proposed draft commitment letter that evidences our 
intent to move forward with specific public benefits we have described, more generally, in our 
pre-submission meetings with stakeholders in the community. If approved by the City Council in 
connection with the consideration of our petition, the letter will be executed and referenced in the 
final amendment.  

As you know, on March 13, 2020 we submitted a draft commitment letter in connection 
with the March 11, 2020 rezoning petition, which was withdrawn with our re-submission of the 
rezoning petition on July 9. The enclosed draft commitment letter is exactly the same as the 
March 13, 2020 draft commitment letter other than any revised dates or references to this re-
submission, as the case may be.

Re: Commitments and conditions accompanying the zoning amendment petition (the “PUD-

CDK Zoning”) for PUD-CDK District (the “PUD-CDK District”) attached as 
Attachment A 

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance 
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey, 
and Zondervan: 

The purpose of this letter is to describe commitments and benefits that BMR-Third LLC 
(“BMR”), a subsidiary of BioMed Realty, L.P., is prepared to offer the City of Cambridge to 
facilitate and enable BMR to develop and vitalize the vacant parcel at 585 Third Street (also 
known as “Parcel C”), and, potentially, the adjacent Eversource gas regulator/transfer station 
site at 330 Third Street (the “GTS Site”) through the construction of a new mixed-use building 
(collectively, the “Project”), subject to the satisfaction of the “Conditions” set forth below. 
Certain commitments specifically identified below are contingent upon our ability to include the 
GTS Site in our development plans (e.g., as further described in the paragraph lettered “A” 
below). 

Capitalized terms used, but not otherwise defined, herein shall have the meanings ascribed to 
them in Article 13.200 of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. 

BMR’s Commitments 

A. Relocating GTS Facilities and Related Utility Infrastructure. BMR agrees that it will use 
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) reach agreement with Eversource Energy and the 
owner of another non-residential property in the area to relocate the gas regulator/transfer

station located at the GTS Site and related utility infrastructure (collectively, the “GTS 
Facilities”) to an appropriate location for utility equipment and facilities that is reasonably 
acceptable to BMR, Eversource, and the City of Cambridge Community Development 
Department and (ii) commence, or cause to be commenced, activities necessary to facilitate 
such relocation following the day that PUD-CDK Zoning becomes effective beyond 
applicable appeals periods (and in any event prior to obtaining the first building permit for 
the Project), at BMR’s cost. If despite such reasonable efforts BMR is unable to cause the 
relocation of the GTS Facilities, BMR may elect to pursue permits and approvals for a 
Project located on Parcel C without the GTS Site. 

B. Arts and Culture Component. BMR agrees that no later than the issuance of the final 

certificate of occupancy for the Project it shall develop a comprehensive, sustainable, and 
inclusive arts and culture program for the Project and associated open space areas, which 
program shall benefit Cambridge as a whole and include (1) an Arts and Culture Center (as 
defined in the proposed zoning amendment) consisting of approximately 30,000 square feet 
of space, if the GTS Site is included in the Project, or a Community Arts Facility (as defined 
in the proposed zoning amendment) of approximately 15,000 square feet of space if the GTS 
Site is not included, (2) the establishment of an Arts Advisory Committee that will meet at 
least twice a year to assist with programing, planning implementation, and developing an 
operating plan for arts and culture events and attracting users to the applicable facility, (3) 
operational support of arts and culture activities within the applicable areas of the Project by 
a non-profit organization (the “Operating Entity”), (4) the design and installation of 
additional public art within the open space areas of the PUD-CDK District to enhance the 
pedestrian connection between Third Street, the Broad Canal, and Termeer Square, and (5) 
an operational system that facilitates coordination with the local arts community to identify 
opportunities for local artists to perform, display and/or sell their work at or within the 
vicinity of the Project, each as further described below where applicable.  

(i) Theater/Performance Spaces. If BMR is able to include the GTS Site in the Project, 
BMR agrees that upon the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy it shall provide a 
significant performance space containing approximately 250-300 seats within the Project 
(the “Theater”) as part of the Arts and Culture Center referenced above. The Theater 
space will be delivered fully fitted and equipped with appropriate seating, stage, sound, 
and lighting technology to support a variety of performances, and will include supporting 
facilities such as rehearsal space, studios, meeting space, offices, lobbies, and storage 
areas (“Supporting Facilities”). If, despite its reasonable efforts, BMR is not able to 
include the GTS Site in the Project, then the Project will contain smaller performance 
spaces with more limited Supporting Facilities within the Community Arts Facility 
referenced above. In any event, the operational model of the performance space, in either 
scenario, shall be formulated by the Operating Entity in a manner that suits the needs of 
local residents, community groups, small businesses, and performing arts groups.  

Certain Supporting Facilities, such as rehearsal space, studies, and meeting space, will be 
made available when not otherwise in use for Theater or other performances in the 
Project, at subsidized rates, to local residents, community groups, small businesses, and 
arts groups for events and activities at the Project.

(ii) Public Space. BMR agrees that upon issuance of the final certificate of occupancy 
for the Project it shall provide approximately 10,000 square feet of interior public space 
within the Project (“Public Space”) (which is in addition to the Arts and Culture Center 
or Community Arts Facility space, as applicable, noted above), and BMR shall provide 
the basis for the Project to accommodate a variety of programmed educational, civic, 
performance, and cultural experiences coordinated by the Operating Entity throughout 
the year. Such experiences may include fundraisers for non-profits, indoor performances 
by street performers, a winter market (as further described below), educational activities, 
cultural activities, and similar events. Portions of the Public Space shall be available at 
subsidized rates to local residents, community groups, small businesses, and arts groups 
for events and activities. If BMR is able to include the GTS Site in the Project, such 
Public Space shall span the length of the building to facilitate an all-weather pedestrian 
connection from the west end of the site to Termeer Square and encourage the 
community to experience the activities available to them in the PUD-CDK District.

(iii) Exhibit Area. BMR agrees that upon issuance of the final certificate of occupancy 
for the Project it shall provide an exhibit area for community-sourced art within the 
Public Space, to be administered by the Operating Entity. 

(iv) Public Arts. BMR agrees to install a second mural by a local artist on the vent shaft 
located along Broad Canal Way, and to seek opportunities to further incorporate the work 
of local artists into the open spaces described below.  

(v) Access to the Arts. BMR will work with the Arts Advisory Committee and the 
Operating Entity to establish a Diversity and Inclusion Outreach Program for the 
performance spaces and Public Space. In addition, BMR will ensure that a minimum of 
two performances each year in the performance spaces are made free to Cambridge 
residents. 

(vi) Operational Support. BMR will provide operational support via the Operating 
Entity to encourage a diverse, inclusive, and sustainable operating model for the 
applicable arts programs at the Project. BMR specifically agrees that the operator of the 
performance space shall not be required to pay for any share of the landlord’s costs 
attributable to real estate taxes or site-wide maintenance. 

(vii) Executive Director. BMR agrees to provide up to $500,000 towards the salary and 
benefits of an executive director retained by the Operating Entity to support the initial 
establishment of a sustainable operating model. 

C. Additional Open Space Within the PUD-CDK District. BMR agrees that, on or before 
the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy for the Project, and provided that the 
Project includes the GTS Site, it shall cause a portion of Parcel C and the GTS Site located 
outside of the building footprint, and proximate to existing open space and pedestrian areas, 
to be designed as landscaped open space. 

D. Enhancement to Community Benefits in PUD-CDK District. For the first 20 years 
following adoption of the PUD-CDK zoning, BMR will provide 100 free canoe and

kayaking tickets per year for local youth from the Broad Canal boat rental station and 100 
free ice skating tickets (including skate rentals) per year for local youth at the ice skating 
rink located within the PUD-CDK District through local youth-focused organizations (in 
addition to the free group rentals for school groups and discounted rates already available at 
the facility). Similarly, local non-profits will be given the opportunity to use the ice skating 
facility for special events at no charge, on a schedule determined by BMR to avoid high use 
periods by the general public. In addition, BMR agrees that it shall host community 
engagement events in or within the vicinity of the PUD-CDK District on a regular basis, 
which events or programming shall be held at such time(s) and locations as BMR may 
determine and shall be open to members of the general public.  

E. Annual Winter Market. BMR agrees to host an annual winter market event with artisans, 
food vendors, and music. The winter market will be a minimum of one day in length with 
opportunities for vendors to sell goods in the Public Space of the Arts and Culture Center, if 
applicable, throughout the winter season. Market opportunities will be advertised throughout 
Cambridge and vendor selection will give priority to Cambridge and local artisans.  

F. No New Parking. BMR agrees to further the planning goals of the City of Cambridge by 
not constructing any new parking as part of the Project and taking advantage of shared 
parking at existing parking facilities within the PUD-CDK District. Furthermore, in the 
interest of making all components of the Arts and Culture Center or Community Arts 
Facility, as applicable, inclusive, BMR agrees that parking for events at such facilities 
outside of normal business hours (i.e., other than 8 a.m.-6 p.m., Monday-Friday) shall be 
heavily subsidized for users identified through a coordinated effort with local community 
groups.  

G. Sustainability. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 13.200 of the proposed zoning 
amendment, BMR agrees that the Project will incorporate best practices for meeting 
sustainability goals in areas such as energy, emissions, water, materials, urban site reuse and 
landscaping. BMR proposes a comprehensive design approach to meet such goals, including 
through implementation of the following measures: 

(i) Adoption of energy conservation strategies. For example, core and shell of the Project 
will meet the LEED framework requirements at the Gold level or better, with an 
emphasis on overall energy (including fossil fuels) and water reduction; and 

(ii) Reduction of carbon emissions by eliminating fossil fuel fired equipment as is 
feasible and reducing total energy required, including through use of steam as an energy 
source and the incorporation of the following to the maximum extent practicable: high 
efficiency building systems; improved building envelope with reduced air infiltration; 
and lighting reduction through usage of LED and smart lighting controls. 

H. Setbacks/Stepbacks. To the extent that the Project has frontage on Third Street it will not 

exceed 85 feet in height within 10 feet of the property line nearest Third Street.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, BMR’s commitments set forth above 
are offered only if the following conditions (the “Conditions”) are met: 

1. The amendments to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance set forth in Attachment A are duly 
adopted in the form attached hereto as Attachment A, and no challenge to the validity of 
the same shall have been made (or in the event of any challenge, such challenge shall 
have been finally resolved in favor of such validity). 

2. With regard to any commitments outstanding as of the date that BMR applies for PUD 

and/or Article 19 Special Permits for the Project, BMR shall have received such Special 
Permits, including, without limitation, PUD Special Permits and Article 19 Special 
Permits, from the City of Cambridge Planning Board, and such other permits and 
approvals as may be necessary to allow for the build-out of the maximum Gross Floor 
Area contemplated for the Project site by and in accordance with the attached PUD-CDK 
Zoning, and no challenge to the validity of any such permits or approvals shall have been 
made (or in the event of any challenge, such challenge shall have been finally resolved in 
favor of such validity) and a building permit for the Project shall have been issued. 

In addition to meeting the requirements and conditions of any required permits or approval for 
the Project (and the payment of any and all fees associated with the issuance of such permits or 
approvals), BMR is making these commitments and providing the other mitigation referenced 
above to the City to provide the City with resources to mitigate impacts that might result from 
the Project as a result of the rezoning and any special permit issued under PUD-CDK Zoning.

EF Education First, 2 Education Circle, Cambridge6/18/20 

 
Cambridge City Council 
City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Avenue 
Cambridge, MA  02139 
 
RE: DCR Curb Cut Permit Application, 11 Education Street 
 
Members of the City Council, 
 
The purpose of this letter is to provide some additional information and context for this request 
to augment our curb cut permit application. 
 
The Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) is nearing completion of its new 
maintenance facility in North Point.  The DCR North Point Maintenance Facility is a 35,000 
square foot building, service yard, and fueling station on a four-acre parcel in the North Point 
area of Cambridge. This facility will serve as the primary operations center for DCR in the 
Greater Cambridge and Boston Region. Among the many responsibilities of DCR is the safety, 
maintenance, and repairs of parklands and parkways, such as Memorial Drive, Alewife Brook 
Parkway, Land Boulevard, and Fresh Pond Parkway.  Our largest special events, such as the July 
4 Boston Pops concert and fireworks display, will be based from the North Point facility. 
 
Cambridge DPW and TP+TD staff have generously given their time to assist us with this 
request, which presents a unique design challenge.  At the end of the facility’s service driveway, 
there is a 9” mature little leaf linden.  Our preferred driveway proposal was to extend the 
driveway directly to North Point Boulevard, remove the tree, and construct a traditional curb cut 
perpendicular to the curb line. 
 
City staff expressed a strong desire to retain the tree.  DCR staff met with Cambridge several 
times – once at 147 Hampshire Street and twice on site – to brainstorm how to build the 
driveway around the tree.   
 
To the right of the tree, part of the relocated driveway would need to pass through the MWRA 
Prison Point property.  On the left, a street light pole and a catch basin would need to be 
relocated.  On either side, the driveway would need to be angled to keep it clear of the tree. 
 
As a result of this collaboration between DCR and the City, we agreed to alter the driveway 
alignment to save the tree.  Although an angled driveway layout is unusual, we concluded that it 
would adequately serve the needs of the maintenance facility and the Operations vehicles that 
will use it.

Again, we are very grateful that Cambridge staff have worked with us on this request.  We 
appreciate the collaboration that we feel it has resulted in a solution that allows us to open and 
operate from our new facility while saving the little leaf linden. 
 
Here are a few additional notes on this request: 
 

•  The North Point Maintenance Facility does have an additional egress onto Education 
Street, but that entrance is intended for visitors and passenger cars.  The North Point 
Boulevard access is much closer to the operations vehicle storage and service and 
materials storage and is designed to accommodate larger vehicles. 

•  The driveway is on state land and not subject to Cambridge zoning regulations 
•  Except for EF Education First, the maintenance facility abutters are also state agencies 

(MBTA and MWRA). 

 
 
Sincerely,

A Neighborhood Organization for the Betterment of East Cambridge 

 

July 21, 2020 

Cambridge City Council 
Cambridge City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Avenue, 2nd Floor 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
      RE: Proposed Curb Cut at 11 Education Street (Application 77480)  
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-
Wheeler, Toomey, and Zondervan: 
 
The East Cambridge Planning Team (ECPT) Board voted to approve the proposed curb cut at 11 
Education Street at its July 15, 2020 meeting. The approval is based on the revised plan below that saves 
the 9” caliper Little Leave Linden tree, which was to be removed in the original application. 
 

We would like to thank City Engineer Kathy Watkins for her efforts in saving the tree. 
 

 

Very truly yours, 
 
 
 
Charles T. Hinds 
President, ECPT

ECPT General Policy 
Curb Cuts 
Adopted February 5, 2020 

 
ECPT has adopted a general position of not supporting curb cuts for a single parking space as they: 

  Encourage car use, which city policy discourages 
  Privatize public space, the related sidewalk and street space 
  Remove public street parking 
  Frequently reduce private open/green space, which is at a premium in our very dense 

neighborhood, by turning it into paved space for a driveway and parking  

  Pose threats to public and private trees, by cutting them down to make way for driveways and/or 

parking spaces or by severely damaging their roots, which often results in the tree being razed for 
public safety 

 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 

Example of privatization of parking spaces. Owners park in street and use 
garages for storage space. The curb cut does not get cars off the street and adds 
to congestion on street cleaning days. Tickets are not given for cars parked at 
curb cuts unless requested by the owner.

Jeya Niranjan 
Supervising Engineer 
Cambridge Department of Public Works 
147 Hampshire Street 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
RE:  Curb Cut Application 
10 Acorn Park Drive 
 
 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 
 
 
Dear Mr. Niranjan: 
 
On behalf of SXC Alewife Hotel, LLC, BSC Group has completed the City of Cambridge’s 
online application for a curb cut at 10 Acorn Park Drive to service the AC Marriott Hotel.  
The AC Hotel is located within the Cambridge Discovery Park development and currently 
has access from Discovery Way, a private way, running parallel to Acorn Park Drive. 
 
The proposed curb cut and driveway have been designed to provide one-way only access 
from Acorn Park Drive in accordance with the City of Cambridge requirements and the 
comments communicated at our site meetings in order to improve site access for hotel guests 
and deliveries, and to provide improved emergency vehicle access to the Hotel.   
 
Visitors to the Hotel exiting Route 2 via the Alewife Station Access Road currently travel 
along Acorn Park Drive to Discovery Way in order to access the Hotel.  The proposed drive 
will have improved wayfinding and access to the Hotel by providing direct access to the 
Hotel from Acorn Park Drive, including for ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency 
vehicles.   
 
We are available to discuss further at your convenience anytime.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact our office with any questions or inquiries you may have.  I can be reached at 
dbiancavilla@bscgroup.com or at 617-896-4347 or my cell phone:  978-857-0513. 
 
 
Very truly yours, 
BSC Group, Inc.

RE:  Nitsch Project #9799.1 

40 Thorndike Street 
Curb Cut Closures/Openings 
 

 
 
 
 
March 27, 2020 
 
 
Cambridge Inspectional Services Department 
831 Massachusetts Avenue 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139 
 
To Whom It May Concern, 
 
Nitsch Engineering is submitting the attached revised curb cut plot plans to supplement the curb cut 
application package being resubmitted by Legatt McCall Properties for the proposed improvements at 40 
Thorndike Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  
 
The proposed project consists of renovating and repurposing the former Edward J. Sullivan Court House, 
which received a Special Permit from the Cambridge Planning Board in October 2014. This redevelopment 
will result in a mixed-use building consisting of office space, residential units, ground-level retail, and open 
space.  
 
The key change to the drawings is that the previous two (2) loading dock curb cuts of 20 feet each on 
Second Street are being combined into a single 30-foot curb cut, per feedback from the Traffic, Planning, and 
Transporation (TPT) Department and the Department of Public Works (DPW). 
 
This change is reflected on the attached revised drawings CC-0 and CC-2 (combining what was previously 
CC-2 and CC-3). Drawing CC-1 remains the same aside from some grading adjustments to accommodate 
the curb cut change at the loading dock.  
 
Please reference the attached plot plans.  
 
 
If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to call me at 617-504-5536.

November 19, 2019 
 
 
Cambridge Inspectional Services Department

Cambridge, Massachusetts  02139 
 
To whom it may concern, 
 
Nitsch Engineering is submitting the attached curb cut plot plans to supplement the curb cut application 
package being submitted by Legatt McCall Properties for the proposed improvements at 40 Thorndike Street 
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
 
The proposed project consists of renovating and repurposing the former Edward J. Sullivan Court House, 
which received a Special Permit from the Cambridge Planning Board in October 2014.  This redevelopment 
will result in a mixed-use building consisting of office space, residential units, ground-level retail, and open 
space.   
 
As part of the proposed improvements, two (2) existing curb cut closures are proposed.  The curb cut on 
Second Street is approximately 24.8 feet in width and the curb cut on Third Street is approximately 20.0 feet 
in width. 
 
Three (3) new curb openings are proposed along Second Street.  The lot frontage on Second Street is 
201.63 feet.  One (1) curb opening will be 22.0 feet in width and two (2) curb openings will be 20.0 feet in 
width.  The 22.0-foot curb opening will service the two-level underground parking garage that proposes a 
total of 92 parking spaces pursuant to Special Permit 288.  The two (2) 20.0-foot curb openings will service 
the proposed building loading dock area and compactor.  Each new curb cut will be constructed to meet the 
City of Cambridge standards. 
 
Please reference the attached plot plans.  These plans have been circulated to abutting properties for review 
and approval. 
 
If you have any questions or need additional information, please feel free to call me direct at 857-206-8673.

July 26, 2020 

Cambridge City Council 
Cambridge City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Avenue, 2nd Floor 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
      RE: Proposed Curb Cut at 40 Thorndike Street (Application #60903)  
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-
Wheeler, Toomey, and Zondervan: 
 
The East Cambridge Planning Team (ECPT) Board voted to approve the proposed curb cut at 40 
Thorndike Street at its July 15, 2020 meeting.  
 
As part of this approval, the Board requests that traffic flow from 40 Thorndike be directed east of Third 
Street toward First Street and Land Boulevard, away from the center of the neighborhood (see attached 
map). First Street is planned to be connected directly to Msg. O’Brien Highway as part of the Green Line 
Extension project before the 40 Thorndike Street project is completed. Therefore travel on Third Street to 
reach the highway is no longer necessary. We believe this proposed traffic flow will mitigate the effect of 
the traffic generated by the building by diverting it away from the residential core of the neighborhood. 
 

Very truly yours, 
 
 
 
Charles T. Hinds 
President, ECPT 

cc: Anthony I. Wilson, City Clerk, clerk@cambridgema.gov

ECPT General Policy 
Curb Cuts 
Adopted February 5, 2020 

 
ECPT has adopted a general position of not supporting curb cuts for a single parking space as they: 

  Encourage car use, which city policy discourages 
  Privatize public space, the related sidewalk and street space 
  Remove public street parking 
  Frequently reduce private open/green space, which is at a premium in our very dense 

neighborhood, by turning it into paved space for a driveway and parking  

  Pose threats to public and private trees, by cutting them down to make way for driveways and/or 

parking spaces or by severely damaging their roots, which often results in the tree being razed for 
public safety 

Example of privatization of parking spaces. Owners park in street and use 
garages for storage space. The curb cut does not get cars off the street and adds 
to congestion on street cleaning days. Tickets are not given for cars parked at 
curb cuts unless requested by the owner.

Public Comment in Support of H.3924

I missed yesterday's meeting, but in case it's still possible to add my comment to the record, I just wanted to 
extend my strongest support for the City Council to back H.3924 - "An Act enabling local options for tenant 
protections."

As I'm sure you know, the bill has been gathering momentum at the state house and it would do a world of 
good for residents in Cambridge and other cities. The bill provides cities with a range of local options that they 
could pursue to combat the current housing crisis.

One of the great things about the bill is how it doesn't force anything on municipalities -- it would give the City 
Council the flexibility to pursue measures like eviction protections and rent regulation that currently are banned 
by state law. A number of the provisions -- like just cause eviction -- would do a world of good for helping 
families stay in their homes and neighborhoods. But again, all the bill does is give localities options which I 
think is smart given the engagement about housing issues (from all perspectives) that happen here in 
Cambridge.

I urge the City Council to back this bill unanimously, sending a strong message to our state reps to get it 
passed and give cities more options for fighting homelessness, housing cost increases, and displacement.

Best,

Potentially confusing messaging about mask adherence from the City of Cambridge

Dear Chief Health Officer Jacob, Mayor Siddiqui, Vice-Mayor Mallon, and Cambridge City councillors,

I'm a Cambridge resident and CPSD parent. I'm also an education/social science researcher and educator (not a school 
teacher).

I've been increasingly concerned about what I interpret to be inconsistent and confusing messaging about mask-wearing 
coming from the City of Cambridge, and wanted to bring it to your attention. In my unscientific observation during 
neighborhood walks (Wellington-Harrington & East Cambridge, home to some of the highest COVID-case rates [tested] in 
the city) over the past two weeks, I have counted a pronounced increase in the number of "unmasked" people outdoors who 
are not always maintaining distance. Indeed, our children have been noticing and remarking on this, too! I am unable to 
comment directly about what is happening in indoor public places like grocery stores as I have not personally visited any for a 
while, but friends tell me this phenomenon is apparent in those locations as well.  

As an analogy, speed limits work because they are clear and consistent. But if the speed limit is merely a suggestion, or only 
relevant during some times and not others, or up to personal choice, you can imagine how compliance might change. Below 
my signature is a sampling of language from messages sent by the City over the past few days via your COVID-19 daily alert 
emails (with apologies for the lengthy copy-and-paste).

As we launch into planning for the new school year, this type of messaging becomes all the more important: kids (who are not 
likely to be very compliant in general) may respond best to clear and consistent messages and structures.

I recognize you're trying to stay flexible and responsive to evolving trends in infection rates, and to differing levels of risk 
tolerance among residents. I'd like to call for clearer and more consistent messaging about adherence to mask wearing (and all 
of the other protective practices) so we continue to keep transmission at low levels.

Thank you for your time, and for your efforts thus far.
Sincerely,
Seeta Pai
(CC to Jill Crittenden who I have observed to be a resident-leader in mask science and advocacy.)

EXTRACTS FROM CITY ALERTS:
July 6: "Wearing masks and face coverings are a critical preventive measure, particularly in situations where 
physical distancing is difficult. The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Public Health Department understand that 
wearing masks or cloth face coverings may not be possible in every situation or for some people, especially during 
the summer months." [Followed by "safety tips"]

July 3: "While many Cambridge residents have been taking seriously all advisories to wear face masks, there are 
residents who continue to walk, bike, and run throughout the city without proper face coverings. There is data that 
suggests that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

Wearing a face covering may help people who are asymptomatic (they never experience symptoms) or 
presymptomatic (that is, they may have the virus yet don’t show any symptoms) from transmitting COVID-19 to 
others. Most non-medical face coverings are not intended to protect the wearer from getting sick.

It is vitally important to remember that a face covering does not replace frequent handwashing, avoiding touching 
the face or mask exterior, staying 6 feet from others when outside, and staying away from people who are ill. These 
are the most important and effective steps you can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Face Coverings are required in the City of Cambridge (with limited exceptions), and may only 
be temporarily removed outdoors when a physical distance of at least six (6) feet from others can be 
maintained at all times. "

June 27: "The City has amended the Emergency Order requiring face coverings. During the summer months (until 
midnight on September 22, 2020) masks or cloth face coverings may be temporarily removed when outdoors when 
a physical distance of at least six (6) feet from others can be maintained at all times."

I support Bill H.3924

I have been a Cambridge resident and taxpayer since 1977 - a renter for the first 15 
years, then a homeowner. I fully support H.3924, filed by State Rep Mike Connolly and 
State Rep Nika Elugardo, which would repeal the 1994 ban on rent control and give 
municipalities more power to protect renters of all kinds.

support for PO 163/pls consider piloting in DHSP preschools

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Cambridge City councillors,
I was very pleased to learn PO 163 passed last week! I hope this exploration proves successful and that Cambridge is 
able to offer comprehensive testing in the school community.

I am writing again to ask if you would consider piloting this testing initiative at DHSP preschools. I am a DHSP preschool 
parent and just learned they are potentially opening on August 3. Conducting testing of staff and students would allow 
the City to learn how one might scale this testing in CPS in Sept and beyond; and allow the City to assess transmission in 
a school environment. This could provide valuable information in gearing up for school opening in Sept.

Many thanks, Amanda  
Parent at MLK Preschool (Amigos incoming)

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Cambridge City councillors,

I am writing in strong support of Policy Order #163, to support availability of SARS-Co-V2 testing in the Cambridge 
community and schools.

I feel very strongly that widespread availability of viral testing is critical to preventing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in 
our community. Public health education, free and easily available testing, and a plan for what to do with these data at 
the school-level, will hopefully keep the spread of covid19 to a minimum in our community.

Testing is key to reduce transmission in schools and to limit school closures. With easily available testing combined with 
sound policies, early identification of SARS-CoV-2 cases in schools will allow the school administration and health 
experts to respond immediately. Moreover, potentially exposed individuals can be informed, and school areas 
sanitized, prior to spread, thereby reducing the likelihood that entire schools or districts need to be closed. Data so far 
indicate that transmission is higher among adults and young adults, suggesting that regular and repeated testing should 
be focused on staff and other adult workers in the primary schools, and on both students and staff in the high school.

DHSP opening/serving families most in need

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Cambridge City Councillors, you might be aware that DHSP preschools are considering opening 
Aug 3. This opening is very welcome.

Our preschool forwarded the below email from director Meghan White about the potential opening schedule.

I am writing about what I think is the mission of DHSP -- to serve the Cambridge community, especially families who do 
not have access to high-quality early childhood care. (Please correct me if I have the mission wrong!) With that in mind, I 
hope the City reconsider who they are offering care to. We are in a crisis and many low-income families despirately need 
this care. I am concerned that the 2d/week option will favor higher-income families (like mine) at the expense of the 
families most in need. I worry that if many schools open for families only 2d/week, the most vulnerable families will be 
shut out because they need more care.

I hope you consider serving the families most in need first. To me that would mean prioritizing low-income families and 
offering them the 4d/week option (and not offering the 2d/week option to anyone unless there is low demand for the 
4d/week option). It would mean that some higher-income families would be left out but I think this is only equitable 
(maybe not equally fair) in this crisis.

The 4d/week model would also be more protective to teachers as they would be exposed to a smaller number of 
families.

(I have also written to Meghan about this.)

Dear DHSP Preschool families,

I hope that this letter finds you safe and healthy. I am writing to follow up on my last update from June 11th.  Since I last 
communicated with you, we have been working hard with the Department of Early Education and Care (EEC), DHSP 
leadership, the Preschool staff, and outside consultants to reopen our programs safely and as quickly as possible.

I am happy to report that we are still on track to open in August! We still have a number of things to complete and have 
approved by the EEC, but I am very hopeful that we will be back in programs in August.

The EEC has set the maximum number of children per classroom at 10 children. For programs that have 10 children or 
less returning (including the children who will be starting in September), we will be able to offer 4 days of care per 
week (Monday – Thursday) from 8:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. For programs that have 10 children or more returning (including 
the children starting in September), we will be able to offer 2 days of care per week (either Monday and Tuesday or 
Thursday and Friday) from 8:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. I recognize that the modified schedules for our programs are not ideal 
for working families. Based on the program and staffing requirements set by the EEC, this is the best way for us to be

able to meet these requirements in order to open our programs at all. We will continue to stay on top of changes made 
to program requirements and we will return to full week, full day care when we are able to safely do so.

In order to help with our planning, we need to have a clear idea of which children will be returning in August. Preschool 
Directors will be reaching out to you soon to learn about your plans to return in August. Once the Directors have a 
clearer understanding of who is returning to their programs, we will be able to communicate with you whether your 
child will have a 2 day or a 4 day seat in their classroom.

As we work with EEC and our staff on our planning, I will continue to share more information with you, including any 
changes to our reopening timeline. I plan to be in touch with another update the week of July 20th.

Thank you for implementing shared streets. I have worried about how I would get to work once I return to

gotten concussions. But now I think I can safely find my way to Boston.

Support for the affordable housing overlay

My name is Masato Kocberber, and I am a Cambridge resident living on Pleasant St in Cambridgeport. I am writing in 
support of the affordable housing overlay, and the construction of more housing in Cambridge more generally.

For me, this is the number one issue facing our city. I view the city as a place that strives to be ever improving, and the 
opportunities that are provided by living here should be extended to as many people as possible.

The rising cost of housing in the city has made living here unaffordable to the many people who contribute to 
Cambridge. The affordable housing overlay will end exclusionary zoning and open up more of city to new neighbors who 
will add to the vibrancy of our community.

Thank you for your time,
Masato Kocberber

Support for voting the bike ordinance out of committee to the full council

I am writing as a resident of Cambridge to voice my support for moving the bike network update ordinance out of 
committee. I have been riding bikes with my 4 and 2 year old children even more since the Pandemic and as a resident 
living on Magazine street have been excited to see the trial of community/slow/shared streets in our neighborhood and 
city. This is a great time to accelerate our bike network plan to build the network with simple, inexpensive, quickly 
added materials now to pave the way and reap many of the benefits of the more permanent version sooner. 

This action would help us as a city take another step toward our climate goals, our vision zero goals, and now with the 
presence of COVID-19 the goals of providing outside space for people to socially distance. We need to be bold in our 
actions if we are to reduce car ownership, vehicle miles traveled, and all of the other negative effects of our fossil fuel 
focused infrastructure. We know that the pollution and death that cars cause disproportionately affect the Black, 
Indigenous and People of Color in our community and beyond. This action can be but a small piece of our collective work 
to dismantle racist policies and create a more equitable city.

Thank you for your attention and hard work,

Dear City Counselors,

City workers heading back into offices

I just heard that the city is bringing non-essential workers back to work in the city offices. As a life long 
member of the community and a parent of kids in two Cambridge public schools (where lots of city 
employees send their kids too) , I am concerned we are adding unnecessary risk of spreading covid. 
Cambridge counts are down now, which is such a relief, but that could change quickly if we all hop on the 
T and spend the day in an office.

My own office in Boston has committed to not reopening until January 2020 because we can all work from 
home effectively. I see the city manager gave similar advice to offices in Cambridge, but isn't actually 
following his own advice now:

Louis A. DePasquale wrote:

"I would greatly appreciate it if you would follow the City’s lead and delay returning non-essential workers 
to your physical locations until at least June 1 and even after that, allowing those workers who can 
effectively work remotely to continue to do so."

https://www.cambridgema.gov/-
/media/Files/citymanagersoffice/COVID19/cambridgebuisnessletter_05202020.pdf

Is there anything city council can do to delay this at least for workers who don't have essential or public 
facing jobs? The last thing we need is higher infection rate as we head into the school year and flu 
season.  

Thank you,

Miranda Pearce

AHO concerns

I support the Cambridge Residents Alliance on the following requested changes:

 To reduce racial inequities caused by past redlining practices, require that at least 

1.
20% of the units completed using the AHO be homeownership units. (Supported by 
Planning Board in 2019.)

 Affordable Housing built using the Overlay must follow the Tree Protection 

3.
Ordinance preventing removal of larger trees until the Tree Protection Ordinance is 
revised (currently AH is exempt from tree protection). The 2019 Council agreed to protect 
larger trees, but that language was removed in the 2020 version. (Section 11.207.7.6c)

 In addition to a required 7.5’ setback from the lot line, there should be a minimum 
4.
10’ setback from any existing adjacent residential buildings. (Idea that Councilor Carlone 
proposed in 2019.) (Section 11.207.5.2.3c)

   Establish a guiding document with goals on income levels served, types of sites, 

5.
proximity to public open space and transit, 20% ownership units, 20% family sized units, 
geographic distribution of housing, and increase in % of affordable housing in areas with 
low amounts. Require Council and Planning Board review the goals in the guiding 
document every five years.

 In the required annual review, in addition to the items currently mentioned in the 

6.
ordinance, add resident demographics and income levels.

7.
 In the required 5 year progress review, add analysis of problems/successes 
encountered, #s of existing buildings demolished, what happened to displaced tenants, 
trees removed and added, demographics of residents, income levels served, types of 
sites, proximity to public open space and transit, provisions of 20% ownership units.

Thank you listening to the concerns of the citizens of Cambridge.

Public Comment Rules and Operations Committee, Cambridge City Council July 22 2020 
2pm

Please see and include for the official record my Public Comment before the Rules and Operations 
Committee, of the Cambridge City Council on July 22 2020 at 2pm.

"My name is Kim Courtney and I am an attorney, and the co-owner of UpperWest with Xavier 
Dietrich.

The people have the right to provide public comment, and attend public meetings, anonymously.

The U.S. Supreme Court in Talley v. California recognized these rights in 1960, yet this City Council 
still has not gotten the memo.

The Supreme Court confirmed our rights under the 1st and 14th Amendments to the Constitution of 
Freedom of Speech, and Freedom to Petition the Government, among others.

Our Massachusetts Declaration of Rights reiterates those rights.

The Cambridge City Council rules and practices requiring public speakers to provide identifying 
information like their name and address violates their constitutional rights to free speech.

The Cambridge City Council rules and practices blocking the public from criticizing the performance 
of our public officials' duties is a violation of their constitutional rights to petition the government.

Councillor Simmons mentioned the need for a refresher for the Councillors on Robert's Rules, but I 
think they also need a refresher on the Constitution.

I ask this Council to cease these constitutional violations.

Thank you."

Public Comment Rules and Operations Committee, Cambridge City Council July 22 2020 
2pm

Please see and include for the official record my Public Comment before the Rules and Operations Committee, of the 
Cambridge City Council on July 22 2020 at 2pm.

Hi, Xavier Dietrich, one of the owners of UpperWest along with Kim Courtney.

Rule 38 8. Every person addressing the City Council shall ... state the person’s name and address in an audible tone of 
voice for the record.

It should be obvious to everyone here that the Council is not allowed to make rules that violate the First Amendment to 
the U.S. Constitution, yet here we are. 

The First Amendment protects the people's right "to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." That is the 
right to make a complaint to, or seek the assistance of, one's government, without fear of punishment or reprisals. The 
right to do this anonymously is also well established and for obvious reasons. For example, if one is required or even 
asked to reveal their identity and other personal information when speaking critically about the Government (remember 
we are petitioning for a redress of grievances here) then it would not be unreasonable for that person to have a fear of 
punishment, reprisals, or retaliation. I have personally witnessed this.

In order to sign up for public comment today I had to enter my full name, email address, address, and phone number as 
required fields. Why is that? Why was I not asked for the last four digits of my social security number? Mother's 
maiden name? Name of first pet?

In short, stop asking for this information, even asking for it is problematic as you are now putting the speaker in the 
position of "refusing to obey the orders of the presiding officer", see Rule 38.1. 

Make it clear this information is NOT required.

Rule 32B & Rule 38.6 Speakers shall not engage in personal or rude remarks. For example, saying that Police 
Commissioner Branville Bard is doing a terrible job and should be fired in a meeting where the Use of Force document is 
being discussed and he is the author of that document is not a personal nor a rude remark. It is protected speech and 
any Councilor that thinks otherwise is misinformed at best or interested in censorship at worst. I would like to note here 
that a Councillor once told me that the even the perception by the Council that a comment is negative against the City is 
a valid reason for infringement of free speech, that is turning off the speaker's microphone. Of course, it is not a valid 
reason.

Read and understand the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment, the Massachusetts Declaration of 
Rights and modify your rules to be in compliance.

Cambridge City Council Meeting July 27, 2020 - for the record

Dear City Clerk,
Please enter this letter into the public record for the City Council meeting on behalf of the 429 signatories.

Perez, Lori

Dear Cambridge City Council,

The recent murders of Black people by the police have brought to the surface the inherently violent and racist structures 
of policing in the United States. It has become increasingly clear that police presence cannot keep Black people safe. In 
fact, police presence leads to physical and psychological harm to Black people who are most likely to have repeated 
encounters with police. 

Policing has always existed in this country to uphold the status quo of white supremacy, capitalism, and colonial 
structures. The institution emerged in the United States from slave patrols and colonial seizures of land from the 
indigenous population. Police became a professionalized force in the 19th century to uphold corporate interests against 
worker rebellions. We have seen the continuation of similar practices in recent weeks, as police have been deployed to 
protect private businesses while brutalizing protesters for exposing police violence in this country. As foot soldiers of 
the carceral state, police are accountable to the criminal legal systems that punish, isolate, and imprison Black people. 
Police do not exist to address the root causes of harm and violence within communities; too often they cause the harm. 

This consciousness about policing in the U.S. is reflected in the massive number of #DefundPolice campaigns that have 
swept across the country. The Movement for Black Lives, along with countless individuals and lesser known 
organizations, have called for dismantling institutions of surveillance, policing, and punishment. This movement is calling 
for construction of community-based mechanisms with transformative and restorative justice agendas that address and 
prevent the root causes of harm. This movement also calls for investing in the social fabric of communities, (e.g. mental 
health support, housing services, job training, quality education, healthy food) as a way to foster lasting physical safety 
and generate community wellbeing. 

While urban centers across the country are in a moment of profound transformation, there is a perception of Cambridge 
as a progressive utopia with a humane police force that serves and protects all residents equally. As a coalition of 
progressive Black Cambridge residents, our collective experiences differ from this claim. Cambridge is not exempt from 
the structures and practices of white supremacy that extinguish Black life in a multitude of ways. We offer an alternative 
view of Cambridge that recognizes police presence as harmful to the overall wellbeing of Black Cantabrigians. Though 
there may not be many documented instances of blatant physical violence perpetrated by the police in Cambridge, 
there are still examples: Gates, 2009; Harvard Student, 2018. These interactions may seem like isolated incidents, 
however, there are many untold stories of harmful encounters between  low income Black residents and the Cambridge 
police. We must uplift the experiences of our brothers and sisters and align ourselves with the Movement for Black Lives 
in calling for divestment from the Cambridge Police Department (CPD) and investment in long term solutions to 
community safety for Black people.

4.13.a

Black residents are under-represented in discussions of policing in Cambridge because of their economic and social 
position in the city. A great majority of Black Cantabridgians receive some sort of housing benefit regulated by the 
Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA). Pockets of Black communities have historically been concentrated in and around 
the public housing projects. These communities are often left out of public discourse because civic engagement, 
particularly challenging government policies and practices, can be dangerous to those who receive government 
subsidies. The CHA and police work together to cast off ‘problem tenants’, who  are often in the most precarious 
position. Those who “cause trouble” are criminalised and viewed as unfit to live in Cambridge. 
Boston is left to absorb the “problematic” residents who are then subjected to the same racist practices across the river. 
This system reflects a logic of white supremacy that Cambridge actively serves through its violent and bureaucratic 
practices. 

Interpersonal violence within Black communities, often referred to as ‘black-on-black’ crime, is treated as something to 
be erased rather than addressed. Some city officials have claimed that Cambridge is not in need of the same 
transformative change as other places, and that Black Cambridge residents especially benefit from police presence in 
Black neighborhoods and welcome the many programs offered by the police department. We wholeheartedly disagree. 
We are calling for more social programs to address interpersonal violence within the Black community, not more police. 

There are countless and yet unregistered accounts of Black businesses bemoaning the unrecognized impacts of police 
detailing of their neighbourhoods. The bottom line of those businesses is affected by the police harassment, the issuing 
of parking tickets and various citations around their businesses. The impact of this is threefold: the policing acts as a 
form of intimidation to Black clients, the tickets serve as a sort of Black tax, and combined these things silence Black 
residents. All of these predatory practices prevent individuals and Black business owners from sharing their experiences 
at the risk of losing their livelihoods.

The People’s Republic of Cambridge prides itself on its reputation as a progressive place, at the cutting edge of social 
and technological innovation. We say, prove it! Cambridge has a discretionary fund of over $250 million. Let us use these 
funds and redirect resources away from CPD to build a Cambridge where everyone thrives, including low-income Black 
people. Prove that our reputation as a progressive city is in fact the truth of Cambridge and not just rhetoric. Let us be 
on the cutting edge of the national movement to defund the police by creating a community where people are truly safe 
and where all Cambridge residents are treated as deserving of the same standard of living. People in the projects do not 
need to be over-policed; they need more jobs, childcare, free internet, business start-up funds, their student loans 
forgiven, their kids’ college tuition paid, and other educational services. Use CPD funding to pay for public services that 
will keep everyone, including poor Black Cantabrigians safe and thriving. 

Here we are, Black Cambridge residents. We are actively calling on the Cambridge City Council to #DefundThePolice!

Black Reponse Petition to Defund the Police

On Thursday, July 27th, 2020, you received a Black Response petition, a Cambridge Group fighting to Defund the Police. 
The petition signed by more than 400 Cambridge residents and is part of the agenda for the upcoming Monday City 
Council meeting. I urge you to take the time to not only acknowledge said petition but also to discuss its very essential 
content.

As a white person, I am degraded and diminished by racism. I support racial justice not only out of moral outrage at 
current and historical conditions, but also from a sense of common interest with people of color in efforts to dismantle 
racism -- including the dismantling of my own toxic white privilege, which gives me material advantages at the expense 
of my own humanity.

Expression of support for Black Response position on policing in Cambridge

I am writing to offer my support for the statement of The Black Response regarding the need for fundamental 
change in the policies of the City of Cambridge as it relates to policing.

We should recognize that the history and the character of policing means that efforts to pursue reform within the 
institution are likely to be ineffective or counter-productive. Practices to increase accountability through 
oversight run up against review practices that do not actually hold officers to account for their actions. There is 
no evidence that training results in better outcomes. Bundling social services with policing in the schools and in 
public housing has a history of disastrous outcomes.

It is important that we aim toward a kind of reform in the way the city interacts with its residents that works 
outside of the history and institutions of policing and social control. We should aim to remove functions that 
are performed by the police that do not need to be, such as traffic enforcement, school “security,” and work that 
would be better performed by community based social workers. We should redirect the resources that are 
currently being spent in these areas on services that strengthen the fabric of our communities and help the 
residents of Cambridge to thrive.

The time delay, for fiddling about the edges, for incremental reform has  passed. Let’s demonstrate leadership 
and vision as a community by starting to dismantle the institutions of policing and punishment we have received 
as our historical legacy. Let’s forge a new path toward healing, growth and peace.

Best, 
Grant Emison

Affordable Housing - Donovan petition

I fully support the Donovan Petition for Affordable Housing. It is the result of extensive research and conversations 
across the board to look at multiple perspectives and needs or gaps, using various sources of data.

I trust that it would greatly benefit the city and bring us together at a time we very much need consensus.

Please do look at this with an open mind, there are many creative ideas in it. It’s a complex matter.

Support of The Black Response statement

I am also writing to offer my support for the statement of The Black Response regarding the need for fundamental 
change in the policies of the City of Cambridge as it relates to policing, a statement on which I also signed off on.

Re-evaluating and re-thinking the United States police force is something that is long overdue, and Cambridge has an 
opportunity in its hands to be a radical leader for this community and for the nation.

As situated, no matter how well meaning, the police force exists as a means of protecting capital for the owning classes, 
it is not set up to be an ally to the community, but a tool of oppression. Any best intentions of the force are immediately 
lost when enacted by men and women equipped with weapons and training geared towards violence, not de-escalation.

In this historic moment, as outlined in the The Black Response's statement, Cambridge can listen to its communities of 
color, people that have been and continue to be oppressed, and work to dismantle the police state as it currently exists 
and to build a community of true equality and compassion.

Thank you,

Kevin Wentworth

Honorable Mayor Siddiqui and Cambridge City Council, 

 

Tomorrow’s agenda looks as if the current crisis of Covid-19 and the havoc it has caused in our 

community is over. Policy order items 10, 13, 14, and 15 contain some of the most detached and 
ghoulish policy suggestions I’ve ever read coming from this Council in 15 years. It comes to no surprise 
that Quinton Zondervan is at the helm of nearly all of them. 

 
Policy Order #10 is the most ghoulish and clearly detached from reality of the bunch. A transfer 
tax in the time of Covid-19 is not only cruel its just another lofty home rule political point scoring piece 
of nonsense of a group of Councilors who I have to assume haven’t looked out a window in four months. 
At some point there may be reason to investigate something like this but taking equity from 
homeowners across this city many of whom are in deferment or actively working through foreclosures is 
is the product of a detached and vindictive conscience. It lacks the basic humanity required to govern 
justly and equitably. It is also worth noting that this piece of doomed legislation comes from Councilors 
who have routinely blocked zoning reform, housing projects, and development in general which has 
greatly contributed to the exacerbated increase in costs not only in housing and commercial real estate 
but the labor and soft costs related to building a better Cambridge. Please reject this proposal and send 
a message to its authors that either they begin to work to the benefit of taxpayers and citizens of this 
City or they should resign.  

Policy Order #13 is yet another Hail Mary show of support for the worst grouping of housing 

 
policy reforms currently being reviewed by the State. Councilors Zondervan and his ward Jivan Sobrino-
Wheeler again show their lack of commitment to actually managing and solving issues regarding housing 
inequality and equity by blindly supporting politics over function. These bill are designed to divide 
municipal legislations across the Common Wealth and transform the housing discussion into a rent 
control battleground. There is no regional strategy here which I’m sure these two absolutely understand 
and therefore the aim is a political one. How thoughtless and heartless must one be to take something 
so serious as housing and support bills designed to turn us forty years back in the housing debate? 
Please do not support this policy order as it is bereft of reason and does not seek to achieve any 
meaningful policy goal. Instead one of you needs to stand up and propose something more equitable 
like what we’ve seen in California and Oregon. A statewide rent stabilization policy that addresses the 
issue regionally and creates an environment where crucial housing creation and development can 
proceed without recreating the same draconian system that has fostered the issues we have today. 
Again, I beseech the remaining Councilors with a conscience and spine to stand up to this nonsense and 
stop being steamrolled by it.  

Policy Order #14 Here is another swipe at the Cambridge Police Department, unwarranted and 

 
without any CPD specific problem to address. Councilor Zondervan is very comfortable couching all 
arguments under the flag of racism without being able to provide specific Cambridge data that suggests 
a racist policy exists. I believe he does this because the topic of race makes the majority of this Council 
uncomfortable and instead of trying to address the real systemic issues of racism that exist in our City or 
within certain department the Council allows Zondervan to run the conversation as if he were the only 
reputable voice in the conversation. Further, what message does this send to the CPD? If this Council 
intends to #defund or #abolish reducing their budget next years by 20% or more don’t you think it would 
make sense to site Cambridge specific reasons for doing so? As you know we are facing a significant

surge in crime in Central Square, something not easily addressed by simply duct taping social workers to 
it. The CPD are an active community driven entity without whom our district would absolutely collapse. 
Again, please send a message to the people of Cambridge, The CPD, and Zondervan that this discussion 
is crucial but allowing one man’s clear vendetta isn’t going to be the foundation on which that 
conversation occurs.  

Policy Order #15 This might seem like the right thing to do. It’s a time of pandemic and towing 

 
cars, making people go and pick up their car for the sake of clean streets might seem reasonable. 
However, our system of prior alert, signage, and CPD outreach … that’s right … prior to towing the CPD 
often call individuals to come get their cars, is a sound one and is to the benefit of all Cantabridgians. 
Not everyone owns a car but everyone is entitled to and needs clean streets. Please reject this policy 
order and do not further encumber city staff with nonsense while real problems need to be addressed.  

Policy Order #8 … I left this one out of order because I support it. I’m not sure now is the time 
 
but I am sure that this is a worthwhile endeavor. Thank you Patty Nolan for bringing it up, however it 
may be that for now we need to learn to walk before we learn to fly.  

Finally, like the tootsie roll lollipops that are made just down the street I’m sure not many will get to the 
center of this communication without rushing through, but I hope you all pay heed to some of what I 
have to say and look forward to any response.  

 

 

 

Stay Safe and Be Well,

Dear Councilors,

There are two issues here:

police militarization

1. Why were you told our police force doesn’t have military equipment?

2. Why do we have this equipment and so much of it? I can think of any number of ways where the presence of this 
equipment could cause purposeful and/or accidental extreme damage and almost zero ways where it would be helpful 
for either keeping the peace, apprehending people suspected of a crime, or solving a crime. Having a properly equipped 
bomb squad is one thing; this armament is quite another.

I hope you all keep well,

Good afternoon,

Clerk; City Council; City Manager
ADA anniversary / shared streets

On this, the 30th Anniversary of the ADA, I implore the City to do more to increase mobility for everyone. We’ve been 
looking forward to the shared streets, including the expansion of the program to more streets. Many of our sidewalks 
are inadequate or downright dangerous for walking and wheeling.

We have no shared streets in East Cambridge, the Port or or Wellington Harrington. Yesterday, for my mother to visit 
we had to walk/wheel on Harvard St without shared street signage. I ask, what is the status of the shared street 
extension on Harvard east of Prospect? What is the status of shared streets or other calming measures elsewhere in 
East Cambridge?

I’d also like to express concern with sidewalk crowding, especially where much appreciated outdoor dining occurs. We 
cannot sacrifice our safety on sidewalks because we can do both outdoor dining and wider sidewalks by narrowing 
traffic lanes, which also helps slow drivers down. What good is a citywide 20mph speed limit if the streets are have 
higher design speeds? 

I implore the City to move aggressively toward creating more equitable use of streets. Streets for people, local 
residents, not speeding drivers. Boston put in an entire network of protected cycle lanes - overnight. Cambridge could 
do the same on Mass Ave and Cambridge Street.

Thank you for again reading my concerns. I will surely being these up again at upcoming council meetings.

Please look at the pictures I took. 

Best,
Luis Mejias

City Council; Clerk
City Manager Contract and Search

Although I have a number of concerns with Mr. DePasquale’s performance as city manager, I am most 
concerned with his refusal to carry out a number our elected officials’ policies and requests. These include, 
among others:

•
•

Ignoring the city council’s request for a municipal broadband feasibility study until only very recently 
Failure to provide information that council has requested such as an inventory of city-own property

The fact that the manager is unaccountable to the public and has unilateral power to ignore the will of our 
democratically elected officials is concerning. Fundamentally, I believe that Plan E is an undemocratic form of 
government. I recognize, however, that changing our city’s form of government is a complex task that would 
take much careful thought and discussion over a considerable period. I hope that Cambridge does take that 
time but I understand that this cannot happen overnight. For now, we need to consider whether to renew the 
current managers’ contract and if so for how long.

The last search for a city manager took approximately half a year and therefore I do not think we have 
adequate time to conduct a thorough national search prior to the end of Mr. DePasquale’s contract. I 
therefore support the proposal, that many Cambridge residents, activist groups, and several councilors have 
made, that the City renew the managers’ contract for one year starting from the period that it expires. This 
provides approximately a year and a half to conduct a search, three times longer than previously. That should 
be more than enough time to conduct such a search as, even under COVID, much of this work can be done 
online and through teleconferences. The council should also use this period to conduct a thorough, formal, 
and transparent evaluation of the manager based on the City Council’s stated goals, something that has not 
happened during Mr. DePasquale’s entire tenure as city manager. 

Again, I think the fundamental problem is our form of government that gives extensive power to an unelected 
official who is not accountable rather than the qualities of any city manager in particular. But in the short 
term, we must act within this system and therefore I believe the best path forward is a one-year contract 
paired with a formal evaluation and nationwide search for a new manager.

Finally, I am also concerned that the current city manager is most focused on bond ratings and does 
sufficiently prioritizes public goods. The manager seems stuck in a period when Cambridge was struggling 
financially. That time is long gone, and we can and should turn away from austerity politics and towards 
funding public goods to the best of our ability. We are a wealthy city with the lowest property taxes in the 
region. If we raise our property taxes even a small amount, we could easily afford public goods such a 
municipal broadband and more social housing. The manager, however, has been resistant to even small 
increases. I believe the city should create a multi-year vision for the future that focuses on public goods and 
eradicating racism in city departments. Having established this vision, the council should evaluate any city 
manager on the extent to which he or she supports and exercises this vision.

Please vote yes on POs: 3, 8, 10, 11, and 14 and please seriously consider the concerns 
of Black Response

4.37.a

To the City Council:

I am writing in support of several policy orders:

•

•

•

•

•

PO #3: Support Senator DiDominico’s Tenants’ Right To Council bill. There is strong evidence that tenants who 
have a lawyer are much less likely to be evicted and become homeless than those who do not. Given the large 
number of evictions that could occur due to job losses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, this is timely 
and important legislation.
PO #8: Review the City Charter. Although many cities review their form of government every five to ten years, 
Cambridge has not done so for many decades. Given concerns that many citizens have about the undemocratic 
and unaccountable nature of Plan E, it seems wise to conduct a thorough evaluation of our current structure and 
alternatives.
PO #10: Real Estate Transfer Fee Home Rule Petition. Funds from this could be used for desperately needed 
social and other affordable housing. The state tenants’ rights enabling act would allow for creating such a fee 
but as it has not yet passed, Cambridge should join other cities in asking permission to create a transfer fee.
PO #11: Requests the City to negotiate with the new owners of Jerry’s Pond about environmental protection 
and restoration. This property has been a toxic hazard for decades; it is time to clean it up and ideally open it to 
the public as a park. 
PO #14: Requests that the city manager investigate transferring primary traffic enforcement responsibilities 
from the Cambridge Police Department to unarmed, trained enforcement personnel in the Traffic & Parking 
Department, Department of Public Works, or another suitable department. As police overreach often stems 
from traffic stops, this seems like a sensible approach.

Finally, Black Response, a black led Cambridge activist group has submitted a petition to the City Council regarding 
concerns they have about policing in Cambridge in which they ask to reallocate funds from the Cambridge Police 
Department to services that directly benefit the Black community. I request that the council seriously consider the 
concerns of Black Response.

Louise Parker

Supporting Arts Organizations through the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund

I am writing in support of the City Councilor's proposed amendment to the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Account. 
This proposal is absolutely critical to the survival of arts organizations in Cambridge.

Allow me to introduce myself: I am a Cambridgeport resident and the President and Chair of the Board of 
ImprovBoston, a non-profit theater that has called Cambridge home for nearly 40 years. For the past decade, 
IB has been an important cultural anchor of the Central Square business district. Every week, we brought over 
2500 patrons, students, and performers to Central Square. Our guests and performing community frequented 
Central Square's coffee shops, restaurants, small businesses and bars. We are proud to be a part of our vibrant 
neighborhood.

But since March, IB--like the other arts organizations in Cambridge--has faced an unprecedented crisis. On 
March 12, we made the decision to go dark (a closure that has since become a legal mandate under the 
Commonwealth's emergency plans ). In some respects it was an easy choice: the health and safety of our 
employees, performers, patrons, and community is our utmost concern. But in other ways, it was a heart-
wrenching decision: it put--and continues to put--our continued existence in peril.

Arts organizations face many of the challenges other companies have faced: prolonged closures, staffing 
furloughs, and prohibitive rent burdens and unyielding landlords. But the arts also face unique, and 
particularly emperilling challenges: there are no half measures by which we can support ourselves, no way to 
limp along, until it is safe to reopen.

Unlike restaurants, theaters cannot offer take out of delivery.

Unlike small businesses, we cannot sell our product online and ship it to your front door.

We are closed, full stop, and we cannot earn any money. Despite being a family of creative and determined 
individuals, we have no way to make ends meet until it is once again safe for patrons to return to our theaters. 
And even once patrons can return--if it is before a vaccine--social distancing measures in intimate venues like 
ImprovBoston will mean vastly reduced seating capacities, and shows cannot run profitably.

The problem we are faced with is quite simple: without support from the city, we will not be able to survive. 
And the question for the Council is also quite simple: are the arts an essential element of a vibrant and 
enduring Cambridge? If so, it is time to act.

I applaud the hard work and ingenuity with which the Council and the City Manager has led Cambridge 
through this crisis thus far: revising the rules for the Mayor's Disaster Relief Account is a logical and necessary 
next step to empower the City to meet the current disaster we face, and to ensure that someday, we can all 
return to theaters.

I am happy to speak to anyone who may want to learn more about what it is like to be an arts organization 
during this crisis, and how the city can help. My contact information is below.

When it comes to questionable Police Department equipment, follow the money

To the Honorable, the City Council:

As some of you may know, a few years ago, I spent time investigating ShotSpotter, a gun shot identification installed in a 
small part of Cambridge. Because ShotSpotter’s own marketing materials assert that ShotSpotter is meant for 
environments with levels of gun violence orders of magnitude beyond what Cambridge experiences, I became curious by 
what process Cambridge decided to invest in this useless technology.

The answer turned out to be there was no process.

Instead, Cambridge received ShotSpotter as part of regional security grant from the Department of Homeland 
Security.  In fact, to obtain the ShotSpotter contract under which Cambridge operated, I had to make a public records 
request of the Boston Emergency Services department.

I’ve spent some time looking through Cambridge budgets seeking to find the sources of funding for the equipment the 
Police Department disclosed. I can’t find them.

Not only should the Council discuss the nature of the equipment the CPD has, it should determine how it was funded. If 
this came through tax dollars, the Council should make sure, going forward, that it fully understands what it is 
approving. If, as seems more likely, some of this was from DHS grants, we need a process, similar to that of the 
Surveillance Oversight Ordinance, to make sure the Police Department is operating with effective oversight and civilian 
control.

Dear Jivan,

Duncan MacLaury <dmaclaury@gmail.com>
Monday, July 27, 2020 12:42 PM
Sobrinho-Wheeler, Jivan
Clerk
Thank you for Policy Order #14 & Question City Manager Agenda Item #30

As one of your constituents in the city of Cambridge, I believe that Policy Order #14 (POR 2020 #178) is an important 
step toward moving away from the police as a first-line of interaction between regular Cantabrigians and the 
government. Thank you for your and Councillor Zondervan's policy order on the agenda tonight. Additionally, I hope that 
in discussion around City Manager Agenda Item #30 (CMA 2020 #177) you will ask and get specific answers in regards to 
the use, potential use, and realistic need for the weapons (particularly those that are military-esque) owned by the 
Cambridge Police Department.

I believe that removing armed individuals from interaction with everyday citizens in as many ways as possible is an 
important first step in moving toward my ultimate goal of defunding the police. While Policy Order #14 is a relatively 
small change, and one that I hope will pass the Council unanimously tonight, it will also help us all in Cambridge see that 
armed officers of the law are not a necessary component of a safe city. 

I appreciate that the Cambridge Police Department quickly completed what seems to be a thorough accounting of its 
equipment for the City Council, per POR 2020 #146. I believe that tonight, and going forward, this listing is an important 
starting point for conversations around what Police Commissioner Bard means when he says "military equipment" and 
what the CPD actually owns. I hope that you will ask and get answers to questions about the use, potential use, and 
actual, realistic need of the weapons owned by the CPD. In his cover letter, Commissioner Bard states that "As it pertains 
to the weaponry, the need for law enforcement officers to rely  on firearms as defensive tools will likely persist 
hereafter. This includes the use of both handguns and more high-powered, specialized long weapons; each of which, 
have distinct advantages in specific situations" (City Council Agenda Pack 7/27/2020 page 104). I hope that you will get 
further specifics on this statement, as to me it is needlessly vague and seeks deference for the police in our city to own 
weapons that could be used in warfare without citing the specific instances that this is or has been necessary. 

Again, I appreciate your creation of Policy Order #14 tonight and hope that you question the City Manager (or Police 
Commissioner if he is present) on the use, potential use, and realistic need for the weapons owned by the CPD. Thank 
you for your time.

Sincerely,
Duncan MacLaury

comments for meeting tonight

I am a Cambridge resident  (one of the homeowners at  149 Prospect St) who is concerned about the CPD’s inventory of 
military hardware. I support the Policy order 146 proposed by Councilors Zondervan and Sobrinho for the CPD to give 
an itemized list of its inventory of  military hardware  to the City manager, as a step toward removing this military 
hardware from its inventory.
Thank you for taking up this issue and registering my support for this Policy Order

Transfer fee

I am writing in support of the transfer fee on real estate sales. Properties are changing hands at eye popping prices. 
Many people and corporations are speculating on land and driving the prices up even higher. A clear and open process 
of where the money from this tax would go is necessary after it passes.

We need a variety of ways to add funding for housing that is within reach of low and moderate income residents and 
they must be suitable for long term homes where we can build community- something that does not happen in the large 
market rate buildings which operate more as short term hotels. Most of you live in homes which are secure and are in 
areas where you actually know your neighbors. It is very lonely and isolating living in a large market rate building. it 
would be great to have building which include low, moderate and middle income residents. A transfer tax is one of the 
ways we can obtain funds to do this.

Regarding City Manager order #30, I hope we can Have a discussion in which we try to gain some control over our own 
police department by giving away the unnecessary military equipment. As we have seen federal troops in Portland using 
this equipment we have learned it only inflames the situation.

I support policy order number 8 which seeks to begin the long overdue formal conversation on charter change. Having a 
strong city manager and a weak council undermines democracy and accountability. I think the majority of residents in 
Cambridge are ready to have this discussion.

I farther support policy number 14 regarding using civilians for traffic issues and finally I support the order asking that 
landlords distribute a resource containing tenants rights to their renters, though we don't have many rights at this time. 
It is important to actively work for Mike Connolly and Nika Elguardo's housing bill in the statehouse.
Thank you for your consideration and enjoy the rest of the summer.

Sincerely,
Kathy Watkins

On Policy Orders to be considered at 7/27 meeting

I see there are many good policy orders on tonight’s Council Agenda. I want to express particular support for item 10 
(The Real Estate Transfer Fee Home Rule Petition,  for item 14 (asking the City Manager to look into transfer primary 
traffic enforcement to an unarmed trained enforcement agency outside of the jurisdiction of the Police Department), 
and for item 8 (starting consideration of Charter Review and Reform).

On item 10: we all know that Cambridge is in desperate need of affordable housing. This petition will give the City 
another tool to make that happen.

On item 14: I would like to see Cambridge explore all the ways that current police functions can be done by other 
agencies without use of arms. This Policy Order would begin a process for doing that with traffic enforcement, following 
the example of the Berkeley CA City Council.

On item 8: I am not comfortable with the current governance model in Cambridge insofar as it invests enormous power 
in an unelected City Manager—this is a fundamentally undemocratic model and one that is not serving us well now as 
the City Manager has failed to follow up appropriately on policy orders from Council. I don’t know whether or what 
changes are possible now, but I think that is the point of consideration of models.

Finally, I’d like to put in a word for Jerry’s Pond (item 11) which is very close to my house. It would be very exciting if 
there were ways to improve it and open it up to public uses.

Best regards,
Carolyn Magid

To: lerk@cambridgema.gov <lerk@cambridgema.gov>

My apologies - a work commitment has come up and I am unable to testify. Please see below my 
comments...

My name is Ronnie Millar, 31 Jackson Street, Cambridge 

I wish to speak about Policy orders #11 and 12 related to sale of the WR Grace site in North Cambridge.

I am testifying this evening to ask the City Council to pause before proceeding with policy order #11 and 
to include the Alewife Study Group in future conversations about the site before you start negotiating with 
the new property order.   

I want to register my concern that the focus of policy order 11 is on the beautification of Jerry’s Pond when 
the real issue with the WR Grace site is the massive amounts of asbestos that is buried throughout the 20+ 
areas. 

This is a distraction from the inconvenient truth of that there are tons of asbestos on this site - even WR 
Grace admits to this, and agreed to have the AUL written into the deeds in 2005. 

North Cambridge neighbors founded the Alewife Study Group in 1995 to enhance the quality of life, and 
protect public health of North Cambridge families near the WR Grace site.

We work to ensure an inclusive process on issues related to the risks of hazardous waste such as asbestos, 
flooding, and the protection of habitats and natural resources. 

The Alewife Neighbors Inc is the 501 c3 sister organization that receives funding for testing and outreach.

ASG & ANI have over 25 years of experience, credibility and collaboration with neighbors, the City, DEP, 
WR Grace and their LSP Haley and Aldrich.

ASG is the group that is on record with the property owner as the neighborhood liaison and we have been 
monitoring the site to protect people, and ensuring no soil below 6 inches is disturbed. for example, when 
emergency grounds work is needed and for the repair of flooding pathway between Russell and the MBTA 
station. We were also recently involved in the asbestos testing of Russell Field training field was being 
upgraded.

It is important to note that asbestos fibers that is buried in the soil do no harm, but that it is only when 
fibers become airborne that serious public health risks are triggered. The asbestos waste is not solid lumps, 
but is so fine that that is invisible to the eye.

If excavation below 6” is necessary, Grace must “tent and vent” as per the Asbestos Protection Ordinance.

Finally, we all care about environmental justice and living in a beautiful neighborhood - Jerry’s Pond can 
be beautiful – just as is Fresh Pond – even with a fence around the perimeter. 

I am asking the City to pause and to include – not exclude – the Alewife Study Group in future 
conversations about the site before you start negotiating with the new property order.

City Council Orders #11 and #12

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Councilors and City Manager DePasquale,

My name is Eric Grunebaum and I live at 98 Montgomery Street. I’m a member of the Friends of Alewife Advisory Board, 
and a long time contributor to City boards including the Trolley Square Committee, the Envision Alewife Working Group 
and the NetZero initiative. 

I’m also a cofounder of Friends of Jerry’s Pond five years ago and tonight I’m speaking about the two Policy Orders 
related to Jerry’s Pond, #11 and #12. 

First is Policy Order #11 which takes note of the polluted eyesore which has existed across the street from the City’s 
highest concentration of affordable housing, at the entry to the city from the west, by the Red Line terminus and next to 
the bike-path.

As you know this land will now be sold for $125 million and is slated for life sciences development.

For years we have recognized the importance of this site to people’s health, for climate change mitigation and for wildlife. 
It is not an exaggeration to say that it is one of our last opportunities to create a new natural reservation in the City and 
that it is a clear cut case of environmental justice.

We expect and hope that the City will rise to the occasion and not accept small measures from a huge development.

We expect better from our city. And we expect that any development will be highly sensitive to the health and safety of our 
community and return to the City what was once a vibrant area for recreation in a natural setting for working class people 
in North Cambridge – an opportunity that many of our underserved neighbors do not have access to.

Will this happen if the City does not play a robust role? It is unlikely! And so we ask you all to step up to the plate. Three 
weeks ago the undeveloped land around Jerry’s Pond and and towards Whittemore Ave. was assessed at under $2 
million.

Today it is clearly worth 10 or 20 times that or more. Please invest these proceeds directly to help create a great new 
place from this one-time clay pit which could become a beautiful pond one day.

The connections between a future Jerry’s Pond Reservation to the nearby Alewife Reservation and beyond to the Mystic 
River play a greater and greater role in the well-being of our neighborhood our citizens. Again, we ask you to provide the 
vision and leadership to make this a world-class place in the middle of our city.

This effort can begin today with the subject of policy order #12 which asks the City to do as skilled a job on the drainage 
ditch across from the Ringe Towers as it does with these drainage areas near Fresh Pond where there are some beautiful 
examples of planted swales.

Please do not wait ~ Get ahead of this and make us proud to live in Cambridge!

Best,
Eric

ongoing since the first slaves survived the journey to America in 1619; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The discussion of citizenship continued into the Continental Congress when the 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

founding fathers began building a nation; and 
 
James Madison, as a compromise between Southern and New England delegates, 
proposed that Black people were 3/5ths of a human being, and as such was written into 
the very document itself; and 
 
For more than 150 years, a wide variety of constituency groups including Quakers, 
Mennonites, and Abolitionists fought for the end of Slavery in America, resulting in 
the Civil War from 1861-1865; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Upon the end of the war, Black people were elected to public offices throughout the

citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.”; 
and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Despite its passage, discriminatory practices were implemented beginning in the late 

1870’s to keep Black people from practicing their rights as citizens.  These tactics 
included: violence, fraud, poll taxes, literacy tests, restrictive and arbitrary registration 
practices, and white primaries; and 
 
For the next 80 years, African American leaders fought for the right to full citizenship

intolerance for the right to vote; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  On August 6, 1965 Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, removing all restrictions to 
voting for Black citizens, thus giving them full citizenship, and is considered one of the 
greatest achievements of the civil rights movement; and 
 
In the 55 years since the passage of the Voting Rights Act, tens of thousands of Black 
people across America have been elected to public office, including 6 United States 
senators and our nation’s first black president; and

Martin Luther King, and hundreds of young college students from across the United 
States who participated in Freedom Summer; and

anniversary we remember those who sacrificed their lives for this right, including 
Herbert Lee, Medgar Evers, Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, 
Cynthia Wesley, James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Henry Schwerner, 
Rev. James Reeb, Jonathan Daniels, Vernon Dahmer, and Viola Liuzzo; and, 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Despite this great success, voting rights for Black people continue to be under attack 
through nefarious methods, aimed at suppressing the Black vote; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  This 55th anniversary, reminds us that we must honor our ancestors and prepare to do 
our duty as citizens in one of the most important elections in this country’s history, by 
registering to vote and encouraging our family, friends, and neighbors to vote; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The participation of the Black community will have a powerful impact on the 

upcoming election, now therefore be it

the heroes who engaged in the struggle to realize this milestone achievement in social 
justice, by declaring August 6th Voting Rights Act Remembrance Day in the City of

WHEREAS: 

It has come to the attention of the Cambridge City Council that July 26, 2020 marks 
the 30th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was undeniably one of the most 

significant pieces of civil rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act was to –  

(1) 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

Provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for 
the elimination of discrimination against individuals with 
disabilities; 
Provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards 
addressing discrimination against individuals with 
disabilities; 
Ensure that the Federal government plays a central role 
in enforcing the standards established in the act on behalf 
of individuals with disabilities, and; 
Invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including 
the power to enforce the 14th amendment to the 
Constitution and to regulate commerce, in order to 
address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-
day by people with disabilities; and 

 

WHEREAS:  The Americans with Disabilities Act established the world’s first comprehensive 

prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability in the areas of employment, 
public accommodations, public services, transportation, and telecommunications; and

WHEREAS:  Commemorating the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act both affirms the protections that people with disabilities have gained since passage 
of the act and recognizes the work left to be done to ensure that people with disabilities  
are fully able to participate in society; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Despite the progress made since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 

people with disabilities in the United States continue to experience inequities in 
employment, health care and health outcomes, income and financial independence, and 
other vital economic and social factors, due to the ongoing presence of structural 
ableism; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The Cambridge City Council recognizes that disabled Black, Indigenous, and People 

of Color living in the United States continue to experience disproportionate 
discrimination; now therefore be it 
 

 
RESOLVED:  That the Cambridge City Council go on record honoring the passage of the Americans 

with Disabilities Act and its consequent 30th anniversary and commit to upholding it 
as a foundation for future progress.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The Massachusetts Housing Court is anticipating that 15,000-20,000 eviction cases 
will be filed once the State’s eviction moratorium expires on August 18, 2020; and 
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic and before the eviction moratorium went into effect 
in April, 78% of all evictions filed in Boston were in census tracts where the majority 
of residents are people of color; and 
 
The racial disparity in Boston evictions mirrors a nationwide trend of systemic racism 
embedded in the housing market, which suggests race has a significant role in eviction 
filings with much of the research finding that the racial composition of a neighborhood 
is the most important factor in predicting neighborhood eviction rates, even more than 
poverty and other neighborhood characteristics; and 
 
In order to address the tidal wave of evictions, housing advocates throughout the 
Commonwealth are working with State Representatives to extend the statewide 
eviction moratorium, as well as introducing legislation (S.2785) to establish a “Right to 
Counsel Pilot” project to protect low-income renters and owner-occupants in areas of 
the Commonwealth hardest hit by COVID.; and 
 
S.2785 would ensure full legal representation in eviction proceedings through 
dedicated new staffing to tenants and owner-occupants whose incomes do not exceed 
200% of poverty; and 
 
Currently, over 90% of tenants face eviction without legal representation, while 78% 
of landlords have lawyers, an imbalance that will likely grow once the eviction 
moratorium ends; and 
 
A statewide Right to Counsel pilot is part of an essential response to the impending 
eviction wave, as having counsel has been demonstrated to be a determining outcome 
of such cases; and 
 
Counsel representation for both tenants and landlords give each party equal footing in 
negotiating terms and agreements moving forward; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record in support of S. 2785, an “Act Promoting Housing 
Stability and Homelessness Prevention through a Right to Counsel Pilot Program in 
Massachusetts in Response to the COVID Emergency,” and be it further

ORDERED: 

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Cambridge Public Health Department has offered 
free COVID-19 testing to Cambridge residents via stand-alone testing centers, as well 
as testing in nursing homes, senior centers and homeless shelters; and 
 
In July, testing sites and times were consolidated into 4 testing centers in the North 
Cambridge, East Cambridge, Harvard Square and Port Neighborhoods; and 
 
CHA expanded three additional Saturday testing dates at the Pisani Center in The Port, 
on July 18th, July 25th and August 1st; and 
 
Appointments for these testing dates and sites have filled up, with many residents 
reaching out to inquire about additional dates and locations; and 
 
The City of Cambridge must be persistent in our efforts in access to testing for 
COVID-19; now therefore be it   
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with Claude Jacob, Chief 
Public Health Officer of the Cambridge Public Health Department, to expand testing 
dates and locations for the months of August and September; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Cambridge Public 
Health Department to create an overall testing plan for the upcoming late fall and 
winter months ahead.

The State of Massachusetts Civil Service Human Resource Division (HRD) has not 
administered a Fire Chief’s exam since the appointment of the current Cambridge 
Acting Fire Chief; and 
 
The State of Massachusetts Civil Service Human Resource Division (HRD) has not 
administered a Fire Chief’s exam since the appointment of the current Cambridge 
Acting Fire Chief; and 
 
The City Manager recently announced the City will utilize a new "Sole Assessment 
Center" to create a permanent Fire Chief Civil Service list, rather than utilizing the 
State of Massachusetts Civil Service Human Resources Division (HRD) process; and 
 
The City Manager explained the decision to utilize a new Sole Assessment Center by 
stating that it is superior to "a generic statewide process which emphasizes a multiple 
choice exam," and that "the City will be able to holistically evaluate through both 
written and job simulation exercises each candidate's knowledge, skills, and abilities to 
be Fire Chief in Cambridge"; and 
 
The Civil Service HRD exam process scheduled for October 2020, and April 2021 
consists of a weighted, graded test with the following structure: 

•  40% Written exam 
•  40% Assessment center (An interview to determine knowledge, skills, and 

more) 

•  20% Education and experience  

and has an associated cost of $2,500 to the municipality for administering the 
candidate process and subsequent scoring; and 
 
The Civil Service HRD process allows municipalities to "maintain the option to hire a 
vendor and utilize a delegated Assessment Center instead of the HRD developed and 
administered Assessment Center," which could ensure that Cambridge maintains the 
desired "holistic evaluation,” and that the process "[reflects] the priorities of the City of 
Cambridge and our unique urban environment"; and  
 
The full process, scoring, appeals process, and associated costs of the proposed Sole 
Assessment Center, as well as the reasons for choosing this option instead of the Civil 
Service HRD process, have not yet been made clear to the City Council; and

ORDERED: 

The City Manager has indicated his desire to enter into an Request for Quotes process 
to select a vendor to conduct the Sole Assessment Center; and 
 
As this expenditure will likely come before the City Council as an appropriation for a 
vendor, the City Council and the public have a vested interest in understanding the 
rationale behind the decision to use a Sole Assessment Center; therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Personnel 
Department and City Solicitor to generate a report detailing the Sole Assessment 
Process, the Civil Service HRD process, the reason for choosing the Sole Assessment 
Process over the Civil Service HRD process, and the projected costs associated with 
both processes; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to present this report at the 
September 14th regular City Council meeting.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

As part of the City’s ongoing efforts to draw attention to those individuals who helped 
shape our community, it would be timely and fitting for the City to re-name the library 
branch located in the heart of our most culturally diverse neighborhood in honor of a 
local figure, Maria L. Baldwin, and a national figure, Rep. John Lewis, who both 
embodied the Cambridge ideals of fairness, education, diversity, and inclusion; and 
 
The Central Square Library is the ideal location for this re-dedication, as it is already 
the home to the Lewis Room, which in 1977 was dedicated in honor of the late Jerome 
Lewis, the First Associate Director of the Cambridge Public Library, who was one of 
the originators of African American cultural programming at the Cambridge Public 
Library; and 
 
In March of 2014, the Central Square Library also unveiled a commemorative plaque 
named the Leroy Cragwell African-American History Book Collection in honor of the 
late Mr. Leroy Cragwell, a senior resident of color who gave tirelessly to the City of 
Cambridge, and in recognition of the fact that the Central Square Library has been the 
center of countless community gatherings over the years, particularly for the Black 
community; and 
 
The re-naming of this library branch would also work towards highlighting and 
preserving those elements of Cambridge history from which we draw our strength and 
our identity, and it will better promote the values that we, as a community, wish to 
embrace; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with the Director of the 
Cambridge Public Library, the Library Board of Trustees, and any other appropriate 
City personnel to consider formally renaming the Central Square Library in honor of 
Maria Baldwin and Rep. John Lewis, with the building being known as “The Maria 
Baldwin and Rep. John Lewis Library and Center for African American/Black History 
and Culture” going forward, or to otherwise find another suitable location for this 
dedication, and to report back to the City Council on this in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, over the last three months, has gone from 
normal condition to level one and two drought conditions throughout the state, 
including in Middlesex County; and 
 
In the summer of 2016, the Commonwealth and Cambridge were in a similar position 
and the City never issued a drought warning or encouraged residents to conserve water 
despite all surrounding cities and towns doing so; and 
 
The Water Department assured the council and community in August of 2016 that their 
projections showed that the water supplies in the Cambridge system were sufficient in 
a 3 month, 6 month and 24 month time frame, yet two months later the City was forced 
to purchase 90% of its water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority; and 
 
In October of 2016 the City Council authorized a $3.6 million allocation from the 
Water Fund, doubling the cost of the City’s water supply; and 
 
The Council wants the City to be prepared in the case of the current dry conditions 
worsening; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager is requested to consult with the Water Department and report 
back on lessons learned from 2016 and on plans in place to institute water savings 
measures, and to inform the Water Board of this request; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager is requested to inform the public as soon as practicable about 
the possibility of dry and drought conditions, so as to encourage the community to save 
water whenever possible

WHEREAS: 

A charter is the most important legal document in a city, defining the power structure 
and organization of municipal government; and 

WHEREAS: 

Chapter 43B, Section 2, in General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
states: “Every city and town shall have the power to adopt or revise its charter or to 
amend its existing charter in accordance with procedures prescribed by [Chapter 
43B]”; and 

WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge, which adopted the Plan E Charter in 1940, has not once held a 
formal review process to consider revisions, making it the only city or town in 
Massachusetts to go 80 years without reviewing its most important legal document; 
and 

WHEREAS:  Many cities and towns in Massachusetts have a charter review process built into their 

charter, requiring a review every set number of years (usually 5-10 years) to ensure 
the charter continues to serve the needs of ever-changing municipalities; and 

WHEREAS 

Cambridge has changed dramatically since 1940, and it is good governance for the 
City Council to ensure that our governing documents are positioned to serve our 
modern, progressive city through a review of the city charter; and  

WHEREAS 

There are outstanding questions of whether the charter as currently construed and 
interpreted is in line with democratic principles and an appropriate balance of power; 
and  

WHEREAS 

The Collins Center for Public Management, created under Governor Patrick’s 
administration in 2008, has aided cities and towns across the state with the charter 
review process and employ experts on Massachusetts city charters as well as a range 
of other municipal government areas; now therefore be it

WHEREAS:  On July 6, 2020, the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under 

the Trump Administration, announced that it intends to bar international college 
students from entering the United States, or staying in the Country if already here, if 
their scheduled fall classes are entirely remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security plans to publish the procedures and 

 
WHEREAS: 

responsibilities in the Federal Register as a Temporary Final Rule, stating that 
“Nonimmigrant F-1 and M-1 students attending schools operating entirely online may 
not take a full online course load and remain in the United States. The U.S. 
Department of State will not issue visas to students enrolled in schools and/or 
programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection permit these students to enter the United States. Active students currently in 
the United States enrolled in such programs must depart the country or take other 
measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in 
lawful status. If not, they may face immigration consequences including, but not 
limited to, the initiation of removal proceedings;” and 
 
Following this announcement, Universities and Cities around the country filed briefs 
and lawsuits in strong opposition to this proposed rule; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Harvard and MIT filed a lawsuit on July 8, 2020 which requested a temporary 

restraining order against the policy, and an order vacating the policy and a declaration

WHEREAS:  Though this proposed rule has been rescinded since the lawsuit was filed, this proposed 

 
WHEREAS: 

rule was intended to punish our international students and hold them hostage in the 
Administration’s ongoing stronghold on school systems to resume in person learning 
without the public health data to support reopening schools; and 
 
Forcing Universities to resume in-person learning amid a global pandemic for the sole 
reason of retaining their international students is contrary to public health guidance and 
puts the public’s health at greater risk; now therefore be it

the same, as follows: 

SECTION 1.  Findings and Purpose. 
 
Whereas, housing costs in and around Cambridge have increased consistently and 
dramatically over the last 20+ years, resulting in a lack of affordability and causing 
displacement of long-term lower, moderate, and middle-income residents and a decrease 
in racial and economic diversity of households: 

-  Between 2007 and 2017, home prices in the city-center areas of Boston, 

Cambridge, and Somerville rose from between 61 and 89 percent, according to 
the Urban Institute  

-  Based on the analysis of low- and middle-income groups, 45,000 individuals or 

43% of the population are negatively impacted by the housing market, according 
to the 2017 Cambridge Needs Assessment  

-  The average rent for a Cambridge apartment was $2,337 for a one-bedroom unit, 
$2,689 for a two bedroom and $2,827 for a three-bedroom unit in October 2018, 
according to the Cambridge Community Foundation. 
In Cambridgeport a renter must earn $44 dollars per hour in order to afford a two-
bedroom apartment, more than three times the current Massachusetts minimum 
wage, according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. 

- 

 
Whereas, these circumstances are further compounded by a combination of regional 
housing demand and constrained supply as documented in the Metropolitan Area 
Planning Council’s projection of regional housing demand for the metro north Boston 
area and the 2017 Housing Report Card, which noted that the sharpest increases in 
housing costs are occurring in Boston’s inner-ring suburbs including Cambridge; and 
 
Whereas, Cambridge’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund is established under M.G.L. c.44, 
§55C and is charged with the preservation and creation of new affordable rental and 
homeownership units in the City of Cambridge and the creation of programs that directly 
assist renters and homeowners, now; 
 
Therefore, the purpose of this act is to establish a sustainable revenue source for the 
Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust Fund as further set forth below:

SECTION 4.  The City may, by ordinance, adopt additional requirements, exemptions, 
and regulations to implement or enforce said fee, consistent with this act.  The City is not 
authorized to eliminate or reduce any exemption set forth in this act.   
 
SECTION 5. The Affordable Housing Trust Fund, as permitted by the ordinance 
establishing said Affordable Housing Trust Fund and its governing documents, shall use 
revenue from the fees raised pursuant to this act to fund affordable housing programs 
including, but not limited to, limited equity arrangements, community land trusts, 
purpose-built housing, and other programs to underwrite the affordability of properties 
with a preference, where permitted by applicable law, for current and recent Cambridge 
residents and employees.  
 
SECTION 6. The City shall prepare and issue an annual report that (i) identifies fee 
receipts by payer category including buyers and sellers; (ii) quantifies affordable housing 
programs funded, including type and purpose, and (iii) evaluates the impact of said

possible and permitted by applicable law, the number and demographics of individuals

Jerry’s Pond and the adjacent land surrounding it are historically, ecologically and 
culturally significant natural resources and a significant body of water for North 
Cambridge residents and the wider Cambridge community; and 
 
Jerry’s Pond has been a long-standing topic of discussion, as revitalization, restoration 
and reopening this land continues to be an issue of health, social and environmental 
equity in Cambridge, as it is the closest green space to approximately 4,000 Cambridge 
residents living in affordable housing along Rindge Avenue; and 
 
Jerry’s Pond and the land surrounding it were historically known as “The Great 
Swamp” and were tidal marshlands connected to the Mystic River via the Alewife 
Brook; and 
 
The natural environment and habitat has continued to thrive in the land surrounding 
Jerry’s Pond and connected wetlands including the Alewife Reservation, Yates Pond 
and the Little River; and 
 
Jerry’s Pond and the land surrounding it are at great risk of climate change impacts via 
heat island, extreme rainfall events, storm surge and sea level rise over the coming 
years; and 
 
Jerry’s Pond and the neighborhoods surrounding it are already subject to flooding, heat 
island, poor air quality, tree canopy loss and natural habitat diminution; and 
 
Jerry’s Pond and the neighborhoods around it are at risk of direct negative health 
outcomes due to increasing development of the built environment and related 
transportation and air-quality impacts; and 
 
Jerry’s Pond and the surrounding neighborhoods have been identified as an area of 
great environmental justice concern given the large underserved population, historic 
inequities and disinvestment in infrastructure; and 
 
Jerry’s Pond and the surrounding land are a Massachusetts Hazardous Material Site 
(MGL c. 21E) site with known pollution including asbestos, petroleum and 
naphthalene, and are subject to an Activity and Use Limitation and a City of 
Cambridge Asbestos Ordinance and are surrounded by dense residential communities 
which are at risk; and

WHEREAS: 

Vulnerable communities, families, and individuals in Cambridge and across the 
Commonwealth are dangerously impacted by environmental pollution and climate 
change; and 
 
The Cambridge City Council adopted a resolution in 2017 affirming the goal of 
operating the city entirely on renewable energy by 2035, and our official goal is to 
achieve zero emissions by 2050 
 
H.2836, “An Act re-powering Massachusetts with 100 percent renewable energy” 
would transition Massachusetts completely off of fossil fuels and would facilitate 
Cambridge achieving its energy and emission goals; and 

 
At least 14 states have already passed renewable energy targets that are more 
aggressive than what Massachusetts currently has in place, and H.2836 would 
transition the Commonwealth to 100% renewable electricity by 2035 and 100% 
renewable energy sources for heating and transportation by 2045; and 
 
H.2836 would establish a council for clean energy workforce development, which 
would recommend ways to promote employment growth and access to jobs in the 
renewable energy sector, and would also be charged with establishing a target for the 
number of Massachusetts residents working in the clean energy industry by 2025; and 
 
A pair of bills, “An Act Relative to Environmental Justice in the Commonwealth” 
(H.826) and “An Act Relative to Environmental Justice and Toxics Reduction in the 
Commonwealth” (H.761), would codify environmental justice into state law for the 
first time, protecting communities of color from being unjustly targeted by polluting 
industries; and 
 
This pair of bills would protect vulnerable communities from pollution by requiring 
that environmental impact reports include a consideration of public health impacts and 
account for vulnerable communities when siting dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure 
and other polluting infrastructure; and 
 
The pair of bills would create a Supplemental Environmental Project (SEP) bank, 
which would maintain an inventory of environmentally beneficial projects in 
vulnerable communities that may be funded by violators in lieu of paying penalties 
associated with the settlement of enforcement actions; and

WHEREAS:  Massachusetts and Cambridge must lead on issues of climate change and 

environmental justice, and 
 
These policies failed to advance out of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, 
Utilities and Energy, but it is essential that they are included as part of any climate 
legislation worked on at the Statehouse this session; now therefore be it 

 
That the City Council go on record in enthusiastic support of H.2836, H.826, and 
H.761, and in urging the Massachusetts Legislature and Governor Baker to enact the 
provisions of all three bills into law before the end of the session; and be it further

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 
 
WHEREAS: 

Routine traffic stops disproportionately impact Black and Brown drivers, who are 
pulled over and searched more often than white drivers, leading to potentially stressful 
interactions with the police; and 

 
This racist outcome is not the result of biases by individual officers, although those 
may play a role, but rather is primarily the result of systemic biases, including over-
policing in Black neighborhoods, and training of police officers to be hypervigilant and 
to expect violent resistance, despite such incidents being very rare; and 
 
The presence of an armed police officer during a routine traffic stop raises the tension 
of the encounter unnecessarily and can itself lead to conflict, causing harmful stress to 
both parties and damaging the relationship between police and the community; and 
 
Routine traffic enforcement can be conducted by unarmed employees of the city, 
which would reduce the possibility of violence during such encounters; and 
 
The police would still be responsible for apprehending known criminals, dangerous or 
erratic drivers, and other related situations that clearly go beyond routine traffic 
enforcement; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager look into transferring primary traffic enforcement 
responsibilities from the Cambridge Police Department to unarmed, trained 
enforcement personnel in the Traffic & Parking Department, Department of Public 
Works, Health & Human Services, or another suitable department; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter as soon as possible.

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

Cambridge has resumed towing as part of street cleaning as of July 1st, 2020; and 
 
Towing fees start at $100 for a regular vehicle and are in addition to a $30 ticket issued 
by the Traffic & Parking Department; and 
 
The burden of retrieving a towed vehicle and paying these fees disproportionately 
impact low income residents, especially during the pandemic; and 
 
The city resumed street cleaning in June without towing vehicles and determined the 
results to be “less than satisfactory”, but other cities have been able to achieve 
satisfactory results during street cleaning without towing vehicles as part of the 
process; and 

WHEREAS:  More thought should be given to less punitive measures that would allow for an 

effective cleaning of the streets without a burdensome towing process, including (but 
not limited to) escalating ticketing fees and continuing to tow vehicles that repeatedly 
fail to comply; and 

WHEREAS: 

It may take time to see satisfactory and consistent results after changes are made; now 
therefore be it 

 
ORDERED: 

 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the appropriate 
departments to conduct street cleaning without towing for the remainder of the 2020 
season, and to employ other methods including (but not limited to) an escalating 
ticketing schedule that would continue to incentivize compliance; and be it further 

 

ORDERED: 

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council at 
the end of the 2020 street cleaning season on the feasibility of permanently abandoning 
regular towing as part of the street cleaning process.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and

In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal

WHEREAS: 

The Y2Y Network (Y2Y) is a student-driven shelter and resource network serving 
young unhoused people in the Cambridge area and beyond. Its mission is to interrupt 
the cycle of homelessness for a generation of young adults, and connects these youth 
with services and skills for long-term success; and 
 
Y2Y is the only youth-to-youth model shelter in the country, and emphasizes the work 
and impact young students can have on the lives of unhoused youth. The shelter 
teaches values of service and local engagement to students while serving as a critical 
sanctuary for vulnerable youth in Cambridge; and 
 
Y2Y is a program of the Phillips Brooks House Association (PBHA), a Harvard 
College-affiliated non-profit, which represents a critical part of Harvard community 
contributions to the City of Cambridge; and 
 
Y2Y is facing dramatic challenges in recent months due to COVID-19. The shelter is 
receiving financial support by the City of Cambridge, which is set to expire in August. 
Y2Y will not be able to operate in the fall without continued financial support, and 
estimates the need for $50k / month beginning in the fall to re-open; and 
 
The shelter’s fall prospects are further endangered by student staffing shortages caused 
by Harvard restrictions on student involvement in off-campus programming. These 
students are the heart of Y2Y, and play a critical role in providing services and passing 
down knowledge about running a safe and respectful shelter; therefore be it so 
 
That the City Council go on record to support funding by the City of Cambridge of an 
additional $30k per month for the Y2Y Network to operate in the fall; and be it further 
 
That the City Council go on record to request that Harvard University partners with the 
City on funding the Y2Y Network, and provide the additional $20k per month that the 
shelter needs to remain operational; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to make a formal request to Harvard 
University for the partnership described above to fund the Y2Y Network; and be it 
further 
 
That a copy of this policy order be sent to the President of Harvard University, the 
PBHA, and the Harvard Office of Public Affairs and Communicatons.

The Government Operations Committee will meet to discuss extending the contract of City 
Manager Louis A. DePasquale beyond January 2021. 

Meeting called to order at 10:02 AM. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  2:03   
Good morning. The hour of the meeting having come, I will call this meeting to order. I am Denise Simmons, Chair 
of  the  Government  Operations  and  Claims  committee.  Here  present  with  us  today  are  Councillors  Zondervan, 
Sobrinho-Wheeler. We have with us Nancy Glowa from the Law Department. Also in attendance is Mayor Siddiqui, 
Councillor  Toomey,  Neal  Alpert  from  my  staff.  I  thought  I  saw  somewhere  Patty  Nolan,  has  she  left  us?  Oh, 
Councillor Nolan, and of course, our clerk, Anthony Wilson. I'll begin by going over - and I do want to welcome 
Councillor Carlone. Members of the Government Operations Committee are Councillor McGovern, Councillor... I 
can't  read  my  own  writing...    Toomey,  Zondervan,  myself  and  McGovern  and  Councillor  Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
Councillor McGovern is away, this happens to be school vacation week and so he's away with his family, so please 
let the record show that he is an excused absence.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  3:13   
I want to thank everyone for coming to this morning's meeting of the Government Operations, Rules, and Claims 
Committee. The call is as follows: "the Government Operations Committee will discuss  extending the contract of 
the City Manager, Louie A. DePasquale's contact beyond January 2021." On February 3, 2020, as per his contract, 
Mr.  DePasquale  formally notified  the  City  Council  in  writing  of  his  wishes  to  enter  into  discussion  to  extend his 
contract as City Manager. Just for people's information, he first assumed this role in November 2016. And after a 
search  process  that  was  led  by  an  outside  consultant  that  saw  the  City  Council  review  the  candidates  in  the  City 
Council at that time. There was a very strong pool of candidates and the City chose to appoint Mr. DePasquale as 
our city manager.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  4:09   
I can only speak from my own personal experience by saying I've enjoyed a productive working relationship with 
Mr.  DePasquale  over  the  past  few  years,  working  to  making  his  office  open,  accessible,  and  collaborative.  Mr. 
DePasquale has demonstrated a willingness to put his own stamp on the office, to think creatively and to strive to do

what he thinks is in the best interest of the city. And in those incidents where his office has been met with criticism, 
he  has  shown  a  willingness  to  listen  and  the  desire  to  find  common  ground.  In  those  instances  where  Mr. 
DePasquale and I have not always seen eye to eye, I've appreciated his willingness to work with me to see if we can 
make an adequate compromise.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  4:51   
Certainly,  the  past  few  years  have  not  been  without  challenges  to  the  city,  to  the  city  manager,  and  to  the  city 
council, but I believe we're in a  solid position to start discussing how we  will address  tomorrow's challenges and 
opportunities together. So, the city manager having met  the requirement of notifying the city council in writing of 
his intention to extend his contract, the city manager's request is now before the Government Operations committee. 
You each have a copy of the city manager's letter dated January 30, 2020 in front of you. In the coming weeks, this 
committee will request that Mr. DePasquale provide the details of what he envisions his contract extension to look 
like. Starting with today's hearing, I would also ask the members of the Government Operations committee to start 
discussing what we think of this extension and what Mr. DePasquale's contract would look like. I also just want to 
remind everyone -- am I speaking loud enough for everybody? Okay.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  5:48   
I will also like to remind everyone here that the role of the Government Operations committee in this process is to 
establish the parameters of the discussion for the city manager's contract extension. This committee does not vote on 
the  contract.  in  terms  of  finality,  or  make  the  ultimate  decision  in  the  matter.  That  has  to  be  voted  by  the  full 
Council. We merely are charged with determining what the details of the contract extension would look like. And 
then we would send that to the full Council for the Council to vote up or down. In a moment, I'm going to open the 
floor  for  discussion.  That  will  then  be  followed  by  Public Comment.  And  so  I believe  there's  a  sign  up  sheet  for 
people that want to speak on the record. And that time allotment for speaking on the record is three minutes. We 
would ask that you do not engage in personalities, direct all your comments to the Chair, and through the Chair you 
speak to the entire body. At that time, after Public Comment, we'll go back to the committee - we do have to take at 
least one vote this morning, and that is to just to accept the letter that is in front of you. Because what happened at 
the City Council meeting, when it came through the portal of Communications, it was forwarded to this committee. 
This  committee  now  has  to  accept  it.  That  would  be  the  only  vote  that  we  will  probably  take  today.  With  that  I 
would like to open the floor for discussion. Councillor Zondervan, would you like to begin? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  7:14   
Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you for those opening remarks. I certainly have also found Mr. DePasquale to be a 
pleasure  to  work  with.  And  I  am  interested  in  how  this  process  moves  forward.  And,  in  particular,  there  are  two 
questions on my mind. One is how do we initiate a formal evaluation of his performance? And second, how do we 
initiate a search for city manager, and I believe both of those things could and should happen, regardless of whether 
we ultimately decide to extend the city manager's current contract. I think we should have a transparent process and 
we should have a formal evaluation of his accomplishments, and areas that we would like to see improvement. And I 
also think that given the likelihood that he will, if we extend this contract, only serve for two or three more years, 
that we should have a further discussion about the search process for finding the next city manager to lead our city. 
Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  8:48   
Thank you. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler.  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  8:50   
Thank you, Madam Chair. When I think about the city manager's contract, I think of it in two parts. The first part -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  8:57   
Councillor  Sobrinho-Wheeler,  may  I  ask  if  you'd  speak  just  a  little  bit  slower,  and  more  deliberately,  because 
people,  I  can  see  the  look  on  their  face.  A  little  slower  and  louder.  So  as  someone  said,  "would  you  ask  the 
committee to articulate better?" Not to say that you should, but I'm going to try and, I would ask everyone, just for 
the  record.  We're  using  a  different  software.  And  that  software,  if  we  don't  articulate  well,  doesn't  capture  what 
we've said well. So we're going to try to practice doing that. Very good. Thank you, you have the floor.

7.1

Thank you, Madam Chair. When I think  about the  city manager's contract,  I think about it in two parts. The first 
being  sort  of  the  executive  role  in  government  -  how  responsive  is  he  to  the  council,  how  well  is  he  in  carrying 
things  out?  And  on  those  parts,  I  think  he  has  been  quite  responsive.  Great  to  work  with.  The  much  larger  part 
though, is carrying out the policy goals of the Council. I was looking at the City Council goals. Before this meeting, 
Goal  One  -increase  access  to  affordable  housing  for  all  income  groups;  Goal  Six,  make  it  easy  to  move  safely 
through the city, especially by sustainable modes of transportation, pedestrian access bike access, so what I think of 
on things like that; Goal Eight,  ensure  that Cambridge remains an innovation hub that integrates businesses of all 
sizes into a thriving ecosystem, and things like that -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  10:21   
I lost you at Goal Six, I'm sorry. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  10:24   
Sure.  Goal  Six  -  make  it  easy  to  move  safely  through  the  city,  especially  by  sustainable  modes  of  transportation, 
transportation; Goal Eight - ensure that Cambridge remains an innovation hub that integrates businesses of all sizes 
into a thriving ecosystem. And Goal 10 ensures that these budget allocates resources responsibly and responsively. 
On things like that, I think, municipal broadband and the lack of progress we've made there. So that's I think, the 
much larger part I think of when I think of the city manager's contract. I was also looking at the the city manager's 
contract  that  was  adopted  in  2016,  I  believe,  before  the  meeting,  and  in  Section  2.3:  "the  city  shall  review  and 
evaluate the performance of the city manager at meetings scheduled by the government operations committee." So 
that  was  my  question,  just  if  there  have  been  any  evaluations  since  then.  And  then  if  not,  or  if  so,  even,  I  think 
before we can consider an extension of the city manager's contract, we've really got to conduct an evaluation as the 
council - probably even just beyond this committee - to allow other folks to weigh in, and to decide if that's the route 
we want to go down or if there's another route, we want to go down. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  11:37   
Thank you for your comments. Ms. Nolan, do you have any comments? I realize you are not a voting member, but 
you are present and we'd like to hear from you. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  11:48   
Thank you, Madam Mayor  - or Madam Chair. I'm excited to be here, I realized this is one of the most important 
decisions  we  can  ever  make  as  an  entire  Council.  And  in  my  short  term  here,  and  in  my  long  service  on  School 
Committee, I certainly have seen many of the ways in which the city has moved forward. The questions I have echo 
part  of  what  was  already  said  by  Councilors  Zondervan  and  Sobrinho-Wheeler.  Those  of  you  -  Madam  Chair, 
yourself, who have served on the School Committee - know that there's a very clear process laid out for the review 
of the superintendent, which is what I would love to have us, if we haven't done that in the past already, to build on 
that. Reviews are critically important for good management and good governance. This isn't just about "oh, this is 
where you need to do, this is where you're failing." It really is wow, these are the goals you set up. This is where you 
succeeded. Here's ways in which we can celebrate what it is that you did. I also believe it would be really helpful, if 
we  haven't  done  it  in  the  past,  to  do  a  full  360  review,  which  for  someone  like  the  city  manager  would  include 
people who work in the city, those of us who are his bosses, but also outside elements. I know we did that on School 
Committee  -  reaching  out  to  the  institutional  partners,  to  the  business  community.  So  I  would  love  to  see  that 
process to help all of us understand as we move forward, and to fulfill the terms of the contract, actually have done 
it.  
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  13:21   
My  questions  related  to  the  letter  include  a  really  clear  focus  on  what  the  specific  plans  are  moving  forward  to 
address these? For instance, as the Council itself, before I got on, has expressed very clearly, a desire to address the 
equity issue of the digital divide, which has been ongoing for more than a decade. I know the school's talked about it 
a lot, in our schools. But the City, it's another issue to really move forward on something I believe the Council has 
already pushed forward, which is to take the next steps to see if municipal broadband - which ends up saving people 
across the city money in the long term - that's an example where what's mentioned as a digital equity study, I'd like 
some more specifics on what's the commitment going forward to the specific ways in which we'll address some of 
the issues that are outlined which the safe streets, the biking, the affordable housing. And another comment: as we 
move forward on the Tobin Vassal Lane project, as the Council also recognizes that we're now working to see if we 
can make that project even more beneficial to the city by working to acquire the armory, it really needs a full court

press to the state to understand if it's even possible, because that would give us the possibility of expanding not only 
a little bit of open space, but an Early Education Center, which I know this council has gone on record for wanting 
for a decade. I don't like that Somerville beat us to it 15 years ago with the Capuano Center, and also put affordable 
housing in an area of the city that needs it. So that frames for me the ways that I'm approaching this decision that 
we'll be making as we move forward. And I'm glad the process is started now so that we have plenty of time before 
the end of this contract to understand where we're going. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  15:09   
Thank you for your comments. Councillor Carlone? Please speak loudly for our audience.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  15:18   
Oh, I usually don't have a problem with that. Yes, I will. Following on my fellow councillors' comments, I think the 
world of our manager as a person. I have found him extremely responsive and very tight with money, which is his 
background. I think as far as in his letter, he mentions he's going for the rating with the different companies and that 
it would be important to say that what his future is. I mean, he is going to be a manager for at least another year, and 
likely beyond that. And I would simply  say: "Review is in process. We've started the review. And obviously, he's 
number  one."  But  this  is  what  bothers  me,  and  I've  had  these  same  discussions  with  Louie,  and  some  cases  with 
other  councillors.  We  have  City  Council  goals  -  that  was  brought  up  by  Councillor  Sobrinho-Wheeler  -  and  the 
number one is affordable housing. And half a percentage point of the budget goes toward affordable housing. And 
there's no way that our number one priority is being properly funded if it's half of 1%. After that is education and 
employment,  and  I  include  in  that  pre-K,  and  I  realize  Louie's  only  come  on  in  the  last  two  years.  I'm  disgusted 
when I think about the lack of pre-K. And here's the reason why: we cite in the letter that we are the most successful 
financially based (and I've talked to Louie about this) city in the state. I actually think we might be in the country. 
And the reason is Brookline (which I believe is a AAA), Boston (which I know is a AAA), and Somerville use 99-
plus percent of what they're allowed to tax. And I know taxes are a dirty word. We use 68% of our taxes that we're 
allowed to tax. So "Dennis, what are you talking about? You're going to just make everything crazy." Our taxes are 
three quarters of Boston. They're 50% of the suburbs, if not a third of the suburbs; our taxes are very low. So what 
does this mean? 20 million more in the budget is $140 more per average house. $103 a week will gain us 20 million 
more, and  we  can't even get there. I know, Madam Chair, you proposed 20 million more for affordable housing  - 
either a year ago or two years ago, I don't recall now - the whole Council agreed. It didn't go up.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  18:42   
When I discovered this information about how much we tax versus other cities, we got it up $5 million. Councillor 
Zondervan and I went in to talk to him. Who knows if we're going be wealthy 10 years from now? When I moved 
here in the early 70s, Cambridge was in terrible shape. Things can change. And if you don't use the funds that are 
available, we've left a billion dollars on the table. I'm not saying we should use even a third of that, but we've left it 
on  the  table  over  the  last  eight  years.  And  if  you  got  it  in  your  pocket,  and  there  were  issues,  transportation, 
affordable housing, environmental, pre-K, what are we  waiting for? And that's the part that disturbs me. And I've 
told Louie this. As a person, I can honestly say I love the guy. As a manager, he's open to us anytime. I brought up a 
couple of issues that are difficult and we've talked about them, and he's tried to resolve them. I give him enormous 
credit for that. But when it comes to budgets, and city goals, we're not doing it. And that's the part that disturbs me. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  20:11   
I suspect we will want him, including me, to be manager. But that part's got to change, as far as I'm concerned. What 
are we doing here? The goals are supposed to be based on the Council's - the budget's supposed to be based on the 
Council's goals. It's not. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  20:32   
Thank you, Councillor Carlone. Councillor Toomey? 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  20:34   
Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess we all have different perspectives on what Council goals have been achieved and 
not  achieved  and  how  even  Council  has  not  achieved  their  goals  of  affordable  housing.  So  you're  talking  about 
affordable housing, and yet voted against the Housing Overlay, which would have provided thousands of more units 
of  affordable  housing  there.  So  yes,  we  all  have  different  perspectives  on  how  this  is  laid  out.  We  are,  and 
everybody here admits, we're the envy of the country with the services we  are providing to our residents. Are we

perfect? Absolutely not. Is there more that we can do? Absolutely. But there is a point that I've seen in the past. And 
it happened probably about 10 years ago when there was all of a sudden a sharp increase in West Cambridge taxes. 
And there was - talk about a revolution coming out of that neighborhood about increasing the taxes then. So it's a 
balance. And I think the manager has done an admirable job, with the Council and the administration, to have that 
balance and providing the great services, but at the same time, maintaining the financial stability of the city. And I'm 
looking  forward  to  more  discussion  on  the  pre-K.  I  think  that's  extremely  important.  But  at  the  same  time  I'm 
looking at that, I want to make sure that when we do with the pre-k that it's income based, because what I'm afraid of 
is wealthy families from outside the city are going to say "Wait a minute, I don't have to be paying $30,000 a year in 
childcare, I can send my kids free to the public schools." So they're going to force out low and working class tenants 
in the city. So that's a discussion I think that has to be pursued.  
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  22:15   
So there's an evaluation I think is important that we start that as soon as  possible. To Councillor Zondervan's point 
about simultaneously having a search for new city manager while we're discussing whether we're going to extend 
the city manager's contract, makes absolutely no sense to me at all. I don't know who would apply to a position that's 
not  vacant.  Either  we  renew  it  or  we  don't  renew  it  and  then  you  start  a  search  process.  But  to  do  two 
simultaneously, I think just sends a terrible signal to prospective candidates that might want to come to the city, but 
would  be  saying  "Why  would  I  apply  if  there's  a  possibility  that  the  current  manager's  contract  is  going  to  be 
extended?" A lot of people don't want to put their names out there to jeopardize their current positions and let their 
current employer know that they're going to apply for the position. So I think it would be best to do an evaluation, as 
always  very  transparent,  that  we  do  in  this  council.  And  with  public  process,  public  input.  And  then  the  council, 
that's  our  decision,  that's  among  the  most  important  decisions  that  the  residents  elect  us  to  do.  And  I  think  that 
should be the process. I think, today, the manager has submitted his intentions to seek an extension. I think it would 
be appropriate for the Chair of the Government Operations Committee to meet with the City Manager to see what 
the parameters are of what he possibly is looking for the extension or renewal. And then come back to the committee 
and  then  we  can  come  up  with  a  process  to  conduct  an  evaluation  and  back  and  forth  between  the  public,  the 
Council,  and  the  City  Manager.  But  this  is  our  most  important  decision.  And  when  you  look  at  these 
accomplishments - and I know Councillor Nolan mentioned the Tobin - there's no other community in the state that's 
building  three  brand  new  schools  for  our  kids  for  the  greatest  education  possible.  There's  still  inequities  in  the 
system,  there's  no  question  about  that.  And  the  new  mayor  and  the new  school  committee  are  really  delving  into 
that. But at least in my strong opinion, you cannot spend every single penny that  we have. I think that would just 
jeopardize a lot. And I actually just asked Mr. Kale for a list of the highest residential people who pay in taxes, and I 
would venture to say that some people are paying upwards of 100 grand on residential taxes. So you're hitting the 
middle  class  when  you  raise  the  taxes.  So  it's  a  delicate  balance  and  I  think  the  Manager  and  his  staff  and  the 
Council have done an admirable job of trying to keep diversity in the city. So a lot of challenges facing us. And I am 
looking forward to the evaluation process and listening from the manager, listening from the public, and go forth. 
But I just don't see the the wisdom of conducting a search process for a position that's not vacant. That's my opinion. 
Thank you.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  25:40   
Thank you Councillor Toomey. Before I open the floor to public comment, I want to see if there was anyone  - our 
mayor has not spoken. I want to give the opportunity to see if she would like to speak before I hear from anyone 
else. So if you don't mind demuring - Madam Mayor. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  25:56   
Thank you. I wanted to allow the committee members and others to speak before I did. I think we have a few paths 
forward. I think that per the contract, some kind of evaluation is necessary. And, you know, I think the solicitor's 
office can work with us on that. And you as chair, how does an evaluation get done? What questions are we asking? 
You know, what's the data that we're looking for? Right. And I think this goes back to goals. This goes back to other 
things. And I think we've individually had conversations with the city manager on different things, and I think he'd 
be happy to probably talk about the things, and he's laid out a few things that he's passionate about and some things 
that you know, we have a right to ask about. So I think we can move forward in that process, I think with regard to 
the search, I think we have to - I wasn't involved in that search for the city manager in the past.

But I think what comes up about searches in general, is - I think the big question is like: what are we looking for? 
And who do we want? Right? And I think those are meaty questions. And I think it doesn't have to be this formal. 
I'm  not  thinking  of  it  as  a  formal  search  process,  in  particular.  I'm  thinking  that  the  Government  Ops  committee 
would set up parameters around what a future search looks like, and reflect on lessons learned from the past search. 
And think about what a future city manager  - who we want that person to be. So I think that's how I was thinking 
about a search and that doesn't necessarily  - it can happen after a potential extension, if that's the will of the City 
Council. So those are just my general thoughts. I am not a voting member  of this committee. I am eager to follow 
what the community does and support you in whatever way I can.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  28:19   
Thank you. Councillor Zondervan, you have the floor.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  28:21   
Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  I  just  wanted  to  respond  through  you  to  my  colleague,  and  appreciate  the  mayor's 
comments.  I  perhaps  didn't  explain  myself  correctly,  I  was  not  suggesting  that  we  do  a  search  and  renew  the 
manager's contract. I completely agree with my colleague that we should decide to extend the manager's contract or 
not.  And  in  addition  to  that,  if  we  do  extend  the  contract,  then  as  the  mayor  suggests,  we  should  start  having  a 
conversation about what a search would look like. Because that's  - if we do a two year extension, that, you know, 
search takes at least a year. And so that gives us about a year to, to really build up to that and set the parameters and 
have a real conversation about what we're looking for. So I think it is appropriate regardless of whether we renew 
this contract or not to have a conversation about what a search would look like, and how we would structure that and 
when we would initiate it. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  29:28   
Thank you, Councillor. Are there any other people that wanted to make comment before we open public comment? 
Hearing  none,  we  will  now  move  to  Public  Comment.  And  I  just  want  to  remind  folks,  Public  Comment  is  this 
process where anyone that is signed up can speak to any item which is on our agenda, which is just a discussion 
about the idea of this city manager, extending his contract. Each individual should open by giving their name and 
address  for  the  record.  Direct  their  comments  to  the  chair,  please  avoid  personalities,  and  the  amount  of  time 
allocated to each speaker is three minutes. So I will - our able Clerk will be keeping the time. Our first person who 
has signed up to speak is Charles Schmidt, followed by Michael Goodman. 
 
Christopher Schmidt  30:26   
Christopher Schmidt 17 Laurel Street. Thank you very much for your time and for having this meeting. I have been 
active in Cambridge politics for the past several years, having gotten involved in Cambridge politics after hearing 
and seeing the city manager's reticence to move forward with the outcome of the Universal Broadband Task Force. 
Over  the  course  of  2017,  the  city  manager  chose  not  to  respond  to  seven  different  policy  orders.  And  as  I  have 
participated in Cambridge politics over the past two years, what I have found is that the idea that the city manager 
will respond to a policy order seems to be kind of up in the air at any given time. You know, how long it will take, 
what the response will be - I have been continually disappointed by the types of responses, we see, the timeliness of 
those responses, and the city manager's commitment to that outcome. I'm not in the city administration. I'm not on 
the  council. I  have not,  you know,  had  the  opportunity,  like  many of  you have,  to  interact  with  the  city  manager 
directly in the same way. But as a citizen attempting to stay informed of what is going on, how the city is meeting 
our  goals,  and  what  the  city's  plan  is  to  meet  those  goals,  I  feel  the  city  manager  has  done  a  poor  job  of 
communicating those issues back to the public; has done a poor job of meeting the demands of the city council, and 
has done a poor job as has been raised in a couple of different cases, meeting the council's priorities. When we look 
at issues like  equity, one of the council's key goals. I think that the city has not done as well as it could. And, of 
course, as a member of Upgrade Cambridge and municipal broadband being one of the focuses that brought me into 
this  area,  you  know,  no  progress  has  been  made  on  the  issue  of  municipal  broadband  despite  a  unanimous 
recommendation from the task force to move forward, despite a straightforward set of steps to move forward. And I 
have seen relatively little, you know, evaluation of that lack of performance in the city manager's actions over the 
past several years. So I think this was raised several times by members of this group, that evaluation is important as 
I'm doing my own self evaluation at work every six months, I have to tell my bosses how I think I'm doing and I 
haven't seen that type of self evaluation. I would expect that from anyone who I think is working on my behalf, and I 
think the city manager is attempting to work on my behalf. And so I would ask the council to really be looking at 
that  and  in  your  position,  I  think  I  would  have  a  hard  time  supporting  the  city  manager's  for  an  extension  of  his

contract. But if that is the path is going to move forward, I think a much more serious evaluation of how the city 
manager is meeting those goals and how his performance is, versus the city council's request, is important. Thank 
you very much for your time. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  33:16   
Thank you for your testimony. Michael Goodman, followed by Alan Green. 
 
Michael Goodman  33:25   
Hi,  my  name  is  Mike  Goodman.  I  live  at  237  Franklin  Street  apartment  811.  So  I  have  a  prepared  statement.  So 
sorry if I drift around, but I also like, I kind of don't - I'm trying to catch on, but like some of the wonky details, I'm 
sure other people will cover. I just want to raise a couple of points. I just want to think about the people living in this 
city  right  now  who  are  -  they're  struggling  and  suffering  and  think  about  the  material  conditions.  I  know  it  does 
seem like from, what I'm picking up on, we do seem to be doing okay financially and there's so many ways that we 
could improve people's lives. I know, at least one city councilor is new this term who campaigned partially on, you 
know, making some material improvements. And that kind of points me to the second issue I wanted to raise, was 
that I think to a lot of people, maybe not to people in this room here, but I think to a lot of people in general, the way 
our  city  government  works  can  be  confusing. I  know  it  was  confusing  for  me  till  very recently,  even  though  I've 
lived here for like six or seven years, I think a lot of people don't understand just how important the city manager is 
for an unelected position. So, going back to what I said, like  I know we  elected one new person making some  of 
these  ideas  for  better  housing,  transit,  municipal  broadband.  That's  just  one  person.  I'm  hearing  other  people  talk 
about schools. I hope that the council, regardless of whether the city manager gets renewed or we have a new one, I 
hope,  it  seems  to  me  like  the  policies  in  the  past  have  been  a  little  too  restrictive  in  terms  of  like,  making  the 
commitments to make these improvements and I feel like the people of this city would really like that to happen. All 
right. That's all. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  35:28   
Thank you for your comments. Our next speaker is Alan Green, followed by Ben Simon. 
 
Alan Green  35:38   
Alan Green, 82 Fifth Street. Madam Chair, earlier a member here mentioned having some sort of criterion or method 
for  determining  whether  or  not  the  city  manager's  contract  should  be  extended.  And  with  that,  also,  the  need  for 
transparency. As I stand here, I don't see that being possible because I don't vote for the city manager. I'm a resident 
here, I have no part of that process. That is all with the City Council. So I would like to see a method where we can 
vote, and we can decide, we determine the criterion. And that's all transparent. Beyond that, I participate sometimes 
on internet forums where people talk about issues in Cambridge, the neighborhood, whatever neighborhood it might 
be. I don't really write too much with that. But there are people who write a lot. And sometimes people  - the things 
that they write - I disagree with almost every time they write something. In one case, one such individual wrote a 
rebuttal of something that somebody else wrote. And that individual, put some maps of how people from Cambridge 
voted in the last election for the City Council. And in spite of what his argument was, I looked at those maps and I 
found them very interesting, because it showed every single candidate that ran - I don't know how many candidates, 
there were like twenty or something - so, what I learned is from the people who were actually voted into the council 
seat, six, around six out of nine, definitely  were voted from specific districts or areas. And so what I would say is 
that we need to change our system of government here. We need to have a mayor who's accountable, who's voted by 
the people. We need to divide up the city councilors salary amongst the councilors and the mayor and have it so that 
the City of Cambridge the people are voting for that mayor, and that's the mayor who's in charge. If it's the default 
that people are voting district by district, we need to make it a district based system. So I'm in essence saying we 
should not extend this contract. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  37:42   
Thank you for your testimony. Ben Simon, followed by Richard Crushnick. 
 
Ben Simon  37:49   
Hi, Ben Simon 67 Bishop Allen Dr. I have prepared a statement. In his time as city manager Louis A. DePasquale 
has run the city frugally, like a business, bringing in huge amounts of tax revenue from commercial development 
and keeping spending relatively low. But there is an extremely ugly cost to this system. By constantly driving rents 
higher, all this commercial development is displacing many of our most vulnerable residents and destroying many

vitally important businesses. It seems like every week there are more stores closing, formerly affordable buildings 
being  luxurified,  and  neighbors  gone.  Again,  this  is  not  an  accident.  This  is  a  predictable  trend  caused  by  a  city 
planning  style  funded  by gentrification.  We  can  reverse  these  trends,  but  it  will  not  be  possible  without  a  radical 
shift  away  from  the  style  of  governance  practiced  by  our  current  city  manager.  And  we  can  look  to  other  cities 
across the country and around the world that are dealing with some of the same problems for inspiration. In Seattle, 
socialist city councillor Kshama Sawant is fighting to pass a progressive tax on the richest businesses in her city in 
order to build thousands of permanently affordable, city owned social housing units. We could raise taxes on our 
local 1%, Harvard, MIT, big tech and Big Pharma, and do the same and much more. Along similar lines, Montreal is 
now using the right of first refusal to purchase private buildings that are up for sale to make into social housing. In 
Baldwin, Florida, the disappearance of affordable grocery stores led the town to open and run its own city owned 
grocery store. Meanwhile, central square is already an affordable food desert. And if a republican town can do this 
in Florida, why on earth can't the so-called People's Republic of Cambridge? But grocery stores of course aren't the 
only casualty of our current system. From EMF to Green Street, the so called "cultural district" is losing art space 
after  art  space.  Faced  with  a  similar  problem,  Vancouver  opened  a  city  owned  art  space  that  provides  affordable 
spaces to over 20 artists last year. Of course, it'd be very easy to keep funding our city through luxury development. 
We don't have to anger the powerful by raising their taxes, and those that we harm like this won't be here very long 
to complain. But if we want to live up to our values as a city, I urge you to hire a city manager with the courage and 
vision  to  help  build  a  Cambridge  that  truly  lives  up  to  our  stated  values.  And  this  cannot  be  done  unless  social 
spending is vastly increased and funded by progressive taxation instead of displacement driving development. And 
it's  already  been noted by  previous  speakers,  but  I  just  wanted  to  reiterate  that  this  is  an  inherently  undemocratic 
position. And as you are, you know, our elected, city councilors are elected, are actually accountable to us, we are 
really looking to you to take this matter seriously. And make sure that we're not just, you know, keeping this guy in 
because that's what we're doing. Thank you.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  40:49   
Thank you for your testimony. No clapping please. I ask that you honor the decorum that is called for in this room. 
The  reason  why  we  discourage  clapping,  hooting,  screaming,  booing  -  it's  so  that  everyone  feels  comfortable, 
whether  they  are  for  or  against.  We  want  everyone  to  feel  equal  in  their  ability  to  give  their  opinion.  And  so  it 
always  feels  good  to  say  "atta  person"  to  someone  that  says  something  that  you  like,  but  it  may  also  discourage 
someone that might have a dissenting opinion. So I would respectfully ask that you not make commentary verbally 
or non verbally. Thank you.  
 
Richard Crushnick  41:35   
Richard Crushnick, 20 Oak Street. I wanted to echo the comments of Dennis Carlone and Ben Simon. I agree with 
some  of  the  things  Ben  suggested  that  other  cities  are  doing,  not  all  of  them,  but  the  general  idea  that  Ben  is 
presenting, I also agree with. I find it  - Dennis is not suggesting that we spend every available penny. He made a 
suggestion that we  might consider spending $20 million out of the billion that we've left on the table, which isn't 
exactly  trying  to  spend  every  penny  that  we  can  spend.  I  think  to  say  that  the  city  is  making  great  strides,  great 
progress  in  maintaining  the  diversity  of  the  city  is  sort  of  a  sad  joke.  I  mean,  the  city's  demographic  statistics 
demonstrate how from 1960 to 2010, the city lost - the percentage of the city that were families was reduced by half. 
The percentage of the city that was zero to 19 years old was reduced by half. The percentage of the city that are 20 
to 40 years old was increased by some astronomical number, they are now half the city's entire population. The city 
is rapidly becoming a homogeneous city of highly paid 20 to 40 year olds and their young families. So don't tell me 
that the city is doing a great job of maintaining the diversity in the city, because it's not. And it can easily afford to 
do  so,  with  minimal,  minimal  impact  on  the  taxation  of  people.  So  I  think  it's  absolutely  crazy  to  renew  the  city 
manager's contract because we know exactly what we're getting if we do that. And it's  not what the city needs and 
can very easily afford to make really profound improvements in maintaining the diversity of the city and making it 
more  affordable.  Just  because  we're  spending  more  money  on  affordable  housing,  doing  everything  that  the 
developers  and  MIT  and  Big  Pharma  want,  drives  up  land  costs  so  high,  as  long  as  there's  infinite  demand,  you 
know, is the way the market is performing, that we're still displacing more people than we're keeping. Because the 
80% of the market units drive land costs up so much that it displaces more people than the 20% that we're keeping 
in. And if you can't count -- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  44:37   
Mr. Crushnick your time is expired, and I thank you for your testimony. Lee Farris, followed by Heather Hoffman.

Lee Farris  44:49   
Good morning, Mayor and councillors and Madam Chair. Lee Farris 269 Norfolk Street. I ask that this committee 
not  take  a  vote  yet  on  extending  the  manager's  contract,  and  that  instead  the  committee  work  to  put  in  place  a 
process to review the manager regularly with public input, and using criteria based in part on the council's priorities. 
I also ask that at the same time, the committee work to put in place a process to conduct a true nationwide search, 
including  what  the  committee  is  looking  for,  what  Cambridge  is  looking  for,  and  that  that  also  be open  to public 
input. I do not think we had a true nationwide search last time. I agree with the councilors who are saying that the 
council  priorities  should  be  used  in  evaluating  the  manager.  And  I  agree  that  affordable  housing,  broadband,  and 
many of the other things that folks have brought up need to be part of that evaluation process. I want to push back on 
the fact that the manager, during Envision, which I was appointed to the housing task force, or working group on, 
the  manager  promised  to  discuss  taxes  and  the  tax  base  and  the  ratio  of  commercial  to  housing  development. 
Because  we  were  told  during  the  Envision  process,  we  could  not  make  a  recommendation  on  the  proportion  of 
housing to commercial because we weren't in possession of the facts about how that would impact taxes. And the 
manager promised about a year and a quarter ago to deliver that information. He has not. And I think that, in terms 
of being able to govern the city, that's one of the most important things that needs to be understood and the manager 
has therefore continued the policy of the prior administrations that there has to be in any new development area 60% 
commercial and 40% housing. We are never going to be able to  house the people that we need to house, whether 
affordable or market, if we continue with that policy. So that's just one example where the manager has not come 
through on promises. I think the point about trying to get an understanding with the manager or an agreement about 
when a policy order is made to the manager, how long does he have to respond, would be really helpful in terms of 
better governance. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  47:44   
Thank  you  for  your  commentary.  And  for  anyone  that  has  written  comments,  please  leave  them  with  our  clerk. 
They'll  be  made  part  of  the  record,  or  if  they're  received by  12  o'clock  midnight  tonight,  they  can  be part  of  this 
record, there's a box somewhere, I can't see from here. Thank you, very good. The next speaker is Heather Hoffman 
fall by Saul Tannenbaum. Thank you.  
 
Heather Hoffman  48:24   
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street. And I want to talk about what kind of manager we need to take us into the 21st 
century. For about 40 years, because as was observed, Cambridge was in terrible fiscal shape, our policy has been 
shaped by getting money. It has not been shaped by figuring out how to make this a good place to live in, for the 
people  who  don't  have  a  lot  of  money,  or  for  people  who  have  some  money,  but  not  enough,  like  me.  It's  been 
shaped by figuring out how Cambridge can drag money into its coffers. And we don't look at much of anything else. 
We talk about a whole lot of other things. But, you know, by their work, we shall know them, and our works are 
getting money. We don't have a vision beyond that. Now, lots of us - that's why the city council has goals - lots of us 
think about vision. And I'm old enough to remember George H.W. Bush talking about "the vision thing" and how he 
didn't have it. Did that make him a bad person? No. It meant that that's not what he was good at. And what I see all 
over  the  place,  and  in  the  City  of  Cambridge,  and  just  throughout  this  society,  is  people  being  put  into  positions 
where the gifts that they have are not what's needed for that position. And I personally think that that is a disservice 
to everybody. Think about serial entrepreneurs. They're people who have a great idea, they are able to turn their idea 
into  something  to  build  a  business.  And  then  most  of  them  leave  because  their  gift  is  building  a  new  thing.  not 
keeping an existing thing going. Well, what we need at this point, because we all know that our city is hurting in a 
whole lot of ways, is someone who can figure out how to have a vision that goes beyond the checkbook. And if you 
think that the current city manager is that person then you should definitely extend his contract. But what I see -- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  51:24   
Ms.  Hoffman,  your  time  has  expired.  I  thank  you,  if  your  testimony  is  written  please  leave  it  in  the  box.  Saul 
Tannenbaum, followed by Carolyn Magid. 
 
Saul Tannenbaum  51:39   
Hi,  I'm  Saul  Tannenbaum,  16  Cottage  Street.  Madam  Chair,  councillors,  I'd  like  to  address  the  city  manager's 
request for extension and that letter, which I found really quite shocking. First, I'll just pose a question: Should the 
manager  actually  be  representing  that  his  contract  is  an  element  of  the  city's  financial  stability?  Shouldn't  he  be 
representing  that  he's  built  a  team  and  systems  that  would  keep  the  city  financially  stable,  regardless  of  what 
happens to him? I mean, after all, he's not going to live forever. So, you know, I mean, I think that just with the

starting  assumption,  the  council  should  look  really  skeptically  at  this  letter.  The  second  thing  I  would  add,  is  to 
contradict Mr. Simon who says the city is run like a business. The city isn't run like a business. There's no measure 
of efficiency or effectiveness. The  city manager's reluctant to spend a dollar, but from all appearances, he doesn't 
care  whether that dollar is spent well, whether it's getting you the results it's opposed to, whether the services are 
efficiently  delivered,  or  effectively  delivered.  Whoever  is  the  next  manager  of  this  city  -  that  should  be  fixed.  I 
mean, there's no other half-billion dollar a year enterprise that would not run without metrics of its health. That's just 
simply  shocking.  The  other  thing  that's  shocking  is  what  my  friend  Christopher  Schmidt  mentioned:  this  city 
manager is uncollegial. It may well be that he's a great guy behind closed doors. But I was watching the number of 
policy orders that went unresponded to at the end of last year - it was close to 100. That's just ridiculous. Either you 
guys are asking too much, which I don't think you are, or the city manager is incapable of responding. The primary 
example  of  that  is  municipal  broadband,  where  he  simply  cut  off  the  fact-finding  process.  He  simply  stopped  it 
without  talking  to  anybody,  and  without  responding  to  policy  order  after  policy  order.  He's  never  come  to  the 
council and explained his decision. He's said things to many of you behind closed doors, some of which are contrary 
to known facts. And the real question is, you know, why has he done that? Nobody knows. I mean, I've talked to 
councilors, and they asked me why he's against municipal broadband. I don't know. I mean, that's really you know, 
your job. I don't think any single issue should be the determinant of the contract situation. But the fact that he is so 
grossly uncollegial on its face should figure large and how and if you extend his contract, thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  54:34   
Thank you for your testimony. We have Carol Magid, followed by Timothy Flaherty. 
 
Carolyn Magid  54:44   
Hi, thank you for having me. I'm Carolyn Magid. I live at 71 Reed Street in North Cambridge. I, first of all, I agree 
with the more negative view of how well Cambridge is serving low and middle income people that's been expressed 
by many people here. In fact, it seems to me it's hard to miss that that's true. Secondly, I want to agree with the need 
for review. And in particular, I like the 360 review, that would involve all of us in the in the review process. And 
that the review should be based on goals. I also agree with Councillor Carlone on the commitment to using more of 
the budget to meet needs, including for affordable housing. And I agree with Ben Simon and some others who have 
suggested that we should be looking at social housing models, and not just market based solutions. And finally, and 
this is a point that other people have made and will probably continue to make. We need a manager who will agree 
to  follow  the  directives  of  the  Council.  And  I  think  if  this  manager  won't  agree  to  do  that,  in  principle,  then  he 
should not be reappointed. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  55:56   
Thank you. Thank you for your testimony. Tim Flaherty, followed by Charles Franklin.  
 
Tim Flaherty  56:04   
Good morning my name is Timothy Flaherty, I live at 103 Fresh Pond Parkway with my wife and my nine year old 
son Timothy, who is the fifth generation of Flahertys to live in this city. I grew up in North Cambridge. This is an 
excellent city, maybe the best run city and the United States of America. I've lived here my entire life. It has a triple 
A bond rating, three new public schools, fantastic improvements of Fresh Pond, excellent town-gown relations, an 
incredibly talented staff. Excellent city services. This morning I was late taking out the trash barrels, and the trash 
hauler  came  and  helped  me;  that  doesn't  happen  in  Wellesley.  This  is  not  happening  by mistake.  And  there's  one 
parallel there's one common denominator, his name's Louie DePasquale. Someone remarked about equity. As many 
of you know, I worked in the cannabis development here in Cambridge over the last couple of years and because of 
that perspective, I work very closely with many of you, and with Mr. DePasquale and with other members of the city 
staff.  And  I  can  tell  you  on  both  sides  of  the  of  the  political  spectrum,  registered  marijuana  dispensaries  and 
economic  empowerment  applicants,  Mr.  DePasquale  was  absolutely  transparent,  collaborative,  working  with  Ms. 
Glowa and other members and he was even handed, thoughtful, and fair throughout the process, irregardless of the 
political  consequences.  I  want  to  give  four  specific  observations  that  I've  made  as  to  why  a  national  search  will 
never find someone better suited to be the city manager then Louie DePasquale. Number one, I would take my son 
before the basketball program was terminated at the Y - in the dead of winter, Saturday mornings, without parking, 
and I would park behind city hall where I wasn't supposed to park, I would see one car there at 7:45 am. It was Mr. 
DePasquale on a Saturday morning. Two: my son, who isn't much of an athlete but wants to play with the other kids, 
I would take him down to the Tobin field. It's legendary, Mr. DePasquale's commitment to West Cambridge Little 
League. When you have a son who isn't an athlete but wants to play with the other kids, and doesn't know what to do

lot of the criticisms I've heard today have been fair, so I don't want to rehash any of them. So I'm going to keep my 
comments short. Someone who is very rarely told no will never respect you. So I think that just very well describes 
kind of the last council session. And in terms of doing things in free time, I wasn't going to say this but now I'm now 
I feel the need to because of other comments. When the Caribbean festival was canceled, and we had a march and 
we marched to Union Baptist, it was seven o'clock and our police commissioner was there, thanks to him, but the 
city manager was not there. And it was his decision to cancel it. And we had a whole church of people who were sad 
and angry that their important -- some people who come to this city to this country once a year to see their family, to 
show their culture canceled last minute and the man made the decision could not be there because no explanation 
was given. It was 7pm. What was he doing? He wasn't running the city at 7pm. That was unacceptable. I'm sorry. I 
wasn't going to say that. But I remembered when I was walking up here. I was like, No, no, no, he's not going to get 
away with that. It's on the record now. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:00:51   
Thank you so much for your testimony. There are two other individuals who signed saying they were not sure if they 
want to speak I will call their names and Invite them to speak if they wish. Not sure was Shelly Wortis still here, 
would she like to speak?   
 
Shelly Wortis  1:01:17   
Yeah. Shelley Wortis, I live at 106 Berkshire Street in Cambridge. And I agree with a lot of the comments that were 
made earlier. And specifically, I think we do need to look ahead at what the search process will be, and to consider 
how to evaluate the city manager before extending his contract. When I look at the city's goals from 2017, they're 
not very specific. Things like "deepen our commitment  to sustainable use of energy" and "strengthen our capacity 
for resilience." What does that mean? How are we going to measure whether the city manager in his position was 
able to do that when we have this extensive commercial over-development that's led to so much displacement in the 
city. And then you look at a goal like "make it easy to drive safely through the city, especially by sustainable means 
of transportation." Look at how much traffic has increased in the city. Is that leading to sustainable transportation? 
And  is  it  easy  for  people  who  live  here  to  travel  safely  through  the  city?  "Ensure  that  Cambridge  remains  an 
innovation hub that integrates business of all sizes into a thriving ecosystem." Specifically, what is an ecosystem? 
Don't  the  people  who  live  here  constitute  part  of  that  ecosystem?  And  how  has  all  this  commercial  over-
development in this city led to a thriving ecosystem? So I would just suggest that the council review its goals and 
make them much more specific before you (a) search for a new city manager or - first of all, you know, look at this 
city manager and consider whether or not to extend his contract. Because in my mind, these goals, don't really do it 
for the residents of Cambridge. Thank you.

Thank you for your commentary. There was another person that signed up as "not sure." I'd like to call their name 
and invite them to speak if they so wish. Ms. O'Hare? 
 
Carol O'Hare  1:04:00   
Thank you. I will be brief. I agree that the city has just too much focus on that rainy day fund for the rainy day that 
is the catastrophe that we have all that money stashed away for, and not enough money spent on pre-K education. 
That  is  just  one  example  of  the  obsession  about  saving  money  and  it's  not  surprising  because  the  current  city 
manager was the longtime finance manager. I do think that there isn't enough time to do a nationwide search and 
that the city should focus on the goal - follow Councilor Quinton Zondervan's suggestion, and that is do both, which 
is to evaluate and to consider what you're going to do when you do a nationwide search. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:05:22   
And thank you for your comments. Although it is not a part of our rules, it is our custom to ask if there's anyone that 
didn't sign up that would like to speak. I would like to offer that coming forward if you would give your name your 
address, and please, the amount of time is three minutes. Thank you. 
 
Fritz Donovan  1:05:41   
Thank you Madam Chair, Fritz Donovan 42 Irving Street, Cambridge. A veteran of the city since I arrived as a deer 
in the headlights in 1955 as a freshman, and I'm enjoying it well into my 80s now. What we have here is essentially 
the Battle of the budget. That usually is a term applied when there isn't enough money to go around. In this case, we 
have - I think the last estimate I heard was 340 million dollar cash reserve uncommitted. So it changes the picture 
somewhat. I take pleasure in ending as this round of comments on the same note that Councilor Carlone brought up, 
which is essentially that it's a matter of goals. For centuries budgeting has been done piece by piece, looking at the 
current expiring budget, estimating whether individual items have to go up or down or be left alone and then going 
forward with a new budget with minor modifications. But along came a thing called "zero based budgeting," which 
is absolutely brilliant. It says, You start with a budget of zero. And then you reveal your, your goals. You establish 
ideal goals with vision and creativity, then you formulate a means to achieve them, then you allocate resources to do 
it. And Budget B may bear no relation, whatever, to Budget A. It probably won't if Budget A is a traditional budget, 
piece  by  piece,  up  a  little  down  a  little.  Our  budget  is  relatively  static.  We  desperately  need  to  move  funds  into 
affordable  housing.  We  need  to  come  up  with  an  affordable  housing  plan  that  does  not destroy  our  environment, 
does not disregard design and so forth. I think the last time around, failed because it didn't meet those logical things. 
But what we  need is vision. We need creativity. We need somebody who can do that. So I would say before you 
even start looking at Manager DePasquale's performance, you start looking at your goals. You establish the goals, 
you  prioritize  them,  and  then  you  and  then  you  compare  what  you  have  with  what  you  need,  and  then  you  act 
accordingly. Thank you.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:08:16   
Thank you for your testimony. Is there anyone that would like to come forward and speak? Please do so, give your 
name and address for the record/ 
 
Phyllis Bretholtz  1:08:31   
Good morning, and thank you for extending the time. I'm Phyllis Bretholtz, I live at 65 Antrim Street. I agree with 
virtually  every  comment  that's  been  made  so  far  in  terms  of  the  need  for  transparency  in  evaluating  the  city 
manager's performance level. I feel it's really important for residents to have some involvement in all of this process. 
I think we have sacrificed a sense. The word that I haven't  heard very much this morning is the word community. 
And  I  feel  strongly  that  by building  so  much  commercial  development  and  micro  units,  we  are  guaranteeing  that 
there is no place for community. We need families to have community. That means housing that's affordable, that's 
large  enough  to both  hold  and  be  available  to  families,  that  have  play  space  for  children.  As  a  former  veteran  of 
teaching at the high school, I feel that the future of our schools we have beautiful new buildings, but if we don't have 
the families, and the early childhood education, to cultivate and make room for these families, we're going to lose 
much of our sense of community and we're at risk of doing that. I want to reiterate my deep, deep disappointment at 
the  loss  of  all  of  the  artists  space.  There  is  some  tragic  irony  in  central  square  being  designated  a  Massachusetts 
Cultural Center. And now we have lost so many spaces where artists can work and perform. We have virtually no 
more easy access to any kind of public space where artists can perform and show their work. And finally, I would 
like to, there was someone who commented on the structure of the city and the involvement of citizens at all level. 
And in talking with a number - I've lived here since the 60s, and in talking with  a number of city councillors who

were on the city council in the 60s and the 70s, it seems in talking with them and my own observation, that the city 
council had much more power in terms of making decisions, and it now appears that the city council really  has to 
have the approval of the city manager for almost anything going forward, rather than having the power invested in 
the city councilors whom we have voted on. And it seems a real reversal. And it happened kind of gradually. So it's 
difficult to say at any one point where or how it happened. But this is my observation. Thank you very much. And I 
will write some comments that I will then submit before the evening. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:11:32   
Is there  anyone  else that had not signed up and would like to speak? Please do so by giving your name and your 
address? Thank you so much. 
 
Alice Heller  1:11:41   
Hi – Alice Heller, 22 Corporal Burns Road. I want to not repeat all that's been said, though I echo a lot. I want to 
represent some neighbors who have question the timing of this important meeting and illuminate the fact that I think 
a lot more people would be here if it wasn't morning meeting. And feel that constituents should be involved in the 
decision to view the city manager's position. So a couple quick points, jumping down, I agree the committee should 
have  a  review  and  process  before  voting  on  renewing  the  city  manager  contract.  I  agree  that  we  need  a  vision 
beyond  the  checkbook.  I've  personally  been  involved  in  groups  and  we  are  very  disappointed  in  the  inaction 
regarding  issues  regarding  to climate  change, deliberate  absence  of  the  pedestrian  bridge  in  the  Alewife  area  that 
was again promised was actually in documents and now taken out. And yeah, bottom line, I agree that we need a 
manager who follows the directive of the Council. So thank you for your time. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:13:12   
Thank you for your comments. Is there anyone else that would like to speak that did not sign up? Hearing none, I 
will entertain a motion to close public comment. On a motion by Councillor Toomey to close public comment. All 
those in favor say aye. Opposed? Ayes have it and public comment is now closed. I want to turn back to the council 
to see if there any further comments from the council. Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:13:38   
Thank you, Madam Chair, and my thanks and appreciation to the members of the public who did manage to attend, 
despite the early hour. Obviously it's a very weighty decision that's before us. And, you know, we've heard a lot of 
comments about what isn't working in our city and also some comments about what is working in our city. For me 
personally, the really big question is what is coming down the road? What does our future look like? And having 
worked on climate change, in particular for a long time, as well as wealth and income inequality, I think those are 
two really, really big issues that we are facing that will make our future very different from the past. And because of 
that difference in that challenge, I think we have to be very deliberate about who we put in charge of managing our 
city, managing our budgets, and really driving the priorities in how we spend our tax dollars. So for that reason, I 
think we have to be really thoughtful about the process that we're going to follow going forward. So I have a couple 
of suggestions, actually, three motions that I would like to introduce. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:15:17   
Before we introduce any motions - the purpose of this meeting was basically to accept the manager's letter, which is 
a procedural matter. And I want to get some ideas what folks wanted to do like going forward. So if you wanted to 
do your suggestions, and I would collect all that information, and then push it back out to the council in order to put 
together a process? Thank you so much. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:15:44   
Thank you, Madam Chair. That's fine with me. So three suggestions: One, to evaluate or goals, our council goals, 
because  I  think  they  could  definitely  use  a  refresh.  Second  to  initiate  an  evaluation  of  the  city  manager's 
performance since the beginning of his contract. And third, to initiate a conversation, perhaps in this committee on 
how  we  will  conduct  a  nationwide  search  for  city  manager,  again,  regardless  of  whether  we  do  that  starting 
immediately or after a year or so, into the current manager's contract, we can never be too early in discussing how 
we would conduct such a process. So those are my suggestions. Thank you.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:16:40   
Thank you for your comments. Members of the committee? Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler.

Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:16:46   
Thank you. I had a point of information. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:16:49   
Please keep your voice up. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:16:50   
Thank  you.  Yeah,  I  had  a  point  of  information  that  hopefully  the  clerk  could  help  us  answer  in  that  what  would 
accepting the city manager's letter mean, and what would not accepting it mean? I'd like the council to have done an 
evaluation of the city manager before we take formal steps towards extending the contract. And that may make sense 
to do that before we accept the letter. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:17:11   
Thank you, Councilor. So what I believe: accepting the  letter is just putting the  letter taking it out of where  it is, 
which is communications, which were forwarded to the council. It formally puts the letter before us because quite 
frankly, I don't think to get the letters formally before us, and that I'm asking for this vote on the advice of our color. 
But you did ask of our solicitor, so I'll grant the floor to the solicitor to respond to your query. I thought you said the 
solicitor...? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:17:47   
Whoever makes more sense to answer it. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:17:49   
Then I apologize. I misheard. Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Clerk. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  1:17:58   
My  understanding  is  that  accepting  the  letter  will  make  it  part  of  the  city  council's  formal  record  that  the  city 
manager has requested an extension of his contract. I don't believe and I would defer to city solicitor that it wouldn't 
necessarily impact how the city council goes forward with whatever process it takes in terms of the selection. But 
the letter would be in the record is the document in many ways initiating this conversation. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:18:29   
Are you satisfied with that response? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:18:32   
I would, I guess, double check with the solicitor, since the clerk seemed to defer to the solicitor. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor  1:18:38   
Thank you, and through you, Madam Chair. Yes. I think that it's just a procedural matter of accepting the letter that 
has been submitted. I don't think it means anything about the process to be followed one way or the other. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:18:51   
Are you satisfied with the answer? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:18:53   
I am, thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:18:56   
Thank you. Other members of the committee? Councillor Nolan, we'll hear from you.  
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  1:19:02   
Thank you, Madam Chair. Just a comment to build on what we're all talking about in  terms of ensuring that goals 
are  included.  I  certainly hope  and  would  work  very hard  to  ensure  that  any  goals  are  smart  goals.  There's  lots  of 
evidence and research to suggest that if you don't have a SMART goal  - smart standing for Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based. There's different ways that those SMART can be used, but they basically are

in the category of that - what I said, SMART is the acronym for those kinds of goals, with the idea that if the goals 
are  not smart, there is no way to tell if they're achieved. So I hope  that I recognize, I believe, the current council 
goals  may  not  be  smart.  The  goals  for  the  city  manager  may  not  currently  be  smart.  But  I  would  advocate  very 
strongly  and  hope  that  we  would  move  forward  with  any  kind  of  smart  goals  ensuring  that  we  have  specific 
measurable  goals,  in  particular  to  ensure  that  we  all  know  -  the  great  thing  is,  if  you  meet  them,  then  you  can 
celebrate. And if you don't, then you say, oh, how do we adjust to ensure that we can meet them next time? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:19:02   
Councillor Carlone? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:20:21   
Thank you, Madam Chair. I totally agree with Councillor Nolan. And just for a quick summary of the past. When I 
came on to the council in 2014, there were no goals in our book for the whole term, which I couldn't understand. 
And some of us got together and said we should have goals and we tried to make them as specific as possible, but as 
you can imagine, in a group of nine people, they were neutralized in some way. But I totally support your statement. 
And we tried to do that in the last round actually calling out number of units and affordable housing. But that was 
taken off the table, but I support doing such a thing. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:21:15   
Thank  you  for  your  comments.  Any  other  comments?  Hearing  none,  next  steps:  so  the  Committee  on  Goals  and 
Claims  having  voted  to  accept  the  letter.  The  letter  is  now  a  part  of  the  record  and  can  be  responded  to  in  like. 
Second: I'm initiating to the members of this committee to submit to us -- 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:21:44   
Madam Chair, point of order. We did not vote to accept the letter yet. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:21:48   
I thought we did, I apologize. Okay. So I had some clarity from the clerk. You're asking that we vote to accept the 
letter to present it to the city council. Is that the correct vote? Which is a procedural vote.  
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk  1:22:10   
Just for clarification, I believe this letter was submitted to the city council as a communication through Councillor 
Simmons,  and  then  the  council  referred  it  to  the  Government  Operations  committee.  Therefore,  the  vote  for  the 
committee  would  be  to  refer  the  communication  back  to  the  city  council  with  a  recommendation  to  accept  the 
communication. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:22:34   
So  I'm  going  to  go  back  to  that.  And  thank  you  so  much  for  your  edification.  So  there's  a  vote  before  us  by  a 
member of the committee, Councillor Toomey, would like to put forward a vote that we accept - or was it you? So if 
there's no discussion, then I would accept a vote by Councillor Toomey to accept the letter from the city manager. 
Discussion?  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:23:05   
Hearing none.  On the matter - All those in favor say Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it. The next step, I would like to 
take the information that we've gathered here to bring back to you at another meeting to comment on a number of 
issues that were presented on the floor from the committee, after which we could then decide how to go forward. 
Discussion? Excellent. So if if you would like to render - this is to the members of the committee in particular - your 
thoughts? We'll also take in any mention of your comments. So again, I want to say to those that testified, if you 
want to have your comments on the record, if you submit them by midnight, then they'll be a part of these minutes 
that will go forward to the council. But for the members here, of course anyone but I'm speaking specifically to the 
members should render their thoughts to me so I can then pull those together working with the city solicitor and the 
clerk to come back to this to this committee.   
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  1:24:23   
When you said anyone here  if you want your notes to be part of the record to put them in the basket, if someone 
testified in public comment, don't those get reflected in the minutes of the meeting and therefore will be part of the

public record? Or are you suggesting if you didn't  get a chance to finish your comments, I'm just trying to clarify 
what's on -  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:24:42   
Let  me  just  say  it  again.  If  you  misunderstood,  which  I  understand  happens,  others  might.  We  often  ask  if  your 
comments  are  written  that  you  submit  them  electronically.  Of  course,  your  comments  go  into  the  record  by 
testimony. But if you also have comments that  you didn't have an opportunity to write that and you would like to 
have them in written form in the record, if you have them to the clerk, date stamped before midnight, it will be part 
of the minutes that go forward to the council. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:25:20   
Hearing no further business under this committee, I would like to entertain  - on a motion by Councillor Toomey to 
adjourn,  all  those  in  favor?  Opposed?  The  ayes  have  it.  The  meeting  is  adjourned,  I  want  to  thank  all  for  your 
attention. 
 
meeting adjourned at 11:25am 

1.  A communication was received from Councillor Simmons, transmitting a letter from City Manager 
Louis A. DePasquale, who is serving formal notice of his desire to enter into formal negotiations with 
the City Council to extend his contract with the City beyond January 2021 .

Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Good evening. I want to thank everyone for coming this evening to the meeting of the government 
ops, rules and claims Committee. The call the meeting is as follows: that the government operations, 
rules  and  claims  committee  will  meet  to  continue  discussion  on  extending  the  contract  of  city 
manager  Louie  A.  DePasquale  beyond  January  2020.  I  want  to  note  that  as  the  city  continues  to 
grapple with the COVID-19 outbreak, we are modifying how we do many things, in the hopes that 
we can minimize the risk of the exposure to those present. We are not holding this committee in the 
typical roundtable setup, instead having Councillors sit at their regular desks... sitting at the regular 
desk as far a part as possible. So if you folks that are sitting on this side of the room want to make 
more room between one another as we have been asked to do, please do so you will see that on this 
side of the room we were able to manage that. We are also providing public comment at the top of 
the meeting. And I strongly... First I want to thank all of you that have come to participate in public 
comment. But as we close or as you have given your testimony, I'm going to strongly urge those of 
you  that  have  come to  give  public  comment,  please  feel  comfortable to  leave  after  you  made  that, 
made  your  public  comment  or  left  your  minutes,  your  notes  so  that  you  know  that  this  meeting  is 
being televised and being recorded it is also being privately, being recorded by other devices through 
the  media  and  other  individuals.  So  please  be aware  of  that.  Everyone  will have  an  opportunity  to 
view  this  meeting  online.  It's  live  streaming  or  at  a  later  time.  Additionally,  with  every  council 
meeting and committee hearing, people are welcome to submit their public comments via email, and 
they  will  be  a  part  and  that  will  be  made  part  of  the  record.  I'm  also  urging  my  colleagues  on  the 
committee to keep the remarks brief and to the point. If you wish to ask numerous questions or make 
a note are numerous level of appoints I would ask that you state so that they will be on the record, but 
to consider having those questions answered in writing at the next meeting. I think it's best until we 
get  a  clearer  grip  on  the  virus  to  keep  our  meetings  brief  and  to  the  point  as  we  can  and  that  is 
certainly my intention this evening. Again, I want to note that my colleague Councillor Zondervan is 
participating remotely by phone this evening. So having said that, I am going to open the floor for 
public comment. I think we have a sign in sheet which our Clerk will get, the time allotted to each 
individual  is  three  minutes  please  give  your  name  and  address  for  the  record.  Make  all  your 
comments  through  the  chair  after  which  you  are  free  and/or  encouraged  to  leave  so  that  we  are 
always keeping your health and safety in mind. So with that when the clerk brings the signup sheet 
forward. We will then start with public comment. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Okay, that first person is signed up to speak is Elaine Thorne followed by Ruth Ryan Allen. 
 
Elaine Thorne   
Hello, I'm Elaine Thorne. I'm at 40 Hay street in Cambridge. I'm here to talk about being in support 
of the current city manager, Louie DePasquale. I have worked with Louie for the past 30 years, in 
different capacities here in the city, most currently with the Affordable Housing Trust. And I  think 
that he's doing a great job. He's an open policy door. I've worked to see that this city has supplied 
affordable housing, much more so than any place I know. And we continue to try to do better all the 
time. I also worked with Louie during one of the more trying times in Cambridge during the large 
fire that we had. Louie did everything possible to make that transition for people who are affected by 
a fire as seamless as possible and worked diligently at, with other city departments to make all of that 
happen. He has an open door policy, we have maintained the bond rating. And I just feel like this is 
the right person for the job currently. And I hope that you all will support it. Thank you.

Thank you for your testimony. Ruth Ryan Allen, followed by Susan Ruff, after that Mike Nicoloro. 
 
Ruth Ryan Allen   
Thank  you.  I'm  here  in  support  of  extension  of  Mr.  DePasquale  contract.  My  name  is  Ruth  Ryan 
Allen. I Live on 48 Fenno Street. I've been a member of the planning and focus group for the new 
inclusionary park being developed and built by the Danehy park space. I'm also on the board of the 
Cambridge C-PAC, the special education Parent Advisory Committee. This park is so important to 
our  city,  the  children,  the  families,  with  all  abilities,  and  I  was  never  so  proud  to  be  invited  as  a 
member of the group. Our city manager Louie decided to put this idea into a reality for our families. 
There  is  such a  need  for parks  where both children  with  different abilities, as  well as  parents  with 
different abilities can go and just enjoy a day in the park. Most of the time these children have to wait 
for one of the specialized swings to become available in order to even be a part of the experience. 
Parents  who  had,  might  have  physical  disability  have  to  stand  there  and  watch  their  children  play. 
But this is going to change Mr. DePasquale saw a need in our city. He heard our families who are 
quiet  and  at  times,  they  don't  make  much  noise.  He  has  the  pulse  on  the  heart  of  the  city.  He  put 
together  a  team  of  parents  whose  children  range  in  abilities,  outside  caregivers,  city  staff, 
inclusionary specialists, art council members who can incorporate artists who them themselves have 
different abilities. And an architectural firm who has an excellent experience with such projects. The 
outreach groups that were formed were coordinated and open to all ideas. He was beyond sensitive to 
all groups and open the process to all of the neighbors in Cambridge. He gave us his word that this 
would  be  done,  and  it  will  be  done.  Now  Mr.  DePasquale  managed  to  get  the  funding,  responded 
back  to  the  group  putting  his  top  aides  in  the  mix.  Many  other  department  heads  followed  him 
because he is a man to be followed. This is a united effort and it was led by him. The most vulnerable 
in  our  city  are  sometimes  drowned  out  by  our  big  plans.  But  Mr.  DePasquale  ensures  all  will  be 
heard.  I  am  eternally  grateful  to  have  such  a  manager  in  our  city.  This  park  will  be  a  reality  very 
soon, the children and adults will find refuge in our turbulent times due to being able to access such a 
facility. This is due to a great project, a great plan and a great leader. And if we lose him, we'll be... 
Cambridge will be much less. So I urge you to follow the extension on this. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank  you  so  much  for  your  commentary.  The  next  person  is  Susan  Ruff.  Followed  by  Mike 
Nicoloro, followed by Scott Slater. 
 
Susan Ruff   
Hello, Susan Ralph. I live at 80 Fawcett Street. I've known Louie for 20 plus years, but I'm also the 
Director of Cambridge youth soccer. So I've been I'm working with him in his role as city manager. 
And I fully support extending his contract for another two years. Louie has a passion for this city. 
And it's been great working with him on various youth programs that our city provides. We sit down 
sometimes over complicated issues, I have to say he always has great respect for everybody sitting at 
that table, and invites all points of views and then we try to work out a good solution for people. And 
he understands youth programs, not just youth soccer, and we really appreciate that. In addition, his 
dedication to affordable housing certainly helps many of our soccer families. So thank you for that. 
Thanks for your time. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And thank you for your testimony. Mike Nicoloro, followed by Scott Slater and then James Teague.

Good  evening.  My  name  is  Mike  Nicoloro,  I'm  a  lifelong  resident  of  East  Cambridge  156  Spring 
Street, and I am in favor of extending city manager's contract beyond 2021. I've had the privilege of 
knowing Louie for pretty much my entire life he grew up few houses down from where I lived on 
Thorndike he was on seventh. I also had an opportunity to actually work with him briefly when he 
was  the  budget  director  and  I  was  with  the  city,  I  worked  for  the  water  department.  And  both 
professionally and on a personal basis, I found Mr. DePasquale to be fair, passionate in his beliefs, 
collaborative, honest and true to his words. Beyond that he loves Cambridge and cares deeply about 
its future. He is a smart man but he's very humble. If you ever have been with him in a meeting or 
just  in  a  general  conversation,  he's  engaged  in  an  easy  to  speak  with.  He  has  no  ego.  Once  again, 
humble. He is a good communicator. From budget director to city manager, he has had involvement 
in maintaining triple A bond rating, which helps the city fund many programs that other cities and 
towns  envy.  Ride  through  Cambridge,  6.2  square  miles.  We  are  building  new  schools.  We  have  a 
fantastic  school  system  with  programs  for  helping our  children learn  regardless  of  what challenges 
they may have. They go the extra distance. I know and I have a grandson that's in that school system. 
We have a state of the art water purification plant in fresh pond, not to mention a wild and natural 
habitat  adjacent  to  it.  Having  a  water  plant  stabilizes  our  water  rates.  We  have  world-class  public 
safety; firemen, police, the fire department ISO Class One, which keeps insurance rates down. Why? 
Because in part a fire water infrastructure is superior. Again, Public Works plays a very defining role 
in  that.  Just  right  around  the  street  and  look  at  the  different  colored  hydrants.  All  of  those  have  a 
significance  in  the  meaning.  Our  Public  Works  serves,  you  know  provides  various  services  to  go 
along with low property taxes when compared to surrounding cities and towns. In summary, the city 
manager  has  to  balance  two  major  areas:  fiscal  stability,  environmental  quality  of  life,  diversity,  a 
number of things, but it's always the money and then the soft side of the business, which I consider to 
be the real thing that hits the hits the ground. I do believe Mr. DePasquale has done a spectacular job 
in  maintaining  a  healthy  balance  with  both  and  would  hope  that  he  can  continue  to  serve  the  city 
beyond 2021. And I'm sure he has a lot of sleepless nights thinking about when he's balancing these 
things, because everybody has to compromise. But at the end, we have a wonderful city, and I want 
to keep it that way. And I think if we have Mr. DePasquale  in place, we have a good shot at that to 
introduce some stability in the world right now with a lot of uncertainty. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And  thank  you  for  your  testimony.  We  now  have  Scott  Slater,  followed  by  James  Teague,  after 
which we have our former state representative and city councilor, Saundra Graham. Mr. Slater. 
 
Scott Slater   
Thank you. Hi, I live at number 10 Bigelow Street. So right around the corner. And I've known Louie 
for  about  25  years  in  many  different  capacities.  One  thing that  really  doesn't  get  talked  about very 
much is how wonderful the City of Cambridge is, especially in the last five years or so, at responding 
to little needs of its citizens, such as having a motorcycle that's been chained to a pole outside of your 
house for a month or having some handicap placards put on a handicap pole in front of your house 
that bicycles were always locked on, or having street life fixed, etc, etc, all the little things that are 
very important to the citizens of Cambridge, to make just our day to day life easier and Louie and the 
people  that  work  in  the  city  manager's  office  have  always  been  incredibly  responsive.  It's...  It's  so 
impressive  friends  of mine  who  were  visiting  me  from  out  of  town  can  never  believe  how  quickly 
things are addressed when you make that call. As a resident, I've lived on Bigelow Street for 30 years 
next month. And most of my neighbors are older than even me, and are on fixed incomes of some 
sort,  have  lived  in  their  houses  for  30  or  40  years,  aren't  especially  wealthy,  want  to  stay  in  their 
homes. And I... one thing that I really think is a wonderful thing that City of Cambridge has done is 
to allow the middle class to stay in Cambridge by keeping property taxes low. And I think Louie has

had  a  great  deal  to  do  with  that.  You  don't  see  when  people  are  running  for  city  council  in  their 
campaign literature: “Oh, one of my goals is to preserve the middle class in Cambridge.” I'm afraid 
you  just  don't  hear  that  very  often  from  city  councillors.  Perhaps  it  is  one  of  their  goals  but  it's  a 
pretty big goal because a lot of people like myself are keeping the city affordable. My... I do have a 
tenant in my house who's a student. And we have basically never raised our rent since he moved in. 
We  have  always  kept  it  low  and  have  always  had  students  living  there  since  we've  lived  there. 
Many... some of my neighbors on Bigelow Street still rent rooms, because under rent control, they 
lived  in  rooming  houses  but  they  decided  even  after  they  did  not  have  to  do  that  anymore,  they 
continue to rent rooms and those rooms are like with my tenants rent well below market. And so it's 
the idea of having our taxes go up substantially would be kind of devastated. I collect Social Security 
now,  despite  the  fact  that  I  still  work  and  for  the  residents  of  so  many  parts  of  Cambridge  all  the 
people who live in their parents houses or have taken them over the two and three families, etc, etc. It 
really helps us... 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Mr Slater your time has expired.  
 
Scott Slater   
Okay, thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
If  anybody  who  has  their  comments  in  writing,  please  leave  them  in  the  basket.  And  they  will  be 
made a part of the record for tonight's meeting. James Teague, followed by Saundra Graham. 
 
James Teague   
Hi, so I'm James Teague. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak. My wife and two sons 
live at 107 Fairweather Street here in Cambridge. I'm here to talk in support of the city negotiating in 
good faith to extend Louie's contract. Here's a couple of brief reasons why we want to support him 
here. I was recently at the Tobin School community meeting and saw the city manager gathering all 
the  different  constituents  stakeholders  and  providers  to  that  project  together  to  go  over  the  plans, 
solicit concerns, get suggestions. My wife and I truly appreciate living in a community that values 
inclusion  and  values,  diversity  of  different  points  of  view.  And  it  was  wonderful  to  see  our  city 
manager making that effort to solicit those points of view. It is not easy. I know it's not easy to have 
to  navigate  the  different  points  of  view  the  debate  between  the  soccer  families  and  the  baseball 
coaches is enough to keep anybody away from that. I truly appreciate that he makes that effort. You 
all know he's worked for the city for a long time. That kind of experience and institutional knowledge 
brings to this position, a tremendous benefit to this city. Earlier, someone mentioned the fire in East 
Cambridge. And I think that that experience and institutional knowledge was tremendous in getting 
the resources to those families providing the homes, the clothing, the food for those families in need. 
And I appreciate that we've got a city manager who has that kind of experience. We've got a triple A 
rating, it  is  not easy  to  sustain  that. We  live  in  really  strange  times.  And  I'm  not  talking  about  the 
corona virus. I'm talking about a federal government that is retaliatory against cities, sanctuary cities 
such as ours. And I appreciate that we've got a city manager who has the skill and the knowledge and 
the ability and the experience to navigate those financial challenges. There's community needs, and 
just  and the  political  challenges that  we're facing, and  so  I  am  supportive  and  I  encourage  the city 
negotiate in good faith to extend his contract.

Thank  you.  Thank  you  for  your  testimony.  Saundra  Graham.  Absolutely.  Thank  you.  Richard 
Vendetti followed by David Altschuler. 
 
Richard Vendetti   
Good evening councillors. I'm here  to, to support the extension. And hopefully it's double the time 
that  you  have  an  extension.  I've  known  Louie  for  probably  55  years  roughly.  I  live  at  24  Winter 
Street in East Cambridge. To have a gentleman like Louie get involved with this city. And the love 
he has for the city, the love he has for children and sports and how we solve [sic], you can't get a 
better person in life. And to have him run the city to be one of the top notch cities in the country with 
the triple A bond rating, and he keeps it up year after year after year. So I hope you will extend this 
here for a long time. I know everybody in this room and in the city you know somewhat appreciate 
would appreciate it for sure. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your testimony. David Altschuler, followed by Douglas Altschuler, followed by Jim 
Stockard. 
 
David Altschuler   
My name is David Altschuler. I want to start by thanking all of you for your service to the city into 
making it the great place that I've been proud to live in for a little over 20 years now. Also thank you 
for, you know, keeping things going in these scary times, having open government and being able to 
have these hearings and wherever we go from here, these kinds of you know, democracy in action is 
just  one  of  those  important  things.  And  one  of  the,  you  know,  heroes  of  mine  and  this  great  local 
setting is Louie DePasquale. And so I'm here to talk in favor of his extension. I come with a couple 
of  different  hats  on.  One  is  from  sort  of  business  side,  and  then  also  from  the  arts.  There  was  a 
business I'm involved with a couple different restaurants and both the restaurant industry called Par 
Le and also here for a friend associate of mine Tom Brush who operates Philippe's in the middle of 
Harvard Square. And what Tom, who's not feeling well right now asked me to convey to all of you is 
that even though  he  had a  couple  of  hiccups  and trying  to  figure  out a  couple  of  regulatory things 
here with the city, where he didn't have the easiest time, he didn't have it, things didn't go the way he 
wanted them to go – Louie was somebody who dealt with him straightforwardly. And with candor, 
and direct and didn't make it easy. He didn't, didn't get anything, but he had to do what he had to do. 
But just by being straightforward and being transparent and acting with candor, to us, it was involved 
with significant costs financially to Tom, that was really important to him.  
 
David Altschuler   
And when you think about what goes on at Harvard Square, and then another hat, I've been involved 
with theater group that was able to bring moon brought able to bring Rocky Horror Picture show to 
Harvard  Square  this  last  fall.  I  was  involved  in  trying  to  revitalize  Kendall  Square  with  arts 
performances. And so we are, again from be at the restaurant side or from the art side, pure nonprofit, 
public  charity,  supported  by  many  people  here  in  Cambridge,  is  we're  trying  to  revitalize  life  in 
Harvard Square and Kendall Square. And in this time where we have all these big corporations and 
all these big companies having little independent activities, arts groups, or be independent restaurants 
or just small businesses, it's hard. And Louie, again, while maintaining a fair and level playing field 
and  trying  to  make  it  all  work  has  been  inviting  in  the  economic  development  group  and  the  Arts 
Cambridge  group,  which again, I  thank  you  all  for  the  support  of those  endeavors,  because  you've 
been  behind  so  much  of  that.  But  Louie  is  somebody  who  I  want  to  just  leave  with  one  word  for 
Louie,  which  is  I  think  he  is  one  of  the  primary  catalysts  for  revitalization.  He  is  someone  who  is 
revitalizing  these...  these  two  squares  Harvard  Square  and  Kendall  Square.  And  so  when  I  look

forward from where we are today in the scary times, and think about what trait do I most want to see 
the leaders of our Financial Services or administrative bureaucracy. I mean that in a positive sense, is 
I want somebody like Louie, he doesn't cut corners. He doesn't do favors. What he does is just try to 
make it straightforward and deal with things with candor. Even now back to speaking for Tom, even 
when things don't work out, knowing that you've got a... 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your testimony you have reach for three minutes. If you have your remarks in writing, 
please leave them in the baskets. Thank you for your testimony. Douglas Altschuler followed by Jim 
Stockard, and then Rob Belkner. 
 
Douglas Altschuler   
Hello, thank you just heard support for Louie DePasquale for keeping the position and city manager. 
I can't really speak to his work as city manager, but I actually was in the baseball Little League for 
West Cambridge. And he was the commissioner of that and, you know, although I was pretty young, 
I just remember the whole program ran really well. And I remember my mother was a coach and I 
remember when I left for a year, and I didn't come back, he spent extra time to help me figure out 
which  team  I  needed  to  go  to.  And  considering  that  he  has  such  an  important  job  aside  from  this 
work as a commissioner for Little League Baseball group, I think it's just shows his character how 
he's willing to spend so much time to help all these different children have a really great experience 
together. And yeah, so specifically, from my experience, I think he proves that he's willing to put in 
as  much  time  as  he  has  plus  more  to  not  only  help  in  his  specific  job,  but  then  just  be  part  of  the 
community all together. And yeah, so thank you for that. And one little thing is like, whatever like he 
I don't think he was even paid for that position as Commissioner, but definitely like considering how 
much work he put in he should have been. Anyway, yeah, but thank you so much. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And thank you for your testimony. Jim Stockard file by Rob Belkner. Followed by Kevin Donaher. 
 
Jim Stockard   
Hello, my name is Jim Stockard, I live at 141 Oxford Street. I want to acknowledge that I first met 
Louie as the mortal enemy. He was a coach for the East Cambridge All Star Little League team and 
my son played for the North Cambridge team. So I was started off by being pretty mad at Louie. But 
it's actually not a bad way to get to know somebody to tell you the truth. Because as I watched Louie 
coach, I began to observe some things about him. Every kid on that team, the best kid, and the least 
good kid, got the same kind of attention from Louie. He didn't... there was no status in Louie. He was 
just a huge supporter of kids. And on top of that, he was really smart. They played really well and 
they won most of their games and then he went to West Cambridge to run – he still wasn't helping us 
out in North Cambridge – so I needed to overcome that as I've gotten to know Louie. However, on a 
professional level, he has done a remarkable job for this city. It is inconceivable that you would find 
a  city  manager  who  knew  our  city  better.  I  doubt  there's  a  street  in  the  city,  he  hasn't  walked  and 
talked  to  families  on  the  streets.  It's  inconceivable  that  you  would  find  someone  who  cared  more 
about this city. It's inconceivable that there's somebody with a greater level of integrity than Louie 
has.  And  people  have  already  mentioned  the  bond  rating  which  allows  us  to  do  so  many  things 
because  of  our  ability  to  raise  money.  And  finally,  as  a  member  of  the  Affordable  Housing  Trust 
Fund, Louie has been a huge supporter of that fund, giving us more money and inspiring our staff 
and our commissioners to think creatively about how we can do the  very difficult task of providing 
more affordable housing for our citizens. So I hope seriously that you will renegotiate with Louie and 
find a way for him to extend his service to the city. Thanks

Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And thank you for your testimony. Rob Belkner followed by Kevin Donaher. 
 
Rob Belkner   
Thank you very much for this opportunity. I'm here in support of the West Cambridge Little League 
Orioles, which I am one of the assistant coaches because if Louie's not renewed, he's going to be at 
the field even more than he already is. And we beat him last year. I don't think we could beat him this 
year if he's there anymore, which would be hard for him to do because he is there so much. I, you 
know, I haven't been to a lot of city manager hearings before, but actually, I've never been to any but 
to hear Louie discuss in the way that he is by all these folks here. I think that's probably unique for a 
city for a city manager position. This city is wonderful. I was born here. Moved back here 14 years 
ago  to  raise  my  family  here.  My  wife and  I  wanted  to  grow up  in  a city that  is  –  is  unique  and is 
inclusive, and is wonderful. Unique is a word I think that people use a lot. And I think in in our city's 
case,  it  really  sticks.  I  think  everybody  here especially  you folks  here,  know  that that's  why  you're 
here  doing  what  you  do.  Thank  you  for  doing  what  you  do.  Our  various  universities  or  our  social 
policies, diverse neighborhoods, diverse neighbors, community programs. It's a special place and to 
manage a special place like this, you need a special person. And you need somebody who knows the 
city, who brings the city home with them brings the city to the baseball field with him, brings the city 
back to work with them. We all know Louie does that. Louie loves the people, the culture. Louie is a 
gentleman  to  all  whether you're  with himor  not or negotiating.  He's  a  mentor  to  many.  I've  seen  it 
firsthand. And it's a beautiful thing to watch. He's financially solid. He's a financial, he understands 
financial management. I think we all pretty much understand that. 
 
Rob Belkner   
Louie knows the city, the people, the businesses, the schools, the struggle.  Louie is the city. And we 
have  a  great  opportunity  to  continue  this,  this  wonderful  relationship  with  a  man  who  loves  and 
knows what he does as well as anybody else. I would like to say one thing about fiscal responsibility 
and  sustainable  growth.  I  think  that,  you  know,  Louie  understands  how  to  move  this  city  forward 
without  sacrificing  its  greatest  resources  which  is  its  citizens.  And  as  a  middle  class  citizen  who 
wants to stay here for as long as possible and continue to raise my family, and my family's family, I 
think Louis gives us a great opportunity for that. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your testimony. Again if it's in writing please leave it in the basket. Kevin Donaher 
her after which city councillor Saundra Graham. 
 
Kevin Donaher   
Hi, my name is Kevin Donaher and I live at 225 Chestnut Street. I'm here to respectfully ask that you 
do not renew the contract of city manager Louie DePasquale.  I first learned about Louie from my 
work on municipal broadband where despite the majority of the council claiming to support it, it has 
been blocked from progressing even to a feasibility study entirely due to the ideological beliefs of a 
single unelected official. Louie believes that Cambridge should be run like a business, tax cuts year 
after year for the wealthy bosses, austerity for the regular people who live and work here. And like 
every  other  Corporation,  Louie  has  been  carrying  on  the  Healy  administration's  record  of 
discrimination.  Councillor  Simmons  recently  remarked,  I'm  tired  of  hearing  the  same  type  of 
complaints  from  the  same  departments  coming  from  city  employees  year  after  year,  and  also  that 
women feel trapped in a toxic environment. The city council has the power to stop Louie and simply 
chooses  not  to.  I  don't  recall  any  candidate  running  for  city  council  on  a  platform  of  tax  cuts,

austerity and discrimination. But that's what we got by continuing the Healy administration. What's 
the  point  of  holding  elections  if  all  the  real  power  in  the  city  is  going  to  be  held  by  the  same 
unelected authority since 1981. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your testimony. Councillor Saundra Graham followed by Susan Freitas and then city 
councillor and former mayor Kenneth Reeves. 
 
Saundra Graham   
Good evening, everyone. Nice to be here. been away for a long time. But it's nice to be here tonight. 
I'm here in really support of Louie. I have been working with Louie over the past couple of years. He 
has been accessible. As a city councilor, one thing you really love is a person that returns your phone 
calls. And you don't have to call him three or four times in order to get him on the telephone. I think 
he's  doing  a  wonderful  job.  I  think  he  has  provided  the  quality  of  life  that  we  look  forward  to  in 
Cambridge,  in  every  neighborhood,  not  just  in  one  neighborhood  but  in  every  neighborhood.  The 
quality  of  the  parks  are  always  kept  up  so  that  the  children  have  places  to  play  without  drugs 
paraphernalia  all  over  the  place.  The  schools  are  getting  better.  We  helped  design  the  schools,  we 
design the king school. We are grateful that there are-- there are buildings in those schools. I think 
the city has been run very well. I think the city has cash reserves that I would like to get my hands 
on. But we have it in case of emergency. Our bond rating is very high, and it continues to be high. 
And that's because you have a city manager that is fiscally responsible for the city. So I'm hoping that 
you look at his contract and that you say to yourself that this is a man that is qualified to continue to 
run the city. You know, when I was in the city council, we had a city-- we had a nationwide search 
for a city manager. And we interviewed probably about six or seven people who came from across 
the country.  
 
Saundra Graham   
And as we interviewed them, we really found out that they didn't understand Cambridge. That they 
didn't  know  Cambridge  at  all.  And  that  some  of  their  responses  to  questions  were  not  what  we 
wanted.  And  so  we  went  through  that  for  about  four  or  five  months  and  decided  that,  hey,  we're 
going  to  get  somebody  that  knows  Cambridge,  that  has  been  in  Cambridge,  that  understands 
Cambridge. And so we hired Jim Sullivan. I just want to say that sometimes it's best to keep who you 
have if they are qualified and can keep the job, rather than go abroad, and try to find somebody who 
does not know our city. Thank you.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And  thank  you  for  your  testimony.  Susan  Freitas,  followed  by  city  council  and  former  mayor 
Kenneth Reeves, followed by Timothy Flaherty. 
 
Susan Freitas   
Hi, my name is Susan Freitas. I have a home at 140 Thorndike Street, Cambridge, East Cambridge 
that is. I have a small business in East Cambridge. I've known Louie DePasquale for over 50 years. 
And I don't know anybody better for this job. He is the most dedicated person I know. He was born 
and raised in Cambridge. We all hung around together back in the days and he is a great mentor. He 
is for the city. I think he eats, sleeps, and drinks it. And Cambridge is his home. It'll always be his 
home. And he is for the people of Cambridge. And I think he's the best person for this job. Thank 
you.

Thank you for your testimony. Former city councillor, former mayor Kenneth Reeves, followed by 
Timothy Flaherty, followed by Margaret Drury, former city clerk. 
 
Kenneth Reeves   
Good evening, and Good to see you all. I came to speak in support of the contract extension for the 
current  city  manager  Louie  DePasquale.  I  find  it  very  heartening  that  the  fact  of  baseball  and  the 
many  metaphors  from  baseball that  describe Louie  because  while  I've  known  him  over  40  years,  I 
think I met his real essence in the midst of Little League baseball and to see his utter devotion to the 
children  of  Cambridge,  particularly  those  in  his  church  and  his  support  and  nurturing  of  them.  It 
makes you understand that he does understand the core of the city and the true qualifications for city 
manager of Cambridge is the love of Cambridge. And he has that in spades. I assure you that but he 
also-- I met him in another context when – you all won't believe this but it was sometime when they 
didn’t elect the mayor on time – and as the senior member of the Council, I was in that position often 
longer  than a month.  And  I  would  have  to  represent  that  office  in  one  time  interviewing  for a city 
position that had a  lot to do with children and, and we had a very good and diverse pool. And the 
oddest thing is that there were people in the pool who were clearly unqualified, but were somehow in 
the  pool  due  to  connections  they  had  with  some  of  us,  and  in  the  pool  was  an  African  American 
woman who was the exceptional candidate but was having a hard time in this pool. But luckily Louie 
knew her and her son from little league and for one of the few times in Cambridge during my service, 
I was in a battle with somebody who I knew what-- knew what war this was and what we must do. 
Now unfortunately, suddenly we've got a mayor and I was bounced out of that and they did not hire 
that woman. But it was the context that I remember back to so richly that I felt Louie was an ally and 
understanding that in this circle, something that shouldn't happen won't happen. It will happen unless 
we're vigilant. It happened anyway. So yet we are not saved in that story.  I really think though, we 
need Louie. If you want new management, begin now to look around the country. But as former rep, 
former Councillor Graham said, when I first sat in this circle, I believe our city manager, the new one 
would be from Santa Monica or some other hip city. By the time I left here, I fully realized that the 
love of Cambridge is the only qualification and that more than likely, it's got to be somebody who 
understands how complex and peculiar. Thank you. I absolutely appreciate. I strongly support Louie. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank  you.  Okay,  Tim  Flaherty,  followed  by  our  former  city  clerk  Margaret  Drury,  followed  by 
Patrick Barrett. 
 
Tim Flaherty   
Good afternoon. My name is Timothy Flaherty. I'm an attorney. I live at 103 Fresh  Pond Park with 
my  wife,  Lisa  and  my  son,  Timothy.  And  as  I  was  sitting  here  thinking  about,  and  listening  to 
everyone  else,  I  realized  my  son  Timothy  is  the  –  represents  the  fifth  generation  of  my  family  in 
Cambridge.  And  it's  very  hard  to  believe  that  my  family's  lived  in  Cambridge  for  that  long.  It's 
equally as difficult for me to believe that I didn't know Louie DePasquale. I knew of him but I didn't 
know  him.  I  didn't  play  baseball  for  him.  I  never  interacted  with  him.  Until  recently,  in  the  last 
couple  of  years,  professionally,  I  interacted  with  him.  And  when  I  did,  I  found  out  exactly  how 
talented he is, how bright he is, how encyclopedic his knowledge is, his historical and institutional 
background,  the  City  of  Cambridge  is  unparalleled.  He  knows  every  department,  every  street,  he 
knows  everything  there  is,  every  facet  of  city  government.  And  when  I  think  of  cities,  I  think  of 
people. That's really what it is. And I think of how Louie interacts with the families and the kids and 
my own son at the Tobin fields with little league baseball. And it's easy to forget, I think sometimes 
we live in a world class city, this is the Paris of America. It's easy to forget, because we're all used to 
Harvard and  MIT and  you  know,  the culture and--  and just the  incredible  resources  in  Cambridge.

But I think it's also easy to forget that none of this happens by accident without a strong city manager 
as somebody who runs the city the way Louie does, and he does it with a mind of Cambridge is about 
people. And he does everything he can to support how people live in the city, how families live in the 
city. And it's easy to forget that, and it's I think of other city managers because I have through my 
practice and opportunity to interact with municipal officials all across Massachusetts. And as I think 
of Louie, and I'm referring to the city manager of Cambridge by his first name, Louie, that in itself is 
unique.  When  I  think  of  how  more  talented  and  collaborative  and  inclusive  and  thoughtful  and 
dignified Mr. DePasquale is, as compared to all of the others that I deal with on a daily basis across 
Massachusetts, it's easy to forget how good we have it. He's outstanding. And I would ask you all to 
really, really consider how lucky we are to have him and to renew his contract, because the City of 
Cambridge is about people who live here, and he does an extraordinary job, making sure that all of 
our lives are better. So I want to thank him for his service. And thank you for your time. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank  you  for  your  testimony.  Margaret  Drury,  former  city  clerk,  followed  by  Patrick  Barrett, 
followed by Lee Ferris. 
 
Margaret Drury   
Good evening, Margaret Drury, 1 Dudley Court Cambridge, Massachusetts.  I support the extension 
of city manager DePasquale's contract. During his tenure, Cambridge has been a very well managed 
and  innovative  city.  The  hallmarks  of  a  successful  municipality  are  the  development  and 
maintenance of a professional and competent administrative staff and workforce and the allocation of 
city resources to manage that work in accordance with the priorities set by the majority vote of the 
legislative  body.  Our  department  heads  are  professional  and  knowledgeable  in  their  fields  and  our 
city  manager  is  adept  at  managing  the  city's  resources  in  accordance  with  the  priorities  of  the  city 
council a difficult tasks in the best of times, due to the fact that while the constituencies of the nine 
constituencies of the nine members of the legislative body overlap, they are by no means identical. 
Mr. DePasquale – Louie – does not seek to make policy for the city, which is the job of the Council. 
But  when  the  council  has  voted  to  adopt  a  particular  policy,  he  works  very  hard  to  implement  the 
policy. If I were more cognizant with baseball statistics, I would give him a very high batting score 
for the level of his achievement of this goal. Louie’s management both fiscal and administrative has 
enabled the city council to provide resources for the many services and programs that benefit all of 
our  residents.  Over  the  last  30  years  that  I  worked  for  the  City  of  Cambridge,  beginning  at  the 
Cambridge  Rent  Control  Board,  I  have  had  the  opportunity  to  observe  Louie  strong  support  for 
affordable  housing.  And  as  the  city  manager,  he  has  overseen  a  dramatic  increase  in  the  city's 
funding  for  affordable  housing.  He's  also  supported  increased  funding  for  the  Cambridge  public 
schools,  including  the  building  and  renovation  of  our  aging  schools.  He  has  supported  the  city's 
increased focus on sustainability, and he has provided support for ongoing and new human services 
that are so essential to the most vulnerable members of our community. The many accomplishments 
achieved  during  his  tenure  are  truly  impressive,  and  represent  the  city  manager's  successful 
management and allocation of resources for an extraordinary array of city council priorities that have 
benefited Cambridge. And last but not least, like everyone before me, I have to mention Louie's deep 
love  for  and  knowledge  of  the  City  of  Cambridge,  and  humanity's  desire  to  use  the  resources  to 
benefit the entire community. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you very much. Patrick Barrett, followed by Lee Ferris, followed by Heather Hoffman.

Thank  you,  Councillor  Simmons.    My  name  is  Patrick  Barrett.  I'm  here  to  say  a  couple  of  things. 
One,  going  through  this  political  exercise  of  jockeying  to  figure  out  whether  or  not  we're  gonna 
extend the city manager's contract to me seems like a colossal waste of time. You should renew it. 
You should do it right now. You should let him get back to work and deal with the massive crisis that 
we're facing right now instead of going through this yet again – because I remember going through it 
with Rich Rossi and it was annoying then, it's annoying now. Spend the time figuring out – because 
Louie's not gonna be here forever – who is going to be manager after Louie. What kind of city we 
want after Louie – because Louie by himself is, you know, just the manager. There's a whole team of 
people behind him. A whole team of people that when he goes they go, and you need to think about 
how  the  city  is  structured  and  how  the  city  works.  I  didn't  want  to  come  up  here  because  quite 
frankly, I shouldn't be up here. None of us should be up here right now. The crisis that's currently out 
there is way worse than I think anyone here realizes. However, I would ask that the council renew 
Louie's contract, let him get back to work, spend the next year putting together what you guys want 
for  a  city  manager  for  the  city.  Because  I  swear  if  you  guys  spend  anything  time  going  over  the 
political nonsense that you guys went through with Rossi before, it makes you just look terrible. And 
we  don't  need  it  right  now,  we  really  don't.  And  it's  not  hysteria,  and  that's  not  theatrics.  It's  just 
reality. You're not -- you're going to renew his contract. So just do it. And then think about how you 
want the city departments to be run. The license commission sent out an email to all my businesses. 
It's reprehensible. That's a problem. Let's work on it. CDD, you know, they need work, lots of work, 
but  you're  not  going  to  solve  it  all  right  now.  So  resolve  yourselves  to  fix  these  problems 
incrementally, systematically, not to go through some nonsense about whether or not we're going to 
hire  Louie.    Louie  is  awesome.  I  like  him  a  lot.  You  should  hire  him.  And  then  think  about  what 
happens afterwards, but not -- don't do it now. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your testimony, Lee Ferris, followed by Heather Hoffman, followed by Reverend Ellis 
Washington. 
 
Lee Ferris   
Good evening councillors. And thanks for your attention to this matter. I'm Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk 
street,  and  I'm  speaking  today  for  the  Cambridge  Residents  Alliance.  Many  people  today  have 
mentioned the city manager's accomplishments. However, before the council decides on whether to 
extend  the  manager's  contract,  the  Residents  Alliance  asks  that  the  council  decide  on  a  process  to 
evaluate the manager. And I have to say I don't think I've seen a good process, or in most cases, any 
process for the council to evaluate the manager. So starting now, when you have a manager that a lot 
people  think  is  doing  something  good,  is  good  for  the  council  to  do.  Initially,  the  council  could 
evaluate  the  manager  using  the  most  recent  council  goals,  including  some  criteria  for  success,  and 
also  requiring  a  means  for  public  input.  Longer  term,  the  council  should  design  a  more 
comprehensive  evaluation  as  is  done  with  the  school  superintendent,  and  that  evaluation  should 
address  the  results  that  can  be  accomplished  and  a  wide  range  of  leadership  skills  that  should  be 
demonstrated.  For  that  to  work,  we  ask  that  the  council  adopt  after  getting  public  input  an 
organizational  vision  mission  goals  and  objectives  that  can  be  objectively  tracked  to  determine 
progress.  We  also  recommend  that  the  city  manager  complete  a  self-evaluation.  In  addition  to 
working on the initial evaluation of the manager and designing a comprehensive manager evaluation, 
we  asked  that  the  council  establish  a  process  and  timing  for  a  National  City  Manager  search  and 
hiring process. That process should include a national salary survey. At a recent public meeting of 
the  Cambridge  Residents  Alliance,  many  residents  expressed  dissatisfaction  with  the  lack  of 
evaluation  of  the  manager  by  the  Council,  and  expressed  concerns  about  specific  aspect  of  the 
manager’s  performance.  For  example,  residents  were  unhappy  that  there  were  a  number  of  issues

where the manager had not responded to the council's repeated policy orders. And you heard about 
those  at  the  prior  meeting  of  this  committee.  Residents  also  expressed  dissatisfaction  with  the 
development  model  that  this  and  prior  managers  have  used,  which  includes  granting  permits  for 
substantial commercial development in order to generate tax revenue. So a comprehensive evaluation 
as the manager and planning on how to hire the next manager would benefit our city. And I hope that 
you will work on that as soon as possible. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And thank you for your testimony. Heather Hoffman, followed by Reverend Ellis Washington. After 
which we have Mike Nakagawa. 
 
Heather Hoffman   
Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street. I want to start out by expressing my disappointment that 
we're having this meeting at all. We shouldn't be meeting. Patrick Barrett’s right, this is a crisis and 
we're  not taking  it  seriously.  That  being  said,  when  I  say  that  I  live in  the center  of the  ATM that 
makes that triple A bond rating possible. And what I see around me is families leaving because the 
overdevelopment in my neighborhood is making it unlivable. And we are doing nothing to increase 
the  supply  of  homes  –  not  people  warehouses  –  homes  in  this  city.  Why  are  values  going  up? 
Because  we  don't  have  more  homes;  we  have  more  and  more  and  more  people  working  here.  We 
build more and more and more commercial development. But we don't build homes. What we build 
is  the  functional  equivalent  of  extended  stay  motels,  places  with  six-month  leases.  If  you  ask  the 
developers of all these big apartment buildings, what they expect their annual turnover to be, every 
last one of them will say 50 to 100%. We are not getting neighbors. We're getting people who are 
passing  through  that  does  not  create  the  community  that  this  city  needs  to  remain  the  place  that  I 
personally want to live in for the rest of my life. The place -- what we are turning into is a place that 
my  husband  wants  to  leave.  That  my  neighbors  want  to  leave.  That  we  know  that  we  are  losing 
people. We've -- people have talked about the statistics of people of color leaving. We are not doing 
this right. 
 
Heather Hoffman   
And  I  believe  that  we  need  to  find  a  city  manager  who  looks  to  our  future,  who  looks  to  create 
community.  Not  someone  who  sees  his  job as  primarily  collecting  taxes.  Collecting  taxes  is  a fine 
thing. But if you have no vision for what to do with them, then you've missed a huge part of the job. 
Why  is  it  that  we  had  this  huge  problem  over  Eversource,  not  just  in  my  neighborhood,  but  in 
Cambridgeport as well? Because the city hasn't planned. And when in the Envision process they were 
asked about talking about energy, they were told “no, you may not.” Imagine where that must have 
come from. Because it didn't come from the vision of the consultant.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your testimony. 
 
Heather Hoffman   
Thank you.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
We  have  Reverend  Ellis  Washington,  there  are  three  other  people  that  are  signed  up.  If  you're 
interested in speaking on the record, there are index cards at the table, just fill them out, and the clerk 
will come pick them up. So there's anyone that speak wants to speak on the record, please fill out one 
of these index cards and the Clerk can pick it up past the Washington,

Reverend Ellis Washington   
Thank  you  for  the  ability  to  address  you  on  this  issue  and  I  rise  to  support  the  extension  of  the 
contract for Mr. Louie DePasquale. I am Pastor Ellis Washington of the St. Paul AME Church, 37 
and  85  Bishop  Allen  drive.  And  although  I've  been  pastor  of  St.  Paul  now  going  into  my  seventh 
year,  I  realize  that is  relatively  short compared to some  of  the  persons  I've heard  speak,  who  have 
lived here all their life. But I will say that it is been a joy getting to know Mr. DePasquale, especially 
over  the  last  few  years,  I've  been  honored  to  serve  as  a  member  of  the  City  Manager's  Advisory 
Council. I've had a chance to get to know him, better watch him work, get a feel for his leadership for 
his  heart,  which  I  believe  is  truly  at  the  center  of  Cambridge.  He  loves  not  only  the  city,  and  as 
you've heard others say he knows the city, inside and out. But I also want to say  that he's someone 
that I trust as someone who has a heart in the right place for doing what is right for everyone, to the 
best of his ability, in the city. I trust him as it regards to issues of affordable housing and working 
towards those issues. And I trust him as someone who not only leads with humility, but is responsive 
to the needs of persons in the community. And so with that, I would just simply urge that we extend 
the contract of Mr. DePasquale. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your testimony. Mike Nakagawa followed by Dennis Benzan, then James Williamson. 
 
Mike Nakagawa   
Hello.  Mike  Nakagawa  51  Madison  Avenue.  I  just  like  to  start  by  saying  that  I  agree  with  what 
Heather  Hoffman  had  said  except  change the  neighborhood  to  Alewife, and  I've  lost  my  spouse  to 
cancer. So that part didn't apply either. On my personal comments on-- I think Louie has done well 
fiscally for the city. But it comes from an older time in the 70s or 80s, early 80s, when the city was 
struggling and getting businesses to come has been what has built the city to be as desirable as it is 
now. But I believe the times have changed and he's too conservative for the current conditions. The 
commercial growth has made much more demand for housing than we can keep up with, with all the 
jobs  we've  created.  And  there  are  no  signs  of  it  stopping.  I  think  we  could  do  more  by  looking  at 
what  getting  things  from  the  commercial  basis.  I  just  moved  in  started  this  week  at  Cambridge 
Crossing  as  one  of  the  first  commercial  tenants  there,  and  I'm  watching  all  the  foundations  go  out 
surrounding the building there. Louie has advertised every year how low our property taxes are just 
year after year, but then we don't have the money in the budget for more affordable housing projects 
or  just  or  support  for  low  income  housing.  We  can't  afford  more  traffic  patrol  officers  or  enough 
CDD  staff  to  handle  the  workload  that  they  have,  which  is  just  incredible.  As  part  of  the  climate 
resilience  zoning  Task  Force,  I  don't  see  enough  priority  for  our  climate  crisis.  I  don't  see  him  as 
pushing that widely. And citywide broadband has been on the table for a long time. If we renew his 
contract as I fully expect, I think we should make some goals and review them and start a process as 
the basis for what will come later. Maybe we can hire him as a consultant for part of the time so you 
can mentor the next city manager and take that energy but let someone grow into their role. We knew 
that the end of his contract would be coming actually multiple times, we have not made a succession 
plan except what appears to be fourth in the line of the Healy -- I don't know what you want to call it. 
But  I  would  like  to  see more diversity in the power  structure  of the  chief  officers  of  the  executive 
branches of our federal, state, and municipal levels and this is one place we could start. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And thank you for your testimony. Dennis Benzan, followed by James Williamson.

7.2

Good evening, Madam Chair, council members. My name is Dennis Benzan. I reside at 1 Pine Street 
in  Cambridge.  I  want  to  thank  all  the  speakers  that  came  before  me.  Rob  was  actually  my  son's 
coach, and my son got a chance to play in that game last year against Louie in a championship. So, 
you  know,  I  really  want  to  just  thank  everyone  for  all  the  great  comments  around  Louie.  I'm  here 
today to support renewing manager DePasquale’s contract. I came to know Louie first as a director of 
the Mayors summer youth employment program back in 1993 through 1996. It was the time when I 
fought to grow the program from about 350 youth workers to 550 youth workers. It was up to Louie 
as the city's finance leader to figure out how to fund it. And he did. He understood that our youth are 
partly shaped early by employment experiences. And so Louie did his best to find the money to grow 
the program. I later had the opportunity to work closely with Louie when I served as vice mayor and 
co  chair  of  the  ordinance  committee  and  Subcommittee  on  economic  development,  here  in  these 
chambers. During my tenure, as many of you know, I fought for affordable housing, support for the 
opioid  addiction,  the  arts  and  science,  technology,  education,  arts  and  mathematics  education.  In 
particular, for the utilization of the foundry building, as a steam workforce training site. Whether it 
was helping me understand the financial implications of new development or finding money to help 
save  expiring  use  buildings,  or  find  money  to  support  our  first  city  supported  Latino  festival  at 
University Park, or to help find money to help beautify central square, Louie was always willing to 
find a way to financially support these efforts. Today I serve with Louie on the CHA board, where I 
have witnessed firsthand his commitment to our immigrant community and those often served by a 
health care system. Louie is someone that has mastered the ability to find a balance between being 
fiscally  responsible  on  the  one  hand,  and  serving  the  most  in  need  on  the  other  hand.  This  is  the 
ability to bounce social and economic justice with fiscal responsibility. It’s one of the  -- one of the 
key  characteristics  of  some  of  the  best  leaders,  municipal  leaders.  Louie's  one  of  them.  So  when  I 
hear  members  of  this  council  suggest  that  we  need  a  new  city  manager  because  our  current  city 
manager does not have enough social economic justice in him, I want you to look in the mirror. And 
I want you to ask yourself: “Have I really been socially, socially and economically just myself? And 
for  how  long?”  I'm  bothered  by  those  of  you  in  these  chambers  that  often  question  others  for  not 
having enough social justice. When leaders like Louie have exemplified social and economic justice 
for much of their life. He's the one that he's walking through Central Square-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Two things. You have come to the end of your time, and I failed to introduce you appropriately as the 
former  vice  mayor  and  city  councilor  on  the  city  council.  So  please  accept  my  apologies  for  not 
doing that for you. But I would have to respectfully ask you to yield the floor. 
 
Dennis Benzan   
Okay. just 10 seconds? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Do I have unanimous consent for 10 seconds plus one. That's 11. 
 
Dennis Benzan   
Thank you. I appreciate it Madam Chair. I just want to end by just saying this. I'm a business owner 
in Central Square. Our city’s about to face one of the most important and critical challenges in the 
history of this city. I ask you guys to focus your attention on the challenges that lie ahead. Louie is 
someone  that  could  help  lead  us  through  these  challenges.  What  we're  about  to  see  in  the  city  is 
something  that  we  probably  have  never  seen  in  the  history  of  this  city.  So  I  ask  you  to  go  with 
stability and go with somebody that really knows our city. And let's not waste any time. Thank you.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And thank you for your testimony. James Williamson? 
 
James Williamson   
Thank  you.  First  of  all,  I'd  like  to  ask  that  the  Department  of  Cambridge's  Department  of  Public 
Health be asked to remove – they are the principal website that is providing information on the virus 
and I would ask-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
That's not before us this evening. 
 
James Williamson   
Okay. I would like to ask why the city manager has perhaps not been more attentive to the fact that 
the  principal  place  for  information  linked  from  the  website  has  this  grotesque  image  of  the  actual 
molecule of the virus, which is not reassuring, which is kind of scary-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
I am going to help guide you a bit. We're speaking to the extension, could you keep your-- 
 
James Williamson   
I  thought  it  was  important  enough,  given  the  fact  that  we  have  this  pandemic,  to  bring  this  to  the 
attention of people in the government and in the government, including the manager. So I'm going to 
go out on a limb and predict that the manager’s contract will be extended. I do think there might be a 
question  about  MIT's  favorite  phrase:  you  can't  manage  what  you  don't  measure.  And  I  wonder  if 
there are metrics for measuring the performance of city managers and if there were what they would 
look like, and I'm not convinced they exist or that it would be necessarily very easy to come up with 
any. I just want to point out some areas where I've been disappointed. Somebody said earlier that it's 
the  little  things  that  matter.  I  think  some  people  seem  to  get  their  concerns  addressed  and  other 
people  don't.  On  Sunday,  the  Number  1  bus  is  going  to  no  longer  make  the  stops  around  Harvard 
Yard. It is going to turn down Dunster Street. I would like – I wish that the city administration and 
the management had done a better job advocating for those of us who don't have cars, which is what 
we're all supposed to be doing and rely on the bus service, which is no longer going to exist in the 
name of supposedly reducing the travel time by two minutes. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Mr. Williamson, please stay on the subject of the city manager. 
 
James Williamson   
I'm talking about issues of – people talked about baseball here. And I'm talking about – 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
In the context of the manager – 
 
James Williamson   
Yes, and I am talking about the city manager's role in sticking up for and giving voice to the concerns 
of the people who live in this city, I think some of my observations are actually more relevant than 
some of the things that have been allowed to be said by others. I'm concerned, I have concerns that I 
think  have  gone  unaddressed  by  the  city  manager.  So  is  it  alright  if  I  talk  about  some  of  those 
concerns or not? Okay, so not being able to take the bus anymore at stops that I've been relying on

for  years,  is  a  concern.  Not  getting  protection  as  a  pedestrian  walking  along  a  supposedly  shared 
path. These are issues that I've actually sat down with, and met with the manager and discussed and 
hoped  for  these  concerns  being  addressed.  The  shared  pathways,  supposedly  shared  pathways  out 
where I live. You were interrupting me, and I think maybe I could get a little bit of a consideration 
for the fact that you were interrupting -- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
With the council's consent, you have 10 more seconds. 
 
James Williamson   
Ten more seconds well, and this is a democratic process, that we're all supposed to be touting how 
wonderful it is. I’d just like the opportunity to speak to a few areas where I think there's been some 
failures. And that has to do with pedestrian safety out where I live where I don't even want to walk to 
the T station anymore because of the way people race their bikes through the supposedly shared path. 
Couldn't something be done about that? Nothing's been done. Couldn't something be done to train the 
lifeguards to be able to keep the DCR pool open for the two weeks that it's now being shut when $15 
million can be found to pay members of the Shocket family to sustain affordable units.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you so much for your testimony. 
 
James Williamson   
I, I there's a couple things that I would have liked to have said but this is obviously not a hospitable 
environment for people to be able to speak about their concerns. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Is there anyone who would like to speak on the record before we close public comment, please come 
forward.  Is  there  anyone  that  would  like  to  speak  on  the  record  before  we  close  public  comment? 
Seeing  none,  pleasure  of  the  committee.  On  a  motion  by  Councillor  McGovern  to  close  public 
comment, all those in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it have a comment is now closed. 
As I said-- 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Point of order, Madam Chair, we should do a roll call. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Oh, thank you. I forgot you were here. Roll call please Mr. Clerk.

Motion passes. Five in favor, zero against. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you. With the roll call vote, and my apologies to you Councillor Zondervan, Public Comment 
is now closed. As I mentioned earlier in the meeting, just for people's, anyone who has any health 
concerns, please do not feel as though you have to sit through the rest of the meeting. We'd like to 
encourage you to go to your place where you feel most – more safe. But I am not going to discourage 
you to stay if it is your will. That being said, so at our last meeting of the government operations, 
claims--  and  claims,  a  couple  of  things  came  up  we  took  them  as  suggestions,  I  came  up  on  the 
agenda. There was a discussion around evaluation, there was discussion around goals, and there was 
discussion about having a process in this process if I understood it correctly, that we would talk about 
what we're doing in context of our current city manager, while we looked for a new city manager—or 
put a process together. And I had said that I-- what I would do is I would look all those suggestions 
over,  which  I  did,  and  come  back  with  a  suggestion  of  a  process.  So  let  me  just  say  for  you,  my 
thoughts, and then we will open the floor and I hope that we will be able to take a few votes. And 
again, in the interest of people's health and safety, I would hope that we could do this in such a way 
we don't keep people very long. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
On  the  subject  of  evaluation,  it  did  come  up  that  the  council  did  not  formally  evaluate  the  city 
manager.  And  so  when  I  looked  over  the  records,  there  was--  that  the  government  operations  and 
claims  committee,  which  is  given  that  charge,  did  not  call  a  meeting  to  ask  for  a  public  or  full 
evaluation of the city manager. In the city manager's contract, it does say part 2.3, "The city council 
shall  review  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  city  manager  at  meetings  scheduled  by  the 
government  operations  rules  and  claims  committee  of  the  city  council.  Said  review  and  evaluation 
shall  be  done  in  accordance  with  Massachusetts  General  law  30A  chapter  18-25."    So  it  was  the 
responsibility of the government operations rules and claims committee to have that evaluation, it did 
not happen. However, I do want for the record and I will give this-- I can give this to our clerk, I do 
have a letter where the city manager did reach out to the members of the city council and said, “Since

becoming  city  manager  I've  met  with  City  Councilors  and  listened  carefully  to  the  collective 
feedback that they've shared with me. I’ve work hard to be responsive to the advice provided to me I 
believe that giving and receiving honest feedback is the foundation of a positive relationship between 
our city manager and the City Council. If you're interested in meeting with me please contact Stacey 
Cooper, cc’d above, to schedule a time.” And then as a part of this letter, there were 12 opportunities 
to meet with him. But it also said, “if none of these times work for you, please give me a call through 
my  executive  assistant  and  I  will  accommodate  that.”  So  I  just  want  to,  for  the  record  say,  that 
although  the  government  operations  rules  and  claims  committee  did  not  call  for  an  evaluation,  the 
city manager on his own ability reached out to each city councillor and said, I want to sit down and 
go over my work performance with you. So, I want to clear the air about the fact that there was no 
evaluation of the city manager. There was an evaluation of the city manager. There wasn't one under 
government operations rules and the claims committee. I take that as the faux pas of the council and 
not of the city manager. The next item that came before as a suggestion was around the goals. And I 
did  sit  down  and  talk  with  the  clerk  just  to  see  where  we  were  at,  what  goals  that  we  might  be 
considering.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And  the  record  shows  that  the  goals  that  this  council  is  operating  under  are  the  2017-2018  goals, 
because the government operations claims and rules committee did not take up the goals of the city 
council in that term. And so just so people know that the goals that we're working under are the 17/18 
goals. And where I think it is extraordinarily important that we have goals, a sense of purpose and a 
sense of direction, I just do think that one of the things that the council should do outside of the city 
manager's  discussion  on  his  extension,  it  should  not  be  in  this  context.  And  then  the  last  thing  I 
thought was very important was a conversation about looking for a new city manager. So either in 
two years or in four years, we will be looking for a new city manager. And I think that it is important 
that we have a process through which that we look to decide what that process is. I do believe that 
that  process  is  different  than  of  negotiating,  or  having  a  discussion  around  what  goes  on  with  our 
current city manager. So where I agree that there should be a process, I don't think these two are the 
same. I think one is about an extension. And the other is about who that new city manager may be. 
And  I  think  that  it  is  imprudent  upon  this  council  to  look  at  that  and  talk  about  that  and  have  a 
process through which we have that discussion. But I do not think it is appropriate to have it in this 
context.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
So what I am putting forward to you this evening is the following: that the government operations 
committee has now formally received the request from Louie A. DePasquale [sic] decided to enter 
into discussions to extend his contract as city manager. I see that as the first step. And that's what we 
are now.  His letter is here, we've accepted. I am going to ask that there is a motion that I, as the chair 
of  the  government  operations  committee,  be  authorized  to  have  a  discussion  with  Mr.  DePasquale 
regarding that request. The third step would be after that discussion, I would schedule an executive 
session to discuss strategies regarding this. The fourth step would be that we as the participants go 
into Executive Session to agree to negotiate an extension. And then the next step would be to hold 
the negotiations. And if those negotiations are successful, that would lead to Step five, which is that 
the government operations committee would then forward a recommendation to the full City Council 
for voting upon. Those are my suggestions and so with that, I open the floor for discussion.

Madam  Chair  for  purposes  of  discussion,  I  would  move  to  a  vote  of  the  government  operations 
committee  to  authorize  the  chair,  Councillor  Simmons,  to  enter  into  negotiations  with  the  city 
manager in terms of the process that you just laid out. And to move forward with that. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you, Councillor Toomey. There is a motion before the committee to authorize the chair to be 
authorized to have a discussion with Mr. DePasquale regarding this request. Discussion. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. And I would-- picking back up the point about the evaluation which is 
in the city's-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Councillor  Sobrinho-Wheeler,  we're  using  new  technology,  and  so  I  just  want  to  urge  you  to  slow 
down a little bit so that your testimony is picked up. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Sure. Thank you. And, as you noted in the city manager's contract, section 2.3, it says the city council 
shall  review  and  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  city  manager  at  meetings  scheduled  by  the 
government operations rules and claims committee of the city council. And that also, those meetings-
- said review and evaluation shall be done in accordance with the Open Meeting laws. As you noted, 
we haven't had those meetings and you pointed out that the city manager reached out to Councillors 
and that isn't the same thing as having an open evaluation process. And those meetings were off the 
record. They weren't done in accordance with Open Meeting Law. And I would suggest that to move 
forward  without  conducting  an  evaluation  would  be  in  violation  of  the  contract,  and  therefore  in 
violation of the city's charter, which puts in the council to hire the city manager. I would like to see a 
written evaluation done beforehand with input of each of the different Councillors. The city manager 
is  the  most  important  person  in  carrying  out  the  council's  goals  on  a  lot  of  different  aspects; 
municipal  broadband,  transit,  affordable  housing.  Evaluation  is  also  important  because  the  city 
manager  is  the  most  powerful  person  in  Cambridge  City  government,  and  our  neighbors  in 
Somerville and  in  Boston,  that  would  be  the mayor.  In  Cambridge,  that's  not  the  case.  It's  the city 
manager who isn't directly elected by the public. And I think it's our duty as the council to have a 
formal evaluation that's public so that councillors know-- So the public knows how Councillors stand 
on  the  city  manager.  And  I'd  like  to  see  the  evaluation  before  we  move  forward  with  the  contract 
extension. And I also don't think it's appropriate to make an important decision at this time, given the 
COVID-19 outbreak. There were a number of folks who didn't come tonight because of fear of being 
in open spaces. I know the solicitor is working on looking at Open Meeting Law and the potential to 
have public input and public meetings of the council at a way that complies with Open Meeting Law 
that  maybe  doesn't  necessitate  being  here  in  person.  I  would  like  to  see  this  take  place  before  we 
move forward. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you. Further discussion.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Madam Chair.

Councillor  Zondervan  and  then  we'll  hear  from  Councillor  McGovern.  Councillor  Zondervan  you 
have the floor. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank  you,  Madam  Chair,  I  first  of  all  want  to  affirm  the  comments  by  my  colleagues  who  just 
spoke: I don't think we should even be having this meeting, given the seriousness of the crisis that 
we're dealing with. And I think it speaks to the question before us how this crisis has been handled 
thus far, and how it's being handled going forward. I think we have failed to prepare for this crisis, 
and it’s continuing to not prepare properly for what we are facing. I think that's a serious concern. 
And in terms of the process, the motion that you've proposed, I completely agree with my colleague 
that  it  would  be  inappropriate  to  proceed  in  that  manner,  without  having  an  evaluation  of  the  city 
manager's contract. And the evaluation will take place in the context of the goals set by the previous 
Council, I believe you meant to say that we are operating under the 2016-2017 goals because we did 
not  set  different  goals  in the  2018-2019  term.  And  we've  also  not  set  different  goals  in  the  current 
term thus far. And so, again, I don't think we can proceed in the way that you propose. I think the 
correct  way  to  proceed  is  to  conduct  an  evaluation  of  the  manager's  performance.  We  furthermore 
have the better part of a year to complete this process. So there's no particular need to move in this 
way.  And  our  attention  should  rightly  be  focused  on  dealing  with  the  coronavirus  crisis,  as  was 
pointed out during public comments by my colleagues, and not on conducting this particular process 
right now. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for your remarks. Do you yield the floor councillor? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Yes, one more thing. We also are dealing with a gender discrimination lawsuit, which I also think is 
relevant and should be discussed in the context of this particular contract. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you, councilor. And Councillor Zondervan having yielded the floor, I will now give the floor 
over to Councillor McGovern. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Thank you, Madam Chair. [sic] Just to make sure I understand correctly. The motion is to allow you 
just  to enter  into  conversations  with  the  city manager  about  an  extension. We are  not--  we are not 
approving an extension, at this point. We are not voting to extend his contract, at this point. In order 
for you to even begin to have those conversations with him, you need authorization in which to do 
that. Is that correct? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Yes, that is correct councillor. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
So, you know-- 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Point of order, Madam Chair. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons

Please state, please, please state your point of order, councillor. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
I don't believe that was a correct summary of the motion. The motion outlined five or six different 
steps, beginning with you having a conversation with the manager. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
I don't believe that's a point of order councilor, and I give the floor back to Councillor McGovern. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
So I think then, maybe I was confused. I thought that you were listing out the potential steps of the 
process, but the initial step or the initial motion was to allow you to start that process. Am I incorrect 
in thinking that -- hearing it that way? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
To respond to you, Councillor: the motion that I was calling for was to get the chair--  the chair be 
authorized to have a discussion with Mr. DePasquale regarding his request. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Okay. So all we're doing tonight is giving you permission to start a conversation about his request for 
an extension. That I think is appropriate, it moves the conversation forward. It doesn't guarantee that 
an extension is going to be given, it doesn't guarantee that we can't take other steps in the meantime, 
but it allows you to start a conversation. And I apologize for not having either my computer or the 
contract right in front of me, but I do want to clarify one thing. Councillor Zondervan mentioned that 
we have a year or maybe he said over a year, I thought we had to let the manager know by September 
of this year, about whether or not we were extending his contract. So it is not-- am I correct in that 
[sic]. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
To  your  point,  I  believe  I'm  reading  the  right  section,  Section  three,  "The  Term",  3.4  reads  as 
follows: "If the city intends to continue meet Mr. DePasquale employment beyond January 8, 2021. 
It shall give written notice to Mr. DePasquale on or before September 14, 2020." 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Okay,  so  we  don't  have  a  year  to  do  this.  We  have  until  September  14,  2020.  So  I  just  wanted  to 
make sure I was correct on that. You know, you asked to keep messages, you know, comments brief, 
so I will. So I'm not going to get into why I think it's appropriate to extend Mr. DePasquale's contract 
for two years. You know, I think it's very easy to focus on the things that we're not happy with. You 
know, we heard broadband mentioned a couple times. I'm not happy with that either. But yet, I don't 
know  quite  where  we  started  believing  that  we  have  to  be  happy  about  everything  that  somebody 
does  in  order  to  have  them  continue  to  be  employed  with  the  city.  You  know,  when  you  look  at-- 
when I-- and we heard comments about, and I mean no disrespect to former city manager Healy, but 
when  we  hear  comments  about  Mr.  DePasquale  is  just  an  extension  of  city  manager  Healy,  and 
although  I  didn't  serve  with  city  manager  Healy,  I  can  pretty  much  guarantee  you  haven't  been 
around at that time, when I look at the surveillance ordinance, first of its kind in the country that we 
passed,  the  facial  recognition  ordinance,  not  the  first  but  one  of  the  first,  the  bike  infrastructure 
ordinance, the first of its kind in the country. Mr. DePasquale went into those conversations at-- you 
know, timid on some not sure where he stood, against some of them, and was able to sit down with 
constituents,  with  stakeholders  to  discuss  and  work  out a compromise,  to  work  out  and  change  his

opinion.  And  you  know,  that  is  something  we  didn't  see  in  the  past.  So  I  don't  make  that--  just 
because  someone  happened  to  work  in  City  Hall  when  Mr.  Healy  was  here  doesn't  mean  that  that 
person is Mr. Healy. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
You know, and-- and that's not a knock on Mr. Healy. There are a lot of good things Mr. Healey did. 
So  I  think--  but  beyond  that,  beyond  my  feeling  that  I  think  the  manager  has  earned  a  two  year 
extension, I do think I've been part of a few national searches. When we do them, we often hear from 
a  lot  of  the  same  people  we're  hearing  from  tonight  that  they've  gone  too  fast,  they've  been  too 
rushed. There wasn't enough input, having a two year-- an ability over two year extension to actually 
plan a community process where we can really think about and have time to talk about what we want 
to see in the next city manager is actually something I think would be a great benefit to the city. And 
so for those two reasons, I'm-- I am happy to move this forward and to vote to, again, only allow you 
to begin conversations and that does not guarantee anything. I'm only one person here, but I just felt I 
had  to  respond  to  some  of  the  things  that  we  heard  today.  You  know,  I  am  not--  I  am  not  in 
agreement with the city manager on every decision, nor should I expect to be, but he is open. He is 
flexible.  He  communicates.  He  is  willing  to  look  at  things  from  all  perspectives.  He  is  willing  to 
compromise. He is willing to collaborate. And those are all very positive things. Thank you, Madam 
Chair. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you, Councillor McGovern. Do you yield the floor? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Point of information.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Please, please state your point of information 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
In the motion that the chair made, would the negotiations with the city manager just be between the 
chair and the city manager? Would they be the government operations committee as a whole? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Just the chair.  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Is it possible to amend the motion to include the government operations committee? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
You  can  but--  I  would  have  to--  I  am  going  to  recognize  my  colleague  that  has  asked  to  have  the 
floor before you, and then we can come back to you. Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
Sorry, I didn't hear you. Thank you, Chair Simmons. I'm not a voting member of this committee. So I 
won't be able to vote on anything that's coming before us. And I also appreciate that you recognized 
me  so  that  I  could  respond  a  little  bit.  I  also  appreciate  the  research  you  did  on  the  couple  of 
questions that were raised at the last one, notably on the evaluation and the question of goals. And on 
the  evaluation:  it  is  unfortunate  that  the  prior  Committee,  which  I  believe  was  perhaps  not  your

committee, did not convene to look at an evaluation. As you may remember, it happened a couple 
times when I served on school committee and it was not good. It's never positive for a body to not do 
its job. And that's part of our job, as you pointed out, that is not something that it was only on the city 
manager, it really was on the council to do. That being said, if this goes forward to have a discussion, 
it's not too late to do a very quick evaluation in the next month even of the city manager, which I as a 
council member would like to be able to, to contribute to. So I understand that it didn't happen in the 
past,  we  can't  change  that.  What  we  can  do  as  a  body  is  to  use--  there  are  several  existing  city 
manager evaluation forms, or even if it's just a very simple form of here are the goals that as you also 
pointed out, while they’re from 17-18, they’re at least our operating goals because we haven't, as a 
body  included  any  others,  have  the  city  manager  do  a  self  evaluation  and  then  even  if  it  is  just 
strengths and weaknesses, here's your goals, it seems to me it would make the process more complete 
as we move forward and that does not have to extend out. And I would definitely say it should not 
extend out for many, many months, even if we have till September, whatever this decision is made, it 
should not wait until September, in my view, because that would put us in a position of having only a 
few months, if, depending on where this was going. But again, I really believe and I, I can I know 
I've probably have a couple of my files of city manager kind of evaluation, just a very quick form, I 
encourage us and encourage you, as chair to consider just over the next month to ensure that that is-- 
we are following the contract that all of us have a chance-- and we and it's good for the city manager. 
This is-- evaluations are really positives about how it is that positive work was done and to really sit 
back  and  summarize.  And  on  the  question  moving  forward,  it  seems  like  you've  laid  out  the  steps 
again, I don't have a say in that. I do think they're-- this city manager has done a lot of really positive 
things for the city, and there's also some questions people have and that's where I sit and that I really 
actually want to benefit from hearing from all my colleagues and talking to people around the city 
about their sense of it, because it will be a very important vote that I will take and I right now, I'm not 
sure how I would vote because I feel like I need more information. Thank you so much.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And thank you for your testimony. You're yielding the floor? Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Thank  you.  Yeah,  I  would  make  a  move  to  amend  the  motion  to  include  the  full  government 
operations committee in that contract extension discussions. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Is there any discussion on the amendment? Councillor McGovern 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Madam Chair? Is there any-- having not been part of this previously-- Actually, I was but very early 
on. What's the precedent? How does this usually go? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you for raising that. So best practice recommends or suggests that the chair or the government 
operations, whoever that person may be, is the lead individual that has the discussion. And so please 
take the idea of a discussion that launches this conversation, one that opens up a process and does not 
close it out. It is so usually the best practice and I had an opportunity to talk to several people about 
this, that have done it as part of the job, this is this is the standard, is to first have a conversation, and 
then come back to the committee based-- with what comes out of that discussion. But again, it is just 
a conversation.

Councillor Marc McGovern   
And  Madam  Chair  and  I believe--  I  believe  that  on  the  school  committee, it  was  similar.  It  wasn't 
when--  there  wasn't  a  government  operations--  wasn't  that  title.  I  believe  it  was  the  vice  chair  that 
would initiate conversations and then we would meet an executive session to discuss with the full-- 
with the full committee. I think if my memory serves me which-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
I  think  you're  absolutely  right  Councillor  McGovern.  It's  not  usually--  the  group  does  not  get 
involved until the groundwork has been laid out. And it's laid out usually by either-- on the school 
committee side, it's usually the laid out by the mayor or the vice mayor, the mayor designating a lead 
individual  to  lead those  discussion  and  bring it  back  to the  council.  So,  using  best  practice,  what  I 
have  suggested  to  this  committee  is  to  authorize  the  chair  to  start  that  discussion,  from  which  we 
have further discussion. Do yield the floor Councillor? Further discussion on the amendment. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Point of information on that, what-- could you explain a little bit what groundwork would be laid in 
the discussion that would then be brought back to the committee? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Are you talking to me?  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
I am. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
When  I  talk  about  groundwork--  so  we  do  know  that  the  [sic]--  superintendent  on  the  brain  now-- 
that the city manager is interested in extending his contract, but we have nothing to work with. And 
so the discussion would be looking at so what is the city manager looking-- What does that look like 
to him? We can't have a meaningful discussion about anything, until we have something in front of 
us.  And  so  this  groundwork,  if  you  will,  would  be  to  have  that  discussion  is:  What  is  it,  Mr.  City 
Manager, that you are seeking from the council by way of your two year extension? Then we bring 
that back in Executive Session because best practice has suggested that you don't negotiate personnel 
issues in an open forum. So that would be brought back to the voting members-- But any member of 
course, can come to executive session-- to the voting members to be discussed, negotiated, and then 
we will move forward, if that helps. Does that help you councillor?  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
That does. Thank you.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Is there any further discussion on the amendment? Hearing none, we will then-- 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Madam Chair.

Thank you. Could you clarify: has the manager requested a two year extension? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
The manager has requested a two year extension. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Okay.  And  could  you  explain  why  the  details  about  his  request  could  not  be  presented  to  the 
community as a whole. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
So Councillor Zondervan. Right now we're speaking about the amendment that has been offered by 
your colleague. And so discussion has to be around that amendment after which-- 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
That’s what I am discussing because-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Then I can't hear you very well. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
I apologize. His amendment is that the entire committee would enter into this conversation with the 
manager, rather than simply the chair. So, my question is why we would choose to have a chair in 
conversation with the manager. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
So if your question, Councillor, is why the chair, go into negotiation? My answer to you Councillor 
is best practices and former practices have been one which there is a lead person, it is usually more 
often than not the chair of government operations claims and rules, however the name is, and so I'm 
following  the  process,  the  procedure,  and  the  best  practices  of  earlier  processes.  Do  you  yield  the 
floor Councillor?  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Yes.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you. Further discussion. We are now voting on the amendment. And let me just speak to the 
amendment  before  I  yield  the  floor  for  the  call  the  roll.  Again,  I  have  spent  a  great  deal  of  time 
talking with people who have done this and also relying on my earlier experience, having served as 
mayor and serving on the school committee on the best practices. And the best practice is one, were 
the – in this case, government operations, the chair leads the process and brings back the discussion-- 
the  fruit  of  that  discussion  with  the  candidate  to  the  committee.  So  I  will  not  be  voting  for  the 
amendment  because  I  think  we're  just  launching  a  conversation.  I  will  not  be  voting  for  the 
amendment because, as has been earlier said, we are sort of in a place where we are in a crisis. And I-
- although I value the point of view of my colleagues, this is not the time for us to be sort of slowing 
down a process that we need to move forward, because we're talking about the leadership of our city 
which  is  shared  by  way  of  our  charter  with  the  city  manager.  So  I  am  going  to  vote  for  the  main 
motion when it comes forward, which is that we start a discussion. Having said that, I yield the floor 
and I asked the clerk to make a call the roll.

We are now going to-- 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Madam  Chair.  I  would  like  to  make a motion  that  we  move to  hold  a  meeting  to  evaluate  the  city 
manager's contract before we enter into negotiations and to my colleague’s point I agree that we don't 
have  to  agree--  approve  of  everything  in  the  city  manager's  position  to  extend  the  contract.  But  I 
think it's also true that we don't know how much of the city manager's performance we approve or 
don't approve of because we haven't evaluated it and every job I've-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Councillor, if you would please, we are in the process of a vote.  You had put an amendment before 
the Council, which failed. Now we have to move on the main motion unamended after which if you 
would like to bring your vote for it for discussion, and for a vote, you may but you cannot do it at this 
time.  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Thank you Madam Chair. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
You're very welcome. Mr. Claerk. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk   
Through  the  chair,  just  through  just  for  clarification,  I'm  just  going  to  read  the  motion  one 
more time for the body just so everyone's clear on what they're voting on. It was a motion  by 
Councillor  Toomey  to  authorize  the  chair  of  the  government  operation  rules  and  claims 
committee  to  meet  with  the  city  manager  to  discuss  his  contract  extension.  Is  that  correct, 
Councillor Toomey?

Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Now, we, we have before us the proposal of a motion that will be offered by 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler.  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  I  would  move  before  we  enter  into  negotiations  that  we  have  a  simple 
meeting to evaluate the city manager's contract beforehand. To my colleague’s point, we don't have 
to approve of everything. I think we should have a discussion about what we approve of and we don't 
approve of before we enter negotiations. I wasn't on the council last term. I couldn't have a say on 
whether the government operations had such a meeting. And I would like to see us have one now. I 
think  it's  a  pretty  straightforward  request  to  have  a  written  evaluation.  In  every  job  I've  had,  I've 
gotten  a  written  evaluation  at  some  point,  usually  multiple  times  a  year.  And  that  this  is  the  most 
important position in Cambridge. And I think we'd be doing the public a disservice by not having an 
evaluation that was open to the public. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Do you yield the floor councillor? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
I do. Thank you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Further discussion. Councillor McGovern.

Councillor Marc McGovern   
Just  through  you  to  Councillor  Sobrinho-Wheeler, when  you  say  before  negotiations are  you-- just 
want to make sure-- is that before the chair starts, the motion we just passed to allow the chair to start 
talking with the manager? Are you talking-- there negotiation sort of-- they're there-- They happen 
multiple times, multiple steps. So when are you expecting this to happen? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
I could amend the motion if it's helpful to within the next month, within the next maybe given the 
COVID virus and that we don't know the process, maybe within the next two months? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Through you Madam Chair. But again, is that -- my question is less about the time. But would your 
motion  for  preclude--  So  if  we  said that  we  would  do  this  in  two months, would  that  preclude  the 
chair from engaging in the initial discussion that we just passed? Because that's, I don't see that as a 
negotiation,  the  chair  is  not  negotiating  the  contract  with  the  manager,  the  chairs  will  be  having  a 
discussion  about  what  the  manager  is  looking  for  more  formally  and  bring  that  back.  So  I'm  just 
trying to get your definition of negotiation because I think an evaluation, you know, I would have no 
problem  writing  an  evaluation  doing  a  written  evaluation  of  the  superintendent  –  I'm  doing  it  to 
myself, Madam Chair – to the city manager. But I don't want to delay what we just voted on, which 
is  to  allow  Councillor  Simmons  to  begin  the  process  of  talking  to  him.  So  I  guess,  what's  your 
definition of negotiation? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Sure, I guess, I think a point of information would be helpful in just understanding what is involved 
in the discussion. I know the chair talked about it a little bit. But if we have the, the timeline of the 
extension that the city manager is asking for, could you clarify a bit about what else will be discussed 
in the discussions with the city manager? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
What  the  city  manager  is  looking  for,  and  nothing  more  than  that.  So  we  now  know  that  the  city 
manager is looking for an extension of his contract. And so this discussion would be what would be 
those things that he would be interested in seeing as a part of this extension. I'm saying two years. I'm 
trying to remember what the letter said. But in part, if it is, indeed two years, it would be: “okay, City 
Manager, you want an extension for two years. What does that look like?” You know, so I can bring 
something back to the government ops committee and say, “This is what the city manager is looking 
for.” And then we could then say, this is what we would like. And I would think if that if it is your 
inclination or the committee's inclination to ask for an evaluation that would be at that time, because 
as  I  understand  it  from  having looked at  best  practices,  because  we  the  council  failed to  execute a 
formal evaluation, both parties they have to agree, it is not standard practice. And one might even say 
a bit disingenuous to ask someone who has not been formally evaluated because the body that was 
poised to do that failed to do so, did not do it. And then to make that contingent on one's renewal or 
extension is in general practice and could be seen as maybe even inappropriate. But to your point, if 
it's something that you might be interested in, that is something that I could take to him to see if that 
is something he would be willing to agree upon. But to try to make an evaluation, a requirement to 
have a discussion, when the council again, has -- I'm trying to find a benign word -- not exercised its 
responsibility under the contract to have done it, I believe is inappropriate. So I would respectfully 
ask that you allow, by this vote, to go forward and have a discussion to see what is exactly on the 
table, and then we come back in Executive Session and have that discussion.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Madam Chair. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
I think I still have the floor. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
I don't [sic] – Councillor Zondervan, you'd have to wait because Councillor McGovern still has the 
floor. He had yielded it to get a response. To respond to a question. He still has the floor and has not 
yielded it. Councillor McGovern.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Thank you. And I think part of those discussions, you know, if the chair sits down, we know that the 
manager is looking for two years, that could change, he could change his mind and want more. But 
we at this point, it's two years. I don't think it will change, but it could. But part of those discussions 
would be you know, if the manager said, I'm looking for a two year extension, and I want to be paid 
$500,000  a  year,  he  would  lay  that  all  of  that  out  to  the  chair  who  would  then  come  back  in 
Executive Session to the council to say, here's what he's looking for. All we know now is that he's 
looking for a two year extension. We don't know if there's anything else he's asking for. That's when 
the negotiations begin, because then we respond to what he has put out there. So I don't you know, so 
I didn't think your motion would preclude that initial conversation from happening, but I just didn't 
know what you were thinking in your motion. As far as the motion itself: I am fine with doing an 
evaluation. I do want to-- hearing what the chair has said, I do want a little more clarification about-- 
I'm not ready to vote for that tonight is what I'm saying. But if we don't vote for tonight, it would not 
preclude us from bringing something forward and, you know, in the near future to do that. So today, I 
just have a couple questions in my mind that I want to think about. In terms of process, I will say for 
the record that I think I agree with the chair that I think the ball was dropped, you know, last term on 
this, but in how we proceed forward, I do want to think about that a little bit more, but I don't think 
an  evaluation  is  out  of  line  or  out  of  the  question.  So  I  will  not  vote  for  your  amendment,  or  that 
motion today. But I would like to talk to you more about that and maybe thinking about how we can 
move forward on something in the near future. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you Councillor McGovern. Are you yielding the floor? 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Yes.  
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Councilor Zondervan, you have the floor. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd like to first of all want to clarify that I have not read in the manager's 
letter  that  he's  formally  requesting  a  two  year  extension.  And  so  I  believe  that  will  be  one  of  the 
clarifications that you would obtain from him in your discussions as to the length of the extension. 
And I agree with my colleagues that we voted to authorize you to enter into conversation with him. I 
don't believe my colleague's motion would preclude or interfere with that in any way. I also believe 
that what the previous council did or didn't do isn't relevant. This current council is the one that has 
to decide on this contract extension or not. And not having a full evaluation, the manager while doing

the negotiation, I don't think is this proper procedure. So, and I'm not sure if this-- if I need to do a 
formal amendment or, or this offer a slightly more precise wording of the motion, which I would say 
is that the government operations committee will conduct a full performance evaluation of the city 
manager prior to entering into negotiations around his request to extend his contract. And I would say 
that  that  evaluation  process  would  happen  after  and  in  parallel  to  your  conversations  with  the 
manager. I don't think it would preclude you from speaking with him tomorrow. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Okay, thank you. Are you yielding the floor?  Okay. Thank you Councillor Zondervan. So, it sounds 
like to me, if I understand you are putting in an amendment to Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler's main 
motion. So let me ask is there any discussion on the amendment-- which you may have to restate a 
slowly  because  it's,  although  you're  audible,  it's  a  little  garbled.  So  please,  slowly  and  succinctly 
restate your amendment to Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler's main motion. Councillor Zondervan you 
have the floor. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank  you.  Yes,  Madam  Chair.  And  I  believe  my  colleague's  motion  was  for  the  government 
operations committee to have a meeting. And so I'm offering amendment by substitution that that we 
will  conduct  a  performance  evaluation.  So  I  will  read  it  again  more  slowly:  “That  the  government 
operations committee will conduct a full performance evaluation of the city manager prior to entering 
into negotiations around his request to extend his contract.” And I will also email a copy to the clerk. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you. Any questions? Does everyone understand what the motion is and so, what Councillors-- 
Are you yielding the floor Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Yes. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
So Councillor Zondervan is trying to amend by substitution. The order of a motion that says that the 
government ops will conduct a full performance evaluation. Is there any discussion?  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Yes, Madam Chair.  I can make a question about whether there can be an amendment or a separate 
motion. I'd like to see us leave this meeting with some other meetings scheduled to evaluate the city 
manager's contract. I'm open if we want to begin negotiations and set that meeting later, to make a 
motion that the evaluation would simply happen before we voted on the city manager's contract. I'm 
not sure if that's an amendment here or a separate motion. But would like to see us set a time for a 
meeting  at  the  last  government  operations  committee  meeting  there  was  a  lot  of  discussion  about 
having evaluation, we had more counselors than we have tonight, including the mayor and the vice 
mayor who weren't able to be here. I thought an evaluation would be the next step. I would like to see 
us get that on the books at this meeting-- 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
So  first  Councillor,  if  I'm  understanding:  you're  talking  about  the  amendment  by  substitution  of 
Councillor Zondervan. And so in terms of precedent of motions, we would vote that one – not unless 
you're trying to now put another motion before his motion by substitution. So you already have a-- if 
I understand the order, now have the Councillor Zondervan’s motion by substitution, we have your

underlying order, which asks, I think pretty much the same thing. Because I don't necessarily see the 
difference between the two. So I'm going to look to my clerk here, because it would seem like now as 
you're going to rescind your main motion, to substitute it with this new one. And I'm not quite certain 
what  the  order  would  be,  because  we  still  have  the  underlying  motion  and  then  a  motion  by 
substitution of which you're now trying to amend. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Point  of  order.    I'm  willing  to  make  it  as  a  separate  motion,  if  that  makes  things  more  simple 
procedurally. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
You would like at this time-- now we're talking about a motion by substitution. You will now want to 
put a motion before that one, that we vote that we have and evaluate  -- because I've totally lost the 
sequence here. So if you can help me, Mr. Clerk, 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk   
If  I  may  through the  chair.  Councillor  Sobrinho-Wheeler  made  a motion  –  and  this  is  what  I  have 
written down, so if I have any part of this incorrect, please correct me Councillor  – the motion was 
that the government operation rules and claims committee meet to evaluate the performance of the 
city  manager  prior  to  entering  into  negotiations  to  extend  the  city  manager's  contract.  That  is  the 
main  motion  that's  before  the  body,  before  any  other  motions  aside  from  amendments  can  be 
evaluated  or  taken,  that  motion  has  to  be  disposed  of.  During  the  course  of  the  discussion  on 
Councillor  Sobrinho-Wheeler's  motion,  Councillor  Zondervan  made  a  motion  to  amend  Councillor 
Sobrinho-Wheeler's  motion  to  state  that  the  government  operations  committee  will  conduct  a  full 
performance evaluation of the city manager prior to entering into negotiations around his request to 
extend his contract. So the order of operations in this case is that the committee will dispose of the 
amendment, and then we'll dispose of the main motion before we can entertain any other motions. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Councillor  Zondervan  if  you  could  hold  just  for  a  moment.  To  our  clerk:  so  right  now  we're  just 
voting for a motion by substitution and the main motion. And if both of those fail, we go to the next 
one?  Or  do  we  say  if  the  vote  by  substitution  fails  and  the  main  doesn't  fail,  we  still  vote  for 
something that's similar to… 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk   
If  the  motion  to  substitute  fails,  than  the  original  language  as  proposed  by  Councillor  Sobrinho-
Wheeler will be before the body for the council to vote on. The council could then vote that motion 
up or down whether it passes or fails, the council could entertain other motions, should there be any. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
I guess my question to you, because the motions by Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler are very similar, 
from  what  I  can  tell,  it  seems.  It  may  be  just  my  understanding  they're  very  similar.  Councillor 
Zondervan, I still have the floor, I will recognize you shortly. It just seems like they're very similar, 
but I'm gonna follow your lead on that. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk   
I  didn't  bring  my  copy  Robert's  Rules  with  me,  but  under  the  rules,  the  chair  has  the  discretion  of 
determining if a motion is proper, if it is – that a motion is improper – if it is something that the body 
has already voted on.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
And that would be-- so this is where I was kind of going. In my mind, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, 
the motion that you elected to bring and the motion that you've already brought are very similar. It's 
almost to me like getting two bites at the same apple. And my ruling: if the main motion were to fail, 
and then you would try to bring that next motion – and according to the clerk, because of what I feel 
is  that  they're  so  similar,  that  would  be  an  improper  motion,  and  would  not  bring  it  to  the  floor, 
because I would rule it was an inappropriate motion because they're just too similar to me. So having 
said that, I do have your colleague waiting to be heard, after which, if you'd like to speak, and then I 
think we should move on to the vote. Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank  you,  Madam  Chair.  I  do  apologize.  It's  a  little  difficult  to  do  this  remotely,  and  apologize 
through  you  to  my  colleagues  as  well  for  any  confusion  I'm  causing.  My  main  intent  of  the 
amendment  is  that  the  government  operations  committee  would  conduct  an  evaluation  versus  the 
original  motion,  which  says  that  the  operations  committee  would  have  a  meeting  to  have  an 
evaluation.  So  the  difference  being  that  the  evaluation  may  or  may  not  involve  meetings,  but  it's 
focused  on  conducting  evaluation  rather  than  just  having  a  meeting  to  evaluate  the  city  manager's 
performance. So I think evaluation can be more expansive than just having a meeting. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you, Councillor Zondervan for that clarification, I do have a better understanding. So if there's 
no further discussion, I would say this: again, having had several conversations around this process, 
and  the  idea  of  an  evaluation,  again,  it  is  not  best  practices,  not  standard  practice,  and  highly 
irregular, that you would evaluate someone at the time that they are asking for a two year or a two 
year extension, an extension, or a renewed contract. Although I do hear you very soundly, Councillor 
Sobrinho-Wheeler,  that  you've  not  had  the  opportunity  to  work  with  this  city  manager.  I  do 
understand that. However, I don't think the sins of the prior committee should be visited on the next 
group that falls behind. I still say that it was something that we should have done that did happen in 
some manner, maybe not formal as people would wish. So what I would then suggest is to allow me 
as the chair to have a discussion with the city manager – again, having talked to a number of people 
that have done this before, they have said that in terms of asking a candidate, a sitting employee to be 
evaluated  on  the  heels  of  their  contract  renewal,  whatever  iteration,  has  to  at  the  minimum  be  by 
mutual consent. So this committee would have to vote perhaps to do that. And then the city manager 
would  have  to  agree.  So  what  I  would  then  suggest,  we  can't  go  anywhere  if  we  can't  have  a 
discussion to launch the discussion about do you stay, do you go? How long do you want to stay? 
What do you want? For me to come back and say, okay, committee, this is what the city manager, 
our current city manager is looking to achieve. After which this committee could say, based on what 
the city manager would like, this is what we'd like to see. And then you can go into negotiation, but 
we're  trying  to  make  something  that  we  don't  have  the  framework  yet.  I'm  trying  to  offer  a 
framework.  And  so  I'm  not  going  to  vote  for  either  motion.  I  think  we  should  go  forward,  have  a 
discussion  and  from  that place,  we  now  have  a  baseline  from  which  to  go  forward.  We  will  know 
what the city manager’s intentions are, and then we can then discuss in Executive Session, what we 
see  as  the  places  to  which  we,  what  we  want  to  see  as  a  part  of  the  conditions  if  we  were  to  go 
forward.

We are also past the two hour limit. So to extend this meeting, I would have to have a vote because 
on our rules, so these meetings will not be more than two hours. So I'd like to entertain a motion to 
extend the meeting for 15 minutes. Is there a motion? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Roll call.

Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Madam Chair I believe you said you would recognize me after Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Okay, well I recognize you, then Councillor Toomey, I would hope that we can have a vote before 
the meeting expires. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
I take everything you say into consideration, and I'm willing to vote to move into discussion, I would 
just like to see us leave the meeting with an agreement for an evaluation at some point in the future. 
I'm willing to amend my original motion to have that evaluation be before the council votes on the 
city manager's contract if we want to start discussion, and I would just like to see us-- we've had two 
meetings now talked a lot about evaluation. I'd like to see us leave this meeting with an agreement to 
have an evaluation before we vote on the final product of the city manager's contract. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Thank you, Councillor. Do you yield the floor?  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
I do.

Councillor Timothy Toomey   
Thank you Madam Chair. I just want to re-emphasize just what you just previously said that you're 
going to have a conversation with the City Manager to lay out the parameters, the framework of how 
we're going to move forward. And after your discussions, you will be coming back to the government 
operations committee members, in discussing with those parameters and the framework side. And as 
that would be most appropriate time then to look at how we're going to move forward with includes 
the city manager evaluations. But until the conversation takes place between the chair, which is the 
most  appropriate,  of  the  government  operations  committee,  and  I  don't  know  why  the  previous 
government  committee  didn't  do  the  evaluation  of  the  goals,  but  that's  behind  us.  But  moving 
forward, you certainly have taken the lead to get this process moving the way it should be moving 
and so once we get those parameters, the framework then all those discussions after you share with 
the members of the committee can then take place and we can do as many evaluations or whatever 
and things but-- We have to first have that conversation then to allow that process to continue in the 
way  it's  supposed  to  be conducted.  And it’s  concluding  evaluations.  That's  how  we  move  forward. 
But until you have that, and the manager have the conversation, then we're just spinning the wheels 
here. So I would move the question on the, I know there's two motions, the substitution motion. I'll 
move the question on those. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
So Councillor Toomey has moved the question.  I will now call the roll. 
 
Anthony Wilson, City Clerk   
This  is  on  the  motion  to  move  the  question.  If  the  motion  to  the  question  passes,  then  we 
automatically move on to Councillor Zondervan's motion to amend. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
No. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Do  you  know  what  you  are  voting  for?  This  motion--  Councillor  Toomey  has  moved  to  call  the 
question. You have to vote a motion to call the question.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
My bad.  Yes, I vote to call the question. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Yes. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey   
Yes 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Yes 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons   
Yes.

▪  Discussing  CPSD’s  proposed  re-opening  models,  voting  on  Superintendent’s 

recommendations 

 
Through these meetings, we have engaged with scholars, families, educators, as well as curriculum and 
medical experts to help inform CPSD in their planning. We’ve learned that there is quite a long way for 
us  to  go  in  order  to  ensure  a  safe  re-opening-which  means  following  the  data  and  the  science-and 
preparation  for  another  shutdown-which  includes  a  robust  remote  learning  plan  and  adequate  childcare 
options for our families, not just compliance to state guidelines. 
 
With  increasing  evidence  of  the  need  for  surveillance  testing  to  safely  reopen  schools,  Vice-Mayor 
Mallon and I have been in many conversations with the City Manager, Superintendent, Broad Institute, 
and  Cambridge  Public  Health  Department  to  advocate  for  the  implementation  of  testing  in  our  school 
community. 
 
As  DESE  is  requiring  all  school  districts  to  submit  their  three  learning  models  (in-person,  hybrid,  and 
remote),  by  July  31st,  the  School  Committee  was  originally  scheduled  to  vote  on  CPSD’s  proposed 
models at the July 21st Special Meeting. However, my colleagues and I did not feel prepared to, with so 
many  questions  remaining  unanswered.  It  is  important  for  everybody  to  understand  that  given  our 
circumstances,  we  must  always  be  ready  to  adapt  and  pivot  with  new  data  and  evidence,  hence  these 
models  will  evolve and  are  not final.  The  School  Committee  is  now  scheduled to  hold  another  Special 
Meeting on Tuesday, July 28th, to continue providing feedback as the Superintendent prepares to submit 
his plans on July 31st.  
 
As a supplement to their Initial Fall School Reopening Guidance 
<http://www.doe.mass.edu/covid19/return-to-school/guidance.docx>, DESE came out with 
Transportation Guidance <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e1XYgmr6c4BEdrsHYpII7O-
96saCM64F/view?usp=sharing> as well as Facilities and Operations Guidance 
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g9NdQPa941ICzE8m_Yw6RPayHO1GKE1U/view?usp=sharing> on 
Wednesday, July 22nd. I look forward to seeing how this new information will inform CPSD’s planning

o  Special Meeting (video | presentation) 

▪  Discussing  CPSD’s  proposed  re-opening  models,  voting  on  Superintendent’s 

recommendations 

 
Through these meetings, we have engaged with scholars, families, educators, as well as curriculum and 
medical experts to help inform CPSD in their planning. We’ve learned that there is quite a long way for us 
to  go  in  order  to  ensure  a  safe  re-opening—which  means  following  the  data  and  the  science—and 
preparation for another shutdown—which includes a robust remote learning plan and adequate childcare 
options for our families, not just compliance to state guidelines. 
 
With increasing evidence of the need for surveillance testing to safely reopen schools, Vice-Mayor Mallon 
and  I  have  been  in  many  conversations  with  the  City  Manager,  Superintendent,  Broad  Institute,  and 
Cambridge  Public  Health  Department  to  advocate  for  the  implementation  of  testing  in  our  school 
community. 
 
As  DESE  is  requiring  all  school  districts  to  submit  their  three  learning  models  (in-person,  hybrid,  and 
remote), by July 31st, the School Committee was originally scheduled to vote on CPSD’s proposed models 
at the July 21st Special Meeting. However, my colleagues and I did not feel prepared to, with so many 
questions remaining unanswered. It is important for everybody to understand that given our circumstances, 
we must always be ready to adapt and pivot with new data and evidence, hence these models will evolve 
and are not final. The School Committee is now scheduled to hold another Special Meeting on Tuesday, 
July 28th, to continue providing feedback as the Superintendent prepares to submit his plans on July 31st.  
 
As  a  supplement  to  their  Initial  Fall  School  Reopening  Guidance,  DESE  came  out  with  Transportation 
Guidance as well as Facilities and Operations Guidance on Wednesday, July 22nd. I look forward to seeing 
how  this  new  information  will  inform  CPSD’s  planning  and  the  discussion  at  our  next  Building  and 
Grounds Subcommittee Meeting on Friday, July 24th. 
 
Our upcoming meetings are as follows: 

•  July 23rd, 2020 

•  July 24th, 2020 

o  Communications and Community Relations Subcommittee Meeting | 12:30 PM 

▪  Discussing Motion #20-99: establishing a “Caregiver University” 

o  Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee Meeting | 12:30 PM 

▪  Discussing facilities plans in response to COVID-19 

o  Special Meeting | 5:00 PM 

•  July 28th, 2020 

 

•  August 4th, 2020 

o  Regular Meeting | 5:00PM 

 
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.  

Respectfully,

Louis A. DePasquale 
City Manager 

27 July 2020 

Madame Mayor, Vice Mayor and to the distinguished City Councilors: 
  
I write to you in the spirit of humility and cooperation with the understanding that we are all 
saddled with the burden of determining the parameters of public safety in Cambridge on the 
other side of what are sure to be historic reforms. I also write in the spirit of brevity, as the next 
time we meet during the Summer meeting, the agenda is inherently long and burdensome. In 
communicating in this fashion, it is my hope to provide some semblance of understanding as to 
how and why municipal police departments, like here in Cambridge, came to require the type of 
weaponry listed in the inventory contained in response to Council Order O-9; thereby allowing 
members to eliminate some questions, and fine-tune other questions. This communication will 
provide much more detail than I would have been allowed to provide in the 1 or 2 minutes I 
would have felt appropriate to take to respond at the actual meeting.  
 
PARADIGM SHIFTS 
Two incidents, both of which occurred at the close of the 1990s greatly shaped the way in which 
municipal police departments arms its officers and respond to mass casualty incidents today: (1) 
the Bank of America Shooting in North Hollywood (1997), and (2) the Massacre at Columbine 
High School in Littleton Colorado (1999). Both of these high-profile incidents resulted in distinct 
paradigm shifts.  
 

1.  BANK OF AMERICA SHOOTING IN NORTH HOLLYWOOD1 (1997)→ Here, 

two (2) heavily armed gunmen, wearing reinforced full-body (head to foot) armor, robbed 
a Bank of America branch in North Hollywood; they were heavily armed with AK-47 
type rifles and an assortment of other firearms. The robbery was interrupted by a lone 
police cruiser, who along with responding backup officers, being armed with only 
handguns, were severely outmatched in terms of firepower. Additionally, in many cases, 
the only cover and concealment available to officers and unsuspecting civilians that was 
capable of providing sufficient protection from the high-powered rifles was the “engine 
block” of their cruisers and nearby vehicles. During the exchange with the gunmen, many 
officers and civilians suffered serious injuries as a result of being struck with gunfire 
from the robbers’ high-powered rifles. The inability of the officers to meet the threat, 
resulted in the community being terrorized for more than forty-four (44) minutes. 
Eventually, some resourceful members of the LAPD entered a gun shop and borrowed

some weapons and ammunition capable of posing a threat to the gunmen (12-gauge 
shotguns); however, still uncapable of matching the force and firepower of the gunmen. 
This action coupled with the arrival of  members of the Special Weapons And Tactics 
(SWAT) Unit [a group of specially trained officers possessing weaponry capable of 
matching and overcoming the threat posed here by the gunmen] brought the situation to 
an end, but not before eighteen (18) civilians and police officers were injured and both 
suspects were wounded fatally. VIDEOS FOR REFERENCE BY LENGTH: 
(26:47Mins-LA Archives; 4:41Min- Military.com) 
 

a.  PARADIGM SHIFT: This incident is largely cited as the point where many 

agencies began equipping all patrol vehicles and each station with high-powered 
weaponry capable of matching or overcoming a threat like the one posed during 
the Bank of America Shooting. You cannot allow your law enforcement agency to 
be overpowered; it is not simply a matter of “officer safety” but of “public 
safety”. 
 

2.  Massacre at Columbine High School, Littleton Colorado2 (1999)→ Here, two (2) 
students entered their high school, Columbine High in Littleton Colorado, armed with 
more than one hundred (100) improvised explosive devices [bombs], guns and knives. 
The two individuals were planning to set off explosions and shoot individuals as they 
funneled through doorways while fleeing the explosion(s). When the explosive devices 
failed to detonate, the two individuals began shooting other students. According to video 
evidence and eyewitness accounts, the two individuals mocked, stalked, wounded and 
killed students for approximately 49 minutes inside of the high school that day. Within 
a few minutes (approx.3 minutes) of shooting the first victim, who was outside eating 
lunch, one of the suspects exchanged gunfire with a Community Resource Officer before 
fleeing inside of the school. At that time, the prevailing paradigm when responding to 
barricaded persons and active-shooter situations was to hold the perimeter while awaiting 
the arrival of Specialists (SWAT) and allow SWAT officers to enter, locate and 
neutralize the threat; therefore, the Community Resource Officer and subsequent backup 
officers did not enter the location. An analysis of the incident would show that officers 
were outside awaiting the arrival of SWAT while students were being shot and killed a 
mere 90 feet away from them inside of the school’s library. As a result, many lawsuits 
were filed against the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and subsequently paid 
out/settled. VIDEOS FOR REFERENCE BY LENGTH: (44:44-Real Crime; 2:33 - 
PennLive).  
 

a.  PARADIGM SHIFT: This incident is responsible for the paradigm shift to an 
Immediate Defense Of Life (IDOL) response. Under the IDOL model, officers 
would no longer await the arrival of SWAT during an active-shooter situation 
[incident where shooter has unlimited access to additional victims]; officers will 
immediately form an entry team, enter the premise in an effort to protect life by 
locating and neutralizing the offender(s). Some legislatures enacted IDOL laws to

criminalize not doing so. To ensure a higher degree of success when engaged in 
these dangerous situations, it further required (or illuminated the need) that each 
unit be equipped with high-powered weaponry capable of defeating assault-type 
weapons likely to be encountered during these situations.  

8.2.a

SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT 

Upon submitting the response to POR 2020-146, many communications have been directed at 
the department primarily surrounding two issues: (1) The Lenco Bearcat, an armored Multi-
Purpose Emergency Response Vehicle that utilizes the chassis of a Ford F550 and (2) the 
possession of high-powered firearms [both quantity and type].  

1.  Lenco Bearcat → (I’ll start this part of the discussion by stating that this vehicle should 

not be used simply as a show of force—it should be used only for its capacity to 
protect/rescue [peaceful protestors, citizens, and first responders]). This vehicle, also 
known as an MPERV (Multi-Purpose Emergency Rescue Vehicle) was acquired by the 
department (and I believe other regional agencies as well) in 2014 in direct response to 
the 2013 Bombing of the Boston Marathon and the massive gunfight that ensued with the 
brothers who orchestrated the bombing. In addition to encountering automatic-type 
gunfire from the suspects, officers from multiple regional agencies were also assailed 
with explosive materials, as the suspects hurled bombs and other explosive devices 
during the exchange. Along with providing, protection from all types of gunfire, the 
Bearcat affords more protection from explosions and explosive devices than typical 
patrol vehicles; it also has self-contained air circulation capabilities that make it useful 
during fires or chemical exposures. Its protective capabilities make it useful for more than 
just law enforcement applications; it has wide-ranging rescue capabilities covering all 
aspects of public safety. For a more complete understanding of the Bearcat’s capabilities; 
such as, how it was used to save many lives during the terrorist attack at the Pulse Night 
Club in Orlando Fl. by punching a hole in a concrete wall, allowing trapped victims to 
escape, please view some of the following videos and articles: (9Min: Bearcat Tour - GB 
Police Dept. & GB City Council; 1Min-Bearcat fights Fire Video Bearcat Can Help You 
Fight Fires While Under Fire).  
 

2.  High-Powered Rifles and Other Firearms→ I want to start off here by saying that I 

would never play a semantic game with you, I have no interest in splitting hairs or being 
coy—when I say “the department does not possess military materials”—I mean in the 
context that we do not possess materials that are restricted only to the military by law 
[and exempted to civilian law enforcement]. Additionally, the Department does not 
participate in the 1033 program where excess military equipment is given to civilian law 
enforcement agencies. It would be foolish to assert that the department uses no materials 
(ever) used by the military; inasmuch as, the military also uses handguns, and other items 
commonly used in many sectors. All of the firearms and rifles possessed by the 
department are able to be legally purchased [if not here in MA, then in neighboring 
states] and lawfully owned by private citizens The mere fact that these weapons are 
widely available speaks to why a municipal law enforcement agency would also be 
required to possess them.

8.2.a

Included in the email containing this communication is an audio file as recorded by the 
Shotspotter ® Gunshot Detection System (GDS). The location of the recording is 108-
110 Harvard Street in the City of Cambridge MA on July 2nd, 2020 at approx. 
9:54:10PM. What you hear in the audio is the sound of an automatic assault-type weapon 
being fired; the less-than six second burst resulted in 50 rounds fired on the streets of 
Cambridge. To be clear, these shots were not fired by Cambridge Police, but by brazen 
individuals who have no regard for laws or life. The fact that an automatic weapon 
could be deployed on the Streets of Cambridge at 108 & 110 Harvard Street, means that 
it could also be deployed anywhere in Cambridge, including in the high school or in any 
one of the City’s colleges/universities, office buildings or in any business that calls 
Cambridge home and enjoy its relative safety. 
 
To further clarify or to reiterate, the recording was from a mere three weeks ago right 
here in Cambridge; not some distant 1997 shooting at Bank of America or 1999 
shooting in a high school in Littleton, Colorado. It is not so much a matter of “it could 
happen here”—it does happen here. At first blush it may sound harsh, but as a general 
rule you cannot allow your police department to be overpowered. Your police department 
must be able to overcome threats it may face and certainly must be prepared to face these 
threats at any and all times. As a resident of Cambridge, I would not want to reside in a 
City where the local police could not protect my family from such threats. My child 
attends school in Cambridge. As a parent, I do not want to send my child to a school 
where, God forbid, that if something terrible happened, local law enforcement could not 
overcome the threat and adequately protect children from further unnecessary harm and 
terror—I am certain that the overwhelming majority of your constituency feels the exact 
same way. 

Lastly, I would argue that the Department uses these weapons sparingly and rarely has cause to 
display them; the surprised response to the Department’s inventory list speaks to this claim. 
Also, in an effort to be transparent, and in response to an article in the Boston Herald, dated June 
7 2020, where Boston City Councilor Wu asked for an accounting from BPD as to equipment 
that “could reasonably fall under the definition of ‘militarized’”, I ordered an inventory of all 
such weaponry; the first list was produced on June 11, 2020 in advance of POR 2020-146, which 
preempted submission [email proof will be submitted to the clerk in writing]. Thank you for 
taking the time to consider this post submission clarification.  

Some citizen responses on various social media platforms to the inventory of CPD’s weapons:  

“It’s disturbing” – hopefully it will become understood that a municipal police department 
would be required to possess high-powered weaponry. A police department must be equipped 
with weapons they are likely to encounter (or better ones in order to defeat what they are likely 
to encounter). It is disturbing that someone would brazenly fire an automatic weapon without 
regard for human life on our streets. In my opinion, it would be disturbing if the police 
department was not adequately equipped and prepared to deal with these types of situations.  

“They should be categorized as military-grade” – that is a normative conversation that I do not 
have the luxury of entertaining; I have to consider the situation that actually is, not how it “ought 
to be”, and the fact is these high-powered weapons can be legally owned and are widely 
proliferated; therefore, law enforcement must also possess them. Legal gun ownership is a 
foundation of American society—legal gun ownership I support—unlawful gun usage is the 
problem, not ownership or classification per se.
