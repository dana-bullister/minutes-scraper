1.  ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REPORT 

Emergency Communications   
Emergency Communications Center 

Department: 
Division or Unit (if 
applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance Technology:  RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System 

Christina Giacobbe 
2/28/2020 

 
1.  What Surveillance  Technologies has the department used in the last year? 
 

•  RapidSOS Emergency Data Integration System (RapidSOS).  RapidSOS is a web 
platform that provides life-saving  data directly to 911 and first responders in an 
emergency, providing faster, more effective responses.  In Cambridge, when callers 
contact 911 their call is directed to Emergency Communications  on the state’s Next 
Generation 911 platform and RapidSOS provides secondary, data-based location 
information to ECC through the RapidSOS clearinghouse.  The purpose of this 
technology is to provide ECC Call Takers  and Dispatchers with an accurate phone 
number and location information of wireless  callers  who contact 911 in our jurisdiction.   

 
2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party? 
 

•  The information obtained through this platform is not shared with any third party as the 
information is presented in real time.  The department does share caller information and 
audio calls with the Police Department and District Attorney’s Office as they proceed 
with prosecution. However, this information is provided through our 911 system, not 
RapidSOS. 

 
3.  What complaints  (if any) has your department received about Surveillance 

Technology? 

•  N/A 
 

•  N/A 

4.  Were any violations  of the Surveillance Use Policy found in the last year?  
 

 
5.  Has Surveillance Technology been effective in achieving its identified purpose?

8.  ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REPORT 

Mayor’s Office1 
 

Department: 
Division or Unit (if 
applicable): 
Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance Technology:  TweetDeck 

Wilford Durbin, Chief of Staff 
2/28/2020 

 
1.  What Surveillance  Technologies has the department used in the last year? 
 

•  TweetDeck.  Social media monitoring software/Twitter monitoring via TweetDeck. Used 
by Chief of Staff and Community Engagement and Communications Liaison to follow 
conversations on Twitter relevant to the Mayor’s constituent services  responsibilities,  and 
to follow public discussion on matters before the Council. Current search criteria being 
compiled on TweetDeck for Mayor’s Office use include the following: 
@Cambridge_Mayor, #CambMA, #Mapoli, @CambMA, +@CambMA. 

 
2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party? 
 

•  No. 
 

Technology? 

3.  What complaints  (if any) has your department received about Surveillance 

•  None.  In fact, the Mayor’s Office usually hears the opposite—people who appreciate the 

Mayor responding to their constituent concern. 

 
4.  Were any violations  of the Surveillance Use Policy found in the last year?  
 

•  N/A 

 
5.  Has Surveillance Technology been effective in achieving its identified purpose? 
 

 

1 Marc McGovern served as Mayor of Cambridge in the 2018 -2019 session.  Mayor McGovern’s Office used 
TweetDeck and submitted the first Annual Surveillance Report dated December 9, 2019.  Current Mayor Sumbul 
Siddiqui  did not use TweetDeck during the period covered by this Annual Surveillance Report.  Because the 
technology was used during  the reporting  period, however, the City Manager is resubmitting this Annual 
Surveillance Report prepared by former Mayor Marc McGovern’s Office.

•  Quantifying the effectiveness of the use of TweetDeck by the Mayor’s  Office is 

admittedly difficult.  Constituent concerns communications  via Twitter have been used to 
generate policy orders to the City Manager, and Mayor’s Office staff have transmitted 
information to Tweeter users, engaged in a public conversation, or otherwise interacted 
with a Tweet on a discretionary basis.  

 
6.  Did the department receive any public records requests concerning Surveillance 

Technology? 

•  None. 
 

7.  How much did it cost to acquire and operate Surveillance  Technology? 

 
•  No costs associated with acquiring or operating TweetDeck.  Office personnel may 

monitor TweetDeck data occasionally  as part of their regular office duties. 

 
8.  Are any communities  disproportionately  impacted by Surveillance  Technology? 

• 

 
Impacts to privacy would likely  not be felt by any individual, as a simple  search of one’s 
Twitter profile shows all Tweets, likes, retweets, and other activity from a user over the 
course of that profile’s existence, and TweetDeck would not provide any additional 
information than could be found during such a search. 
 

•  Twitter is the only social media platform that is regularly  monitored by Mayor’s Office 
staff, which means that those constituents who use other social media platforms do not 
have the same access to Office staff as Twitter users. Additionally, Twitter users are 
typically younger, more educated, and more likely  to identify as Democrats than the 
general population. Twitter has been shown to be disproportionately popular among 
African American and Hispanic users.  
 

•  The Mayor’s Office has attempted to make itself available to a wider proportion of 

residents by hosting regular open office hours, employing  a community engagement 
team, attending community events, and responding to communications  that are received 
through mail, email,  telephone, or other mediums.

•  LENS 

 
1.  What Surveillance  Technologies has the department used in the last year? 

 
•  Accurint Workstation: 

•  BRIC Omega Dashboard: 

o  The Accurint Workstation is a software program utilized by CPD to analyze and 
map incident data from the Department’s Incident Database, including arrest and 
incident reports; information contained in this database is gathered directly from 
QED, the Department’s Records Management System (RMS).  

o  The Department uses this software to produce daily, monthly and yearly maps; 
many that are disseminated publicly in various formats (Public Safety Bulletins, 
monthly Bridgestat, CPD Annual Crime Report, etc.).  
 

o  BRIC Omega Dashboard is the Intel portal for Boston Regional Intelligence 

Center (BRIC). The BRIC works at the forefront of intelligence  collection and 
analysis.  The BRIC allows for a regional  approach to analyze whether crimes  are 
interconnected by geography, type, or method.  The BRIC covers the Metro 
Boston Homeland Security Region (MBHSR), consisting of: Boston, Brookline, 
Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Quincy, Revere, Somerville,  Winthrop, The Greater 
Boston Police Council (Boston Area Police Emergency Radio Network—
BAPERN), Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), Massachusetts 
Port Authority (Massport), and Metro Fire Association. 

o  In order to have the most complete accounting of what crimes  and trends are 

impacting the region, it is necessary for all cities and towns, including Cambridge 
to contribute intelligence  information. As such, the Cambridge Police Department 
contributes the following information: Approved arrest reports and Field

Interview and Observation (FIO) reports for certain cases (Confidential items, i.e., 
specifically  marked domestic, juvenile, and sexual assault reports are excluded).  
 

•  Coplink: 

o  COPLINK is one of the “solutions and services”  provided through NESPIN (New 
England State Police Information Network®). COPLINK is a data sharing and 
crime analytics platform.  

o  NESPIN (New England State Police Information Network®) is the local arm of a 
national project known as the RISS Program (Regional  Information Sharing 
Systems). The goal of RISS is to assist local, state, federal and tribal Criminal 
Justice partners by providing adaptive solutions and services that facilitate 
information sharing, support criminal  investigations, and promote officer safety. 
NESPIN is one of only six RISS centers operating nationwide.  
 

•  QED: 

o  QED currently functions as CPD’s Record Management System (RMS). A 

records management system (RMS) is “an agency-wide system that provides for 
the storage, retrieval, retention, manipulation, archiving,  and viewing of 
information, records, documents, or files pertaining to law enforcement 
operations. In this context, records are limited to documents or electronic  files 
directly related to law enforcement operations such as incident and accident 
reports, arrests, citations, warrants, case management, field contacts, etc.”   
 

• 

Incident Database: 

•  CLEAR: 

o  The Incident Database is a Microsoft® Access database of corrected Records 

Management System Data.  The database is used to “clean up” or to keep a more 
accurate record of the data that comes into the Records Management System 
(RMS) (i.e., initially  an entry may be coded as a Larceny Motor Vehicle (L-MV) 
but through investigation it is determined to be a House Break where a L-MV also 
occurred—this database accurately reflects the appropriate Uniform Crime 
Reporting/National Incident-Based Reporting System code). 
 

o  CLEAR® is a Public Records search engine. For a fee, CLEAR’s database 

provides access to thousands of data sets including, address, phone numbers, 
billing  (utilities, etc.) and credit-related information through public records and 
publicly available  sources. According to its website:  

▪  “Thomson  Reuters CLEAR® is powered by billions  of data points and 

leverages cutting-edge public records technology to bring all key content 
together in a customizable dashboard. Locate hard -to-find information and 
quickly identify potential concerns associated with people and businesses

to determine if further analysis is needed. The user-friendly platform was 
designed with intuitive navigation and simple  filtering parameters, so you 
can quickly search across thousands of data sets and get accurate results  in 
less time.”  

o  In addition to accessing  these public records to gather information on criminal 
suspects, the Department utilizes  CLEAR to locate victims, witnesses and to 
verify background information on applicants (Public  Safety Employment or 
License to Carry Firearms  (LTC)). 

 

•  LexisNexis: 

•  Focused Deterrence Database: 

o  LexisNexis is a search engine.  Users pay a fee to searchpublic  records and other 
information compiled by the provider . It serves as a research tool used to locate 
people, companies, businesses,  phone numbers, properties and fragments of 
information; this information helps to create a more complete picture of what we 
are investigating. (e.g., the Department entered the name and phone number of an 
individual who had been the victim of a scam, this search lead us to where the 
“scammer”  found the victim’s information, potentially creating a solid 
investigative lead).  
 

o  The Focused Deterrence Database uses an algorithm to analyze Records 

Management System (RMS) data based on past arrest and incident reports. The 
database algorithm identifies individuals who most recently have caused or been 
the subject of (i.e., victim/survivor)  the greatest social harm and could currently 
benefit from social services and a case manager (offender or victim/survivor).   
CPD reaches out to individuals identified through the Database to offer them the 
option of joining  the Focused Deterrence Program.   

o  “Focused Deterrence” in terms of policing  is a strategy that aims to deter specific 
criminal  behavior through fear of specific sanctions, as well as anticipation of 
benefits for not engaging in crime. In its initial iteration here in Cambridge, 
Focused Deterrence closely resembled this. There have always been “variants” of 
the Focused Deterrence program in practice; here in Cambridge, Focused 
Deterrence has morphed into an altogether different program.   

o  Focused Deterrence in Cambridge does not utilize a predictive policing  program, 
through the Focused Deterrence Database or otherwise. The department does not 
have a “gang database” (or any semblance thereof) and instead pulls information 
directly from the CPD RMS.  
 

•  LENS (Law Enforcement Notification System): 

o  The Law Enforcement Notification System (LENS) is a web-based system which 
provides local law enforcement with information on federal offenders currently on 
supervision  with the U.S. Courts. This release  of information is required by the

8.  Are any communities  disproportionately  impacted by Surveillance  Technology? 

 

 

•  Accurint Workstation: 

o  The department is not aware of any community disproportionately impacted by 
this technology.  This  technology has a minimal  impact as the software analyzes 
incident data already stored in the Department’s records management system. The 
Department is required by state and federal law, as well as court procedural rules 
to document a variety of police  encounters, whether for criminal,  civil  or 
administrative matters. 

•  BRIC Omega Dashboard:  

o  The department is not aware of any community disproportionately impacted by 

this technology.  However, anytime that large amounts of intelligence  information 
are gathered, significant privacy implications  exist. The BRIC maintains a strict 
policy designed to “protect individual privacy, civil rights, civil liberties,  and 
other protected interests” [Boston Regional Intelligence Center Privacy, Civil

Police Department. 
 

•  Cell phone and computer forensic analysis  tools: 

o  Digital Intelligence  Workstation;  Dell Laptop BCERT; Magnet Forensics – 

Axiom; and Getdata Forensic Explorer:  

▪  The department is not aware of any community disproportionately 

impacted by this technology.  Where police engage in a search of any 
type, privacy concerns are at their highest. This  technology is utilized in a 
wide berth of investigations in which a cell phone or computer device is 
lawfully seized.  The technology is only utilized where there is no 
reasonable expectation of privacy, after consent is provided or a search 
warrant is obtained. 

•  Shotspotter:   

o  Individuals who live, work or are otherwise located within the geographic area of 
its microphones/sensors  may be impacted by the technology.  The placement of 
microphones  has not changed since the implementation  of the technology.  Initial 
placement was based on prevalence of gunfire or gunshot victims. CPD can 
request movement but the high concentration (relative  to Cambridge) has 
persisted in the same area.

interrogations.  The benefits of recording custodial interrogations go above and beyond 
transparency.  The benefits extend not only to the accused, but also to the police, defense 
attorneys, prosecutors, fact finders, and the public.1

•  No public records requests were received. 

 
7.  What were the total annual costs of the Surveillance Technology? 
 

•  Costs for the acquisition, operation, and maintenance of MAVEN are covered by the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health. CPHD staff use MAVEN to do state-
mandated infectious disease investigations but are not involved in maintenance of the 
system. 
 

8.  Are any communities disproportionately impacted by Surveillance Technology? 

 

•  All confirmed and suspected cases of reportable infectious diseases among Cambridge 

residents are required to be reported to the state health department and/or the Cambridge 
Public Health Department through MAVEN, where they are managed and investigated. 
Representation in the MAVEN system is a function of the distribution of disease in the 
Cambridge population and the health care utilization rates among Cambridge residents, 
both of which may vary by sub-group within Cambridge.  Wherever possible, CPHD 
considers the potential over- or under-representation of marginalized communities in 
Cambridge in our infectious disease investigation work.

1.  What Surveillance  Technologies has the department used in the last year? 
 

•  Securly for Chromebooks Web Filter.  This  technology is employed as a web filter only 
on all CPS Chromebooks. The filter is a Chrome plugin that is managed and deployed at 
the Google Domain level to all CPS owned Chromebooks. One this is setup it requires  no 
other maintenance. The web filter will block sites that are considered potentially unsafe 
or harmful to students.  
 

•  Securly blocks the following categories of content: Pornography, Drugs, Gambling, 

Other Adult Content, Social Media, Anonymous Proxies, Chat Messaging, Hate, Social 
Networking, Streaming Media and Games. There is also a Keyword blocking as well. 
These are “Generic” filter settings established by Securly. 

 
2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party? 

 
•  No.  All vendor provided-applications employed by the school department that may, or 
do, collect student-level data are protected against inappropriate  use of student data by 
the vendor through Student Data Privacy Agreements (DPA). These agreements ensure 
that any and all student-level data collected is only used for the purpose of providing the 
service the vendor was engaged for, and nothing else. All school department DPAs are 
available  on the CPS website.1  The DPAs employed by CPS are both a MA State and 
National Model DPA developed by the Student Data Privacy Consortium2 and leveraged 
throughout the K12 Educational Technology Marketplace to protect student data from 
inappropriate uses.

•  Bus Video Recorders 
•  GPS Devices 
•  Edulog Transportation System 

 
1.  What Surveillance  Technologies has the department used in the last year? 
 

•  Bus video recorders:  Cameras  are installed on all school buses.  The cameras on the 
school buses allow the school department to review any incidents that take place, after 
the event is over.  The cameras  allow the department to determine the source of any 
behavioral  issues on the bus. The footage helps CPS staff and parents clarify what 
actually happened during an incident and supplements any report from a student or bus 
driver. 
 

•  GPS devices:  These  devices are installed on vehicles transporting sudents. GPS units are 
attached to the student transportation vehicles  to monitor and report back the physical 
location of the vehicles  to the CPS Transportation  Department. The GPS units monitor 
the physical location of each vehicle in real time. 
 

•  Edulog Transportation System:   The Edulog Transportation system is a database used 

by the CPS Transportation Department to manage the bus routes and student 
assignments. All information about what buses students ride as well as the buses 
locations are stored and managed within this system.  

 
2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party? 
 

•  Bus video recorders:  Yes, but in limited circumstances.  In some cases, parents can 
view the video footage generated by the video recorders, but parents can only view 
footage of their child. 
 

•  GPS devices: Yes.  GPS location data is shared with the contracted transportation 

company to aid in the delivery of the bus transportation service.   Parents can also view 
data on the location of the bus to which their child is assigned through a secure parent 
portal.

22.  ANNUAL SURVEILLANCE REPORT 

Department: 
Division or Unit

Submitted by: 
Date: 
Surveillance 
Technology: 

Traffic, Parking, and Transportation 
Parking Management, Street Management 
 
Joe Barr, Brooke McKenna, Stephanie McAuliffe 
2/28/20 
•  ATLAS RMV Portal (Parking Management) 
•  Traffic Signal Detection Cameras (Street Management Division) 
•  MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units (Street Management 

Division) 

 
1.  What Surveillance Technologies has the department used in the last year? 

 
•  ATLAS RMV Portal: ATLAS is a web application provided by the Commonwealth of 

Massachusetts to access the RMV system and used by the Parking Management division.  
It used by Parking Services staff to issue resident parking permits, view handicap placard 
information, and clear holds on licenses and vehicle registrations. No data is collected or 
stored, and the public cannot access it.  

•  Traffic Signal Detection Cameras: These cameras are deployed at a limited number of 
signalized intersections across the City.  The detection cameras include 360-degree units 
manufactured by MioVision and directional cameras manufactured by Iteris.  They are 
used for detection of roadway users, to classify their mode of transportation, and to 
quantify their movements at signalized intersections in the City of Cambridge, and to 
assist in the optimized operation of traffic signals. The aggregated data collected will be 
analyzed and used to improve the efficiency and safety of operations for all roadway 
users. The technology will also provide City staff with continuous roadway user counts to 
allow for evaluation of seasonal and annual traffic volume variations to assist in future 
design and planning projects.  

•  MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: These units are deployed in the field 
by transportation consultants, at various locations on a temporary basis. The units are 
typically attached to a signal, utility, or streetlight pole within the right of way. This 
technology collects traffic video and data that is later processed to provide a variety of 
traffic related data such as turning movement counts, intersection counts and 
classifications, and road volume counts. Additionally, there is an optional “Connect” 
component that can be added to Scout units that allows the unit to communicate 
wirelessly for monitoring purposes (but not to stream data) and has the capability of 
detecting MAC addresses from devices searching for wireless networks within their

range. With the added ‘Connect” functionality, the Scout Unit can detect devices within 
an 80-100 foot radius of the unit. The Scout Unit uses MD5 hash function to produce a 
128 bit hash value for each MAC address, pseudonymizing the MAC addresses. This 
process is unidirectional and cannot be reversed, but the MAC addresses remain unique 
and matchable. These hashed addresses and timestamps are stored in the unit during the 
data collection period then transmitted to a central system operated by the vendor, 
MioVision. The central system then looks to see if the same hashed MAC address has 
been recorded previously by other scout units in the vicinity and in the same time frame 
and uses any matches to establish travel times. 

 
2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party? 

 
•  ATLAS: No data has been shared with a third-party. 

•  MioVision Intersection Cameras:  These cameras are accessed by the Vendor, 
MioVision, for purposes of set up, training, and troubleshooting of the product.  
 

•  MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: Video from these units is collected 

and accessed by Transportation Consultants. Given that past deployment has taken place 
without City approvals, we cannot determine who has accessed the data.  Moving 
forward, a permitting system will allow us to understand who is collecting data.   

 
3.  What complaints (if any) has your department received about Surveillance 

•  MioVision Intersection Cameras and MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera 

Units: The department has received inquiries about the installed cameras from time to 
time, but no inquiries that the department would characterize as complaints. We explain 
the use of the technology and that has been satisfactory for individuals inquiring. Moving

•  ATLAS: Yes. ATLAS is used daily by Parking Services staff to issue resident parking 
permits, view handicap placard information and clear license and registration holds.  In 
2019, 38,381 Resident Parking Permits were issued.  In FY19, there were 17,973 
chargeable clears for license and registrations holds.    

•  Traffic Signal Detection Cameras: The MioVision units were installed in late 2019 and 
are functioning as expected. We will be better able to assess the success of the units once 
we have collected enough data to use for analysis. The directional cameras operate as 
expected and detect vehicles in order to optimize signal operations.  

•  MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: Yes.  These data collection units are a 
significant improvement over past manual and tube data collection methods.  In the past, 
counts have been taken by hand, which is far more labor intensive and limits the amount 
and timeframe of the data collected. Tubes used for data collection frequently 
malfunctioned or were destroyed by road traffic or street cleaning vehicles.  Overall, the 
video-based data collection allows for better data collection, and as a result, far better 
data analysis for transportation planning. In addition, it is becoming increasingly difficult 
to obtain detailed counts using any other methodology as most vendors are using this 
technology. 

 
6.  Did the department receive any public records requests concerning Surveillance 

Technology? 
 
• 

In January, the department received a request from John Hawkinson that was sent to via 
email to the City Manager’s office. He requested records that answered the following 
questions about the Traffic Signal Detection Cameras at Ames/Main Street: 

1. Make/model number of the cameras? 
2. How many are deployed? 
3. Where are they installed? 
4. Date of installation and activation? 
5. Whether the fact that they do not record is enforced by configuration, by 
software, by hardware, or some other mechanism? 
6. Effect on bicycles and non-auto vehicles? 
7. Effect on cycle times? 

The Public Records Access Officer responded with a sales brochure about the cameras 
and the signal plans for the Ames and Main Street intersection. 
 
In late March we received a request via an email to the Public Records Access Officer for 
all records related to the City’s pilot programs with MioVision and Draper. The requestor 
did not provide any more details about what they were looking to learn. The Public

Records Access Officer provided all records except for emails. One document was 
withheld as it was exempt from disclosure because the document related to policy 
positions being developed by the City.  A total of 10 records were provided. 

  

  

  

• 

In total, we’ve received two requests, both of which came via email, and provided 12 
records. 

 
7.  What were the total annual costs of the Surveillance Technology? 
 

•  ATLAS: There is a $20.00 RMV surcharge for license plate clears.  In FY 2019, there 
were 17,973 chargeable clears for license and registrations holds, which are assessed 
through a reduction in local aid provided on the Cherry Sheet Assessments.    
 

•  Traffic Signal Detection Cameras:  The cameras were acquired for $166,000, funded by 

Casino Mitigation Funds.    

•  MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: N/A.  These are typically installed by 
traffic engineering consultants as part of the overall cost of a transportation planning or 
traffic engineering study, such as a Traffic Impact Study required for a private 
development project. 

 
8.  Are any communities disproportionately impacted by Surveillance Technology? 

 
•  ATLAS: The Portal allows TPT staff to access detailed personal information about 

Cambridge residents. The information accessed is not collected or stored and the public 
cannot access it. The information is only accessed by Parking Services staff when issuing 
resident parking permits, viewing handicap placard information, and clearing holds on 
licenses and vehicle registrations, all of which are requested by the customer. The data 
available on the Portal may have a greater impact on the privacy of those individuals who 
own a vehicle than those individuals who do not own a vehicle, since staff only access 
the vehicle registration data for residents who own cars. Access to the Portal is password 
protected and the Parking Services Staff who use ATLAS receive individual, detailed 
training which includes best practices for protecting personal information. As such, the 
use of the Massachusetts RMV Website Portal does not have any disproportionate impact 
on any population. 

•  Traffic Signal Detection Cameras: Although they are installed in specific communities 
that have specific demographics, they observe all users that pass through an intersection, 
whether or not those users come from those local communities. Typically, these units are 
installed at major intersections which carry both local and regional traffic. The

technology does not retain any personally identifiable information, and does not impact 
the drivers, cyclists and pedestrians that are counted by the cameras.  As such, the use of 
Detection Cameras does not have any disproportionate impact on any one population.  

•  MioVision Traffic Count Mobile Camera Units: The units record all users that pass by 
the unit, whether or not those users come from those local communities. These units are 
also deployed for very short periods of time, further limiting impacts. While data 
collection is used across the City, it is possible that data collection, and thus video 
recording, will occur most frequently in areas with significant new development, thus 
possibly impacting these areas more than parts of the City with less development.  
However, these cameras primarily collect data that is not personally identifiable and use 
hashing technology to mask MAC addresses that could otherwise be personally 
identifiable.  Overall, the use of MioVision Intersection Cameras does not have 
disproportionate impacts on any population.

Water 
 

Department: 
Division or Unit (if 
applicable): 
Sam Corda & Fred Centanni 
Submitted by: 
2/28/2020 
Date: 
Surveillance Technology:  Automated Meter Reading (AMR) System 

 
1.  What Surveillance Technologies has the department used in the last year? 

 
•  Automated Meter Reading (AMR) System.  The Water Department’s AMR system is a 
radio-based system which transmits on a Federal Communication Commission (FCC) 
licensed/reserved frequency.  Meter Transmitter Units (MTUs) are attached to every 
water meter throughout the city. The MTU transmits water meter reads in a propriety 
format.  These reads are transmitted every 4 hours on a floating schedule.  For example, 
an MTU will transmit a read today at 6:00AM, and then transmit a read tomorrow at 
6:03AM.  The reads are received by the Data Collection Units (DCUs) located within the 
city. The DCUs transmit the meter readings, using a cell phone network, to a 
communications computer located at the Water Department.  The communications 
computer then transfers the data to a database computer which translates the data in order 
for the city to view the water meter reads.  This allows the Water Department to provide 
actual reads for billing and allows us to alert customers for potential leaks at their 
property.    Below is an example of our STAR AMR software and the data collected: 
 

 

2.  Has any Surveillance Technology data been shared with a third-party?

DATE:

SUBJECT:  

Response to Policy Order #2, adopted 3/2/20 

Excerpt of Order: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with the 
Executive Director of the Public Health Department and other relevant City personnel to 
determine what measures the City must take to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus, 
what measures must be initiated to minimize the risk to our community if the pandemic 
spreads to Massachusetts, and to report back to the City Council on this matter no later 
than the March 16, 2020 meeting of the City Council.  

OVERVIEW 
 
The City Manager and his staff, Mayor Siddiqui and multiple city departments are preparing for 
potential community spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Cambridge. 
 
COVID-19 is a respiratory illness characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath.  According 
to the CDC, reported illnesses have ranged from very mild (including some with no reported 
symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. While information so far suggests that 
most COVID-19 illnesses are mild, a report out of China suggests serious illness occurs in about 
16% of cases.  
 
The most susceptible populations are older people (age 60+) and people of all ages with severe 
underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes. These groups seem 
to be at higher risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19. 
 
The novel coronavirus (SARS CoV-2), first reported in China in late December, has spread to 125 
countries, as of March 11.  In early March, new coronavirus began spreading more rapidly outside 
China than within.  As of the morning of March 12, there were over 1,200 positive cases 
(presumptive and confirmed) in the U.S., according to the New York Times database, which we 
believe is the most up-to-date, reliable source for U.S. case counts. 
 
More cases of COVID-19 are likely to be identified in Massachusetts and other states in the coming 
days. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it is likely that sustained 
person-to-person spread will continue to occur in the U.S., and that at some point, widespread 
transmission of COVID-19 in the United States will occur. 
 
On February 28, the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory received approval to begin 
testing Massachusetts patients for COVID-19, in accordance with guidance from the CDC. As testing 
ramps up in the Commonwealth, it is expected that the number of presumptive positive cases will 
continue to rise.  

As of March 11, there were 95 positive cases (89 presumptive positive; 6 CDC confirmed) of COVID-
19 among Massachusetts residents. Of these cases, 77 were linked to a company meeting of Biogen

in Boston late February.  For the latest data, see the Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
dashboard. 

Significant Events 

•  On March 11, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. 
•  On March 10, Governor Baker declared a state of emergency in Massachusetts and released 
enhanced guidance for the executive branch of state government. This guidance includes 
cancellation of work-related foreign or domestic travel, discouraging personal international 
travel, and cancellation of large-scale government meetings and conferences.  This impacts 
approximately 42,000 state employees. 

PLANNING FOR COMMUNITY SPREAD 

The Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD) is paying close attention to the situation locally, 
nationally, and internationally. Staff are participating in conference calls with the CDC and the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and receiving regular email updates from both 
agencies.  
 
The Cambridge Public Health Department is following the CDC's Community Mitigation Guidelines to 
Prevent Pandemic Influenza--United States, 2017, which provides a decision-making matrix for U.S. 
health departments on using nonpharmaceutical interventions (non-vaccine preventive actions) to 
slow the spread of viruses, including the new coronavirus. 
 
According to this guidance, the goals of implementing nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 
early in a significant communicable disease outbreak include: 

•  Slowing the acceleration of the number of cases in a community. 
•  Reducing the peak number of cases during the outbreak and related health care demands 

on hospitals and infrastructure 

•  Decreasing overall cases and health effects.  
 

When a communicable disease outbreak begins, state and local public health authorities need to:  

•  Decide on an appropriate set of NPIs for implementation. 
•  Reinforce to the community the importance of personal protective measures (e.g., voluntary 
home isolation of infected individuals, staying home when ill, frequent handwashing, and 
covering coughs and sneezes). 

•  Reinforce environmental cleaning measures (e.g., routine cleaning and disinfecting of 

frequently touched surfaces), which are recommended at all times for prevention of 
respiratory illnesses. 

•  Reinforce personal protective measures reserved for major outbreaks, such as: 

−  Voluntary home quarantine of exposed household members (e.g., staying home when a 

household member is ill). 

−  Use of face masks by ill persons. 

A more difficult decision is how and when to implement community-level NPIs that 
might be warranted but are more disruptive, such as: 

•  Temporary school closures and dismissals. 
•  Social distancing in workplaces and the community.  
•  Cancellation of mass gatherings. 
•  Cancellation of smaller workplace and community gatherings.

CAMBRIDGE RESPONSE AND ACTIONS 
 
City officials including the City Manager and his staff, Mayor Siddiqui,  
. 
..public health, fire, police, emergency communications, schools, and other city departments have 
been working with hospital, ambulance, and other community partners, as well as state and federal 
agencies, to prepare for and respond to potential community spread of COVID-19 in Cambridge. 
 
Local Actions, as of March 12: 
 
Quarantine of Potentially Exposed Individuals / Isolation of Infected Individuals 

CPHD public health nurses have considerable experience and expertise in monitoring individuals 
exposed to or infected with communicable disease and tracing contacts.  
 
From Feb. 2 through March 3, the public health nursing team, in partnership with the state health 
department, monitored or followed up with CDC-identified Cambridge residents people who had 
recently traveled to mainland China.  CPHD’s public health nursing team has been monitoring 
identified individuals seven days a week. 
 
On March 4, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidance and 
recommended procedures for travelers returning from “high risk” or “Level 3” countries: Travelers 
returning from China or Iran (level 3) must self-quarantine (“stay home”) for 14 days upon return 
to the U.S. and be monitored by their local health department.  
 
From Feb. 2 through March 11, CPHD public health nurses monitored or followed up with a total of 
47 Cambridge residents who (a) had recently traveled from mainland China or Iran, or were 
connected to the Biogen meeting in Boston. 
 
The Cambridge Public Health Department is currently (as of March 11) monitoring 17 Cambridge 
residents, the great majority of whom are connected to the Biogen meeting in Boston. 
 
Note: The number of people being monitored by CPHD nurses fluctuates on a daily basis 
as (a) monitored individuals complete their 14-day self-quarantine period and (b) the state health 
department identifies new individuals for local health department monitoring. 
 
Preparedness Meetings:  Local and State 

The Cambridge Public Health Department is communicating on a daily basis with the City 
Manager’s Office and the Cambridge Public Schools (CPS), and is in regular communication with 
many other city departments and city staff.  In addition, CPHD and other partners have been in 
communication with Harvard and MIT about their COVID-19 preparedness plans.   
 
Recent Preparedness Meetings 

•  On March 4, Cambridge Public Health Department’s Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob 

met with Governor Baker, Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders, 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel, and other local 
health department leaders. The meeting focused on local health department preparedness 
and outreach, and preceded a press conference in which all participated.

•  On March 5, representatives from the city’s fire, police, health, and emergency 

communications departments; Mount Auburn Hospital, Cambridge Health Alliance, 
Harvard, MIT, and two ambulance companies met to discuss COVID-19 updates and 
strategies. 

•  On March 6, the City Manager DePasquale and Mayor Siddiqui held a briefing meeting with 

designated departments heads for an update about the City’s COVID-19 response 
efforts. The City Manager’s office is developing a communications plan to provide weekly 
updates to the City Council and City employees to share timely information regarding this 
situation as it continues to evolve.  The City Manager’s Office will also develop a coordinated 
communication strategy with CPHD to provide information to the broader community.  The 
Cambridge Public Schools, in coordination with CPHD, has been communicating with the 
school community on issues and concerns directly related to the schools.  

•  On March 7, the City Manager held a briefing meeting with designated departments heads 
for an update about the City’s COVID-19 response efforts. The discussion focused on the 
ongoing case investigation pertaining to the Biogen meeting in Boston and the coordination 
with state authorities. 

•  On March 10, the City Manager facilitated a huddle with the CPS leadership, including the 
School Superintendent, Deputy Superintendent, and Chief Operating Officer, to discuss 
potential scenarios and plans to support students, teachers, and parents in the event of 
school cancellations and the curtailing of activities that could impact the school community. 

Upcoming Meetings  

•  On March 12, the City Manager and Mayor is participating in a Greater Boston region 

emergency preparedness meeting regarding COVID-19. This is an opportunity to hear from 
a panel of experts in public health and epidemiology, and to discuss regional partnerships 
for handling this epidemic. 

•  On March 12, there will be a meeting of all city department heads with the City Manager to 

further discuss city preparedness and outreach.  

•  On March 12, there will be a meeting of public health and safety stakeholders on 

preparedness and outreach, a follow up to the meeting held on March 5. 

CPHD Information Sharing, Guidance, and Technical Assistance  

The Cambridge Public Health Department is sharing information as it becomes available, with 
Cambridge first responders, law enforcement, public schools, human services, and other city 
departments.  
 
The health department is also offering guidance and support to community partners.  CPHD has 
responded to numerous requests from local businesses, nonprofits, and other groups on preparing 
for community spread of COVID-19. 
 
Specific actions and communications include: 

•  Sharing Daily Information with the Public: On February 27, CPHD launched a COVID-19 
webpage.  On March 7, the department began providing daily “Situation Reports” to the 
public, which are posted at the top of the web page. The page is also a repository of all 
health department communications to the public.

ONGOING CONCERNS 

As this situation continues to rapidly evolve, CPHD has identified some near-term concerns and is 
reaching out to state partners for support.  Significant concerns, as of March 12, include: 

•  Undertesting of Massachusetts residents, including Cambridge residents, who may have 
become infected with COVID-19 from unknown sources. Local health departments were 
notified on March 11 that the state health department is actively working to address this 
situation and additional testing sites should come online soon. 

•  Lack of personal protective equipment, including face masks, hand sanitizer, alcohol-based 

wipes, and other supplies.  The state is currently working to address this issue.  

•  Risk to older adults (over age 60+) and people with underlying health conditions and how 

best to prepare these groups for community spread of COVID-19. 

•  Risk to members of the above two groups who live in congregate settings, such as long-term 

care and assisted living facilities, and how best to prepare management, families, and 
residents.  

•  Concern that while some Cambridge residents and families may be receiving good 

information from many sources, other residents may be receiving limited information or 
may not understand the information they are receiving due to language barriers or health-
related cognitive issues.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $40,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Cable 
TV Extraordinary Expenditures account. This appropriation will be used to replace the production van for 
22-CityView, Municipal Cable Television.  
 
The current vehicle is a 1995 Ford Econoline production van that the department was using to transport 
equipment and staff to and from production shoots.  The van has a number of mechanical problems that 
have been determined to be too costly to fix given the age and usage of the vehicle.    
 
With the increased production obligations a reliable transportation source is needed.  The van will be 
used to transport media production equipment for all remote productions.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am pleased to provide you with an update on the Children’s Savings Account Program. In the 
fall of 2019, the City issued a Request for Information (RFI) for a “Retail Banking Institution to 
Develop and Deliver Program to Support Financial Literacy and Children’s Savings Accounts in 
Cambridge Public Schools.” Following the RFI process, on February 26, 2020, East Cambridge 
Savings Bank (ECSB) and the City signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish the 
Children’s Savings Account Program. This appears to be the first such partnership in the 
Commonwealth between a private financial institution and a municipality to deliver such a 
program. 
 
As someone who has spent over 40 years in finance, I understand the importance of ensuring the 
next generation has strong fiscal literacy skills. This process began in 2018 under the leadership 
of Mayor Marc McGovern.  I also want to express my appreciation to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice 
Mayor Mallon for their tireless efforts, and the entire City Council for their leadership in asking 
the City to explore a Children’s Savings Account Program. Additionally, I want to thank the 
members of the City’s Finance team for their creative thinking and the ongoing work to 
implement this program, as well as the School Department administration for their collaboration 
in this process. 
 
I also want to thank the East Cambridge Savings Bank, especially President and Chief Executive 
Officer Gilda M. Nogueira and Leo Gayne, Assistant Vice-President/Public Relations Officer, 
for their collaboration in providing financial literacy training and for providing the $50 per 
student seed money for each account opened. This public-private partnership exemplifies the 
strong commitment our local business community has to the residents of Cambridge. 
 
Offering families, a way to begin saving for their young children’s college education has been 
recognized to reduce the educational attainment gap facing low-income and minority students. 
Research shows that children with even only small amounts of school savings are much more 
likely to enroll in college and much more likely to graduate from college than those without 

1.5

savings. (Reference: Communities and Banking Magazine, Summer 2016, p.20, Bahar Akman 
Imboden and Yiming Shuang) 
 
As part of this program, ECSB will provide financial literacy training for all kindergarten and 
junior kindergarten students enrolled public elementary schools of the Cambridge School 
Department (a/k/a Cambridge Public Schools (“CPS”)). Additionally, parents for any eligible 
kindergarten student enrolled in Cambridge Public Schools will have the opportunity to opt-in to 
opening a savings account for their child, with the ECSB providing $50 in seed money for 
college or career training costs. At this time, this program will be put into place for the 2019-
2020 school year. 
 
The CPS, under the leadership of Deputy Superintendent Dr. Carolyn Turk, will serve as the 
initial point of contact between parents or guardians of students and ECSB. The program will be 
introduced to the students at each of the twelve (12) public elementary schools operated by CPS.  
 
It is estimated that approximately 640 CPS students are eligible for the program during the 
current school year. 
 
CPS will provide families (including guardians) of the students with information about the 
program, and CPS will host the financial literacy training within the kindergarten classes during 
school hours throughout the school year. In fact, ECSB staff recently visited several CPS 
kindergarten classes as part of our ongoing commitment to financial education within the 
Cambridge community.  Parents or guardians who choose to opt into the program will be able to 
open a “passbook savings account” with no fees to student account holders. This program will 
allow participants to make deposits and watch their money grow.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation in the amount of $4,000,000 from Free Cash to the 
Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account to support the 
Complete Streets Reconstruction Program and for repaving portions of streets that are part of the 
separated bicycle network. 
 
$2,000,000 of the additional funding requested is required to complete reconstruction of the 
streets identified in the previous capital budgets such as Chestnut Street, Rufo Road, and 
Washington Street, in order to cover significant increases in construction costs over the past 2 
years.   
 
The remaining $2,000,000 of this request will support the partial paving and spot drainage 
improvements of streets on the separated bicycle network in advance of the implementation of 
quick-build separated bicycle lane projects.  This paving will improve conditions for people 
cycling on critical bike connections.    The scope of work with these improvements will be 
limited to paving of sections of asphalt in deteriorated condition and spot drainage 
improvements. 
 
In FY19 and FY20 a total of $13,926,455 was budgeted for the Complete Streets Program, an 
additional $1,000,000 was appropriated for Elm Street in FY20 which allowed the City to further 
accelerate implementation of the Cambridge Bicycle Plan.   
 
The goal of the Complete Streets Program is to reconstruct streets and sidewalks to provide high 
quality infrastructure with an emphasis on designing streets for all users and supporting the 
City’s commitment to Complete Streets and Vision Zero.  Funding is provided annually in the 
City’s Capital Budget and specific streets are prioritized through the 5 Year Sidewalk and Street 
Plan.  Streets being reconstructed are designed through a community process and the scope of 
work includes addressing the condition of the paving; reconstructing the sidewalks to be fully

ADA accessible; incorporating traffic calming elements to enhance the safety and comfort of the 
street for pedestrians and cyclists; incorporating green infrastructure; planting additional street 
trees; and strengthening the character and operation of the street for the community.  
 
With the total supplemental funding of $5 million in this fiscal year from free cash we have 
continued our commitment to Complete Streets, Vision Zero and the separated bicycle network.

SLOPE RESTORATION: 

In coordination with the Glacken Field and Playground project, the Glacken Slope area will 
be restored consistent with the Fresh Pond Reservation Master Plan; addressing slope 
erosion, improving degraded and compacted soils, removing invasive species, and 
restoring a diverse, native plant community within Glacken Slope.   This will continue the 
successful slope restoration in the area and is the 6th phase of restoration. 

The restoration includes the removal of 54 invasive black locust trees and a planting of a 
multi-layered woodland that mimics the Oak-Hickory Forest community native to eastern 
Massachusetts under similar soil, aspect, and hydrological conditions. The work will 
increase species diversity and abundance, improve habitat value, better protect the water 
supply, and will create a revitalized, resilient tree canopy in 10 – 15 years.  Approximately 
75 canopy trees and 150 understory trees and shrubs will be planted. The black locust 
being removed will be used in playground projects in the City including Glacken 
Playground and the Universal Playground at Danehy Park. 

PROJECT BUDGET: 

The project budget covers the design and construction of: 
 

Playground (perimeter path around fields, plantings,  

 

 

$3,375,000 

play equipment) 

 

athletic equipment, athletic fencing) 

 
Athletic Fields (site preparation, natural grass field, drainage, 
 
 
Huron Avenue Bike / Ped Connection (Fresh Pond Pkwy to Glacken)  $1,200,000 
 
Athletic Lights for 1 Field 
 
Bleacher Removal 

$1,750,000

$250,000 

$675,000 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Total Project Costs:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

$7,250,000 

The slope restoration work is estimated to cost $350,000 and is being funded through 
existing Water Department funding allocated for Fresh Pond Reservation and Reservoir 
Facility Improvement projects.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting a supplemental appropriation of $139,080 from Free Cash to the General 
Fund Fire Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account ($6,080) and to the General Fund 
Fire Department Extraordinary Expenditures account ($133,000). 
 
Funds will be used to cover cost for protective equipment for 10 new firefighters; for equipment, 
initial station uniform, and medical and psychological screenings for a new firefighter recruit 
who will begin training in July; and to cover the cost of the replacement of 18 sets of bunker gear 
for present members. The approximate life of bunker and turnout gear is ten years.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $1,500,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Fire Extraordinary Expenditures account.  
 
This appropriation will fund the replacement of a 2002 Pierce Tower Ladder for Ladder 2 in East 
Cambridge.   The current apparatus is almost eighteen years old, and the newer design of this 
Tower Ladder will result in a smaller, more compact piece of apparatus which will be better 
suited for responses in a congested urban environment.    
 
Over the past several years, the City has removed Fire equipment purchases out of the pay-as-
you go capital plan due to their extraordinary costs.  The existing Tower Ladder 2 will be 
disposed of on the secondary apparatus market as it cannot serve the city as a reserve piece of 
apparatus.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-66, regarding establishing a Young Adult Civic 
Unity Committee, please be advised that after consulting with City staff from the Department of 
Human Service Programs and City staff supporting the Citizens’ Committee on Civic Unity, I 
propose working directly with the City’s young people to develop a strategy for youth 
involvement that they will find engaging and impactful. 
 
The Department of Human Service Programs, through its Youth Center Programs and Office of 
Workforce Development, will engage in a process with people in their teens and twenties to 
explore the development of a Young Adult Civic Unity Committee. The Youth Centers will 
work with teens across their summer youth programs to gather their input and expertise in how to 
increase and maintain youth involvement in civic activities. The Mayor’s Summer Youth 
Employment Program will also host focus groups for its summer staff and youth center staff, 
who are in their twenties, to gather their input. What would inspire and motivate them to become 
more engaged?  How can the City better reach its young people?  Are there other stakeholder 
groups the City should solicit input from to ensure diverse perspectives?  Staff from the Youth 
Programs and the Office of Workforce Development will compile the feedback from these 
efforts and develop next steps for expanding the representation of youth and young adult 
populations otherwise not being heard from in civic planning in a sustainable way.  
 
Additionally, the Department of Human Service Programs will propose the development of a 
strategy to increase youth involvement in City planning as a potential project for the 
Department’s Neighborhood Design Project.  The Neighborhood Design Project is a 
collaboration between the Cambridge Youth Programs and the Office of Workforce 
Development.  This fourteen-week program introduces teenagers to the world of work and 
project development.  Small groups identify a need in their community, design a project that will 
address that need, and then implement the project. This year, the program is being supported by 
the Design Museum Boston to connect early career designers to the staff and young people to

support their projects. The young people participating in the Neighborhood Design Project 
decide which they want to work on. Staff will propose this project to the participants and, if the 
project is selected, a team will specifically design a process to increase youth involvement in city 
planning.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

APP-2 
IN CITY COUNCIL 
March 16, 2020 

Draft of PUD-CDK Amendment 

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 
Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use district that is 
comprised of high quality general and technical office and labs with diverse active 
commercial and community uses (including retail and restaurant uses, and arts and 
cultural uses), all of which promote, create corridors among, and enhance the existing 
open space network within and surrounding the district, and provide benefits to the 
surrounding community through community arts and publicly accessible interior 
gathering space. In particular, the district facilitates strengthening the public open 
space connections among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the 
Broad Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street. The PUD-CDK District creates incentives to 
(A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and culture facility that will further diversify the 
mix of uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade utility 
and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station on Third Street to 
enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street and provide an attractive 
connector corridor between the district and the East Cambridge neighborhood. The 
parcel on which the existing gas regulator/transfer station is located is referred to 
herein as the “Gas Transfer Station Parcel”. 
PUD-CDK Special Permit 

applicant may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the 
Planning Board approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel 
located within the PUD-CDK District that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK 
special permit, consists of at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the 
foregoing, the Final Development Plan for a currently vacant or undeveloped 
Development Parcel under this PUD-CDK overlay zoning shall include either an Arts 
and Culture Center or Community Arts Facility, as further provided in Section 
13.204.1(b) below.

13.202.2  PUD-CDK Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-CDK 

special permit approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel upon 
finding that the Final Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, 
and all other criteria applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought. 

13.202.3  PUD-CDK Special Permit Requirements. Within the Development Parcel the 
locations of the open spaces, the quantities of proposed land uses, the building 
envelope, and heights shall be indicated in sufficient detail that the Planning Board

Open Space Plan: illustrating and quantifying the areas of all open space 

areas utilized by the development in satisfaction of Section 13.204.5, including, 
without limitation, existing open space constructed under a PUD-3 special permit and 
pedestrian ways providing connectivity to the Broad Canal.  

(f) 

Ground Floor and Activation Plan: illustrating the conceptual 
arrangement of functions such as retail establishments and other ground floor uses, 
and residential and office lobbies at the ground floor of the building(s) in the 
Development Parcel, as well as the locations and anticipated sizes of any Community 
Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center that may be required by Section 13.204.1(b) 
and strategies for programming and activating such spaces.  

(g) 

Sustainability and Resiliency Plan: describing: (1) how the sustainability 
requirements set forth in Section 13.206.2 below will be met; (2) how the proposed 
development will promote best practices for environmental sustainability and

Permitted New Gross Floor Area. Any planned Development Parcel 

within the PUD-CDK District that is currently vacant or undeveloped shall be 
permitted to have a maximum of 450,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area in the 
aggregate, excluding any Gross Floor Area for the Community Arts Facility as 
described in Section 13.204.1(b) above. However, the Planning Board, in its review 
of a special permit application under this Section 13.204.1(c), may allow a planned 
development within the PUD-CDK District to have a maximum of 550,000 square 
feet of new Gross Floor Area, excluding any Gross Floor Area for the Arts and

addition to the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its review of a special permit 
application under this Section 13.204.3, may allow the maximum height of the 
building to exceed the foregoing maximum heights if mechanical equipment that 
might otherwise have been located on the roof is designed to be located on other 
above-grade areas within the building in which case the maximum building height 
may be increased by the floor to floor height of the relocated above-grade mechanical 
space, and to the extent such mechanical equipment is to be located on multiple floors 
within the building, then the maximum building height may be increased by the 
aggregate floor to floor heights of such multiples floor provided that such mechanical 
equipment occupies at least 75% of the floor plate of each floor. For illustration 
purposes only, if some mechanical equipment is located on the roof (e.g., air

13.204.5  Open Space: Any Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK District shall 

demonstrate that, following completion of such development, there shall be not less 
than fifteen percent (15%) open space as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 in 
the PUD-CDK District except as modified below.  

13.204.5.1 

The Planning Board, in its review of any special permit application for a 
development containing a Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, 
may consider indoor or covered pedestrian ways, decks, arcades, loggias, and 
gallerias appurtenant to the Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center, 
even if located on a different Development Parcel in the PUD-CDK District, to be 
open space provided that the same is publicly accessible during normal business 
hours. The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall make a finding that there is no net-loss of open space already existing within 
the PUD-CDK District (other than within any previously undeveloped or vacant 
Development Parcel). 
Open space, whether already existing within the PUD-CDK District or to be 
constructed by the developer or its affiliate, shall include, without limitation, the 
following: parks; plazas; lawns; landscaped areas substantially open to the sky;

this Section 13.205. 

13.205.2  Parking:  
13.205.2.1  Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements within the 
PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in approving a Final 
Development Plan may specify a minimum parking requirement based on review 
and analysis of Transportation Assessments and other relevant information on 
parking demand provided in application documents, and with the guidance of City 
agencies.

13.205.2.2 

13.205.2.3 

13.205.2.4 

13.205.2.5 

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, shall 
make a finding that that the Final Development Plan provides adequate parking 
for the proposed uses and that the Final Development Plan does not substantially 
increase net-new off-street parking spaces within the PUD-CDK District. 
The parking requirements of this Section 13.205.2 may be satisfied (a) anywhere 
in the PUD-CDK District, or if located outside of the PUD-CDK District, within 
2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in part by an easement, lease 
agreement, occupancy agreement, license or other comparable legal instrument 
between the developer and the City, other public entity or private owner or 
consortium for use of parking spaces in the public or shared parking facilities 
within said area. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 6.000, this Zoning Ordinance 
shall not restrict the management and assignment of parking spaces in a way that 
will most efficiently utilize the existing and proposed parking spaces to serve all 
approved uses. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 19.20, the Planning Board 
may permit the Developer to substitute a Transportation Assessment in form and 
substance acceptable to the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department if the 
Planning Board otherwise determines that the materials submitted with the Final 
Development Plan adequately describe the impacts of traffic and parking on the 
area surrounding the Development Parcel.  

13.205.3  Loading: The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may 
waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities 
within the PUD-CDK District, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across 
various uses within the PUD-CDK District or the adjacent PUD-3 District. 
13.205.4  Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100 
of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the 
requirements in Section 6.100 may be modified by the Planning Board through its 
approval of a Final Development Plan. 
Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to Development 
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK District. 

13.206 

13.206.1  Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s) shall remain 

valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, all development 
projects constructed pursuant thereto and existing prior to the enactment date of this 
Section 13.200 for the PUD-CDK District, including without limitation with respect 
to rebuilding due to casualty. Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit 
shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-3 special permit, 
and the PUD-CDK zoning shall govern with respect to such additional rights, except 
however any rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit shall 
automatically supersede any undeveloped rights for the applicable development 
parcel as provided for under the PUD-3 zoning. Such undeveloped rights under a 
previously issued PUD-3 special permit shall be deemed automatically extinguished 
as of the date that the subsequent PUD-CDK special permit becomes valid and 
effective, and such automatic extinguishment shall be deemed to be a minor 
amendment of such previously issued special permit under PUD-3 under Section 

Packet Pg. 147

12.37.2 of this Zoning Ordinance. To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to 
the provisions of one or more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or 
variance(s) issued prior to the issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted 
hereunder and the provisions of such existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent 
with the PUD-CDK special permit, the provisions of the PUD-CDK special permit 
shall govern. 

13.206.2  Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District shall comply 

3.2

with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain documentation showing how the 
development at an aggregate level will comply with the requirements of Section 
22.20. The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the 
requirements of Section 22.20.  
The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development Proposal shall 
describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will incorporate a 
comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best practices for meeting 
sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero Action Plan, Climate Change 
Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and other sustainability plans and guidelines 
promulgated by the City at the time the Development Proposal is submitted. The 
conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be 
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall 
incorporate best practices in the following areas:  

(a) 

Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve building 

energy and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer 
of a new building within the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for 
implementation of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may 
include rooftop solar pv) within the PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, 
economic viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse 
gas emissions analysis for such new building and will implement energy efficiency 
mitigation for such building to achieve the maximum energy reductions possible 
identified in such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial building 
shall include a study, prepared by the developer, considering the feasibility of 
connecting the proposed building to the existing district steam system, if available. 

(b) 

Urban Site and Landscaping; Water Management. The developer of a new 
building must explore opportunities for potable water use reductions and the ability to 
enhance indigenous plantings in and around the development site.

WHEREAS: 

As Massachusetts continues to grapple with the challenges posed by the novel 
coronavirus outbreak, the City of Cambridge must continue being vigilant in protecting 
our community from this developing public health concern, and in moving to minimize 
its impact locally; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Director of the 
Public Health Department and other appropriate personnel to design, develop, and 
implement a mobile Coronavirus Testing and Information Center that can rotate across 
2 – 4 locations throughout the community to provide free testing for Cambridge 
residents and to ease the burden being placed upon our hospitals and health clinics; and 
be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the appropriate City 
personnel to establish barriered, outward-facing service counters that have a Plexiglass 
divider (similar to what is seen at the Cashier’s Window on the first floor of City Hall) 
for those City departments that have the greatest degree of daily interaction with the 
public, to minimize the risk of infectious agents being spread; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to establish guidelines that will 
allow those City employees who are considered to be at the “highest risk” of 
developing the coronavirus to work remotely from home without losing their accrued 
paid sick time; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

In 2017, the City Council adopted goals including “Make it easy to move safely 
through the City, especially by sustainable modes of transportation”; and 
 
The City has committed to Vision Zero, which seeks to eliminate transportation 
fatalities and serious injuries, as well as reduce crash rates across all modes of 
transportation; and 
 
There have been multiple cyclist deaths and numerous serious injuries on Cambridge 
streets in the past several years; and 
 
Promoting sustainable transportation methods can help alleviate high levels of traffic 
in the region, provide alternatives for residents who cannot afford to have a car in the 
city, and help reduce Cambridge’s carbon footprint; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached “2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance” be forwarded to the Ordinance 
Committee for discussion and recommendation.

Definitions 

Cycling Safety Ordinance 

Chapter 12.22  
 
Section 12.22.010 
 
This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.  
 
Section 12.22.020 
 
This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the 
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected 
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City. 
 
Section 12.22.030 
 
A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or 
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle 
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in 
both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.” 
 
D. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that 
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City. 
 
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of 
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction 
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion, 
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine 
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a 
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

H. “Public Transportation” shall mean bus and shuttle stops for the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific 
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist 
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or 
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible

lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so 
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better. 
 
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a 
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN 
 
WHEREAS: 

Housing costs in and around Cambridge have increased consistently and 
dramatically over the last 20+ years, resulting in a lack of affordability and 
causing displacement of long-term lower, moderate, and middle-income 
residents; and 
 
A Real Estate Transfer Fee on commercial and residential property in 
Cambridge could yield millions of dollars in funding for urgently-needed 
affordable housing; and 
 
The Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Orders on September 18, 2017, 
January 10, 2019, and December 16, 2019 requesting that the City Manager 
instruct the City Solicitor to prepare a draft Home Rule petition for a Real 
Estate Transfer Fee; and 
 
The City Council has yet to receive any update on said Home Rule petition; and 
 
The local governments of Nantucket, Concord and Somerville have already 
approved Home Rule petitions for a Real Estate Transfer Fee; and 
 
The Boston City Council approved a Real Estate Transfer Fee that is now 
before the state legislature; and 
 
The City of Brookline approved a Real Estate Transfer Fee Home Rule petition 
on December 5, 2019 at a Town Hall meeting by a margin of 139-44; and 
 
The cities of Watertown and Arlington introduced Transfer Fee legislation for

AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY/TOWN OF CAMBRIDGE 
TO IMPOSE A REAL ESTATE TRANSFER FEE  
 

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority of 

the same, as follows: 

 
SECTION 1.  Findings and Purpose. 
 
Whereas, housing costs in and around Cambridge have increased consistently and 
dramatically over the last 20+ years, resulting in a lack of affordability and causing 
displacement of long-term lower, moderate, and middle-income residents and a decrease 
in racial and economic diversity of households: 

-  Between 2007 and 2017, home prices in the city-center areas of Boston, 

Cambridge, and Somerville rose from between 61 and 89 percent, according to 
the Urban Institute  

-  Based on the analysis of low- and middle-income groups, 45,000 individuals or 

43% of the population are negatively impacted by the housing market, according 
to the 2017 Cambridge Needs Assessment Survey 

-  The average rent for a Cambridge apartment was $2,337 for a one-bedroom unit, 
$2,689 for a two bedroom and $2,827 for a three-bedroom unit in October 2018, 
according to the Cambridge Community Foundation. 
In Cambridgeport a renter must earn $44 dollars per hour in order to afford a two-
bedroom apartment, more than three times the current Massachusetts minimum 
wage, according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition. 

- 

 
Whereas, these circumstances are further compounded by a combination of regional 
housing demand and constrained supply as documented in the Metropolitan Area 
Planning Council’s projection of regional housing demand for the metro north Boston 
area and the 2017 Housing Report Card, which noted that the sharpest increases in 
housing costs are occurring in Boston’s inner-ring suburbs including Cambridge; and 
 
Whereas, Cambridge’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund is established under M.G.L. c.44, 
§55C and is charged with the preservation and creation of new affordable rental and 
homeownership units in the City of Cambridge and the creation of programs that directly 
assist renters and homeowners, now;

Therefore, the purpose of this act is to establish a sustainable revenue source for the 
Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust Fund as further set forth below: 
 
SECTION 2. Except where otherwise exempted pursuant to this act, the City of 
Cambridge may impose a fee of up to __________% of the purchase price upon the 
transfer of any real property interest or a controlling interest in a trust, limited liability 
company, or other entity that directly or indirectly holds such real property interest, in 
any real property situated in the City of Cambridge, as follows: (A) a fee in the amount of 
_____________%  of said purchase price shall be due and payable by the seller and/or 
buyer ; and (B) a fee in the amount of _____________% of said purchase price shall be 
due and payable by the seller and/or buyer. In the case of a transfer of a controlling 
interest, the City of Cambridge may define by ordinance what constitutes a controlling 
interest and the calculation of the fee.  The City of Cambridge is hereinafter referred to as 
the “City”.                                  
 
(a) Exempt Transfers. The following transfers of real property interests shall be exempt 
from the fee established by this act: FOR EXAMPLE- (i) transfers between family 
members as defined by ordinance; (ii) transfers of convenience with consideration under 
$100.00[insert other threshold if desired] as defined by ordinance; and (iii) transfers to 
the government of the United States or any other instrumentality, agency of subdivision 
thereof, or the Commonwealth or any instrumentality or subdivision thereof (iv) [insert 
what makes sense for Cambridge; note- additional exemptions can be added to an 
ordinance following HRP approval, but not removed]   
 
(b)  Exempt Sellers; Fee Due by Non-Exempt Seller.  The seller of residential real 
property in the City shall be exempt from the fee authorized in Section 2, if the seller of 
such real property is:  

(i) 
(ii) 

(iii) 

(iv) 

a vulnerable senior, as defined by the City or  
a taxpayer approved by the City for an exemption for residential real 
property pursuant to section 5C of chapter 59 of the General Laws or any 
special law for the property to be transferred (referred to as the “residential 
exemption”), or meets all qualifications for approval of the same, for the 
two immediately preceding years as of the date of the deed or other 
instrument evidencing such transfer or such other date as may be defined 
by the City. This exemption shall not apply to residential real property 
which contains four or more dwelling units.   
[insert what makes sense for Cambridge;  note additional exemptions can 
be added to an ordinance following HRP approval, but not removed]   
If the seller of such real property is an heir-at-law or devisee, and the 
transfer of said real property is within one year from the date of demise of 
the deceased owner of such real property and such owner met the above 
residential exemption requirement, or would have met all qualifications 
for approval of the same, the seller shall be exempt from said fee.    

 
If the seller is not exempt, the fee shall be due and payable by the seller to the City at the 
time set forth in Section 3.

(c)   Exempt Purchasers; Fee Due by Non-Exempt Purchaser.   The purchaser shall be 
exempt from the fee authorized in Section 2 if: 

(i) 
(ii) 

(iii) 

that purchaser is a vulnerable senior, as may be defined by ordinance or  
prior to the recording of any deed, the purchaser of such real property 
submits an affidavit of intent to the City to seek a residential exemption for 
that property, on a form approved by the City, in which case the purchaser 
shall be provisionally exempt from the fee in Section 2, subject to this 
section.  Such provisional exemption for such transaction shall be made 
permanent, and the fee shall be permanently waived, if said purchaser is 
approved by the City for a residential exemption with respect to such real 
property for the first two years following the date of transfer in which the 
purchaser would first be eligible to apply for said residential exemption.  If 
the purchaser does not submit said affidavit, the fee shall be due and payable 
by the purchaser to the City at the time set forth in Section 3. If the purchaser 
does not obtain residential exemptions during the first two years following 
the date of transfer, the fee shall be due and payable by the purchaser upon 
failure to obtain either required exemption. This exemption shall not apply to 
residential real property which contains four or more dwelling units.  
[insert what makes sense for Cambridge; note additional exemptions can be 
added to an ordinance following HRP approval, but not removed]   

  
(d) The fee shall be paid to the City/Town of Cambridge. The City is authorized to adopt 
an ordinance to provide for the collection and lien of any outstanding transfer fee.  The 
City shall have such remedies to collect said amount as provided by law with respect to 
the collection of real property taxes.   
 
(e) The City shall deposit all fees received pursuant to this act into the Cambridge 
Affordable Housing Trust Fund established by the City. 
 
SECTION 3. A copy of the deed or other instrument evidencing such transfer shall be 
provided to the City and shall be accompanied by, (a) an affidavit signed under oath or 
under the pains and penalties of perjury by the purchaser and seller attesting to the 
purchase price, (b) the applicable fee owed, (c) the basis, if any, upon which the transfer 
or one or both of the parties to the transfer is claimed to be exempt in whole or in part 
from said fee, and (d) if applicable, an affidavit of intent to seek a residential exemption 
for that property by the purchaser. Upon receipt of such payment and/or satisfactory 
evidence of exemption, the City or its designee shall promptly thereafter issue a 
certificate indicating that the fee has been paid or that the purchaser or seller, or the 
transfer, is exempt from the fee.  The Middlesex South Register of Deeds shall not record 
or register a deed unless the deed is accompanied by such certificate.  
 
SECTION 4.  The City may, by ordinance, adopt additional requirements, exemptions, 
and regulations to implement or enforce said fee, consistent with this act.  The City is not 
authorized to eliminate or reduce any exemption set forth in this act.

SECTION 5. The Affordable Housing Trust Fund, as permitted by the ordinance 
establishing said Affordable Housing Trust Fund and its governing documents, shall use 
revenue from the fees raised pursuant to this act to fund affordable housing programs 
including, but not limited to, limited equity arrangements, community land trusts, 
purpose-built housing, and other programs [insert any additional uses if desired] to 
underwrite the affordability of properties with a preference, where permitted by 
applicable law, for current and recent Cambridge residents and employees.  
 
SECTION 6. The City shall prepare and issue an annual report that (i) identifies fee 
receipts by payer category including buyers and sellers; (ii) quantifies affordable housing 
programs funded, including type and purpose, and (iii) evaluates the impact of said 
affordable housing programs, including but not limited to, to the extent reasonably 
possible and permitted by applicable law, the number and demographics of individuals 
and families served as well as measures of housing stability and wealth generation in the 
community.

COUNCILLOR NOLAN 
 
WHEREAS: 

COVID-19 has begun to spread in Massachusetts with 89 presumptive cases and 6 
additional cases confirmed by the CDC as of March 11, 2020; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  While COVID-19 presents as a mild flu-like illness in most people, with the primary 

symptoms being fever and dry cough, it is considered dangerous, especially for elderly 
and immunocompromised individuals, as well as those with underlying medical 
conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and has already 
killed 38 people in the U.S., over 800 in Italy and more than 4,700 worldwide as of 
March 11 and has been officially declared a pandemic by the World Health 
Organization (WHO); and 
 
Limiting social contact (“social distancing”) is an effective way to interrupt and slow 
down the spread of the virus and preserve the medical system’s ability to treat severe 
cases by limiting how many patients are hospitalized at any given moment, and is 
being recommended by health experts as the best way to protect more vulnerable 
populations; and 
 
It appears that individuals can spread the virus even when experiencing no symptoms 
or mild symptoms; and 
 
It can take several days or even weeks for the virus to incubate inside a human host and 
days more for test results to indicate possible infection and days more for the CDC to 
confirm those results, with a limited supply of tests, leading to the disease progression 
advancing faster than officials and the press are able to track and report on; and 
 
Governor Baker has declared a state of emergency and announced new guidance for all 
employers throughout the state, which includes discontinuing all work-related travel, 
both foreign and domestic, encouraging telecommuting whenever possible, and 
emphasizing that any person feeling sick should stay home from work; now therefore 
be it 
 
That the City Council cancel, postpone or shorten all nonessential in-person meetings 
until further notice, including non-urgent committee meetings and regular meetings 
where no urgent business will be transacted; and be it further 
 
That the City Council seek to limit the transmission of disease by providing alternative 
means, via audio/video technology, for public comment to be delivered other than in-
person at city hall; and be it further

That the City Council go on record urging citizens who are safely able to do so to limit 
physical interactions outside their home, and to avoid large crowds and events when 
possible, including working from home as much as possible if employment 
circumstances allow; and be it further 
 
That the City Council go on record urging citizens to take further precautions including 
frequent hand washing and avoiding touching one’s face as well as following other 
practices and guidelines as suggested by the CDC and the Cambridge Health 
Department; and be it further 
 

 
RESOLVED:   That the City Council go on record urging anyone who is experiencing mild symptoms 

 
RESOLVED: 
 
ORDERED: 

to stay home and notify close contacts, and anyone who is experiencing serious 
symptoms to seek medical assistance immediately; and be it further 
 
That these recommendations remain in effect until further notice; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to take all necessary actions to 
protect the population, including, but not limited to, cancelling all non-essential events 
and gatherings, allowing staff to work from home when possible, providing visitor 
screening at senior living facilities, and preparing emergency medical facilities for 
treating respiratory infections.

That the Cambridge City Council calls on the state government to mandate extended

shutoffs during the COVID-19 outbreak, and provide funding to assist small businesses

WHEREAS: 

As of March 10, 2020, Governor Baker has declared a State of Emergency in 
Massachusetts due to Coronavirus/COVID 19; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  While we are doing everything in our power to prevent the spread of disease in our 

communities, and mitigate the impact of this public health on our residents, businesses, 
and essential services during this time, the pressure on individual residents and 
families is immense; and 
 
COVID-19-related disruptions and potential income loss may result in difficulty for 
residents affected by the pandemic to pay rent, or pay rent timely, support of this 
moratorium will establish needed protections for the City’s most vulnerable residents; 
and 
 
Boston Rep. Kevin Honan, House Chairman of the Joint Committee on Housing, and 
State Rep. Mike Connolly, of Cambridge, filed HD.4935, An Act Providing for a 
Moratorium on Evictions and Foreclosures During the COVID-19 Emergency to pause 
evictions and foreclosures across the state until Governor Baker’s state of emergency 
concludes; and 
 
Through this legislation, courts overseeing eviction processes would be banned from 
entering a judgment; issuing an execution for possession of a unit; accepting filing of a 
complaint, summons, or writ; and denying a stay of execution or a continuance of a 
case as requested by a defendant, among other measures; and 
 
Creditors and mortgagees would be barred from carrying out foreclosures, publishing 
notice of a foreclosure sale to evicting tenants; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record in support of this temporary moratorium on 
evictions, foreclosures, and their proceedings in order to protect tenants facing 
significant financial burdens due to the global COVID-19 pandemic; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of 
this resolution to the Cambridge Legislative Delegation.

Re: Communication Re Coronavirus Preparation 

 
Dear Madam Mayor:  
 
 
At tonight’s meeting, the City Council is poised to receive a response to the March 2, 2020 Policy Order I 
submitted alongside you, Councilor Toomey, and Councilor Nolan that asked the City Manager to inform the City 
Council about the steps being taken to prepare Cambridge for the coronavirus. In the two weeks since that order was 
submitted, communities across the globe have been increasingly impacted by this illness, and time is clearly critical 
in determining what actions we may need to be contemplating. I am hoping that my colleagues on the City Council 
will forward any specific questions, concerns, and ideas they have to the City Manager and to the head of our Public 
Health Department. I am using this communication to raise the following questions and concerns:  
 

•  As news of the coronavirus continues to dominate the headlines and Cambridge residents are increasingly 
concerned about this threat,  it  would be  wise  to devote a space on the City’s main webpage  that links to 
rolling updates on this matter (and I am hoping we can have material in multiple languages).  

 

 

•  Not everyone has ready access to online resources, and it is therefore important for the City to establish a 
hotline  people can call to have their coronavirus questions answered, or that can direct them to  where to 
find the latest information (beyond merely directing them to online resources).  

•  We have been told that the elderly and those with compromised immune systems are at the greatest risk of 
having severe responses to this  illness; I believe it would be  wise for the Mayor’s Office and officials at 
MIT and Harvard to discuss the wisdom of modifying or canceling plans for the annual senior luncheons 
co-sponsored by those institutions and the Mayor’s Office.  
 

•  As  City  Councilors  have  been  receiving  anxious  calls  and  emails  from  parents  who  are  nervous  about 
whether  additional  precautions  at  the  schools  may  be  needed,  I  am  urging  the  City  Manager  and  the 
Mayor’s  Office  to  be  as  vigilant  as  possible  in  sharing  information  with  the  School  Committee  and  in 
working to speak with one clear, consistent voice and message to the public. 
 
It would be wise for the City Manager to conduct a concerted outreach to our Interfaith Community, to 
ensure that all relevant information is reaching the local congregations.   

• 

  
Again, I am looking forward to receiving tonight’s update from the City Manager on our March 2 Policy Order, and 
I know that by working collaboratively, our City shall be well-positioned to face this challenge as it comes.   

  

Sincerely,

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL 

 

Cambridge City Council 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler 
March 12, 2020 
Comments on 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance 

TO: 
 
FROM:  
DATE:  
RE: 
 
 
Fellow Councillors: 
 

The City of Cambridge has long recognized the importance of providing safe and sustainable 
transportation for all residents.  This is codified in City Council Goal 6, adopted on October 16, 2017: 
“Make it easy to move safely through the City, especially by sustainable modes of transportation.” The 
Council has passed more than a dozen policy orders related to cycling safety in the last few years, along 
with the landmark Cycling Safety Ordinance from last term, which ensures that Permanent Separated 
Bicycle Lanes be added to streets included in the Separated Network of the Cambridge Bicycle Plan as 
part of the street reconstruction process.   

The actions of the City Council and the work of the City’s staff have been in recognition of both the 
growing demand by Cambridge residents for sustainable transportation alternatives and the difficulty of 
travelling by car in Cambridge due to increased traffic throughout the Boston region, as documented by 
reporting in the Boston Globe’s “Seeing Red” series among other recent reporting.  The work to promote 
safe streets has also been motivated by the deaths of multiple cyclists and pedestrians in collisions with 
cars over the past few years.  The policies promoted by the Council and work carried out by the City’s 
staff have led to safer streets and high levels of non-motorized transportation.  According to the City’s 
2019 Neighborhood Statistical Profile, more than 31% of Cambridge residents commute to work by 
bicycle or on foot.  However, while the Separated Network of the Cambridge Bicycle Plan lays out the 
streets which have been identified for protected bike lanes, there has until now not been an Ordinance that 
provides a specific timeline for their implementation to address the urgent safety situation on our streets.   
This proposed Ordinance was jointly written by Cambridge City staff (including members of the 

Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department, the Community Development Department, the 
Department of Public Works, the City Manager’s Office, and the City Solicitor), my office, Councillor 
Marc McGovern, and Cambridge Bicycle Safety.  The goal of the Ordinance is to provide a concrete 

Packet Pg. 253

7.2

timeline for construction of Quick-Build and Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes while also 
accommodating potential implementation challenges.  The timeline and language in the proposed 
Ordinance also take into account the need for a robust community engagement process that incorporates 
feedback from residents, local businesses, and community groups, especially seniors. 

Should the Council choose to send this proposal onto the Ordinance Committee, City Staff and 

members of Cambridge Bicycle Safety will prepare a presentation and answer questions from the Council 
about the proposed Ordinance.  Some main points from the Ordinance are highlighted below: 

●  The Ordinance would require that Quick Build Separated Bike Lanes be constructed, or the 

construction of Permanent Separated Bike Lanes commence, for most streets in the Separated 
Network of the Cambridge Bicycle Plan by May 1, 2026 

 

●  The Ordinance includes a one-year extension at the City Manager’s discretion if the Manager 

submits a report detailing their rationale to the Council by May 1, 2025 

●  Recognizing the additional complexities of adding protected cycling facilities to 

Massachusetts Avenue, along with its importance as a cycling corridor, the Ordinance lays 
out the process for analysis of the street and different scenarios by which Separated Bike 
Lanes can be implemented along Massachusetts Avenue by May 1, 2022 with important 
exceptions in Central Square and northern Massachusetts Ave in “Requirements” subsections 
D, E, and F 

o  In particular, subsection D of the Ordinance lays out a process by which the City 
Manager shall submit a block-by-block analysis for Quick-Build Separated Bike 
Lanes on the northern part of Massachusetts Ave from Harvard Square to the 
intersection with Dudley Street by May 1, 2021.  If Quick-Build Lanes are 
determined to not be feasible, the City Manager will submit a plan for Permanent 
Separated Bike Lanes to be approved by the Council 
 

o  Due to planned construction in Central Square, subsection D also lays out a modified 
timeline that was developed with input from the Department of Public Works for the 
section of Massachusetts Ave from Sydney Street to Inman Street  

●  The Ordinance ensures that Separated Bike Lanes will be a complement to, and not an 

impediment to, public transportation as laid out in “Definitions” subsections G, H, and I 

●  The Ordinance requires a report by the City Manager on the status of carrying out this 
Ordinance each year, with the first report to be delivered no later than May 31, 2021 

●  The public will be able to track progress of the Ordinance, as well as upcoming projects to be 
completed in pursuance thereof, via a website created by May 31, 2021 and updated twice per 
year thereafter

Based  on  the  potential  severity  of  COVID-19  outbreak  in  the  student  community,  several  local  universities  have  made  the 
difficult decision to close indefinitely to reduce possible virus exposure. While there are currently no known cases of COVID-19 
in the Cambridge community, my office is committed to helping our residents and sharing information when available.  

Below is a list of resources specifically to support students who may be displaced due to campus closures in Cambridge. We 
will do our best to update this page as more resources become available.
