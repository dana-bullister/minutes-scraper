2:30 – 4:00 PM 

Virtual Meeting 

The Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) will meet to advance its purpose act on the Guiding 
Principles for Community Benefits Funding set forth in the Community Needs Assessment. 

Overview 

I.  Introduction & Updates 
 

•  A few CBAC members participated in virtual meeting with members of Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition (CNC) to 

review CNC recommendations for the funding. 

Summary of CNC Recommendations 
•  Funding Approach:   

 
o  Make 100 grants available at $10,000 each   
o  Administer funds through grant agreements rather than reimbursement contracts 
o  Allow proposals that address any of the needs listed on the 2017 Community Needs Assessment, rather 

 

 

 

 

than just the top tier 

 

o  Allow organizations to define their approach to addressing the broad impact of COVID-19 on the 

•  Application Process:  

consumers and community they serve, and the ability of their organizations to operate.  
 

  

 

 

 

o  Create an extremely simple and streamlined application and reporting process. We recommend that the 
committee create a short eligibility checklist, and in addition request only a 1-2 paragraph project 
summary and simple budget. The checklist would allow organizations to establish their 501(c )3 status, 
and that the proposal is addressing one of the needs from the Needs Assessment, will benefit Cambridge 
residents, and addresses needs that are a result of, or have been intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic.  

 

 

o  Create a timeline that will allow funds to be distributed the week of July 1st. The process should match 

o  Provide funding to the first 100 organizations that meet the eligibility requirements and submit a

the urgency of need. 

complete application. 

•  Discussion:  

o  Speed and simplicity both really important; $10,000 is a reasonable amount of money and significant 

o 

enough for many nonprofit organizations 
In evaluating applications, focus on being more broad and inclusive – the more criteria CBAC 
establishes, the more complex the process becomes 

o  With CNC recommendations, CBAC would not be comparing applications against each other 
o  Potential for doing lottery if CBAC receives more than 100 applications 
o  Question of how CBAC evaluates – as public money, need for accountability and nonprofit organizations 

have limited capacity and CBAC does not want to make process cumbersome

Factors that may guide CBAC in this process (from 6/4 CBAC meeting): 
•  Prioritize simplicity and expediency – sense of urgency 
•  Prioritize equity 
•  Address all needs identified in Needs Assessment  
•  Cast a wide net in outreach to nonprofit organizations – all available channels, including Find It Cambridge, 
Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition, Cambridge Community Foundation, City’s Daily Updates, City’s homepage  

•  Maximize flexibility of funding for nonprofits 
•  Application – keep simple, only require what is necessary 
• 

“Vulnerable residents” – keep definition broad, let applicants define why population they are serving is 
vulnerable/ how they are responding to needs 

•  Make link to Needs Assessment – the more of the needs that their population is at-risk for, the more 

vulnerable  

for up to x months  

•  Duration – ask applicants to give some estimate of timeline, and/or state that grant agreement will be in effect 

•  Consider ways to avoid competition – e.g., provide awards to first 100 nonprofits that meet application criteria   
Discussion:  
•  Prioritize equity among nonprofit organizations in Cambridge  
Focus on assisting/ being responsive to vulnerable residents impacted by COVID-19 pandemic – have applicants self-
certify 
What are the questions CBAC may need to address in the weeks ahead:  
•  Outreach: How do we make sure eligible nonprofits know about and can access the application?  
•  Population: How do we define/ understand “vulnerable residents”? 
•  Duration: For how many months? What is the time period for the grant agreements? 
• 
Funding: What is the grant amount for each organization? Set amount? Maximum? 
•  Assessment: What is evaluation criteria/ rubric to evaluate successful proposals?  
•  How do we consider organizations that have already received Community Benefits funding?  
•  Application: What is the necessary information CBAC needs?  
Decisions:  
• 
•  Nonprofit organizations that already receive CBAC funds are eligible to receive this funding as well 
 
Discussion:  
•  Outreach – start now, and invite interested nonprofit organizations to get on email list  
Include language from City Council order to clarify purpose of $1m 

o 
o  Frame around CBAC values – emergency funding to be distributed as quickly and easily as possible; 

Each grant will be for $10k 

intended to be expedited, quick, simple  

•  Assessment – will not be looking at applications in a comparative way, so questions about whether an org may 

have been hit harder, incurred a greater loss of revenue, etc. are moot  

•  Application – keep as simple, open-ended as possible; include declarations/ certification from applicants that 

they are a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, meeting one or more needs from the Needs Assessment  
•  Use of funds – ordinance addresses use of funds; how much can funding be used for expenses that help 

facilitate service delivery? 

•  Duration – is expectation that grants will be expended quickly? 
•  What about entities that are not 501(c)3 nonprofit organizations that have a fiscal sponsor?
