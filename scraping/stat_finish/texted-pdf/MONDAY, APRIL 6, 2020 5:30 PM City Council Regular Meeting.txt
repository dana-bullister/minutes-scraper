To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
Based upon a review of the City of Cambridge’s (“City”) personal property accounts, I am 
proposing adoption by the City Council of a statutory small business exemption for personal 
property accounts equal to or less than $10,000.00 in assessed value, and if approved as a special 
act by the Legislature and Governor of the Commonwealth, for personal property accounts equal 
to or less than $20,000.00 in assessed value.  This recommendation is made to help small 
businesses in Cambridge for Fiscal Year 2021 going forward.  This is one part of the City’s 
effort to help small business in Cambridge through a combination of programs including small 
business initiatives, grants, workshops and tax relief, particularly with respect our effort to assist 
small businesses dealing with the ramifications of COVID-19.  
 
For smaller accounts, this proposed exemption would decrease the administrative burden upon 
small businesses and upon the City Assessing and Finance Departments. Fiscal year 2020 was 
used to analyze the proposed impact of this exemption.  At fiscal year 2020 tax rates, the 
proposed exemption would save a small business $126.80 for a $10,000.00 exemption, and 
$253.60 for a $20,000.00 tax exemption.  For fiscal year 2020, the City has 2,576 personal 
property accounts.  Of those, 62% have an assessed value of $20,000.00 or less (which 
represents just 0.54 percent of the overall personal property valuation in the City of $1.679 
billion dollars), and 49% have an assessed value of $10,000.00 or less (which represents just 
0.27 percent of the overall personal property valuation in the City of $1.679 billion dollars).   
 
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has enacted a statute which allows cities and towns which 
accept its provisions to allow for an exemption for personal property tax, not to exceed 
$10,000.00: 
 

The following property shall be exempt from taxation . . . Fifty-fourth.  Personal 
Property, if less than an amount established by the city or town, but not in excess 
of $10,000 of value.  This clause shall take effect upon its acceptance by a city or 

1.1

1.1

town, which shall establish a minimum value of personal property subject to 
taxation and may modify the minimum value by vote of its legislative body. 

 
G.L. c. 59, §5, clause 54th  (“Clause 54”). 
 
The City has not accepted Clause 54, and based upon the foregoing, I recommend that the City 
Council issue an order accepting the provisions of Clause 54, which was originally enacted 
through Chapter 159 of the Acts of 2000, and to establish the exemption for the amount of 
$10,000.00 for Fiscal Year 2021 going forward. 
 
I also recommend that the City request authority from the legislature to allow for a larger 
$20,000.00 personal property tax exemption for small businesses, for the reasons stated above.  
As such, attached is a form of vote for the City Council to adopt G.L.c.59, §5, cl.54th and a 
separate form of vote and proposed home rule petition for submission to the Legislature to allow 
the City to establish an exemption in the amount of $20,000.00 for Fiscal Year 2021 going 
forward if adopted by the Legislature. 
 

 

 

Very truly yours, 

 

Louis A. DePasquale  
City Manager

IN CITY COUNCIL 
April 6, 2020 

Small businesses in the City of Cambridge (“City”) are in need of substantial 
assistance due to the economic effects of the response to COVID-19;  
 
Payments of personal property tax is a financial and administrative burden for small 
businesses, and for smaller accounts, an administrative burden upon City departments; 
 
For fiscal year 2020, 49% of the City personal property accounts had an assessed value 
of $10,000 or less, which represents just 0.27% of the overall personal property 
valuation of the City;   
 
For a $10,000.00 personal property tax account, the proposed exemption would save a 
small business $126.80 at fiscal year 2020 rates; 
 
G.L. c. 59, § 5, Clause Fifty-Fourth allows a city to exempt personal property from 
taxation and provides as follows: 
 
The following property shall be exempt from taxation . . . Fifty-fourth.  Personal 
Property, if less than an amount established by the city or town, but not in excess of 
$10,000 of value.  This clause shall take effect upon its acceptance by a city or town, 
which shall establish a minimum value of personal property subject to taxation and 
may modify the minimum value by vote of its legislative body. 
 
A personal property tax exemption is one part of the City’s effort to assist small 
businesses in the City, and now, therefore be it  
 
That the City Council goes on record accepting the provisions of Massachusetts 
General Laws Chapter 59 §5, clause fifty fourth, which allows for an exemption for 
personal property tax not in excess of $10,000 of value; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager direct City departments to institute the full personal property 
tax exemption of $10,000 of value as soon as practicable.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation in the amount of $16,620.00 from Free Cash to the 
General Fund Human Service Programs Other Ordinary Maintenance account for the support of 
the daytime operation of the First Church in Cambridge Shelter for the duration of the COVID-
19 crisis. 
 
The City, through the Department of Human Service Programs, has agreed to fund the daytime 
operation of the First Church in Cambridge Shelter for the next 8 weeks. First Church in 
Cambridge currently provides a 14- bed overnight shelter. With these funds, First Church will be 
providing staffing for daytime shelter space that allows for appropriate social distancing for their 
14 clients who would otherwise not have a place to go during the day. Many of their shelter 
clients would utilize spaces that are now closed (coffee shops, libraries), so this is intended to 
allow those shelter clients to safely shelter during the day through this crisis. This appropriation 
reflects the critical importance for existing shelters in Cambridge to remain open and provide 
safe spaces and opportunities for social distancing for individuals that might not otherwise have 
them.

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation.

ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

The City of Cambridge has declared a Health Emergency due to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
 
On March 23, Governor Charlie Baker issued a “stay-at-home” advisory, in an effort to 
increase social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19; and 
 
Playgrounds, basketball courts, ball fields, and fitness areas have been closed to ensure 
social distancing; and 
 
It is imperative that Cambridge residents are able to safely go outside while keeping a 
distance of 6+ feet from others; and 
 
The length of time that residents will be asked to distance themselves from others is 
unknown at this time; and 
 
New York City has already implemented street closures to decrease density and reduce 
crowding in the city’s parks; and 
 
The “stay-at-home” advisory has drastically reduced car traffic in Cambridge, now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager is requested to confer with the Director of Traffic, Parking, and 
Transportation on streets in each neighborhood that could be closed to all non-essential 
traffic for the duration of the Health Emergency and report back to the council as soon 
as possible; and further be it 
 
That the City Manager will ensure that all neighborhood groups are invited to give 
suggestions and input into any recommendations for how to best select streets for 
closure.

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

The Governor has issued a Stay at Home order for the Commonwealth; and 
 
The order urges residents not to leave the home except to do essential jobs, shop for 
groceries, buy medicine, or take a walk; and 
 
It is impossible to maintain proper distance from other individuals when talking a walk 
or going for a run on narrow Cambridge sidewalks, creating an unsafe situation for 
anyone who leaves the home; and 
 
Closing Memorial Drive to vehicular traffic would create a space for residents to go for 
a walk or get some exercise while maintaining recommended social distancing 
practices; and 
 
Traffic volumes are down significantly in the City of Cambridge during the Stay at 
Home order; and 
 
As the temperature gets warmer, the demand for safe outdoor space will only continue 
to increase; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DCR to explore 
closing Memorial Drive for the duration of the Stay at Home order to give people in 
Cambridge a safe space to exercise and be outside without violating social distancing 
practices; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter as soon as possible.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

In 2017, the City Council adopted goals including “Make it easy to move safely 
through the City, especially by sustainable modes of transportation”; and 
 
The City has committed to Vision Zero, which seeks to eliminate transportation 
fatalities and serious injuries, as well as reduce crash rates across all modes of 
transportation; and 
 
There have been multiple cyclist deaths and numerous serious injuries on Cambridge 
streets in the past several years; and 
 
Promoting sustainable transportation methods can help alleviate high levels of traffic 
in the region, provide alternatives for residents who cannot afford to have a car in the 
city, and help reduce Cambridge’s carbon footprint; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached “2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance” be forwarded to the Ordinance 
Committee for discussion and recommendation.

Section 12.22.010 
 
This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.  
 
Section 12.22.020 
 
This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the 
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected 
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City. 
 
Section 12.22.030 
 
A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or 
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle 
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in 
both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.”

reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City. 
 
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of 
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction 
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion, 
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine 
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a 
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific 
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist 
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or 
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible

lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so 
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better. 
 
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a 
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

3.1.a

March	31,	2020	
	

Dear	Members	of	the	Cambridge	City	Council	and	Cambridge	Planning	Board:	
	
	
My	name	is	Victoria	Awkward,	and	I	am	the	Artistic	Director	of	VLA	DANCE,	a	dance	company	based	in	
Cambridge	and	Boston.	I	am	writing	to	share	the	ways	in	which	BioMed	Realty	has	supported	my	artistic	
work	and	to	urge	you	to	support	their	proposal	for	585	Third	Street	by	rezoning	the	land	to	allow	BioMed	
Realty	to	develop	a	much-needed	public	space	and	arts	facility.	
	
I	grew	up	in	Natick,	commuting	into	Cambridge	to	work,	take	dance	classes,	and	spend	time	with	friends.	
Since	graduating	college	and	beginning	my	professional	artistic	career,	I	have	gravitated	towards	
Cambridge	because	of	its	artistic	community	and	spaces,	including	the	Dance	Complex,	José	Mateo	Ballet	
Theatre,	Studio	@	550,	the	Multicultural	Center,	Green	Street	Studios,	and	BioMed	Realty.	However,	I	
have	also	witnessed	in	recent	years	the	closures,	full,	partial,	and	potential,	of	many	cultural	institutions.	
It	is	vital	that	Cambridge	continues	to	support	its	artistic	community.	Allowing	BioMed	Realty	to	develop	
on	585	Third	Street	would	increase	the	dwindling	space	for	artists,	especially	dancers,	to	work	in	the	city.	
VLA	DANCE	and	our	peers	in	the	dance	community	would	benefit,	and	thus	the	cultural	sector	of	
Cambridge	would	directly	benefit	as	well.		
	
I	especially	support	BioMed	Realty’s	proposal	to	develop	at	585	Third	Street	because	I	believe	it	will	be	a	
wonderful	and	important	addition	to	East	Cambridge,	a	neighborhood	which	I	called	home	last	year,	
living	on	Gore	Street.	Kendall	Square	is	developing	quickly,	and	as	biotech	companies	and	corporations	
take	foothold	there,	what	the	area	needs	desperately	is	space	for	culture	and	community.	BioMed	Realty’s	
plan	increases	green	space	and	will	provide	access	to	affordable,	diverse	and	inclusive	programming	that	
benefits	not	just	the	people	who	work	in	Kendall	Square,	but	the	residents	of	the	area	as	well.			
	
	BioMed	Realty	has	shown	that	they	are	committed	to	supporting	local	arts,	and	their	support	for	my	
company,	VLA	DANCE,	has	been	unparalleled.	Last	August,	BioMed	Realty	hosted	VLA	DANCE’s	show	
“Bare	Velvet”	at	their	campus	on	Third	Street,	providing	us	with	a	full	week	residency	and	monetary	
resources.	More	recently,	BioMed	Realty	supported	VLA	DANCE’s	GoFundMe	Campaign	with	a	matching	
donation	of	$5,000.	Their	support	has	directly	impacted	VLA	DANCE’s	ability	to	thrive	and	continue	to	
enrichen	the	cultural	scene	in	Cambridge.	
	
I	am	excited	for	this	project	because	I	have	seen	how	much	direct	community	input	has	gone	into	the	
plans.	I	believe	that	once	completed	the	space	will	be	enthusiastically	activated,	since	the	community	has	
been	involved	at	the	initial	stages.	
	
With	all	this	in	mind,	I	ask	that	you	support	BioMed	Realty	on	the	rezoning	of	585	Third	Street.	For	
further	communications,	I	am	available	at	victoria@victoriaawkward.com	or	508-315-9833.	Thank	you	
for	your	time	and	for	the	work	you	do	for	Cambridge.	
	
	
Respectfully,	
	
	
	
	
Victoria	Lynn	Awkward	
Artistic	Director	of	VLA	DANCE

Education and information are everything.  It’s disgraceful if children away from school during this uncertain time should 
be deprived of what in 2020 is a basic utility.  I have wondered about the lack of progress in Cambridge about making 
internet access available to all.  I am in support of Policy Order 4 (POR 2020 #69) by Councilors Zondervan, Nolan, and 
Sobrinho-Wheeler and Mayor Siddiqui. The order asks that "the City Manager explore short-term solutions to expand 
essential internet access to Cambridge residents who lack it during the pandemic until such time that a municipal 
broadband network can be implemented.”

Councillors and Clerk,

Please include this correspondence in the package of the next city council meeting.

Can you guide me to where the info is about the city contracts being offered to Cambridge 
businesses like mine for food preparation?

I have not received any email about the contracts, nor do I see anything posted on the license 
commission website, or in the city announcements that go out. My legal clients have also not received 
any such contract offers or information.

I have heard, however, that specific businesses that are members of the Harvard Square Business 
Association have received invitations to apply for these contracts.

Are these city contracts being offered in a fair and open process for all Cambridge businesses?

Thank you
Kim Courtney

Public comment for Council Meeting of Mar. 30, 2020

Public comment to Cambridge City Council on City Manager's Agenda Item #2 and Policy Orders #2 and #3, 
March 30, 2020

In view of the activity at the War Memorial Recreation Center and Field House on Cambridge Center today its 
use as a temporary shelter for the homeless during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency seems to be well 
under way. In view of the urgent public need for temporary shelter, I expect that this interim use is something 
most neighbors in Mid-Cambridge will accept and support if it is done right. I urge the City to inform and 
promptly engage with abutters, the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association, and the Joan Lorentz Park 
Committee to ensure that legitimate concerns about the guests in the heart of the neighborhood are promptly 
and properly addressed for the good of all.

On P.O.R.s #2 and #3, it will be great if residents of all ages can make temporary use of some side streets and 
Memorial Drive for needed socially distant recreation during the Public Health Emergency. I'm sure the Mid-
Cambridge Neighborhood Association will be glad to work with the City to identify streets in our area where 
this could work.

Please remember, though, that Joan Lorentz Park is Mid-Cambridge's main and only remaining park and 
residents will want to use it more even than in "normal" times in the weeks and months ahead. 

Thanks for your consideration,
John Pitkin, 
18 Fayette Street

Attention:   City Council and Planning Board 
 
 
RE: Support Letter for the Rezoning of 585 Third Street, Cambridge, MA, for Redevelopment by BioMed Realty 
 
Dear Cambridge Council and Planning Board, 
 
I am writing this letter today, in strong and enthusiastic support of BioMed Realty's earnest and well-rooted application 
to rezone and redevelop the long-barren 585 Third Street, Cambridge, MA, lot, into a beautiful mixed-use commercial, 
recreational, and cultural building, with a 30,000 SF arts and culture center, and a 10,000 SF indoor all-season public 
space, at its center, and over an acre of public and green space.  I am writing as the President and Executive Artistic 
Director of the 17-year-old non-profit 501(c)(3) public charitable cultural organization, Brookline Community Center for 
the Arts, Inc., (BCCA) and as an individual artist, engineer, and developer, specializing in mixed-use redevelopment 
projects. 
 
Whenever a developer makes a proposal that requires rezoning, one of the criteria should be the determination of the 
earnesty and viability of their plans, so I'd like to offer our organization's and my personal experience with BioMed 
Realty.  I fully attest to their first-rate and caring management, including but not limited to the visionary V.P. of 
Development Salvatore Zinno, and the hardworking, passionate, and skilled Community Manager Andrea Windhausen, 
with whom we've been extremely fortunate to develop a strong community partnership.  In January 2020, they awarded 
our non-profit a rent- and utilities-free licensing agreement to their 1,250 SF retail facility at 500 Kendall Street, 
Cambridge, (opposite the 585 Third Street lot), along with extensive publicity services and other logistical support, and 
recently a $5,000 cash sponsorship, to facilitate our establishment of the Cambridge Community Center for the Arts 
(CCCA - www.CCCAonline.org), in support of artists and organizations that had recently lost their space with the 
closure of Green Street Studios, and other local cultural establishments and support systems.  During challenging 
economic and social times, which have only become tougher with the recent COVID-19 crisis, BioMed has proven many 
times over, to be a trust-worthy partner, a loyal corporate sponsor, a true team player, a culturally inclusive and 
unbiased supporter of community arts programming of all types, and a first and effective responder, each time it counts. 
 
We feel extremely fortunate for BioMed's support of our cultural programming, and a big reason for our ability to 
survive through the progressing pandemic, is due to their corporate sponsorship, the many direct community 
partnership referrals and connections that they have provided us with, and their regular collaborative engagement with 
our programming.  This has allowed us to keep focusing our resources on employing artists, and continually developing 
our technological infrastructure and reach, which has proven invaluable, as we were among the first organizations to 
launch our online/virtual arts programming, to help keep artists working, and for the Cambridge, Greater Boston, and 
global online community, to benefit from the dance, martial arts, fitness, and music classes we continue to offer.  
BioMed plans to extend our facility licensing agreement through the end of this summer, while increasing our access to 
be able to offer on site programming seven days a week, during all prime-time hours of operation, and hope to be able 
to keep extending our stay, which effectively makes them our first long-term corporate sponsor, and further 
demonstrates their commitment to our organization and the community! 
 
On Thursday, February 27th, a good number of community artists, arts colleagues, and myself, had the great pleasure of 
attending BioMed's unveiling of their arts center plans for the Canal District Kendall building they had been working so 
diligently on, for the past two years.  The strong show of support by a wide range of Cambridge constituents, for 
BioMed's visionary building design was well-deserved.  As a developer and re-development consultant who has helped

develop and realize several mixed-use cultural, industrial, commercial, and residential buildings, and has deeply 
analyzed large (400K to 1.1M SF) building projects with non-profit and cultural elements at their core, financed by the 
strong economics of the for-profit residential and commercial building components, I was particularly impressed and 
inspired by BioMed's well-rooted, extremely well researched, socially- and community-minded, environmentally 
friendly, practical, and from my initial assessment, economically viable detailed building design!  From the get go, 
BioMed has engaged the community artists and arts administrators to realistically design the cultural facility portion of 
their building, in a way that would best serve the evolving needs of the community, including but not limited to their 
assessment that a 250- to 300-seat theatre and multi-use and scalable art studios, would be the best approach — From 
28 years as a professional artist, producer, and arts administrator, I can confidently say that they have hit the mark, and 
the fact that they are continuously getting council from active community leaders, and local artists and arts organization, 
in an earnest effort to develop a solid plan for the realization and management of their proposed cultural facility, speaks 
volumes of their high chances of success. 
 
I have found BioMed and its community and development representatives, to be highly transparent, forthright, and 
dependable, and willing to put their money where their mouth is, in support of arts, culture, and community.  My staff 
and I have strong confidence, and a consistently growing relationship track-record to prove BioMed's intention, that our 
non-profit organization, and many other worthy community organizations and artists, will find a permanent home in 
BioMed's proposed multi-use building, that the building will serve as the resounding and unifying center piece of the 
growing vision for Canal District Kendall, and that until the building is realized, BioMed will continue to actively support 
the arts community with action, shared real estate, and funding.  Our non-profit organization and I, wholeheartedly 
support BioMed's application for the rezoning of 585 Third Street, and encourage your council to work hand-in-hand 
with them to carefully consider, and help further develop and support their well-thought-out multi-faceted building and 
environmental plan, and to do so expeditiously, in the best interest of allowing the project to proceed at the earliest 
date — the sooner the better for the benefit of the revitalization of the Cambridge cultural landscape! 
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration, and please contact me at (617) 642-1444 or

RE: 207 Lake View Curb Cut
207_LAKEVIEW_CAMBRIDGE_04_02_20compressed.pdf; Lertter City Council.pdf

Dear Councilors,   
 
We are requesting that the attached letter and revised plans be included in the public record for Monday’s discussion 
concerning the curb cut for 207 Lake View Ave.  
 
Based on some feedback from counselors we went ahead and made two significant changes to the plans, attached 
hereto: 
1) The plans now formally call out “permeable pavers” 
2)  The driveway as been narrowed from 13’ to 12’ 
 
Additionally, we just met with our neighbors to discuss some of their concerns and are amenable to working with them 
in a neighborly fashion.  
 
Thank you,  
Maggie Currier

April 2, 2020 
 
Dear Cambridge City Councilors,  
 
We are writing to ask for your support on a driveway curb cut on Lake View Ave. I am a life-long 
resident of Cambridge, born and raised on Lexington Ave and now raising two children, ages 3.5 
and 1.5, with a baby due in August.  
 
In October we purchased the home at 207 Lake View Avenue. We were drawn to the generous 
yard which would allow space for our kids to burn off energy and an area for my husband to 
garden. We expected it would be a home to raise our family and in the long-term space for my 
mother-in-law to move in with us (a widowed, cancer survivor living alone on the North Shore).  
 
In February we drafted plans and obtained signed support from all of our neighbors, and met 
personally with our next-door neighbor who would be most affected by the driveway. They 
asked for a few changes to the plans, which we readily accepted.  
 
We’ve decided to take some additional measures to clarify our plans. We are an 
environmentally conscious family and would like to preserve as much open space as possible. 
The initial plans show a 13’ wide driveway which we have amended to 12’. In addition, the 
driveway would be made out of permeable pavers which is stated on the plans.  
 
When we purchased the home, we knew there was no driveway. Normally we are able to park 
within 5 houses of ours. However, as a 21-week, pregnant mother juggling two toddlers it’s 
really become a matter of safety to request a driveway. As you can imagine, corralling children 
while loading bags and kids into the car can be a challenge. Additionally, raising a family has 
taken its toll on me physically, especially my back, which is prone to falling out of alignment and 
rendering me bed ridden. Running after children who run into the street or could encounter a 
car backing out of the driveway is a scary situation with limited physical abilities.  
 
My mother-in-law has been coming to our home 2 days a week from Georgetown, MA to watch 
the children. This is an hour and a half commute during rush hour. She is not accustomed to city 
roads and when she can’t find parking in front of the house, she circles the block which is 
confusing and stressful for her. We would like to have parking to accommodate her needs and 
well as my own.  
 
Sean O’Grady and Ranjit of the Cambridge zoning department have signed off that this 
driveway meets Cambridge building code and zoning ordinances, from section 6.40, we are 
more than 25’ away from a street intersection, and are more than 15’ away from any crosswalk.   
 
We appreciate your help and consideration at this time.  
 
Sincerely,  
Maggie Currier & Samuel Kachmar.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The City is continuing to make determinations about what expenditures will need to be 
made to mitigate some of the worst local impacts of the economic hardships caused by 
the Covid-19 pandemic, including providing additional funding for our human services 
programs, services for the homeless, and other unforeseen expenditures; and 
 
On March 30, 2020, the City Council asked that the City Manager provide a financial 
impact summary on how these unexpected expenditures will impact the City’s budget 
and free cash reserves from April 1 to June 30, 2020; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the relevant City 
departments to give the Council a financial impact summary on how the local Covid-
19 response will be impacting the City’s free cash and ability to budget looking into 
July 1, 2021, and to report back to the City Council in a timely manner.

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY 
 
WHEREAS: 

Governor Baker has extended his orders for residents of the Commonwealth to 
continue sheltering-in-place at home until May 4, and the likelihood suggests that this 
date shall be pushed back further into May and possibly beyond; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  With a vaccine for the Covid-19 virus unlikely to become available until sometime in 
2021 at the earliest, it would appear that many large social gatherings will be delayed 
indefinitely to ensure the safety of residents in Cambridge, the Commonwealth, and 
across the country; now therefore be it 
 
That the Mayor’s Office be and hereby is urged to convene discussions with 
representatives of MIT and Harvard University to make determinations as to whether 
this year’s annual senior luncheon gatherings shall be delayed or cancelled, to 
determine whether alternative celebrations can be planned it their wake, and to report 
back to the City Council in a timely manner. 

 
ORDERED: 

In City Council April 6, 2020.
