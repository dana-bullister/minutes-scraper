          MARY FLYNN:  Good evening.  Welcome to the 

September 22, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  

My name is Mary Flynn, and I'm Vice Chair acting as Chair 

for this meeting.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge temporary 

restrictions on city public meetings, city events, and city 

permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on September 02, 

2020.  

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online 

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

          Jeff?   

          I will start by asking Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  This is Jeff 

Roberts from the Community Development Department. Just do a 

quick roll call check to see that Planning Board members are 

present, and I'll ask if the meeting is audible to you.    

          Starting with Louis Bacci, are you present and is 

the meeting audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Present, the meeting is 

audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  H Theodore Cohen,

          And Mary Flynn, you're obviously present.  Can you

          MARY FLYNN:  The first item on tonight's agenda is 

an Update from Community Development Department.  Please 

also introduce Staff present from the department who are 

present at the meeting.  I think Jeff is --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, Mary, that's back to me

          At tonight's meeting on my team is Swaathi Joseph.

Thorkildsen from our Urban Design team and Khalil Mogassabi, 

the Chief Planner and Deputy Director at Community 

Development.  I believe that's all the City Staff who are 

present at this time.   

          Just for a quick update, we are having a meeting 

tonight.  There are a few items of business; the first one 

will be postponed; we'll get to that later.   

          The -- we are currently not planning to have a 

meeting scheduled next week, we're only holding it in case 

anything gets continued.  So assuming nothing gets continued 

from tonight's meeting until next week, then next week will 

be a week off from Planning Board. 

          On October 6, we have a public hearing scheduled 

on the Cambridgeside PUD development proposal that's the 

first of a required two public hearing process for a 

Planning Unit Development.   

          On October 13, we have a public hearing scheduled.  

It's a case at 56 Creighton Street.  This is a case at the  

-- or it's a site that the Planning Board reviewed a 

development proposal for and approved, and there are some 

changes that need to be brought back for approval. 

          And October 20, we have a public hearing scheduled 

8

on a development proposal at 325 Binney Street -- that’s the 

former Metropolitan Pipe site.  We do expect we will have 

meetings just about every week, except we will not be 

meeting November 3, because that is the day of the election.   

          And we have several items that have been coming 

our way that we still need to work out the schedule for. 

          At this time, I also -- I know I mentioned that 

there were several zoning petitions that have been under 

review by the Planning Board, and I mentioned if there was a 

scheduling of Ordinance meetings, I've not received any 

Ordinance Committee hearing schedules at this point, but 

I'll update the Board when I do. I'll just end my update 

there, thank you.       

                          * * * * *

                  Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, and Nikolas  

                  Bowie 

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you, Jeff.  The next 

item is approval of meeting minutes.  The Board has received 

a certified transcript for the meeting held on August 25, 

2020.  If there are any questions from Board Members, please

say your name and ask your question now.     

          [Pause]        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, hearing none, is there a motion 

to accept the transcripts as the meeting minutes?  And when 

making a motion remember to say your name, please?

                  Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, and Nikolas  

                  Bowie 

          MARY FLYNN:  Very good.  Thank you.  Okay.  The 

next item on the agenda is a public hearing on a zoning 

petition by Francis E. Donovan to amend Article 4 Use 

Regulations and Article 5 for the stated purpose of 

increasing affordable housing.  CDD Staff will begin by 

giving an update, and I'll turn it back to Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  So this is a 

little bit of a funny status on this one.  It was noted on 

the agenda for the meeting if you've seen it that this item 

will be rescheduled.  That is because the petition was 

referred by the City Council back in July, and we received 

word that because of the timing requirements for holding a 

public hearing and providing notice for that hearing, and 

that the Ordinance Committee has not scheduled a meeting 

within the statutory time frame, this petition will not be 

able to be acted on by the City Council unless it's refiled.

          We reached out to the petitioner's group to inform 

them of this, and they requested that we not go ahead with 

this hearing until they're able to refile the petition.  At 

that point, another hearing would be scheduled, which may 

occur either before or after this version of the petition 

expires. 

          But since this won't be acted on, and it was 

requested that this be postponed until it gets refiled, our 

suggestion is that the Board continue this hearing to a date 

that will be determined.  That will just kind of leave it 

open, and then when it does get refiled, then we will 

schedule a hearing at that point.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thanks, Jeff.  Are there any 

questions from Board members?  No.  I don't see anyone 

asking.  Okay.  Is there a motion then, to continue this 

hearing to a date to be determined?  Remember to say your 

name when making the motion.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Ted Cohen, move to continue to 

a date to be determined.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Ted.  Second, anyone?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis Bacci, second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Lou?  Lou is the second.  Okay.  Roll

          CDD Staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us, and I will turn it over to Erik Thorkildsen to 

begin that explanation.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Hello.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  

Yes, the -- the Parcel U Project at Cambridge Crossing is 

before us tonight, and I think the applicant has a 

presentation that we can go through.  I think we should just 

leave it to them to go ahead.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  If I could just -- for Erik 

Thorkildsen just to point out the procedural item, which is 

that this is part of a Planning Unit Development special 

permit, so received its special permit originally back in 

2003.  It's been around a long time.  It's been amended many 

times.   

          The development is currently in process, and as a 

part of the conditions of the special permit, each 

individual building as part of this master plan comes before 

the Planning Board for Design Review approval.   

          And that's approval by a majority vote of the 

Planning Board members who are present.  They have to get 

that approval before they can proceed to get a building 

permit.  So that's the process tonight.

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you, gentleman, 

appreciate that.  Presenting the permitee tonight is Mr. 

Mark Johnson from Divco West, and I will turn it over to him 

to introduce the design presentation.   

          Please introduce yourself and anyone else on your 

team who will be speaking.  Your presentation should be no 

longer than 30 minutes, unless the Board grants additional 

time, but we'd ask you to be as concise as possible.  So 

thank you, and take it away Mr. Johnson. 

          MARK JOHNSON:  Very good, thank you.  My name is 

Mark Johnson.  I'm Director of Development for Divco West, 

and with me here tonight are Anthony Galluccio and Darren 

Barret (phonetic) from our Legal team, Peter Shubert of NEA 

Architects, Chris Matthews of Michael Van Valkenburgh, 

Landscape Architects, and other members of the project team. 

          I want to begin by thanking the Board for working 

during this unprecedented time and for hearing our request 

this evening. 

          We're here to ask for Design Review approval for 

Parcel U, including approval of an intentional deviation 

from the Design Guidelines, which we'll describe to you 

shortly.  As you may recall, this parcel received Master

Plan approval for the overall planning, massing and square 

footage in July, 2016.   

          Parcel U design has a number of public benefits, 

including a new elevator connector from the Gilmore Bridge 

to the Common, which is dependent on a separate state 

approval process which is currently underway. 

          Between May and August, we had five meetings with 

City Staff and responded to over 70 comments.  I would like 

to thank the City Staff for their input and the design is 

much better because of it. 

          We held a community meeting last week with over 

100 attendees via Zoom, and we presented the Parcel U design 

and it was very well received by the community.  Now I want 

to give you a brief update on Cambridge Crossing.   

          Next, please?   

          Divco West has been providing COVID relief to the 

community.  We donated billboard space to support COVID 

Relief Fund fundraising from the Mayor's COVID Relief Fund, 

and incidentally, this billboard is located on Parcel U, so 

the project is going to mean one less billboard in 

Cambridge.  Divco West also donated $50,000 to the Mayor's 

COVID Relief Fund, and additional money to help create the 

Starlight Square in Central Square. 

          While making these new commitments, Divco West has 

continued its ongoing support of Cambridge organizations 

16

during the pandemic.   

          Next, please? 

          The pandemic has also led us to think of new and 

creative ways to activate Cambridge Crossing.  We've 

migrated our site activation program online.  All events 

continue to be free and open to the public.  We hold artist 

talks, virtual fitness classes, music by local bands and 

cooking demonstrations by local chefs.  We're doing all we 

can to bring people together in this unprecedented time. 

          Next, please?   

          The Common is open.  The photo on the right is a 

Will Gilson, a Puritan, opening a new restaurant on Parcel 

We supported Will as he opened the outdoor restaurant 

pictured in this slide.  This is in keeping with our 

approach to open space, an active, popular destination and 

open to the public. 

          Planning member Espinoza has asked that we be 

mindful of the potential for over policing, and she's asked 

us to think about ways to make open space welcoming to

people of color.  And we want you to know that we've heard 

that, and we know how important it is to send a message that 

the park is open to the public.   

          Next, please?   

          Divco West is also supporting social justice and 

equity.  We donated $25,000 to My Brother's Keeper summer 

program, attended by over 50 Cambridge teams.  My Brother's 

Keeper focuses on life skills and empowerment. Mark 

Roopenian of Divco West was a guest speaker, and our 

attorney, Anthony Galluccio, was an organizer and 

instructor.  We were very glad to be a part of this really 

important program. 

          Corporately, Divco West also donated a total of 

$100,000 to the NAACP Legal Expense Fund and the Three 

Strikes Project.   

          Next, please?   

          In 2019, Divco West worked with the city to rename 

city streets in honor of Cambridge Women of Color Harriet 

Jacobs and Gertrude Morgan.  Parcel Urine, we're proud to 

say, will be the first building to have a Morgan Avenue 

address. 

          Last year, we held a dedication event, and we were

          Next, please?   

          In 2021, we'll open a bicycle center that will 

provide repair, shower and lockup facilities to the public, 

as well as the ability to hold bike repair workshops and 

other public events.  And we will be naming it the, "K.D.  

                                               th

Knox (phonetic) Cycle Center" in honor of a 19 -century 

bicycling advocate, a woman of color who lived in Cambridge.   

          Next, please?   

          Cambridge's construction is underway on the 

projects that the Board has approved.  We have collaborated 

with our contractors and with the city to work safely during 

the pandemic.  The large foundation in the foreground of 

this photo was Parcel I Residential, which is under 

construction.   

          This building will house 486 dwelling units and 

ground-floor retail.  The apartment building will look out 

over a gently sloped lawn for outdoor events, concerts and 

movies. 

          On the right, you can see the Green Line Extension

and the new Lechmere Station under construction.  We're 

building a public plaza between the new station and the Q1 

building.   

          The retail core of Cambridge Crossing is located 

on North First Street.  And the Q1 building on the right, 

the shed retail building next to the Common, and Parcel JK.  

          On the left, you can also see Parcels E, F, G and 

H all under construction. 

          In addition, we have completed off-site mitigation 

projects.  The first phase of the Monsignor O'Brien Highway 

reconstruction included new cycle tracks, pedestrian 

crosswalks and landscaping that will transform the highway 

to a tree-lined boulevard.  The next phase is under 

construction now. 

          We've also completed the Gore Street Sewer Project 

and storm drainage improvements near Binney Street.   

          Next, please?   

          And with that I'd like to turn it over to Peter 

Schubert of Ennead Architects.   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  Greetings, everyone.  This is a 

map of the site of the surrounding area, and as you probably 

know, and as you probably know, Parcel U is in red on the 

20

southeast corner of the site of the park.   

          Next, please?        

          THE REPORTER:  Could you state your name for the 

record, please?   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  Ah, Peter Schubert, yes -- Ennead 

Architects.  What you're looking at is the two major façades 

of the building.  On the left is the park view, which 

undulates across the façade and really aligns with the 

various setbacks on the park, and on the right is a civic 

façade.  And this façade is basically southeast, southwest 

back towards the city and feathers into the surrounding 

urban area.   

          Next, please?   

          As we look at this façade -- as I said, it's 

comprised of a series of setbacks.  As you go across the 

façade, you'll see a series of terraces.  These terraces are 

occupiable.  There is sort of a fanning undulation to give 

life and meaning to this sort of -- as of the façade.   

          One deviation we'll discuss tonight is on the far 

left, which is going to be a deviation from the guidelines 

that we know.  Next, please? 

          The façade itself is comprised of a series of very

rich -- we believe -- two materials; a highly transparent 

glass, a fritting alongside that vertical lawn, which is 

actually a TerraPod of Thin.   

          Next, please?  In your supplements you'll see some 

of these materials which really depict the various 

coloration that we're thinking about.   

          Next, please?   

          On the southern façades, you can see that there's 

a series of setbacks as well.  They reflect the setbacks 

from the southern -- I'm sorry, the north façade along the 

park.  There's a kind of sculpture quality to the piers of 

this façade, as well as a window that basically is a nod 

back to downtown Boston.   

          Next, please?   

          These façades have a sort of a horizon striation 

to them at various points.  They're about 16 to 14 inches 

off the face of the glass.  The piers themselves --  

          Next, please?   

          -- the piers themselves will be also a coloration 

that matches the terra cotta fence from the north façade, 

and there will also be some eyeletted coloration of the two 

lower parts of the building on the upper right.  These are

also in your supplement.  Thank you.   

          Next, please?   

          Across the façade along the park, you'll see a 

very transparent façade that basically comes from the west, 

greets you with a very transparent façade as you walk along, 

sort of a park-like environment, and then you get to a 

portal that’s at the appropriate size to the park.  

          Next, please?   

          The materials of this are also the terra cotta 

Thins above -- a brow that is also metal and wood.  And then 

below that will be Low E glass.  I'm sorry, iron-free glass.   

          Next, please?   

          Here are the materials again -- a series of metal 

metallic colors on the upper right, punctuating the edges of 

thin.  Underbelly would be a kind of a wood and then there's 

some stone that is actually along the base of the building 

that continues into the lobby.   

          Next, please?   

          Here you start to see again the sort of building 

in terms of its sculptural qualities.  The fans give it a 

kind of a texture that I think will be -- really play with 

the light in a very nice way.  The deviation I was talking 

23

about earlier is on the far left there, and that is really I 

think facilitates a number of very nice urban moves. 

          As you can see and you Zoom in on it, there's two 

entrances that you can see on the top of the Gilmore Bridge, 

and then another entrance that comes out on the bottom of 

the park.   

          Next, please?   

          As you can see, then, as you emerge from that 

elevator or that park elevator that connects to the park, 

there's also another canopy that brings you out onto the 

Square itself.   

          Next, please?   

          Now here is I think a great shot that lets you 

kind of hone in on that deviation, is that this is what 

would be -- if we were behind the setback lines.  So this 

depicts the massing of the building without the deviation. 

          Next, please?   

          What we like about bringing it forward, then, is 

that it really emphasizes that entrance from the -- to the 

garage.  That is also the entrance to the Gilmore Bridge 

access.  It is also access to the Bike Room.   

          Mark will go over -- I'm sorry, Chris will go over

all of the various landscape elements of this, but I think 

that this massing coming forward really helps give a sort of 

backboard to the sort of park experience.  It also helps 

24

guide you under the bridge. 

          Next, please?   

          From Glassworks now, you can start to see how the 

building is a civic façade.  And that façade starts to play 

with the setbacks that you can see along the north side of 

the park.  There's also two colorations to the façade as it 

appears itself.  So in this way, we're able to break down 

the civic façade into a number of parts that really blend in 

with the surrounding fabric.  

          Next, please?   

          As one hones in on that view, then you can start 

to see the loading dock.  The loading dock enjoys also a 

similar palate as the rest of the building.  There's a kind 

of coloration to the metal that surrounds it.  It's very 

much like Corten steel.   

          The lighting has been artfully, we believe, 

thought through in the sense that those down lights by day 

illuminate that area.  They also start to suggest the 

continuation of a ceiling plan that goes into the garage, so

there will be a very nice inside/outside feeling about it. 

          Additionally, two of those garage doors are 

partially glass, so that there will be some activity, some 

light, and we think it's a very -- if I could say so myself, 

it's one of the more elaborate loading docks I've ever done.   

          Next, please?   

          And then from the façade of the bridge, or -- I'm 

sorry, from the bridge one can see the building in this 

downtown, and it's very much in alignment with the rest of 

the buildings in Cambridge.  However, we know that color is 

one of the things that we've been looking forward to in this 

area, and we think the terracotta element of the building 

will also speak to some of the historic colors in Boston.   

          Next, please?   

          As one moves across the façade, you can start to 

see where all the clear glass is, and you can see that 

there's a lot of activity coming from the left.  You move 

across an office area into the lobby area in blue, and then 

on the upper right there's also -- you can see where the 

plan of the entrance to the garage elevator is, to the 

Gilmore elevator, as well as to the Bike Room itself. 

          Next, please?   

26

          A typical floor plan that really speaks to what 

we're all about here, which is very flexible spaces that 

would be fitted out by each tenant. 

          Next, please?   

          And then here we're looking at the resiliency 

analysis.  And this is the flood-plain that is for year 

2070, to give you a 24-foot lot.   

          Next, please?  And then here are the wind analyses 

of the building.  This one is within its current condition.  

As you can see, it's fairly benign, but there is --  

          Next, please?   

          -- some improvement along the front of the 

building, particularly around the entrance relative to wind.  

And then there is perhaps a step backward on the upper left.   

          Next, please?   

          This is actually what also exists on the site, a 

little windier during the winter.   

          Next, please?   

          And then during the winter then it is much 

improved, particularly along the pedestrian corridor along 

Morgan Avenue.   

          Next, please?

          And last, the sun studies.  Here you can start to 

see the existing conditions without the building.   

          Next, please?  And then as you can see, there is a 

little bit of blue there that really suggests -- illustrates 

where the shadows will be, and as you can see it's pretty 

good, being that the building is in the southeast part of 

the park, where we aren't really going to throw too much 

shadow there.   

          Chris, I leave it to you.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Thanks, Peter.  Chris Matthews 

with Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, Landscape 

Architects.  So this building, apart from finishing up the 

streetscape along the southern edge of the park, which we're 

excited about, also provides us with an opportunity to add 

an extra public access point between the Gilmore Bridge and 

the Cambridge Crossing neighborhood, so to make a total of 

two elevator connections and two stair connections.   

          One of the stairs and elevators are the Brian 

Murphy stairs in Building H, the northeast corner of the 

neighborhood, which will be the first point of exit for 

people walking across the bridge from Charlestown in the 

Community College Station.

          And then we're proposing to add the elevator at 

Parcel U to be paired up with the existing stair further to 

the south, in the Archstone property.   

          Next slide, please? 

          So when we look at the landscape of Parcel U, the 

building addresses four quite different conditions on each 

of its sides.  As I mentioned, on the north side of the 

building, we have the opportunity to complete the 

streetscape along the south side of the park with street 

trees against the curb line, consistent with the rest of the 

Cambridge Crossing neighborhood and the public sidewalk, and 

then a series of small gathering spaces either side of the 

main lobby entrance -- separates it by plant beds.   

          There will be places to sit and relax to meet 

people to park your bike.  And then, quite excitingly, a 

couple of the spaces are going to have outdoor musical 

instruments to provide some sort of fun activity on the 

sidewalk -- there's something for kids, something for 

passers-by, and hopefully for the building users too.   

          The Leighton street façade on the west side is the 

shortest of the façades.  Peter spoke a little bit about the 

loading dock and garage access, and we've got landscape

treatments both on the corners of Leighton and Morgan, and 

the corner of Leighton and the Avalon property to the south 

for the screened views to those doors, as well as vine 

structures that extend in front of those loading docks, 

which I can talk about in a little bit more detail later. 

          On the south side of the building, we have a 

service building owned by the Avalon Lofts, and we've been 

able to plant a row of shade trees along the south side of 

the building to soften up that driveway façade of the 

building.   

          But we really think that this is an area where the 

general public are not invited to come down.  It will be for 

emergency access and maintenance.  And we have a small gate 

on Leighton Street to discourage people from coming down 

that south side of the building. 

          On the east side too, we see this as a private 

space.  It's the maintenance easement for the Gilmore 

Bridge, as well as an access driveway too for Eversource, to 

get to the electrical gear of the southeast corner of the 

building.   

          And again, we've got another gaze at the northeast 

corner to prevent the public from coming down that side of 

30

the building. 

          You'll just see very quickly on this the Bike Room 

is at the northeast corner of the building, and that's 

associated with this kind of new connection to the Gilmore 

Bridge and the elevator.   

          Next slide, please? 

          So zooming in on that corner, the right-hand plan 

on this slide shows the upper level connection at the 

Gilmore Bridge, sort of widened threshold for the elevator, 

which is actually cantilevered off the building itself, 

where we're not allowed to structurally bear upon the 

bridge.  But the connection between the sidewalk of the 

bridge and that threshold will be seamless. 

          So you enter the elevator, go downstairs, and the 

left-hand plan shows the ground floor configuration.  You 

come out of the elevators straight onto the sidewalk of 

Morgan Avenue, and you're close to the Bike Room access and 

the garage access right there.   

          There are things like public amenities like a 

bottle fill station.  We've got the security on the upper 

level, as well as wayfinding for people entering the 

neighborhood from the bridge.

          Next slide, please?   

          This is a view of that, taken on the existing 

sidewalk of the Gilmore Bridge looking down Morgan Avenue.  

You can see the canopy of the upper levels sort of inviting 

you into the elevator, and there's another canopy down 

below.   

          So it's nice and visible with clear signage.  And 

we've wrapped the vine structures from Morgan Avenue up onto 

the bridge level at this point to provide a sort of 

continuity between the upper and lower levels.   

          Next slide, please? 

          Now we're down on the Morgan Avenue sidewalk 

looking towards the Gilmore Bridge, and this shows the small 

gathering spaces with the planted elements.  So these 

outdoor xylophone and grand piano in this case can stay 

outdoors year round.   

          We did have a comment from the public last week 

about noise nuisance at night.  So we've committed to 

putting the ballots away in the evening and locking the 

piano lid in the evening.  So it'll only be used during 

daylight. 

          And you can see the row of street trees on the

left-hand side, with parking in front of the building and 

drop-off space.   

          Next slide, please?  So now we're standing in the 

Common looking down Leighton Street.  And we're looking at 

northeast -- northwest corner of the building.   

          And this is to show a combination of landscape 

elements off in the corner of the building and help screen 

views towards the loading dock and the parking garage -- a 

combination of street trees, some evergreen trees, which 

also help with wind mitigation and the vine structures. 

          Next slide, please?   

          The lighting we're following the Cambridge 

guidelines.  We're in keeping with the rest of the 

neighborhood using the historic street poles as well as a 

couple of height poles with aimable spots either side of the 

main lobby, which will illuminate those little gathering 

spaces with the instruments and the seating areas, to 

provide a little bit of extra sparkle at night.   

          Our material selection for paving materials, site 

furniture, lighting, and -- it is consistent with the rest 

of the Cambridge Crossing neighborhood, and the bottom 

images there show the three elements that we're hoping to 

33

include; the tubular chime xylophone and an outdoor grand 

piano.   

          Next slide, please?   

          The street trees selection is consistent with both 

the City of Cambridge Open Forest Master Plan and the rest 

of the Cambridge Crossing neighborhood.  We're using a 

variety of trees to provide seasonal interest, as well as to 

mitigate any risk from climate change.  We're trying to 

maximize the diversity of the plantings at Cambridge 

Crossing.   

          Next slide, please? 

          And below that, also a diverse layer of shrubs and 

ground cover.  The two central images in the bottom row are 

wisteria, which is a self-twining vine.  We're proposing 

mixing both Japanese and Chinese wisteria -- again, for the 

benefits of diversity, and all the plants are selected for 

their habitat value and/or seasonal interest.   

          Next slide, please?       

          MARK JOHNSON:  And we'd like to please show the 

Planning Board the model -- the Cambridge Crossing models.  

We ask that Erik Hollenberg's camera be turned on, please?   

          ERIC HOLLENBERG:  Is it on now?

          ERIC HOLLENBERG:  This is Eric Hollenberg with 

Jacobs.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Great.  And then if we could please 

share Jeffrey Hugh's (phonetic) screen, we'd like to show -- 

we have a brief presentation responding to the Staff memo 

that we received. 

          Great.  So we wanted to thank Staff for reviewing 

the project and working with us, and we've recorded their 

comments -- the most recent round of comments in this 

presentation.  I'd like to just review it very briefly.   

          Next, please?   

          So asked if we could adjust this index for solar 

orientation.  Right now, the Thins are at the maximum we can 

support with this wall system at 14 inches in depth.  We can 

make them shallower, but we would prefer to keep them at 

full length.  And the Thins right now are oriented both for 

views and for solo orientation. 

          The memo asked a question about whether the roof 

step backs are occupiable -- and yes, all the balconies on

the northeast to northwest façade are occupiable and will be 

available to tenants. 

          The north façade, there was a question around the 

north façade, and whether it aligned with the north façade 

of building T -- the Tango Building.  And that the setbacks 

are approximately the same.   

          This slide shows six inches' difference.  There's 

another way to measure it, which we think is about a two-

foot difference.  But they're very, very close, and I can 

speak more about that later, if the Board wishes. 

          The setbacks of the Parcel U design do comply with 

the Design Guidelines, except for the one corner, the 

northeast corner that we've noted.   

          Next, please?   

          Questions about the Morgan Avenue landscaping and 

the planting beds that are there, the strategy, as Chris 

outlined, for the Morgan Avenue landscaping is for the 

street trees to provide the continuity and structure.  And 

those are outboard of the sidewalk.   

          Inboard of the sidewalk, the vine structures 

provide interest and frame the sidewalk.  And the planting 

beds are there to support the vine structures and punctuate

the program areas. 

          This diagram here shows the vine structures.  

There are steel poles, on which grows the wisteria that 

Chris described.   

          Next, please?   

          The memo asks for moveable furniture and benches 

with backs.  And we are pleased to commit to installing 

benches with backs and providing moveable further. 

          The memo noted that the lighting should comply 

with the draft ordinance and it does, and an error in our 

submission had an in-grade uplight, which is actually not 

being used in this project, so that can be disregarded, and 

there is no in-grade uplighting.   

          Next, please?   

          The memo had a very helpful suggestion around the 

orientation of the sidewalk and of the crosswalk at the 

eastern corner of the building, and we can go through this 

at greater length if desired, but starting with the 

crosswalk, the submitted design is on the left.  The now 

revised design is on the right.  The crosswalk is angled 

now, so that it more directly leads one to the public 

elevator entrance. 

37

          And the sidewalk, which is traveling from the 

lower left to the upper right, is now angled slightly such 

that it meets the sidewalk underneath the bridge.  And we 

can go through this in greater detail if it's of interest, 

but we think this is a very good suggestion, and we're glad 

to adopt it.   

          Next, please?   

          The memo also suggested investigating artwork 

under the MassDOT bridge, under the Gilmore Bridge.  We do 

think this is a fruitful idea that we'd like to pursue.   

          We would ask, though, that since we don't own this 

plan, and it's different from the bridge in that we can't 

cantilever it in essence over to the -- over MassDOT land -- 

we'd ask that this be handled separately and not become a 

condition of approval for the Parcel U. Design.  But we 

think this is worth pursuing it, and we would like to do so 

separately.   

          Next, please?   

          There was a question in the memo about the 

bollards at the entrance to the connector to the Gilmore 

Bridge.  And if the Board wishes, we can go into the detail 

on this, but the bollards are very required for ADA

compliance having to do with the camber of the bridge and 

the cross slope.  But we can assure the Board that the 

bollards are required for ADA compliance.   

          Next, please?   

          The memo questioned the need for the recess on 

Leighton Street.  And I wanted to assure the Board that 

we've minimized the recess as much as possible.  The drivers 

of that are having enough space outside of the doors for a 

car to queue and not block the sidewalk, and also, have 

enough space such that the turning motion can occur as much 

as possible on the site, rather than in the road. 

          And then there was a discussion of the curb cut, 

and some very helpful suggestions, which we're very glad to 

adopt.  Rather than express this as one long curb cut, we're 

instead going to introduce some intermediate curb cuts to 

break up the length of it.   

          And the sketch on the right shows the revised 

proposal that will comply with all the Cambridge regulations 

around curb cuts -- their width, the distance from the 

intersection, the curb cut.   

          And so, we're very pleased to make that 

improvement to the design and have it be reflected in our

proposal.   

          Next, please?   

          The memo noted that we are building the 

underground parking garage to a 0.9 per thousand parking 

ratio, and that will be the ratio if the building is used as 

office.   

          And as part of this presentation, if the building 

is used as research and development or lab use, we commit to 

blocking off spaces such that we would not have any more 

than the 0.8 per thousand allowed under zoning. 

          There was discussion request for dimensions of the 

short-term bicycle parking, and we had provided those 

dimensions to Staff and we're glad to include it here in 

this presentation as well.   

          Next, please?   

          There were comments in the Staff memo about the 

Bike Room, and we've made a number of subtle improvements 

based on the recommendations of the memo, which we agree 

will make it more -- make it improved and better for bikers.   

          We've increased the Bike Room door with -- we 

already had the push button automation to that door.  We've 

increased the ramp width, and we've reduced the slope of the

ramp below 8 percent.   

          Unfortunately, we cannot bring the ramp closer to 

the exterior door, because we do not wish the violate the 

minimum dimension of a walk-off mat stipulated in the LEED 

requirement that we're trying to attain.   

          Next, please?   

          The Staff comments had a number of ongoing review 

items, which I'll just review briefly.  We will provide 

staff with a detailed planting plan for ongoing review.  We 

have provided transparency and reflectivity information in 

the submission materials, and this building will be more 

transparent and less reflective than what the Board approved 

for Parcels G and H. 

          On the review of the mechanicals and the parking 

exhaust, all mechanicals are screened.  We've set the tops 

of the screen at the top of the highest elevation of the 

mechanical equipment.  So it's fully screened from all 

places on a grade. 

          So the parking exhaust, we've placed that near the 

loading docks facing away from Morgan Avenue.  The review of 

the exterior materials, colors and details are all in the 

submission materials, as Peter mentioned, and we are

planning on reviewing a mockup with City Staff.   

          Next, please?   

          For the LEED process and energy performance, we've 

submitted those materials under the separate Article 22 

process, and the project is targeting LEED goals.  

Pedestrian wind conditions are included in the submission 

materials, and as Peter mentioned, in all but a couple of 

locations, it greatly improves wind conditions. 

          The landscape design is in the submission 

materials.  The building, including the Gilmore Bridge 

connection, are fully ADA compliant.   

          Next, please?   

          All the city standards have been met with the bike 

racks, the loading, parking, sidewalk details and with the 

now revised design, thanks to the city's comments, also with 

the Leighton Street curb cuts, and we will be glad to have 

ongoing Staff review of the Earhart Park raised crossing, 

which we're pleased to propose as part of this project.   

          And I believe that is it.  That concludes our 

presentation, and we're pleased to receive questions.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you very much.  That was a very 

thoughtful and great overview of the project.

          Generally while we've been doing the meetings, we 

have gone next to public comment and hold the Board 

questions and comments until after that.  So today is not a 

public hearing, but there are members of the public 

watching, and I believe there are at least a couple who are 

interested in giving comment.   

          So if there are any other members of the public 

who wish to speak, now is the time to click the button that 

says, "Raise hand."  If you are calling in by phone, you can 

raise your hand by pressing *9.   

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board has received 

any written communications from Jeffrey Silveira and Kristin 

Johnson (phonetic).  Written communications received after 

5:00 p.m. yesterday will be entered into the record.   

          So I'll now ask Jeff if he could unmute speakers 

one at a time.  The speakers should begin by saying your 

name and address, and Staff will confirm that we can hear 

you.  After that, you have three minutes -- up to three 

minutes to speak before I ask you to wrap up. 

          Jeff?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thanks, Mary.  This is Jeff 

Roberts with Community Development again.  Just I apologize

in advance for mispronouncing anyone's name but I will read 

the names in the order the hands are up, and you can unmute 

yourself and begin speaking.   

          Always begin by giving your name and address, and 

if you were name doesn't appear on the screen, please spell 

it.  [If it's not -- if it doesn't appear in its correct 

spelling, please spell it for us as well.]  

          So the first speaker is Martin Burra (phonetic).  

Please unmute yourself, and you can start by giving your 

name and address, and then proceed with your comments.   

          MARTIN BURRA:  No, I fully apologize.  I was not 

intended to speak at this meeting.  I was just here, and I'm 

sure I did something wrong with my Zoom.  I apologize to all 

the members and the presenters.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  That's no problem.  We will 

just do that.  The next speaker is Kanan Alhasani.  Could 

you please give your name and address?   

          KANAN ALHASANI:  Yes.  This is -- can you hear me, 

Jeff?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.     

          KANAN ALHASANI:  Yes, this is Kanan Alhasani, 65 

East India Road in Boston.  I'm interested to hear from Mark

Johnson regarding the future parking at the new building in 

the U lot, since currently the lot is used as a parking spot 

for a lot of the tenants and owners of Earhart and Sierra.  

          Are you planning to negotiate with them to down 

the road to have them park in the same place, but this time 

in the garage of the new building?       

          MARY FLYNN:  So let's hold that questions for when 

we get to the Planning Board questions and comments.  And 

Mr. Johnson you can address it at that time.  Right now 

we're just going to do comment from the public.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Okay.  Thank you, Mary.          

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  I assume that concludes the 

comments.  And the next speaker is Heather Hoffman.  You can 

begin with your name and address, please?   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hi.  Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley 

Street.  I was unable to attend the public meeting because 

it was scheduled opposite the Cambridge Redevelopment 

Authority talking about my neighborhood.  So I went to the 

CRA instead. 

          So this is the first I have seen of this.  And I 

have a few things that I probably would have asked as 

questions, had I been able to go to the presentation

earlier.   

          My first one has to do with the elevator.  I hope 

that it will be very conspicuously public, so that it will 

actually get used.   

          I want to say, thank you tons for putting up 

wayfinding.  That ought to be the standard for any of these 

bigger developments.  And I hope that you will make it very 

noticeable and very detailed, and that it will keep up with 

changes. 

          And with respect to the balconies, I'm glad to 

hear that you plan to make them usable, rather than just 

ornamental.  And I hope that you will do a better job than 

Zinc did, since I was told by a resident there that they 

can't use any of their balconies because they don't comply 

          So I was also happy to hear you discussing ADA 

requirements, and I hope that that will apply to everything 

with the ADA.   

you do. 

          With respect to the musical instruments, I agree 

people tend to get really annoyed -- and it's too bad, 

because I like them.  I don't know how I'd feel if I lived 

close to one, but I'm glad that you're thinking about that.

          And then with respect to light, I'm glad to hear 

there won't be uplighting, but I want a commitment that this 

will not be a lantern; that you will not have, "Cool, look 

at me" lighting up high on the building, and that you will 

generally try to be a good neighbor.   

          You've made a huge investment in plants and things 

like that.  And they need dark sometimes.  The animals that 

I hope live there -- you know, birds and such -- they also 

need dark sometimes.  So I hope that it's not just that 

you'll have the shades, but you will not do anything that 

makes unnecessary light just to make people look at you. 

          And I also hope that you will commit to not going 

for any variances for signage.  As the Planning Board knows, 

several of us are really, really tired of dealing with that.  

And so I hope that you will not make us have to.  Thank you.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So that is the last speaker that's 

had a raised hand.  I'll give folks a last call, if there's 

anybody in attendance that hasn't spoken yet wishes to make 

comments, please push the button that says, "Raise hand."  

It should be right there on the bottom or somewhere on your 

screen on Zoom. 

          If you're connected by phone, you can press *9 on

your phone.     

          [Pause] So I gave folks a little time.  It seems 

like that's the extent of the attendees that wish to speak.  

I'll turn it back over to you, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you Jeff.  So now we're 

going to move onto Board member questions, and let's start -

- Mr. Johnson, if you would care to address the question 

that Mr. Alhasani raised about the parking management in the 

area, we can start with that, and then we'll go to Board 

members.     

          KANAN ALHASANI:  Yes, I'd be glad to address it.  

So as the Board may recall, Parcel U is part of the 

Cambridge Crossing special permit.  It is also subject to a 

parking agreement between the developer and the Sierra & 

Tango Condominium Association.  And that agreement was 

entered into at the same time roughly that the Condominium 

Association was formed.  

          And it was always imagined that that lot of Parcel 

U would be a temporary lot.  And that agreement stipulates 

that Divco West now as the developer for furnishing parking 

spaces to the Sierra & Tango Condominium Association to 

replace those spaces.   

48

19

20

21

22

          So Mr. Alhasani asked about the relocation.  Divco 

West is obligated under that agreement to provide 

replacement parking.  And we can do that in a number of 

ways, all within Cambridge Crossing.   

          The Board may recall that the parking garage in 

Parcel H was increased in size to accommodate those spaces, 

and we also may search for interim locations within 

Cambridge Crossing if needed before Parcel H construction is 

completed. 

          So that's the situation.  So there won't be any 

negotiation.  It's all according to the already stipulated 

and agreed to agreement between the developer and the 

Association.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Thank you very much.  

That was very helpful.  Board members, are there any 

questions for the development team?   

          If you could either raise your hand on the using 

the Raise hand button, or you can try raising your hand and 

letting me see you on the screen but right at the moment -- 

oh, there you are.  I guess I do have you all together.  So 

yes, if anybody -- any questions?   

          No.  Okay.  Well, I have -- I'm just curious about

the building façade facing the Avalon apartments, 

particularly the loft building.  That building's been there 

a long time.  And, you know, it's used to seeing wide open 

spaces, and now it's getting closed in on a variety of 

sides.   

          So I'm just curious as to what the treatment is 

along that side, and if any thought has been given to 

designing it in a way that makes it more visually appealing, 

or as visually appealing as possible to the residents?    

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yes.  Happy to address it, and if 

we can also have the landscape architect Chris or the 

architects here address it.  But we did spend a lot of time 

thinking about the experience for the people in the Avalon 

lofts.   

          As Chris mentioned in his presentation, we've 

included a planting bed with a row of trees and lawn.  We've 

talked with Staff about an ornamental wire mesh that would 

receive plantings as well along that line, and we think it's 

going to be a dramatic improvement over kind of what exists 

there today in terms of a view out the window. 

          The façade is obviously richly textured, and it's 

-- we've held it off the back property line as well, a total

of 55 feet between buildings.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  There's other details I'm happy to 

have Chris Matthews talk about landscape or Peter Schubert 

talk about the architecture.       

          MARY FLYNN:  No, that's fine.  The -- just knowing 

a little bit more about the landscaping is very helpful.  

And I didn't realize it was as much as 55 feet.  I thought 

it was a narrower pathway. 

          Picking up on Heather's comment about, you know, 

needing some dark at night, I'm not sure how you regulate 

tenants and the lights in their spaces at night, but it 

would seem to me that that particular façade has the ability 

to shine a lot of light into the Avalon Lofts.   

          So if there's any way you can try to get the 

tenants to turn off their lights at night, that would be 

very, very helpful. 

          So getting back to -- yes.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  If I could respond to that, in the 

package, you'll see there's a commitment to include 

motorized shades that deploy at night.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

51

          MARK JOHNSON:  So we've made that commitment.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  And just to respond to Heather, 

yes, we're complying with the Cambridge noise or lighting 

ordinance.  So there won't be any ornamental light.  There 

will be FAA required lights at the corners of the building.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  -- on the roof, but no ornamental 

lighting, other than what Chris described, which is pretty 

close -- tight to the ground plane, and just lighting up the 

entrances.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you so much.  All right.  

Are -- other Planning Board members, do you have any 

questions?     

          [Pause]  

          All right.  Ted?    

          [Pause] 

          And you have to unmute yourself, Ted.  We can't 

hear you.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm sorry.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Here we go.  Okay.

have no or little relevance toward Design Review.  But a 

couple of comments we received reference that the condo 

owners in Tango & Sierra were required to pay for many of 

the improvements to this site and to other areas in 

Cambridge Common, and that other tenants or owners were not.  

          And I was just wondering whether that's true, and 

if it's part of this agreement.  What's the basis for that?   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Sure.  So the -- all of the parcels 

that constitute or comprise Cambridge Crossing are part of 

what amounts to a Common Area Association for the entire PUD 

area.  And so, each one of those parcels has voting rights 

in the Common Area Association, and also pays its pro-rata 

share of the Common Area's expenses. 

          And this is the -- again, agreement that predates 

Divco West, and it's called the ACER, A-C-E-R, and it is the 

mechanism by which the common Areas, the open space, and 

other areas and the streets while the streets are private, 

will be maintained by the association.  So it is true that 

each parcel contributes to that ongoing operation 

maintenance.   

          We have not and are not allowed to pass onto that 

association any costs related to developing any parcels.  So 

53

these are strictly maintenance and repair expenses.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted, did you --    

          MARK JOHNSON:  Does that answer the question?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Did you have anything further, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Not at this time.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Other Board 

members?  I'm not seeing any hands.  So in that case, there 

will always be the opportunity to ask a question when you 

make comments as well.  So why don't we start with the 

architect who's present on the Board tonight.  Hugh, would 

you like to begin making your comments on the project?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Certainly.  That's -- my first 

comment is that this building is unusual, in that it is 

surrounded by five residential buildings.  A couple of them 

are across the street.  Some of them are farther away, like, 

2020, or the old condo buildings on the other side of the 

Gilmore Bridge, or the Avalon Tower. 

          I was very pleased to hear about the motorized 

shades.  So I think that is one response.  But it's been a 

challenge -- it's a challenge.  I think there was one lucky 

thing, which is that the two towers on the other side of the

Gilmore Bridge, the space between them lines up with the new 

building.  So that if you've got a condo looking out, you'll 

still have a partial view -- partial long distance view past 

the new building. 

North Point.   

          You know, I'm not sure anything else one can do 

about this, but it's just in probably a unique condition in 

          The -- so my second comment is that the façade 

that faces the Common is probably the most interesting and 

most sophisticated façade in the project so far.  And I 

really think there's been tremendous -- a great step forward 

in this façade. 

          I also looked very carefully at the glass areas, 

and the strategy has been just to modulate the glass areas, 

so that the solar gain has been reduced on the façades.  I 

think they're using solid spandrel panels rather than the 

glass spandrel panels; another way of keeping the heat out 

of the building.   

          So this also represent progress beyond any other 

building so far at North Point in trying to deal with the 

climate and the city's desire to ultimately create a Net 

Zero.  And so I really applaud that.

          I had a bunch of things underlined in the Staff 

report, but Mark basically stole all of my thunder, because 

-- in his presentation saying giving his response, which was 

precisely the response I was looking for in all my 

underlined items.   

          So there is a 45 or 50 years ago I was a solar 

expert for a few years.  And one thing I learned is, if you 

were façade faces southeast and southwest, vertical 

collectors are actually -- do pretty well.  They pick up -- 

the southeast ones pick up more sun in the morning, and of 

course lose it midafternoon.  But the total amount of sun 

that shines is not wildly off.   

          So I'm wondering if the sustainability analysis 

might consider the use of vertical collectors in the 

penthouse areas as part of a perhaps future Net Zero 

approach?  There isn't a lot of roof area on these buildings 

or roof collectors, but given the wall orientation, this 

seems like a possibility. 

          And then I would make one comment about the two 

letters from the Condo folks about their condo fees and the 

formula.  I think it might be worthwhile to revisit the 

agreement, to see if unintentionally the Common Area fees

have become something that's simply very atypical for other 

kinds of condominiums.   

          The resources of residential homeowners to absorb 

additional costs are very limited, and the ability to get 

more rent from commercial tenants probably doesn't have that 

kind of a limitation.   

          So I would ask Mark to look at that agreement and 

do a little homework on what the condo fees were actually 

working out to be, and see if somehow something that's 

prepped into existence that is going to be discouraging 

residential occupancy and posing a burden on residential 

occupants.  I don't know what the facts are.  It's just a 

possibility.   

          So those are my comments.  I, you know, I think 

this is a really, a really excellent building.  Oh yeah, one 

other -- one final comment.  The dark hole on the loading 

doors in the garage entrance, as pictured on the renderings 

-- I hope you would keep working to try to brighten that 

area up.   

          There are only three windows at that level that I 

could see in Tango yesterday when I visited the site.  Two 

appear to be bedrooms with their blinds closed in the middle

of the afternoon.  One is a corner window that probably 

doesn't look actually at the loading dock.   

          There's also a corridor window that has not great 

concern.  But I think dark holes at the bottom of buildings 

are problematic and not pleasant to walk past, and not 

pleasant to look at.  I can understand how this has been 

generated, but if there are even more solutions to keep that 

area bright, particularly during the day, that would be very 

desirable.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you, Hugh.  Mr. 

Johnson, did you want to respond in any way?   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yes.  That would be great if I 

could have the opportunity just to respond, please?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Go right ahead.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  So on the surrounded by five 

residential buildings, we agree.  And that was the origin of 

our desire to be mechanized shades deployed at night.  On 

the façade facing the Common, I very much appreciate your 

comments on that.   

          On the -- I just have some notes I'm just reading 

as we go -- I'm glad that our responses to the memo were 

coincident with your thinking, and we're pleased to study

the vertical solar collectors, particularly as part of a 

longer term Net Zero strategy. 

          On the condo fees, we did -- we hear what you're 

saying on the condo fees.  The fees are actually quite 

modest when broken down per unit.  Nonetheless, any fee is a 

fee, and we're sensitive to -- particularly in this time 

people may be struggling.   

          We did have a fee holiday during the worst months 

of COVID.  We waived all the user fees for all the parcels.  

And I will point out that in the very short run, obviously 

we as Divco own the parcels, and are paying the vast, vast 

majority of all these operating fees.   

          And the loading dock, we agree and we appreciate 

the Staff comments that we received on the loading dock.  We 

think it's much better for those comments.  As Peter alluded 

to, we spent and he spent with his team a lot of time 

studying the loading dock.   

          The lighting that they're proposing I think is 

going to go a long way towards breaking it up and preventing 

it from being a hole, a dark hole at the base of the 

building.  It may not be showing up quite yet in the 

rendering the way it's intended, but we think that we will

look again at the lighting and make sure that it's in 

keeping with the spirit of that question. 

          So thank you.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Lou, would you like to go 

next?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Sure.  And I will have to 

agree with you that Mark knocked most of all the questions I 

had down.  I -- and I guess I could probably ask you and 

whoever else wants to field it -- it's a great-looking 

building, and I don't know if the renderings don't do it 

justice on the north façade.  I expect these parapets all 

have glass rails?  They seem to be transparent.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I wonder myself if -- yes, 

that’s what I thought -- they kind of --  

          MARK JOHNSON:  The spandrel --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- blend.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- spandrel blends, yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, my whole -- right.  

And maybe in the actual building it will be more depth to 

it.  It seems like they turned flat, because there's nothing 

at the top of these parapets.  They're not really well-

defined, because you can see through them.  They kind of 

blend.  And that may be the effect you're looking for.   

          I just wondered if you had thought of something to 

define the tops of those parapets?   

          MARK JOHNSON:  I thank you for the comment and the 

question.  I think the -- I think the vertical continuity -- 

and maybe Peter can speak to this -- Peter Schubert; if 

anything the vertical continuity was really the design 

intent. 

          And I think the -- kind of the tops of these 

parapets will actually be more visible when you see it in 

three dimensions than I think of the renderings particularly 

with reflected light and things like that, probably 

flattening out the façade a bit. 

          I think in three dimensions it'll be -- there will 

be no mistaking that the tiers in this façade as it goes up.  

     Peter, would you add anything to that?   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  No, I think you covered it.  

Basically it's all about a little bit of continuity with the 

façades, and not -- and allowing that verticality to go 

through.  But I appreciate that this isn't -- this rendering 

might not do the building justice, because renderings are

always tough, particularly when you're using very 

nonreflective glass.   

          So I think the richness of this façade will be 

through the layering of the terracotta to the glass -- 

division glass, the balcony glass as well as some of the 

fritting. 

          So I hope it really will play with the light in a 

very nice way for the park.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  My concern was that you'd 

lose some definition in the façade.  I understand that it's 

very vertical.  Hopefully the tenants that will be accessing 

these will be planting them, and maybe that'll break -- give 

you a little more colon in there.   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  That would be welcome.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That's all I have, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you, Lou.  Ted, would you 

like to go next?     

the model again?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Surely.  Is it possible to see 

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yes, if you'd Share Screens please 

with Eric Hollenberg.

I want to say I like the building quite a bit, and I really 

applaud your totally screening off all the mechanicals on 

the roofs.   

          I mean, that is something I've been arguing for 

for a long time, and it really looks lovely.  And I hope 

that if it does become an R&D building, you're not going to 

end up with anything extending beyond the screening. 

          The only real question I have -- and I'm curious 

what you and the other Board members and what Erik 

Thorkildsen might have to say -- is with regard to the 

change in the coloring of the -- I guess the fins or the 

fritz.  I really don't know how I feel about that.   

          I find it somewhat off-putting and, you know, 

maybe it's the colors on the renderings, but I'm just 

curious what the other members of the Board and what Staff 

think about that. 

          That's why I was hoping to see the model again, 

just to look at it, you know, all in the one color white.   

          And with regard to that, from the renderings I'm 

not sure the entryway -- main entryway on the north façade, 

does that repeat the gold color from the south and 

southeast, or is that just a question of the way light is

being shown as reflecting in the renderings?   

          MARK JOHNSON:  So I --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Does somebody from the Development 

Team want to answer?   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yes.  Glad to respond.  I wasn't 

sure if I --      

disadvantages.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, no, I know.  It's one of the 

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yeah, no, I know, I know.  On the 

main entry, I do not believe the gold color is intended to 

repeat the gold color on the south façade.  But Peter, maybe 

you could take these questions, please?   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  Sure.  The canopy that stretches 

above the storefront starting at the -- at this point I 

guess it would be the western most façade, or western most 

corner -- extends across the façade and then up and around 

and down again.   

          And it's a bit of a canopy or a cornice of dark 

metal, but it's framing wood.  And that would probably could 

be viewed as being a similar color to the middle piers on 

the south façades, but --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Is it possible to see the

rendering while you're speaking?   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  Sure.  I suppose we should go 

back to this -- the series on the storefronts.  Hopefully 

all these materials are in your supplement.  I believe they 

are.  But, you know, this has been the frustrating part of 

the whole COVID thing, the trying to describe materials, 

because they never quite look the same on camera as they do 

in real life.

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  Do you have a page number for the 

          PETER SCHUBERT:  Two more slides up, please.  That 

would be 25 and also, slide probably 18.     

          [Pause] there you go.  Yeah.  So now you're 

looking at --              

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Right.   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  What I was just describing as the 

underside of the canopy as it moves across above the 

storefronts, and then that same frame kind of does a loop-

de-loop up and over the top of the portal and entry to the 

building.   

          So -- and then the horizon fins that are within 

that frame above the main canopy to the entrance are also 

65

wood.  So we're hoping -- again, kind of bringing in that 

kind of naturalistic texture.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Oh, okay.  So what I see on 

the left-hand vertical is sun glistening on the wood?   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  Absolutely.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay.  Is it possible to see 

the model?      

          PETER SCHUBERT: Yes, if you could Share Screen 

please with Eric Hollenberg? Eric, are you there?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  He might have made a mad dash.   

          PETER SCHUBERT:  Eric?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  He's showing the model.     

          ERIC HOLLENBERG:  Sorry, I have too many fingers

I have to go back -- I'll come back in.  Here's that view 

between the buildings.  I'd like to go back now to the long 

park view.  Come back around.   

          Here, you can see the building from the park.  Let 

me zoom in.  How's that?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  That's great.  Thank you very 

much.   

          ERIC HOLLENBERG:  Okay.  You're welcome.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Gosh.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted, go ahead.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I really have no further 

questions or comments, but I would like to hear, you know, 

from Erik Thorkildsen and Hugh and any other Board members 

how they feel about the two colors of the fins.  That's --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So why don't we start with 

Eric?  The Staff put a lot of time and effort into their 

memo, and so, he may want to comment on that and some other 

things, and then we can go back to Hugh.   

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay, yes.  I think the slight 

variations I'm not sure if they're due to changes in 

materials, or just the changes in angle of the fins on the 

68

north side.  Seems quite nice.  The more contrasting color 

panels are at the northern end of the east façade --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  -- along the bridge, and the 

western end of the south façade, which I think are actually 

kind of good, because particularly the latter kind of picked 

up on the scale of the Avalon building.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mm-hm.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  It's as though there's a sort 

of a representation of that scale lower down that sort of I 

think helps it blend in in scale a little more than it 

otherwise would.  And those -- that zone is reinforced by 

that vertical slot window that's just to the right of that 

differentiated large, rectangular panel. 

          So, you know, that sort of yellowish color, maybe 

we could fine-tune exactly what the color is -- less gold, 

maybe.  But it seems like a beneficial change to make in the 

material in those locations.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Hugh, did you want to weigh 

in?     

Eric.         

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm in complete agreement with

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Eric, while 

we have you, did you want to add anything else?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  No.  I think basically Hugh and 

the applicant's response to the memo were really good.  I 

think you've probably basically already hit on it, but it 

seems to us that the angle's façade at the corner, that it 

pokes out past the designated setback zone.  It seems like a 

really good thing for the reasons you describe.   

          And also, as you walk along the bridge, the 

sidewalk from the north to the south I think it'll help kind 

of define the space of the bridge, and sort of make a strong 

corner to the Commons, which I think will be really nice.   

          I think that pretty much covers it.  The loading 

dock was a concern, and I'm glad that you worked on it.  I 

think probably continuing with Hugh, there might be more 

that could be done.   

          And we could talk about that offline if you'd 

rather.  You know, is there a possibility for more 

landscaping?  Paving, what is the paving, that's sort of 

stuff?   

          But I think basically it's been covered.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right, thank you.  And

Niko, did you want to weigh in on your thoughts on the 

design?                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  No.  I like the design a lot.  And 

I think that it will be a good contribution to the general 

area.  I am not an architect, so I am happy to defer to the 

judgments of my colleagues on the Planning Board.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you.  Yeah, I'm in 

general agreement with the comments made by CDD and the 

other Board members.  I'm very happy that you responded as 

you have to the memo.  And generally, I think the building 

is very, very handsome.  I think it's going to be an amazing 

addition to the Cambridge Crossing area. 

          I'm very happy that you're thinking as much as you 

are about the neighbors -- the shades, and the motorized 

shades as well as making the façades that abut the Avalon 

lot building as attractive as possible is terrific. 

          I am a little concerned about the musical 

instruments, I will say.  I think it's a great idea in 

concept.  I just go back to when we once had chimes in front 

of City Hall when I worked there many, many years ago that I 

think now are in the Kendall Square T station, because they 

were banged upon at all hours of the night, and the

neighbors weren’t getting much sleep.  So whatever you can 

do to sort of lock things down at night I think, you know, 

is really the way to go.  But it's a very fine idea. 

          The elevator -- is the elevator going to be open 

24/7?   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yes.  It'll operate much like the 

Murphy staircase elevator does.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So I do like the -- 

how the façade does project out, as Eric was talking about.  

I am just a little bit concerned about overall safety as you 

go past the building under the bridge.   

          And I'm a little concerned about 24/7 access off 

of that through the building, and, you know, particularly 

with the underside of the bridge.  So, you know, whatever 

can be done there, I'm sure you've thought a lot about 

security.  But, you know, maybe there is some improved 

lighting planned for underneath the bridge, something like 

that. 

          But, you know, to me that's not totally your 

responsibility either -- say you don't own that property.  

But -- so all in all, I think you've done a wonderful job, 

and I appreciate all of your efforts.   

72

          Is the Board at this point ready to approve the 

design as shown, subject to conditions?  Maybe we are, but 

if I'm incorrect in that, someone please let me know now.  

All right.  So not hearing any objections.   

          Could I have a motion to approve the design as 

shown, which would include anything in the Staff memo that 

remains subject to continuing review by staff?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Hugh, so move.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you, Hugh.  And is there 

a second second?

          MARY FLYNN:  Niko and Hugh.  Okay.  So Lou, are 

you back yet?  I'm just giving them a couple more seconds.  

Okay.  Why don't we begin.  I think Lou will be back with us 

shortly.  So let's move on, then.   

          So the next item on the agenda is a review of a 

Board of Zoning Appeal case -- an application by the 

Cambridge Housing Authority for a substantial change to an 

existing comprehensive permit at 25 Eighth Street.   

          CDD staff is going to summarize why this is before 

us, and I'll turn it over to Jeff to have him do that for 

us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  Jeff Roberts from 

Community Development again.  The Board by now is pretty 

familiar with comprehensive permits.  So this is a type of 

permit authorized by Chapter 40B, Massachusetts General 

Laws.  It provides a process for affordable housing 

development to seek relief from zoning and other local 

requirements.   

          In this case, the Cambridge Housing Authority is 

proposing modifications to a building that was previously 

granted a comprehensive permit.  And comprehensive permit

applications go to all of the local Boards, including the 

Planning Board, for a review and any Advisory comments.  So 

the Planning Board can send a recommendation or advisory 

comment to the BZA.  And the BZA is scheduled to hear this 

case on October 8.   

          Turn it back over.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  So representing the 

applicant is Maura Barry-Garland from the Cambridge Housing 

Authority.  We're looking forward to your overview of the 

proposed changes.   

          Please start by introducing yourself and anyone 

else on your team who will be speaking.  And please be as 

concise as possible.  Thank you.       

          MAURA BARRY-GARLAND:  Good evening, and thank you 

so much for having us.  My name is Maura Barry-Garland, and 

I am a Project Manager at Cambridge Housing Authority.  My 

fellow panelists tonight are Deputy Director Clara Fraden at 

CHA, as well as Steve Baker, Senior Principal at BWA 

Architecture.  And we're excited to present to you tonight 

our proposed renovation for Truman Apartments. 

          So Truman is located at 25 Eighth Street in the 

East Cambridge neighborhood.  It was constructed in 1969,

and is currently a 59-unit masonry building.  It serves 

residents who are seniors and residents who have 

disabilities. 

          And as you can see from the image, it has three 

front yards to Thorndike Street, Eighth Street and Otis.  

And it also has a side yard that borders on the side yard of 

the buildings that line Fulkerson. 

          And we can go to the next slide, please. 

          Great.  So these are four different views of 

Truman currently.  So this is a side yard on the top left -- 

the view from Thorndike.  And on the top right, you can see 

the border of Truman's parking lot on Otis.   

          On the bottom left, you can see a side view of 

Truman from Thorndike Street, and on the bottom right you 

can see a view of the front of the building, which is on 

Eighth Street. 

          And you can move on to the next slide.  Thank you. 

          So since its construction in 1969, Truman has 

served as home for elderly and disabled residents.  

Currently average income at the site is below 40 percent 

area median income, and rent is capped at 30 percent of 

residents' income.  Residents often express to us how much

they love living in the East Cambridge neighborhood.  So our 

primary intention with renovating the building is to 

preserve these 59 deeply affordable units for the long term. 

          We can move on to the next slide. 

          Great.  So we began the design process with a 

series of resident meetings, as well as walk-in hours -- for 

instance to ask questions, and give comments in a smaller 

group setting.  And we coupled that with a residents' design 

survey, which was created by DWA Architecture.   

          So -- and throughout this process, over 40 

residents participated, or more than 70 percent of the 

building.  And through this process, many resident concerns 

came up.   

          So this is an image of the community room taken 

shortly before COVID.  But prior to COVID, the community 

room was often at capacity or over capacity -- events and 

meetings happened frequently.  So one of the priorities that 

emerged for the renovation was to build larger community 

spaces, as well as a larger laundry room. 

          The second resident priority was to install 

central air conditioning, which as it is primarily a senior 

building is a health and welfare concern.

          And then the third priority is to install new 

windows, as many residents reported the windows were drafty 

and difficult to operate.  We can move on to the next slide, 

please. 

          So we coupled the design feedback that we got from 

the residents with our knowledge of the current state of the 

building system at Truman, and arrived at the scope of work 

for our renovations.  This will be a gut renovation.  Many 

of the building systems are past their useful life and 

failing.   

walls. 

          For example, the roof is failing, causing leaks 

onto the eighth floor, and the current masonry cladding 

system is failing, causing water infiltration through the 

          So we proposed replacing the roofs as well as 

installing a new fiber cement façade that will not only 

solve the water infiltration issue, but also increase the 

energy efficiency of the building. 

          We also will be adding mechanical ventilation into 

every unit to improve air quality for residents -- another 

of our primary health and welfare investments here.   

          And we also plan to build a new addition to expand 

79

community spaces.  And the addition is the primary reason 

that we are requesting zoning relief.  But the scope also 

does include a few other things such as placement of 

windows.  It includes stormwater management features, as 

well as updating the interior finishes of the apartment. 

          We can move on to the next slide. 

          Great so as I said previously, the masonry façade 

is currently failing.  And at other CHA properties where we 

have installed cladding, we found that we have energy 

efficiency savings about 35 percent.  So those are 

properties like LBJ and Manning are fairly similar to 

Truman.   

          So by installing the fiber cement cladding, we'll 

be able to make the building more energy efficient, while 

still being able to add amenities like central air 

conditioning and mechanical ventilation.   It'll help to 

support resident health and welfare.   

          So the new insulated fiber cement siding is about 

four inches thick, and we will also be moving the new 

windows out by four inches.  So that way we'll be able to 

maintain the same window to hall relationship, as well as 

the same shadow line around the window openings.

          And the window dimensions in the apartments will 

essentially remain the same.  We're not going to be making 

any reduction in the area, in the glass area, although we 

will be changing the style of the window from a double hung 

to an awning.   

          And the reason for that change is because the 

awning windows are easier to operate, especially for seniors 

and folks with disabilities. 

          And we can move on to the next slide.  We'll also 

be increasing the amount of glass at the first floor along 

Eighth Street.  In order to provide more transparency and to 

enhance the street edge. 

          So the top image is the ground level view along 

Eighth Street.  And we have not yet finalized our color 

scheme for the façade.  But we've just wanted to show you 

our plan for the glass and glazing on the first floor.   

          And then that bottom image is the view from the 

side yard.  So in it, on the left you can see the current 

generator building, which is existing through Main.   

          And then you can also see our proposed addition, 

which is 1000 square feet on the first floor and 557 square 

feet on the second floor.  And there will be more

information on that on the next slide.  You can move that. 

          Great! So our renovations include making a 1759 

square foot addition to the building.  So the building is 

currently 46,048 square feet.  And this addition is 

primarily going to be on the east side, the side yard, where 

we'll be adding 1507 square feet.   

          But there's also going to be a small addition on 

the front to expand the front vestibule.  So that's 202 

square feet on the front.  We can move on to the next slide. 

          This is currently what the side yard looks like.  

So this is where that primary addition is going to be 

jutting into the side yard here.  And we're going to be 

replacing the current shade cover there with a operculum, so 

we'll still have a shaded area in the back yard.  We'll also 

be replacing the site furniture tables and chairs, and we'll 

be adding two charcoal grills. 

          And we planned this addition as well as the 

landscape plan with the existing trees in mind, so we will 

not have to remove any existing trees in the renovation. 

          We can move to the next slide to see an aerial 

view.  And yeah, so all existing trees are to remain, and we 

plan to plant four new trees along Otis.  So it would be

along the border of our parking lot, and that will make the 

pedestrian experience of walking down Otis past our parking 

lot more pleasant. 

          We can move on to the next slide.   

          Great.  So this is a view -- just a basic view of 

the massing of that back addition, so the 1000 square feet 

on the ground floor and 557 square feet on the second floor. 

          We can move onto the next one. 

          So this addition allows us to expand our critical 

community spaces.  Currently, there is no designated social 

worker office at Truman.   

          So the social worker who works out of that 

building has to share an office with the property manager, 

which presents a myriad of issues with scheduling and with 

confidentiality and privacy. 

          And then we also -- the current laundry room is 

undersized for the building, and it's only accessible 

through the community room, which also raises issues when 

there are events going on in the community room, and it's 

just a longer trip to carry your clothes through to the 

laundry room.   

          So by expanding -- by adding the addition, we were 

83

22

able to reconfigure the community spaces.  So the addition 

is outlined in red, and the community spaces are in blue.   

          So adding the addition allows us to expand the 

community room, larger to expand the community kitchen, and 

also, allows us to add a second community space - the TV 

lounge -- so that residents, multiple groups of residents 

could have events simultaneously. 

          It also allows us to have an interior recycling 

room. 

          And lastly on the first floor, we're able to 

create waiting lounge as well, because of reconfiguring 

those community spaces.   

          So we can move to the second floor view. 

          Great! So on the second floor, the addition 

enables us to expand the laundry room, and to make it 

accessible directly off of the elevator lobby.  Also, so 

next to the laundry room is a computer lounge -- is going to 

be a computer lounge, as many of our residents don't have 

computers of their own, and often need to use the Internet.  

          And there will also be a conference room made 

possible because of the addition.  So those are the second-

floor community spaces.

          We can move on to the next slide.   

          Great!  So we're seeking relief on floor area 

ratio, as well as side yard setback -- distance between the 

principal building and the second-area building on the site, 

and we're also seeking relief on number of parking spaces. 

          So first off is floor area ratio.  So we have 

previously gotten approval for an FAR of 2.17 in our 

previous comprehensive permit, but we'd only ever had an FAR 

of 2.13 on the site.  And we are asking to increase that to 

2.21 in order to account for that additional 1759 square 

feet of the addition. 

          We can move on to the next slide. 

          So the addition will also shrink our side yard 

setback, which is currently 35.5 feet.  And it will be 22.3 

feet after the addition is constructed. 

          And we can move on to the next slide. 

          So we do have a generator building on site -- 

that's a good thing, it will remain.  And it's currently 10 

feet away from the principal building on the site.  But 

after the addition is constructed, the accessory building 

will be only 7.25 feet away from the principal building. 

          We can move on to parking.

          Oh, actually -- sorry, this is another view of the 

dimension.  So it just shows the 22.3 feet to the property 

line, and 7.25 feet to the accessory building.  Great.   

          Yeah, so we currently have 19 parking spaces on 

site.  As part of the renovations, we will be restriping the 

parking lot in order to add a van-accessible space.  There 

are three ADA units at Truman, and so, we would like to add 

this -- be an accessible space. 

          However, restriping means that we would have to go 

from having 19 parking spaces to 18.  We actually have been 

approved to have 18 in our comprehensive permit, but since 

we are building an addition, we are seeking relief again so 

that we can have that 18 spaces approved. 

          And although we are building an addition, it's not 

an addition that’s going to increase the number of people at 

Truman.  And so we will not need any increase in parking. 

          And if you move to the next slide you can see the 

current parking lot at 19 spaces.  So our residents -- the 

vast majority of the residents at Truman do not own a 

vehicle.  And so, the 19 spaces have been sufficient, and 

the 18 spaces will also be sufficient for this building. 

          You can move on to the next slide.

          Great.  And finally, we would like to ratify two 

existing nonconforming front yard setbacks.  So this is a 7. 

4 foot setback on Thorndike Street, and a 9.6 foot setback 

on Eighth Street.   

          And both of these have been in existence since the 

building was constructed in 1969.  And we'd just like to 

ratify those existing, nonconforming. 

          So we can move on to the next slide. 

          Great!  So we have plans to begin construction in 

January 2021.  And we're very excited to be able to offer 

larger community spaces at Truman, and to begin programming 

those spaces that we can offer more social services at the 

site.  And we are excited just to preserve this deeply 

affordable housing in East Cambridge for the long term. 

          Thank you so much for your time, and we welcome 

any questions.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  It was a very detailed 

and helpful presentation.  So this is not a public hearing, 

but there are a few members of the public who are watching.  

If there are any members of the public who wish to speak, 

they should now press the button that says, "Raise hand."  

If you are calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by 

87

pressing *9.  

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had not 

received written communication on this case.  Written 

communications from received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday will 

be entered into the record.  Okay.   

          So I see one hand so far.  So there may be more as 

we go along.  Let me turn it over to Jeff, who will unmute 

speakers one at a time.  Please begin by saying your name 

and address and staff will confirm that they can hear you.  

After that, you'll have up to three minutes to speak before 

I ask you to wrap up. 

          So Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  There is one 

hands that's raised, so I'll just repeat the instructions 

before going on, if anybody is in attendance and would like 

to speak please push the, "Raise hand" button now or push 

*9.  In the meantime, we'll go to Heather Hoffman.  Please 

give your name and address.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hi, Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley 

Street.  And I was interested to hear this.  I can say that 

having been in that community room one time, it is a cramped 

feeling place -- partly because it's pretty narrow.

          So I am sure that people will be happy to have 

more room to spread out in and feel as though you aren't 

sitting on top of other people.  And I am extremely happy to 

hear that not only are you preserving the trees, but you 

will be planting more.  And I hope that you will plant the 

largest ones that you can afford.  Thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I still don't see another hand 

that's raised, so I'll just give it one more set of a few 

seconds, to see if anybody else wants to raise their hand.     

          [Pause] 

          I think that probably does it.  So I'll turn it 

back over to you, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  Do Board members 

have any questions for either the staff or the permittee at 

this point?  I'm seeing none.   

          Okay.  I just have one, and that is I assume there 

have been discussions with the abutters, and if you could 

just briefly explain what the outreach efforts have been to 

those folks and their thoughts on the addition?     

          MAURA BARRY-GARLAND:  Yeah.  So I sent a mailing 

out to all the abutters that had a link to the BZA hearing 

on October 8, as well as information about the proposed

addition and my contact information.  And I haven't heard 

from anyone yet, but it -- yeah, should have arrived to 

everybody.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Excellent.  Okay.  Thank you 

for that.  Other Board members, any questions?  No.  Okay.  

Then let's move on to comments.  Ted, would you like to 

start?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Surely.  I really have no 

comments.  It seems, like perfectly reasonable to me.  You 

know, the -- you know, there's only a little loss of green 

space in the rear, but it seems that the expansion of the 

community rooms and the laundry and kitchen and all the 

other things certainly outweigh any minimal loss of open 

space. 

          And, you know, the other -- the loss of the 

parking space, it makes sense to have a space for an 

accessibility van.  And the other minor issues just seem 

very minor to me.  It seems like a great thing to do.  You 

know, it's not relevant to our decision.   

          I'm curious about where all the current residents 

will be relocated for the period of time it takes to 

renovate everything.  But other than that, I mean, it seems

like a good thing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you.  Yeah, Maura, 

that is a good question:  Where are all these?     

          MAURA BARRY-GARLAND:  Yep.  So we were able to 

have enough vacancies in our portfolio that we're able to 

offer units within our portfolio to everyone.   

          So we had three resident relocation meetings 

before residents voted on the relocation agreement.  So they 

all have the right to return to Truman after construction, 

and they have a variety of relocation options.  Most are 

taking the option to relocate to another unit in CHA's 

portfolio temporarily during construction.   

          A few have taken other options; for example one 

resident is using a Section 8 voucher to move into the same 

building where her daughter lives, and another resident 

actually took -- so we have a down payment assistance offer 

as well, and another resident actually took the down payment 

assistance offer and is moving into his own home in October. 

          But primarily, the residents are moving into CHA 

apartments throughout our portfolio.  And luckily, we have 

apartments coming back online from Miller's right now too, 

so that's helpful, especially for residents who really want

to stay in East Cambridge.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Excellent.  That sounds like a very 

well thought-out plan.  How long is the construction time?     

          MAURA BARRY-GARLAND:  So construction is going to 

last 12 months, beginning January 2021.  So it should be 

finishing up at the end of 2021.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Not very long, thank you.  I remember 

you said starting in 2021, I just couldn't remember the end.  

Okay.  So let's move on then with comments.  Lou, why don't 

you go next?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Hi, yeah.  I think it's kind 

of an overdue project.  I think it needed to be done, and 

I'm glad someone, they’ve gotten to it.  The addition is 

kind of a small item.  Doesn't seem to be too intrusive to 

anyone. 

          I like the barbecue area.  This is a pretty tight 

group in this building.  I'd like to see them to be able to 

get outside and have a barbecue on holidays. 

          The community room:  Yes, I agree with Heather it 

has always been kind of undersized.  And likewise the 

barbecue area, this will work to great effect in this 

building.

          As far as the setbacks, they seem reasonable, and 

glad they're going to clear up their other items.  And I 

think it's a great project.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great, thank you.  Hugh, why don't 

you go next?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Well, I agree with my colleagues 

that this is a well-executed plan, and well-designed 

project.  It is needed because the building's age.  The -- I 

believe the architect of this building was Paul Fellini 

(phonetic) project.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh!             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- who at the end of his career was 

-- served as the City Architect of the City of Cambridge, 

which is how I got to know him somewhat better, because he 

hired me to do a few little jobs for the city. 

          Paul's work is not well appreciated, but that 

building from 1969 was a huge step above what else was being 

built at exactly the same time, by less skilled architects -

- particularly the windows that were given to the 

apartments.  But just it's a fine building.   

          And I -- the thing that I feel I'm -- needs more 

thought and more work is the coloration of the building.

Right now it's a red brick building.  It's relatively dark, 

as brick is, and it's rich, as brick is.  I think the 

lighter sort of beigy-tan colored basic panels for the 

building really don't have that same appearance of quality 

and stability, and that work should be done on that.   

          And I would like to volunteer our own Erik 

Thorkildsen, who is very perceptive on these questions to 

maybe consult with the Cambridge Housing Authority in their 

construction of colors or selection of color.  Because I 

think that would help the building be even more outstanding.  

So those are my comments.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you, Hugh.  Niko, would 

you like to add anything?                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  No, I agree with Ted.  I like the 

proposal.  I'm glad that the residents will be able to 

benefit from these renovations, and I appreciate all the 

work that CHA is doing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you.  Well, I concur 

with my fellow Board members.  I think it's a long overdue 

project, and it will be of tremendous benefit to the 

residents.  I think I appreciate the efforts to save the 

trees and upgrade the outdoor space for the users, but 

94

particularly the additional community space -- interior 

space I think will be really transforming for the residents' 

enjoyment of the property.  And certainly the -- you know, 

improving the shell of the building and the systems, it's 

going to be very remarkable. 

          So I like it.  I do appreciate Hugh's comment on 

the color selection.  So I don't know how the Housing 

Authority feels about that, but perhaps it's something we 

can suggest to the BZA. 

          Do the Board members want to make a recommendation 

on this?  It sounds we're all -- you know, very supportive 

of it.  So do we want to send a recommendation in support 

for the reasons that various folks have outlined this 

evening, various Board members?  And maybe add the 

suggestion that Hugh gave?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think we absolutely should give 

this a very high recommendation.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.                   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I concur.   

          CLARA FRADEN:  Can I make a quick comment, Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Pardon me?                 

          CLARA FRADEN:   May I make a quick comment?

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, please.                 

          CLARA FRADEN:   I just wanted to add kind of to 

Hugh's point -- oh yes, of course: Clara Fraden. So exactly 

to Hugh's point, we met with the Cambridge Historic 

Commission today, who mentioned Paul Fellini (sic) as well, 

and their kind of love for this building.   

          And so, because Truman Apartments is in the East 

Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District study area, the 

Cambridge Historic Commission does need to approve the 

façade design when we go in for a building permit, which 

will be next month.   

          And so, Charlie and Eric and his team kind of 

echoed your sentiments, and we will be meeting again with 

the Cambridge Historic Commission on October 1, and then 

again finally when our building permit is submitted.   

          And they asked us to look at a couple of details  

-- specifically the connection between the kind of first-

floor stone panels and the fiber cement.  So we're going to 

be furthering that detail, as well as the color selection as 

well.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Wonderful.  That's excellent.  All 

right, so Jeff, do you have enough -- we'll take a vote, I

guess -- a motion to approve or to recommend great support 

for the project.  But do you have enough in terms of the 

comments that we've made to craft that recommendation, or do 

you need us to restate anything?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The only note I have is about color 

selection.  I don't know if there was anything else in the 

comments that should be called out in the recommendation.  

But if there's something I missed, please just let me know 

and I can put it in.                     

          MARY FLYNN:  No, I don't think -- there certainly 

wasn't anything required for the study or change.  I think 

it was all just positives.  But I guess generally we can 

just send a recommendation saying that we are very 

supportive of the project, and then and support the 

continued efforts to look at the color scheme. 

          All right.  So can I have a motion from a Board 

member to that effect that we are in favor of the project, 

and would like to see continued review and input from the 

city's Historical Commission and Urban Design Staff on color 

selection?            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So moved, Hugh.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Hugh.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  And a second from Lou.  Okay, roll 

call vote?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Lou Bacci? 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Niko Bowie?                    

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Mary Flynn?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes.             

          [All vote YES]   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Terrific.  Well, thank you very much.  

We really appreciate the time and effort you put into this, 

and certainly the seniors and residents I'm sure appreciate 

it very much; they must be thrilled.  So good luck at the 

BZA.     

you all.

So that concludes the business on our agenda for this 

evening.  Does the staff have any additional comments at 

this point?  No?               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Nothing from me, thanks.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay Board members, do you have 

anything to add before we adjourn?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So we can confirm that there will 

be no meeting next week?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes, there will be no meeting next 

week.  The next meeting will be October 6.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, then, this meeting is 

adjourned.  So see you all on October 6.
