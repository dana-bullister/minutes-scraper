To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the transfer of $20,000 from the General Fund Reserves Other Ordinary 
Maintenance Account to the General Fund City Clerk Department Other Ordinary Maintenance 
account.   
 
Funds will be used to cover higher than expected printing and advertising costs.  The Clerk’s 
office has transitioned to creating transcription-based meeting minutes for City Council 
meetings.  This has resulted in an increase in printing costs.  There are also several extensive 
zoning petitions which are anticipated to be submitted before the end of the Fiscal Year which 
will necessitate further expenditures for printing and advertising.    
 
 

 

Very truly yours,

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of a Homeland Security Grant from the City of Boston 
for $7,047.00 to the Grant Fund Fire Salaries and Wages account. The City has received this 
grant, as reimbursement, for trainings performed in conjunction with the Urban Area Security 
Initiative (UASI).  
 
The UASI committee coordinates the emergency planning in UASI communities, which includes 
Cambridge.  The City of Boston is the fiscal agent for the Urban Area Security Initiative and 
Homeland Security Funds.  
 
This grant will cover the City’s costs for participation in the trainings.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
Typically, as the end of the fiscal year approaches, we request from the City Council permission to make 
some necessary transfers that would be needed to maintain appropriation control as part of the fiscal end-
of-year closeout process.  These transfers typically involve funding departmental salary and wage 
accounts from the salary adjustment budget account contained in the adopted budget.   
 
However, I am seeking this authority now so that if we need to make emergency purchases due to the 
current situation that there is flexibility to move funds between statutory accounts and/or between 
department budgets. This would allow us to expedite processing and not to have to wait for a City 
Council meeting, which may not meet as often as normal. In addition, as we prepare for potential 
reimbursements from the State or Federal government, this would allow for orderly tracking of expenses.  
 
As noted, the City Council annually has authorized the City Manager to make necessary transfers from 
available budget balances for the orderly closure of the fiscal year. 
 
This request is being requested now due to the special circumstances.  
 

 

 

Very truly yours,

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

In 2017, the City Council adopted goals including “Make it easy to move safely 
through the City, especially by sustainable modes of transportation”; and 
 
The City has committed to Vision Zero, which seeks to eliminate transportation 
fatalities and serious injuries, as well as reduce crash rates across all modes of 
transportation; and 
 
There have been multiple cyclist deaths and numerous serious injuries on Cambridge 
streets in the past several years; and 
 
Promoting sustainable transportation methods can help alleviate high levels of traffic 
in the region, provide alternatives for residents who cannot afford to have a car in the 
city, and help reduce Cambridge’s carbon footprint; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached “2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance” be forwarded to the Ordinance 
Committee for discussion and recommendation.

Section 12.22.010 
 
This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.  
 
Section 12.22.020 
 
This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the 
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected 
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City. 
 
Section 12.22.030 
 
A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or 
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle 
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in 
both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.”

F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction 
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion, 
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine 
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a 
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist 
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or 
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible 
loading, intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle 
lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so 
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better. 
 
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a 
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:

(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,

Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS  
  

Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives in General Court 

assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:  

 
SECTION 1.  
  

Beginning in the year 2019, notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, 

the City of Cambridge may offer early voting for municipal elections. 

The City of Cambridge may elect to allow any qualified voter, as defined in section 1 of 

chapter 51 of the General Laws, to cast a ballot for any biennial municipal election during the 

early voting period.  

The City of Cambridge’s Election Commission may promulgate regulations to implement 

this act not inconsistent with section 25B of chapter 54 of the General Laws and with other 

election laws applicable in the City of Cambridge, including those governing proportional 

representation voting.  Such regulations may include, but are not limited to, a process for 

establishing early voting locations, dates, staffing, and a process for applying for, receiving,

decision in PB 288

With everything you have to deal with and the blizzard of notices coming from the SJC, it would have been easy to miss 
the fact that all statutes of limitations are tolled until April 21, 2020. I didn't see it until it was pointed out to me. 
Therefore, I respectfully request that you not consider the decision filed in PB #288 on February 26 final until that date 
has passed.

Thank you for keeping up with all of this craziness and not losing your cool. I hope I can do as well myself.

Sincerely,

Heather Maguire Hoffman, Attorney at Law

Proposed Real Estate Transfer fee

I am totally opposed to the proposed real estate transfer fee. As proposed, there are no exceptions for life long 
property owners who actually reside in their single, two or three family houses. For those who say "...rates and 
exemptions are open for discussion...", this is unacceptable. There should be no 'discussion'.  
At the very least, before such a petition is even considered, a firm, enforceable commitment to exempt owner 
occupied properties must be incorporated from the outset.

We are overwhelmed with the invasion of rich developers, particularly in East Cambridge. The City needs to concentrate 
on ways to subject them to 'fees' to accomplish the goal of more affordable housing--not punish the middle class 
homeowners.

It's very disheartening to see what's been going on lately in the City I grew up in. Between the cyclists who have been 
granted all the rights and subject to no rules, to the promoting of unmonitored composting in the midst of a 
serious rodent problem, to the recent Ordinance regarding non-arrest of unlicensed illegal immigrants 
potentially putting licensed drivers in danger, I have serious concerns about the thought processes of our City 
Officials.

Sincerely,

Audrey Cunningham

Re: Proposed Real Estate Transfer fee

Right on Audrey!  Again, we have certain councilors proposing new taxes with the country falling into a recession. It’s an 
embarrassment for The City of Cambridge!!! Protect the Middle Class, don’t destroy it.

Policy Order #3

I support Policy Order #3.  This is an important piece of legislation for affordable housing.  Those with high value 
properties have benefited greatly from increased value of their property.  A real estate transfer fee is a very small tax on 
real estate that has risen so much in value.

I do not understand how the city manager can avoid asking the City Solicitor to draft the language to send the the state 
legislature for 3 years.  That is not acceptable.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

City, State, and Federal Offices are all grappling with the ongoing coronavirus 
pandemic, curtailing hours, closing offices, and scaling back to skeletal staffs and 
barebones operations for an undetermined period of time; and 
 
Communities across the country are bracing for the possibility that routine daily life 
could be disrupted for upwards of eight weeks, if not longer, depending upon a variety 
of factors; and 
 
The closures of all these government offices will make it difficult, if not impossible, 
for residents of Cambridge and across the Commonwealth to go in person to their local 
Registry of Motor Vehicles to complete the process to obtain the new Massachusetts 
REAL ID, which must be completed by October 1, 2020 and which will be required 
for people to enter federal buildings and to fly domestically after that date; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record in strong support of Senator Ron Wyden’s 
forthcoming legislation calling for the delay of federal REAL ID requirements until 
September 2021; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of 
this resolution to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Senator Ed Markey on 
behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS: 

The COVID-19 virus is spread when individuals are in close proximity to each other 
and Cambridge residents are being encouraged to social distance during the outbreak; 
and 
 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:  Many leases allow landlords to enter an apartment without a tenant’s permission on 
short notice to show the unit to prospective tenants, purchasers, or mortgagees; and 
 
The City of Boston has asked brokers and real estate agents not to show apartments 
during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
Apartment showings during this period of high transmission potential could put the 
health of immunocompromised tenants at risk and harm local efforts to curb the 
pandemic; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to enforce the Governor’s order and 
prevent brokers, landlords, and real estate agents not to show housing units, in person, 
with current occupants during the COVID-19 pandemic, or to enter or bring others into 
the unit which is currently occupied for reasons unrelated to the health of the 
occupants.

ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

The Cambridge Department of Human Services estimated that there were 408 
homeless individuals residing in Cambridge in 2018, an increase of 18.5 percent from 
the number of 340 unhoused Cantabrigians accounted for in 20101; and  
 
Individuals experiencing homelessness are especially vulnerable to the transmission 
and severe health risks of COVID-19, as many are older, struggle with compounding 
disabilities, and have little to no access to healthcare; and 
 
Lack of housing during this outbreak is a concern not only for these individuals but 
also a public health concern, shelters currently do not have adequate space for social 
distancing and exposure creates opportunities for infection; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Director of the 
Assessing Department and the Director of the Inspectional Services Department to 
compile an up-to-date list of housing units and buildings currently vacant in 
Cambridge, that feasible measures may be taken to avail that underutilized shelter to 
those most in need during this time of emergency; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to explore the feasibility of using 
City properties including the vacant buildings at 884 Main St and 105 Windsor St as 
emergency shelters; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to reach out to local hotel operators 
about contracting for the use of their properties as emergency shelters; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter no later than the April 6, 2020 City Council meeting.

people who run them, including but not limited to arts & culture institutions, nonprofits 
providing essential services, restaurants and foodservice establishments, bars and

are no longer available because of necessary social distancing to limit the spread of 
COVID-19; and 
 
Some organizations have necessarily shut down completely or partially in order to 
comply with regulatory changes and social distancing recommendations from health 
experts; and 
 
Organizations both large and small will be challenged by social distancing and limits 
on large gatherings for weeks and months to come; and 
 
For some of these organizations, losing weeks or months of revenue may end up being 
an impossible hurdle to overcome without assistance; and 
 
The positive, uplifting power of art and music will be an important component of our 
healing process in the months to come; and 
 
State and federal funding is becoming available for certain businesses and 
organizations, but not others; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to present emergency appropriations 
to the City Council in order to provide appropriate financial relief to businesses and 
organizations in the city, especially those which are not receiving sufficient state or 
federal assistance, in proportion to need; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Community 
Development Department and local business associations to provide and promote a 
centralized resource with ways that residents can continue to support local 
organizations and businesses in the weeks and months ahead, including when 
applicable takeout and delivery, online merchandise, donations, and the sale of gift 
cards; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
these matters as soon as possible.

WHEREAS: 

As of March 23, 17 Cambridge residents had tested positive for COVID-19, more 
than doubling the known cases in 4 days, with many more cases expected due to 
sustained 
community spreading of the virus; and 
 
The City of Cambridge has declared a Health Emergency due to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
 
In the last week, the City of Cambridge has led the way in the fight against COVID-19 
and enacted several policies including the closures of hair, tanning and nail salons, 
barber shops, gyms, tattoo and body-piercing studios and more, as well as closed 
municipal buildings and schools, tot lots, basketball courts, and tennis courts, and 
playgrounds,  in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus, which has a 
current global death toll of over 15,000; and 
 
As we have reached a critical tipping point, local hospitals are already seeing an 
increase in cases of COVID-19, and are in danger of being overwhelmed, which will 
result in an unprecedented demand on medical personnel and supplies, ultimately 
leading to many more deaths as we have seen in other countries; and 
 
The City Council has received reports that residents are still not practicing medically 
advised physical distancing, particularly in grocery stores, public parks, pick-up food 
establishments; and 
 
On March 23, Governor Baker ordered the closure of all non-essential businesses in 
the state and issued a “stay-at-home” advisory, beginning Tuesday, March 24, 2020 at 
noon, effective until April 7, 2020 at noon; and 
 
‘Stay at Home’ orders are critical interventions which have been instituted across the 
United States; and 
 
A ‘Stay at Home’ order would not apply to those going to work in an essential 
business; now therefore be it; 
 
That the City Manager and the Chief Public Health Officer immediately execute a 
‘Stay at Home’ order for the City of Cambridge; and

COVID-19 ideas and suggestions 

 
 
Dear Colleagues, 
 
These are trying times and we will get through this by working together. The following is a 
non-exhaustive list of ideas and suggestions from my office for strengthening our response to 
the coronavirus epidemic in Cambridge. As we combine our ideas and diversity of expertise we 
will produce the best outcomes that we collectively can.  
  
In terms of our own function as a legislative body, I think the Council should prioritize these 
three things: 
 

1. Avoidance of all possible in-person interactions for the next 2 to 3 weeks.  

curve

 
The next few weeks are most critical for flattening the 
distancingtactics over the next few weeks will protect our most vulnerable residents by reducing 
their risk of contracting the virus and having to seek treatment in overcrowded hospitals. It is 
essential that the Council model this behavior by conducting our own business entirely online 
using the Zoom video conferencing platform, as several other cities are doing, including 
Newton. While I fully respect and commend the efforts that have already been made to reduce 
everybody’s risk, health experts simply do not recommend physical gatherings of the size we 
saw at the March 16 regular council meeting at this time. When the public sees councillors and 

. Any effort put into social

staff in close physical proximity during our council meetings, they are receiving mixed messages 
about the importance of taking precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19.  It makes 
no sense to have any part of our council meetings be in-person during this critical period when 
we have the technology to completely avoid that. 
 

2. Continuing to function as the legislative body that directs the city administration’s efforts 

 
It is essential that the council continue to meet and conduct business related to the COVID-19 
outbreak, even over these next few weeks. The rapidly-changing nature of the situation will only 
continue, and it is important that we have regularly scheduled opportunities to discuss and 
approve any appropriations that the City Manager puts forward, uplift the concerns of our 
residents, and have frank discussions about necessary policy changes as we respond to the 
pandemic. We need to work together to fill in the gaps that have been created in the lives of all 
our neighbors and give everyone as much stability as possible, especially the most vulnerable 
and those with the most essential needs. This emergency has exposed how thoroughly 
unprepared we are to deal with situations like this, and it is going to take considerable time, 
effort and attention for us to catch up to it. 
 

3. Maintaining transparency and the public trust 

 
We are fortunate to have the ability to continue conducting business in the age of COVID-19 
using online technologies, but we must also be mindful of the downsides. The integrity of our 
public process is at stake when residents are not able to give public comment or even watch us 
conduct business. I have already spoken with residents who are concerned about council 
meetings moving online because they do not have internet access at home. Other residents 
have struggled to adjust to the online system for giving public comment, and public comment 
was not audible to me last Monday night through the remote participation audio link. The city 
should provide a low-stakes training session for residents who would like to learn and practice 
using these technologies, in order to be as accommodating, inclusive, and transparent as 
possible. While the level of transparency and accessibility we usually enjoy may not be possible 
for now, we should avoid advancing significant non-emergency legislation until we have made 
adjustments to this new normal, so as to not lose the public trust which is so essential to our 
democracy. At some point in the hopefully not too distant future, we will reach a “new normal”

that is more stable, and we may find that we have capacity and ability to work transparently on 
other important priorities. We can always reevaluate at that time, but for now working on other 
detailed policies will only distract from what we must be most focused on, which is responding to 
the immediate crisis. 
 
To accomplish the above I recommend that we do the following: 
 

1. Conduct all city council meetings entirely via the Zoom platform starting Monday, March 

23, while continuing to stream the meetings to the general public via all existing 
channels. 

2. Limit our meeting agendas to our response to the coronavirus pandemic, and anything 

else that is time sensitive and urgent. 

3. Ensure maximum public participation via Zoom, including public comment. 
4. Ensure city websites are accessible to the maximum range of devices and internet 

connection setups possible. 

 
In addition, the most important thing we can do is to educate the public on the need for maximal 
social isolation. It is important to stay home except for walks/fresh air, and to keep a distance of 
15 feet from other people when outside of the home (minimum 6 feet but a small risk of 
transmission remains even at that distance). 
 
Here’s a list of suggestions/ideas that have been communicated to us that are worth considering 
further: 
 

1. Large apartments: 

Many residents live in large apartment buildings and aspects of 

social distancing are  logistically challenging. The city should work with the CHA, 
non-profit housing providers, and private landlords to minimize the risk of transmission in 
shared spaces. The city should develop guidance from both the landlord and tenant 
perspective. New York City has 
things to include:

a. Guidance for minimizing risk in communal laundry rooms, washrooms, 

mailrooms, elevators, stairwells, and other shared spaces. 

b. Guidance for times when it is necessary for a landlord to enter the home of a 

tenant. 

c. General infection prevention strategies and disinfection guidance. 
d. Additionally, the city should work with building managers to ensure that first 

responders know where people with special emergency/medical needs live in 
each building, and that any especially vulnerable residents of each building are 
receiving the protection and attention they need.  

2. Small businesses: 

Many are concerned about the impact of social distancing on our 

small businesses, restaurants, and bars. Here are some steps we should consider 
immediately (some may already be in the works): 

a. The city should use its platform to exert pressure on both the federal and state 
government to implement significant relief, including tax relief and extensions, 
deferred payment plans for rents, mortgages, utility bills, grants, providing bailout 
funds, and emergency zero-interest loans 

b. The city should leverage its considerable resources to supplement as necessary 

the financial relief provided by state and federal authorities. 

c. The city should create a centralized resource for employers and employees to 

provide assistance and guidance, as San Francisco 

already has done

. 

d. The city should work with Cambridge Local First and other business associations 

to develop centralized resources for members of the public interested in 
supporting local businesses during the emergency. This could include a list of 
restaurants and other businesses offering delivery services, online goods for 
purchase, or gift cards for sale. 

e. The city should work with Cambridge Local First and other business associations 
to provide special assistance to and promotion of businesses that are newly 
transitioning to a takeout and delivery model. Residents won’t necessarily know 
that these services are even being offered.

3. Taxation, billing, and fees: 

With economic forecasts looking bleak and many residents 
already out of work, the city should do what it can to defer or eliminate taxes, billing, and 
fees, including the following: 

a. Defer collection on any taxes, bills, or fees that it possibly can, including excise 

taxes, water bills, and parking permit fees for the time being. 

b. Waive the additional fee burden that is presented when making an online 

payment to the city. 

online. 

c. Provide access, education and training for anyone who is not used to paying bills 

d. Continue with street cleaning, but not ticket or tow cars for the next month or two.
