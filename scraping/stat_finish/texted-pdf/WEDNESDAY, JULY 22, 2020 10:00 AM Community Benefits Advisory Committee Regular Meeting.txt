Discussion about eligibility  
• 
• 

Tried to orient toward a yes based on eligibility criteria 
Location – applicants that were deemed ineligible: are not based in Cambridge pre-COVID, do not have a 
location in Cambridge, and do not directly serve Cambridge residents in Cambridge; are not based in Cambridge, 
and ability to serve Cambridge residents dependent on physically being in Cambridge Public Schools – which are 
not giving permits to outside organizations 

•  Question about one organization – whose eligibility does not impact eligibility of any other organization: CBAC 
determined, that, yes, it should be deemed eligible as a Cambridge-based nonprofit organization, provided it 
can affirm that it can use funds in the next 6 months to facilitate services to Cambridge residents 

 
What to convey in outreach and communications with applicants 
Applicants found to be ineligible:  
• 
Thank you for applying! 
•  Reason(s) why application was found to be ineligible – be explicit about criteria 
•  Process CBAC followed to determine eligibility and outreach efforts to elicit complete application materials from 

applicants  

 
Applicants found to be eligible – and that are among 100:  
•  Congratulations! 
• 

Explanation of process – including that lottery process was based on random selection among eligible 
applicants, not quality of application 

•  Reminder that receipt of funds is subject to requirements laid out in grant agreement  
 
Applicants found to be eligible – and that are not among 100:  
• 

Explanation of process – including that lottery process was based on random selection among eligible 
applicants, not quality of application 

•  How many organizations are part of this group  
•  Be clear that they could still be selected for funding in the months ahead – either because selected 100 may not 

all execute grant agreements with the City, or because additional Community Benefits Funds could be 
appropriated   

 
CBAC unanimously approved two recommendations to the City Manager:  
• 

To enter into grant agreements for $10,000 each with the 100 nonprofit organizations identified in the 
randomly generated list 
To use existing Community Benefits balance to enter into grant agreements with 6 additional nonprofit organizations
