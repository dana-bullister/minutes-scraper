          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good evening.  

Welcome to the July 21, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board.  My name is Catherine Preston Connolly, and 

I am the Chair.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency actions limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles D Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 

2020, temporarily amending certain requirements to the Open  

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, dated May 27, 

2020. 

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is streamed live on the City of Cambridge online meeting

portal and on cable television Channel 22, within Cambridge.  

There will also be a transcript of the proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their name before speaking, and all votes 

will be taken by roll call.  Members of the public will be 

kept on mute until it is time for public comment.  I will 

give instructions for public comment at that time, but you 

will also find instructions on the city's webpage for remote 

Planning Board meetings.  

     We'll start tonight by asking the staff to take Board 

member attendance and verify that all members are audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

Jeff Roberts of the Community Development Department.  I'm 

just going to go through the most fun part of every meeting 

of making sure that everyone is present, visible and 

audible. 

          I'm going to start with Louis Bacci.  Are you 

present, and is the meeting visible and audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'm present, and you are

Daniel Messplay and Sarah Scott in Zoning and Development; 

Iram Farooq, the Assistant City Manager for Community 

Development is present; as well as Khalil Mogassabi, the 

Deputy Director and Chief Planner for the city.  From the 

Urban Design Team Erik Thorkildsen is present, and from the 

Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department Adam Shulman 

is present at the meeting.   

          As for the update, just to go through quickly a 

preview of coming attractions, we do not have a meeting 

scheduled next week on July 28.  We will continue to have 

meetings in August in this same remote format. 

          On August 4, we have scheduled a public hearing on 

a zoning petition, which is the Affordable Housing Overlay.  

It's a version of -- a refiled version of a petition that 

the Planning Board had hearings on last year. 

          There will also be a General Business Item review 

of a comprehensive permit application for an affordable 

housing development at 402 Rindge Ave.  That's August 4.   

          August 11, we have two public hearings scheduled.  

They're both new cases.  They are cases that were kind of 

pending to be scheduled back in April, but never fully got 

scheduled.

          There is a public hearing for a development at 101 

Rogers Street.  That is the building that many people know 

as "the boundary building."  The City of Cambridge came to 

acquire that building some eight, or six to eight years ago, 

as part of a redevelopment proposal, and there's a proposal 

for the reuse of that building that the Board will hear. 

          There's also a proposed retail cannabis store at 

1908 Massachusetts Avenue.  That will be on August 11. 

          August 18, we have a public hearing on another 

retail cannabis proposal -- retail cannabis store.  It's at 

759 Massachusetts Avenue in Central Square, and we have a 

public hearing on another zoning petition, which is the 

green -- it's an amendment to the Green Building 

Requirements that has been submitted by the City Council.  

So that will be heard by the Planning Board on August 18.    

          That zoning petition has just had its public 

hearing at the Ordinance Committee scheduled for August 26, 

if you're interested in tuning into that.   

          I'll also note -- I think it's just a reminder -- 

the Affordable Housing Overlay will have a continued public 

hearing at the Ordinance Committee on August 19. 

          The only other meeting to note is that next week

on Monday, July 27, is the usual summer meeting of the 

Council, which they hold while they're on summer recess -- 

well, they're normally on summer recess. 

          So that's it for updates for me.  I'll turn it 

back over to the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you 

very much.  If there are any questions from Board members at 

this time, you can state your name and ask Jeff a question.  

          Okay.  Hearing none, we'll move onto the next 

item, which is approval of meeting minutes.

                  Tom Sieniewicz          

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  The Board has 

received certified transcripts for the meeting held on June 

16.  If there are any questions from the Board members, 

please again say your name and raise your questions now.     

          [Pause] 

          All right.  Hearing none, is there a motion to 

10

accept the transcript as the meeting minutes?  Say your name 

when making the motion.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steven Cohen, so moved.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh, second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So I have 

a motion from Steve with a second from Hugh.  Then we'll 

turn it to staff for a roll call vote.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On accepting the transcript for 

June 16 is the minutes.  Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.

                  Tom Sieniewicz.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So then 

we'll move on to the next item on the agenda, which is a new 

public hearing on Case No. PUB 360, a proposal by the KG 

Collective, LLC, for a cannabis retail store at 701-703B 

Mount Auburn Street, within an existing retail space. 

          CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  Just me 

one more time.  So this is a new hearing.  It was originally 

scheduled for March 2020, but it had to be postponed.  

          A cannabis retail store is allowed in this zoning

district by special permit from the Planning Board if it's 

found to conform to the criteria in Section 11.800 of the 

zoning ordinance, and the General Special Permit Criteria in 

Section 10.43.   

          Also, because this particular proposal is in a 

Business A1 zoning district, one of the requirements is that 

applicants must be designated at Economic Empowerment 

applicants or certified as eligible to participate in the 

social equity program by the Massachusetts Cannabis Control 

Commission. 

          CDD staff has provided a memo summarizing the 

Special Permit Criteria, and other matter relevant to this 

proposal.   

          That's all for me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you 

very much.  The presenter for the applicant is Megan Kemp.  

Please begin by introducing yourself and any other speakers 

on your team, and then commence your presentation.  You will 

have up to 30 minutes for the presentation, unless the Board 

grants additional time.   

          MEGAN KEMP:  Thank you, Chair, and to the members 

for being here.  My name is Megan Kemp.  I'm an attorney

with Adam Dash & Associates, located at 48 Grove Street, 

Somerville, Massachusetts.  I'm also a Cambridge resident, I 

live in North Cambridge. 

          With me this evening are the founders and owners 

and operators of the proposed business, Michael Pires and 

Marcus Johnson-Smith.  Also with us this evening are Jose 

Guzman, our Architect; and Steve Chaisson, our Security 

Consultant on the project.   

          Swaathi, you can go to the next slide. 

          So a little background about how this came about.  

This is the brainchild of Michael and Marcus.  They are both 

Cambridge raised.  They went to CRLS, graduated from 

Northeastern, they have strong ties to particularly this 

West Cambridge community, as I'm sure you read in some of 

the letters that came in from neighbors in support. 

          They own an existing business together.  It 

started in 2015 in Boston, and they have recently opened a 

new location for Cushgrove (phonetic) in Central Square.   

          And, as you can see, Marcus has been involved on 

the Cannabis Business Association as a founding Board 

member.  He was an appointee of the Citizen's Review 

Committee for the Mass Cannabis Control Commission.

          Our Security Consultant, Steve Chaisson, started 

out in Compliance for Medical Marijuana with DPH.  And so, 

the team has a lot of background in history and experience 

and industry knowledge in this area. 

          And over the past -- if you could scroll -- and 

so, over the past couple years, we found this property, and 

it's 701-703 Mount Auburn Street. 

          You can go ahead and go down again.  One more. 

          So this is an existing -- it's most recently a dry 

cleaners.  So we tried to keep the -- over the past couple 

years, we -- once we found a location, Mike and Marcus 

participated in a number of community outreach initiatives.  

They literally canvased the neighborhood, went door to door 

talking to neighbors and business owners to get their 

perspectives, show them some plans.   

          They've been consulting with the Community 

Development staff to meet as many community concerns as 

possible. 

          This property in the VA district allows for 

cannabis retail by special permit.  KG Collective is an 

Economic Empowerment applicant; they do have the appropriate 

designation for the BA-1 District.

          The store is a single-story, ground-floor, 

consistent with the area businesses.  We're not looking to 

do anything different there, we're not changing the 

dimensions of the building at all.  It is a permanent 

building, sufficient distance from schools and other youth-

focused areas and activities.   

          The nearest currently existing cannabis retail is 

over by Fresh Pond, which is far outside the 1800-foot 

radius required by the ordinance. 

          And this is an area of the city that does not have 

this use in existence yet, and so, it is an underserved 

population.  It would take some of the pressure off of 

traffic at other locations to have it sited over here.   

          We're also very near the Belmont, Watertown lines.  

We're literally steps from three bus lines -- the 71,73 and 

72, all running back to Harvard and directly to the Red 

Line. 

          It's also immediately adjacent to the new 

Watertown-Cambridge Greenway, which allows additional non-

car access to this site.  For those of you -- I'm sure 

you're all familiar with the area -- we're right next to the 

Star Market, SOFRA, et cetera.

          There is no proposed parking on site.   

          You can go to the next screen, I think. 

          So there is no proposed parking on site.  But as I 

mentioned, and as you can see from the diagram, there are 

several bike racks in existence.   

          We're also proposing to put a new, short-term bike 

parking rack on the property, as well as a 25-station 

Bluebikes station, which we will also be encouraging both 

patrons and employees to utilize to the best of our 

abilities, to keep traffic to a minimum. 

          As detailed in the narrative, there are a number 

of measures in place regarding security, surveillance, 

access, and inventory control.  Per the ordinance, no 

packaging or repackaging is going to take place on site.  

All of that will happen remotely.   

          There are several metered spaces in front of the 

location that we're able to monitor by external cameras.  

Those would be used for deliveries, which will be 

randomized, and trash management, because KG will be using 

unmarked sprinter vans.  They can control the timing of 

those deliveries, so that we can avoid high traffic times.   

I know that was a concern that everyone has these days,

right?   

          But we'll be able to -- you know -- give the 

driver a call if there are no parking spots, ask them to 

wait and come later, be able to minimize those transfers.  

And everything will happen in a way that will kind of keep 

that to -- you know, 10 or 15 minutes or less, at most.   

          The proposed operating hours are from 10:00 a.m. 

to 8:00 p.m.  So we would be working on trying to make any 

of those sort of business things happen before business 

hours and keep that out of high traffic times. 

          In addition to training for the staff, the 

businesses are also producing a lot of educational materials 

and training for consults for clients, both recreational and 

medical.   

          Initially, as we've discussed in the narrative, it 

would be by appointment-only. If that needs to change, over 

the course of time there had been some discussion back and 

forth with the Development staff about how long that by-

appointment only should last; should it be six months or a 

year?  And it kind of depends on how things are going. 

          Obviously in the current climate, maybe that will 

be ongoing for a longer period of time; health concerns, you

don't know.  But we do have other processes in place 

preordering, pickup, local delivers as able to help keep 

those things to prevent any unnecessary queuing and what not 

in the neighborhood. 

          The -- you know, the staff will encourage patrons 

who are there to -- you know, go frequent the other 

restaurants and stores in the area, and come back at a later 

time and kind of use that joint ability. 

          And so, you know, there are probably some other 

questions.  I will turn it over to our architect, Jose, to 

talk about a little bit of the design and kind of the 

concept there.  And so, let's see.  Jose, are you there?     

          [Pause] Okay.  Steve?  Nope.  There's just -- 

there's no sound.  He's unmuted, but there's no sound.  He's 

on one of the -- sorry, apologies -- technical difficulties.  

Okay.  So I'll just keep going.  I'll walk you through some 

of the site. 

          So this is the initial site plan, as you can see.  

So you've got about 15 parking spaces right in front.  We'll 

probably be using -- you know, these designated 2,3,4 as 

available for those deliveries, as we discussed. 

          We are proposing to shift the front entrance over

to the east corner over here, from the center, and we have a 

secondary delivery entrance to the far left.   

          As noted on here, that is the entrance that would 

be the secondary means of egress out of the basement.  It's 

going to be keycard accessed for deliveries down, but then 

have ability for emergency egress out as needed. 

          There's also an additional -- you can see to our 

left there -- an additional door out of the basement that is 

within the property line.   

          We are talking with DCR about whether or not we 

would need any agreement with them for access, if anybody 

does walk over onto the Greenway.  But the immediate exit 

there is all within the property line.   

          The idea is that maybe an employee just wants to 

go outside for some fresh air, and that way they are not 

just crowding up the sidewalk out front.  But that is not 

meant to be an emergency egress, secondary means.  Both 

exits would go out to the front.   

          You can go down to the next slide. 

          So you see we've got the wood rain shield here.  

We're trying to kind of keep in line with the existing 

buildings, but kind of modernize this a little bit so it's

not just a complete concrete face.   

          The windows are as transparent as possible.  They 

do allow them light into the space, trying to keep that as 

open as possible, but with a rotating art wall behind the 

windows, so that it stays active and shields the product 

from the street.  

          And signage be minimal -- you know, flush against 

so it's not protruding, but it's still attractive and meets 

all the signage requirements. 

          Let's see.  You can go one more down. 

          So the reason that the door is shifted is to help 

with this flow -- so the customer flow in and around the 

store, so you don't end up with a backlog kind of in the 

middle where no one can go anywhere.  We also have next to 

this vestibule this checkpoint area for the security, and 

so, all of that can be kind of contained in a more apt way.  

          And then you can see we've added -- existing 

there's only one restroom.  So we've added a second 

restroom, so that there is sufficient space for both 

employees and patrons, and the staircase, which goes down to 

the basement area, which is an existing part of the 

building. 

          But is only under this lease being added to this 

retail space, which I believe caused a little bit of 

discrepancy in the initial dimensional form, which we've 

21

          So the total floor print of the building is not 

changing. All that is changing is the space being added to 

corrected. 

our use. 

          So you can go to the next slide down.  So this is 

the proposed buildout for the basement space security 

product.  And you can see it's -- so you have the staircase 

again on the bottom right, that goes out to the front, and 

then the rear exit.   

          We're not looking for a whole lot of -- this isn't 

going to be, like, someplace people are doing a whole lot of 

hanging out; it's mostly security and storage and 

management. 

          Let's go one more down.  So this is the rear view.  

You can see up on the top, right where that ledge is.  This 

is where we're proposing to put the short-term bicycle rack 

parking, so this will be slightly cantilever over just to 

provide that space for the rack. 

          We had initially proposed to have four long-term

and four short-term, but there's just not the spacing there 

to provide the security for the long-term parking as needed.  

          So we'll just have the short-term parking and do 

as much as we can to encourage traffic, you know, to use 

those other available options for public transport, et 

cetera and walking to come. 

          You can see there's no cover over this little back 

porch area, so it doesn't add anything again to the FAR.  So 

the dimensions of the building don't change, it's just a 

little staircase down so you can go down and get air.  And 

that's all with the property line.  So that does not use the

talk?     

          [Pause] 

          He still doesn't have audio.  Okay.  Let's see.  

Yeah, I can -- let's see.  One, you can go ahead and go one 

down.  That to me is existing, we're not doing anything with 

that.  We're just utilizing what is already there.   

          So yeah, so try to address a few of these.  Okay, 

so just go one more down. 

          So just a couple of the concerns that came up in

the CDD memo and the Traffic and Parking memo.  So again, we 

understand there's no parking that we can add on this space.  

          And so, you know, to try to address those 

concerns:  Because we are a small business, we do fall under 

the ordinance to have the parking and loading and long-term 

bicycle parking requirements waived.  But we are going to, 

you know, address that by trying to have home delivery 

options, encourage pedestrian visits…  utilize all those 

public transit options and Bluebikes and what not that are 

so readily available in the city, encourage employees to 

rideshare or carpool as much as possible if they are still 

going to drive. 

          While there is not a designated loading area here, 

we do believe that we can handle that operationally with the 

existing metered spots by being able to use them in nonpeak 

times, having those unmarked vans, those very short delivery 

          But it wouldn't be anything different to the 

neighborhood than the regular pickup and drop-offs, for 

instance, from the dry cleaners that were going to be 

happening on a daily basis, you know, sending things off 

times.   

every day.

          We touched on this -- you know, in the narrative 

you'll see and [-- he is unmuted.  Sorry, I know Swaathi is 

working with Jose to try to get him in.  I apologize.]  So 

in both the narrative and the TPT there are severe ways to 

address the traffic issue, which we understand is the 

concern.   

          Again, having subsidies for the employees to use 

the MBTA, really encouraging all of those for both employees 

and clients, and having that -- you know, readily -- 

information readily available on the website as well, so 

anybody coming to will be encouraged to use those public 

transit options available to them.   

          I think I touched all the others.  I know -- like 

I said, Swaathi and Jose are trying to work on getting him 

in via either a direct link or a phone call, since he's 

there, but he's not showing up.  Are there any questions 

thus far before the architect is available for you?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Megan.  

Thank you for soldiering on and being as efficient as you 

can be with time.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Trying.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- despite the

technical difficulty.  Board members, while we are waiting 

to see if we can get the architect on, are there any 

clarifying questions that you might have for Megan at this 

time?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I don't know whether it's for 

Megan or for staff, but at the moment, is home delivery of 

cannabis allowed in Massachusetts, and/or Cambridge?      

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Hi, this is Steve here.  I can 

answer that for you.  Right now, adult use home delivery of 

marijuana is now allowed.   

          The CCC has begun a process for certifying and 

issuing licenses for home delivery for adult-use products, 

but it -- you know, it's in its infancy right now, and it 

would still require local approval and a special permit for 

that license. 

          So the answer is no right now.  Now, medical 

groups can still deliver to medical patients at this time, 

but adult-use is now allowed right now, and it would not be 

allowed directly from a bricks and mortar retail 

establishment.

          So let me take that back -- for collocated.  So KG 

Collective could not -- KG Collective, Cambridge could not 

have a license for home delivery out of that store.  I hope 

that answers your question.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

questions from Board members?  You can just give your name 

or use the "Raise hand" function to be recognized, as you 

like.    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  This is Steve.  I guess I just 

want to follow up on the question.  If we can't have 

delivery of the cannabis and there isn't parking on the 

site, and, you know, human beings being as they are, they're 

probably not going to be perfectly compliant about walking 

and biking there.  As a practical matter, what's going to 

happen?   

          Are there other places in the neighborhood where 

customers are just going to drive and park in the 

neighborhood?  You know, what are the possibilities and 

risks there about parking?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Right.  So, I mean, the possibilities 

are there are the 15 spots directly in front, the metered 

spots.  There is, obviously -- people are local.  While we

would not encourage them to take up resident spots, you 

know, as a practical matter, they probably would if they 

have a permit. 

          But what we are trying to do -- so, as Steve 

mentioned, the home delivery is still in its infancy.  As I 

mentioned earlier, we would still be trying to do as much by 

appointment or order ahead for pickup as possible.  So you 

can place an order and schedule a pickup.  So it would say, 

you know, it's going to be ready between these times.  And 

that would help minimize that traffic flow. 

          It's the same issue that any retail business in 

this neighborhood is going to have, because while there is a 

large parking lot at Star Market, it's for Star Market, it's 

not for these other businesses.   

          So the nail salon, the hair studio, the dry 

cleaners, us -- you know, Sofra, the coffee shops, these 

sort of 15-minute spots and the handful of spots further 

down the street are what would be available.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Questions 

from other Board members?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Just a quick clarification.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  This is Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The parking spots on Mount 

Auburn Street and that parking area, they are time limited?         

28

          MEGAN KEMP:  Correct.  I believe those are all 

two-hour spots, yes. Swaathi, could you go back up to that 

slide?  It's the one that has the radio circle on it.  Yes.  

So those are all two-hour spots, except for Sundays.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And they also only -- until 

6:00 p.m.?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Yes, correct.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  All right.  So we're 

probably going to lose all those spots after 6:00 p.m., 

correct?  There's going to be a lot of resident parking and 

so forth?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  You know, I think there is some.  I'm 

sure that we're going to lose a lot of them, but there's 

still a lot of flow from those businesses that happens 

during those times in the traffic study.  There were 

available spots throughout the business time, both the TPT 

and Vanasse.  So while some of them go, it's not a total 

loss. 

          And again, we'd be trying to do as much scheduling 

-- particularly for consultation appointments; people who

possible. 

          Those are also prescheduled online appointments, 

so that we'd be able to keep that traffic flow to a minimum, 

to the best of our ability and still -- again, encourage as 

many of those people to use public transit and Bluebikes as 

          Or if they're in the neighborhood, and they live 

over on Spruce, they can walk over.  And that would be great 

too.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Catherine? It's Tom.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Tom.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom -- I have a question.  It's 

well over maybe a dozen of these applications that we've 

seen at the Planning Board, so we're beginning to get 

pointed and expert in our questions.   

          A question that came up last week, we pose the 

same question here:  There's an existing dry cleaning 

operation that has existed there for a long time.  Have you 

compared how much traffic -- obviously potentially 

preexisting, nonconforming relative to its traffic

requirements, but the amount of traffic crossing the 

threshold for that business, as compared to the amount of 

traffic that might be anticipated in the new business, so 

that this Board member could compare the relative impact?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Off the top of my head, I'm trying to 

remember all of the details of the traffic study.  I don't 

know that they did a head to head comparison of the prior 

use as much as they did a comparison to other uses of this 

type.    

          I know they went over and they looked at Brookline 

and what was happening there.  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I note that we do 

have Adam Shulman from Traffic and Parking with us tonight.  

So we'll have a chance to check in with him from the staff 

point of view as well, Tom, on that matter.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  That's fine, Madam Chair, thank 

you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Any other 

questions from Board members for Megan?  Have we had any --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I have one quick one.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Whoop!  I think --

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, I was just -- can you confirm, 

like, how many people you anticipate per hour during the 

scheduling process?  How many stations are there?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  So there are six registers.  So six 

points of sale in the building.  So I will switch over -- 

let's see -- occupant load -- I think they're only looking 

right at the maximum capacity, you know, of about 29-30 

people in the sales area at a time.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And how long do appointments 

generally last?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Let's see.  That's a good question.  

Mike or Marcus, do you want to talk about the appointments? 

          MARCUS JOHNSON:  So I can speak just from my 

personal experience having patroned (sic) an adult-use 

dispensary, using the order ahead pickup method.  Typically, 

you know, it takes about five to 10-minute, depending on 

kind of the queue that is in beforehand.   

          You know, you have your appointment, you show 

security your confirmation of the order, they allow you into 

the facility, you show your identification to the 

salespeople, to the register -- budtenders -- they give you 

your product, you pay, you walk out the door.  It's pretty 

32

much as simple as how it's described.   

          Steve, I know, kind of does this a little bit more 

than I do, just on the professional side.  So maybe Steve 

you want to kind of answer to the broad experience of how 

this is done?       

          [Pause]      

          MARY FLYNN:  He might be on mute.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  He's unmuted, but the sound isn't.  

There we go.  I can hear you, Steve.       

          MARY FLYNN:  That's okay.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  The idea is that we'd be working to 

keep it as short as possible.  This would not be lingering.       

          MARY FLYNN:  And that would be kind of once you're 

up and fully operating?  I think the initial appointments, I 

assume, would be longer, because --      

          MEGAN KEMP:  There are some waivers and things 

that they need to sign --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.    

          MEGAN KEMP:  -- and be walked through.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  I think that's it for now.  

Thank you.

see that Michael Pires has his hand up, so I want to check 

and see if that is wanting to be recognized or just an error 

with the device?   

          And I see Jose has also put his hand up.  So if 

either of you want to speak, that would be fine.  

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Well, I raised my hand.  I'm hoping 

that you can hear me?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Jose, great, yes.  Hello.   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Oh, fantastic.  Oh, my goodness.  

Okay, thank you.  So my name is Jose Guzman, by the way.  

I'm the architect of record on the project.  And I'd be glad 

to answer any questions that you have related to the layout 

of the plans or the elevation.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  I'm so 

glad you were able to join us.  Do Board members have 

questions for the architect about the layout?   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Okay.   

          [Pause]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Not seeing any 

questions regarding the layout.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have one question, Catherine.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, Hugh?  Hugh 

Russell, yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It would be nice if the first floor 

plan would show the stair.  I guess you have plans that we 

don't have.  So it is on that plan that you're showing now, 

up from the basement?      

          MEGAN KEMP:  Yes, yes.   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Right.  That is the first-floor 

plan, and I believe the prior is the basement plan, which 

happens to be not directly over the first floor, by the way.         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess my point is the plans 

you're showing us now are not the ones that were sent to us 

for review?  You've made some minor corrections to them?   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  A week ago.  And my understanding 

was that those drawings were going -- were going to be sent 

to you in the form of slides, I believe.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Let me -- no.  I believe --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, we can see that 

staircase now.  Are there other questions about the layout, 

or anything for the architect?

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  This is Mary.  It seems as though the 

first floor phase is kind of tight in comparison to many of 

the other shops that we've looked at.  And I guess if you 

would just explain the vestibule area, and is that divided 

off in any way to separate the incoming folks from the folks 

who are departed?   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Okay.  Well, the vestibule has two 

functions.  One is an airlock to prevent cold air or hot air 

from coming into the interior.   

          The other is a way of devising circulation where 

people come in straight ahead and turn left, and people that 

are leaving the store enter near the storefront on the 

bottom and exit out.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  I'm confused now.   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  You see the arrows?  There are some 

          JOSE GUZMAN:  That's the entry point, where you 

gray arrows --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.   

see the 12-foot dimension?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.

          JOSE GUZMAN:  And they -- when they come in, they 

will check in at the security checkpoint, which is a counter 

where a person will be sitting there taking IDs and making 

sure that -- you know, that it's okay.  And then once 

they're checked in, you'll proceed back into the main 

product showroom.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  When they're there, they can just go 

around looking at different products.  And then they head 

over to the register, which is -- there are six registers 

going here.  When they pay for the product, then they will 

exit out in the arrow circulation that you see there.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So it's --  

          JOSE GUZMAN:  That’s the pattern of circulation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So it's a 

big loop, basically?   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Yes, it's basically a loop, correct.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  And what is to 

prevent -- you know, I mean this is just hypothetical, 

obviously but -- what is to prevent someone who is in the 

vestibule area from getting through the exit door if, say, 

the security checkpoint is -- you know, that person is busy

and, you know, is there an opportunity for somebody to slip 

in?  I guess is my question.   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Well it's a staffing issue.  That's 

what this is.  You know, they'll either have one or two 

people --    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  -- staffing the station, and one 

paying attention to people that are exiting, and another 

person checking people in.  It'll depend on volume; the 

amount of volume will depend how many people are manning the 

checkpoint.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you so much.  That makes 

it clearer.  Appreciate it.   

          JOSE GUZMAN:  Okay, yeah.  You're welcome.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  So just a brief comment through the 

Chair to Hugh.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  I do apologize.  I do see what it was 

that we had to correct on the initial plans.  It showed the 

second egress door on the first floor, but it did not show 

the staircase behind it.  It did show it on the basement 

unconstrained conditions.  How accurate do we think that is?       

38

plan, and that was something that we corrected just for 

clarification.  The door was there, but it didn't specify 

the staircase.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Okay.  

Thank you very much for that.  Lou, I want to circle back to 

you.  Yeah?  You had a question?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.  How -- I guess back to 

Mary's original question, looking on the Summary form, and 

240 customers by appointment-only, and 860 customers a day 

          MEGAN KEMP:  At the current -- I'm going to say 

that's probably fairly accurate, if not a little bit high. I 

think if we can hear Steve, he can talk to this more.   

          [Steve, could you try calling in, maybe?  Would 

that work?]  

           But those numbers were pre-pandemic.  All right, 

so in the current climate, we would imagine that those would 

be much lower, and that that period where we would go to 

some unrestrained situation completely where there would not 

be any sort of appointment or predelivery schedule, that 

number would be far, far lower.   

          There probably would not be a situation where it

was completely unrestrained for quite a while.   

          For now, for instance, the Governor's order is -- 

you know, order only at dispensaries.  There is no ability 

to do anything else, and that will probably last for some 

time.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Right.  The business 

hopefully will be in business for a long time to come.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I don't know what the 

capacity you have for queuing or parking or transit for 84 

customers an hour?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Whose hand is up?  Mike?   

          MICHAEL PIRES:  Oh.  I just wanted to add to that 

that those numbers were findings from Sira Natural's survey, 

which is another dispensary that was in operation in the 

City of Cambridge.  So that's how we came up with those 

findings.   

          And just going back to the parking center, just 

the peak hours would just be between 2:00 and 4:00, and 

being that it's only two hours of the 10 hours of operation, 

I don't see that that would be much of an issue.   

          And that's all I just wanted to add to that point.

I haven't raised my hand for a while.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Wouldn't you expect your 

customers to be more of after work than during work?  I 

mean, it's a funny time of day, 2:00 to 4:00.  That would 

mean you have a lot of customers at 3:00, when -- if traffic 

and so forth is the heaviest.   

          I'm just concerned with queuing -- you don't have 

any queuing area in this facility, and the parking is very 

limited.  It's going to create a problem.   

          MICHAEL PIRES:  The vestibule can hold about at 

least nine occupants, and then we also have a space, we have 

plans near the restrooms, which is kind of a dead space that 

we have in there, that we could also keep customers that are 

inside the store.   

          So, you know, and then being that we assume that 

most purchases will be after hours with people getting out 

of work, and those parking spaces will become more 

available.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  And again, because these would be by 

appointment, we would be able to schedule people.  If it 

looks like, you know, everyone wants to come at 5:00, well 

there are only [X] number of appointments at 5:00.  So

you're going to have to come during a different time of day 

as well.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.  But we won't be 

appointment-only for very long.  I actually don't even see a 

duration in the paperwork.   

          STEVE CHAISSON:  We suggested to have appointment 

on for the first six months.  And again, it's Governor's 

order now that all purchases are appointment-only, because 

of the COVID restriction.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  So it would be a minimum of six 

months and probably longer.  And again, that was in 

consultation with as more storefronts do open, not just in 

Cambridge but in the surrounding communities that the amount 

of demand on the few that are currently open would probably 

dissipate to some extent. 

          And so, after some period of time, there will be 

enough spacing that that would be feasible.  Again, if it's 

not feasible, then it would be something that we would 

extend longer.  That is not something we are -- you know, 

we're happy to do that for a longer period of time if that's 

what's needed.  But if there's not the customers to mandate 

that --

          STEVE CHAISSON:  Hi, Megan, this is Steve.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Oh, great.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Can you guys hear me now?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  Yes, yes.     

          STEVE CHAISSON:  Sorry about the technical 

difficulties there, you know, on the audio there.  So I was 

unable to get the last couple minutes here.  But I just 

wanted to opine a little bit on what we're seeing in the 

industry right now.    

          I know we're talking about customer numbers and 

things like that.  And I just wanted to start off that, you 

know, one of the unintended outcomes of this COVID, you 

know, that we're dealing with is we're seeing a lot of 

online ordering right now, which quickens up the amount of  

-- or the time it takes to make a transaction.   

          So using our software, people can make their 

orders online, they can be given a time when they come in, 

they can meet our greeter at the front door and say, ["This 

is who I am"] they can show them a code on their phone, and 

they can come in.  And transaction times are sometimes, you 

know, under five-minute to get people in and out. 

          The other point I want to make is, you know, back 

43

a year and a half ago when the first recreational or adult-

use dispensaries opened up, you know, there was a huge 

influx, and it all made the news of all these long lines 

outside the stores:  We're not seeing that anymore.   

          We're seeing when groups open up, you know, 

there's a ramp up, but we're not seeing those -- you know, 

hundreds of people outside the store or anything like that.  

We're seeing people do their research, they find out what 

store they're going to, they find out about preordering. 

          So we can maintain our queue to the amount that we 

need to, using our preordering and reservation system, the 

appointment systems.  So people can go right onto the KG 

Collective website, they can choose a time when they're 

going to come into the store, or they can actually place 

their order at the store.   

          So while there will be people who just walk up and 

look to get in, if we don't have the capability -- you know, 

if there's a queuing line out there, they're going to be 

turned away until it lightens up.   

          So we're not seeing the crazy, you know, numbers 

that -- you know, with 40 or some odd opening in 

Massachusetts right now, and more opening -- and I'm not

sure, you know, we're most likely not going to be the first 

in Cambridge but, you know, we may be -- you know, we will 

be able to -- you know, deal with the customer numbers in an 

effective way.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I wasn't really 

concerned with all the queuing.  Even if you have half of 

these customers coming for five minutes apiece, where do 

they park?  Where do they stop?  Where do they pull over?   

          Our service is very limited here.  Some of the bus 

services have very long headways.  We'd just like to see 

some kind of a plan that makes sense, that's all.  And I 

don't want to put too much -- too fine of a point on it, but 

--    

          STEVE CHAISSON:  No, I understand that.  You know, 

we've dealt with this in other municipalities.  We're 

opening up retails.  And the bottom line is if there's no 

parking, they're going to go somewhere else.   

          You know, it's not what Michael and Marcus want to 

hear, but it is the truth that if they're not going to find 

a location to park, they're going to go to another 

dispensary in Cambridge or to one of the other dispensaries 

in the neighboring towns.

22

          So I totally understand your concern, but, you 

know, that's basically what's going to happen is if we fill 

up the parking we have, if people aren't traveling by bus 

and bike and walking, you know, our limits are kind of 

mandated on how people get there and the amount of parking 

we have.  And once that fills up, we're not going to -- you 

know, those people are going to go elsewhere.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  And some of that is also the 

marketing -- that the idea is that we're going to be 

marketing local, and the vast majority of our customers will 

probably come from the neighborhood, not from far away, 

right?  

          If they come to the website and they look and we 

say, "Look, there's limited parking, we encourage you to use 

these bus lines and Bluebikes or rideshare" then we're 

hoping -- you know, that most customers, particularly now 

that a lot of people are getting into the habit of ordering 

online and using these other services, that that will 

continue.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Well, why 

don't we leave that there.  We will have additional 

opportunity for Board discussion and questions for staff, 

46

and if there are any additional questions we need to pose to 

the applicants, we can certainly do that at that time. 

          I would like to move on I think to public comment 

at this time, unless any Board members have an objection to 

doing that?     

          [Pause] 

          All right, hearing none, this is a public hearing.  

Any members of the public who wish to speak should now click 

the button that says, "Raise hand."  

          If you are calling in, and therefore there is no 

button for you to click to say, "Raise hand," you instead 

raise your hand by pressing *9.  Because this is a continued 

hearing, we'll ask you to focus your comments on the new 

materials that have been presented at this meeting.   

          This is obviously an unusual continued hearing in 

that it was continued without much in the way of process 

earlier.  So -- but anything that you heard tonight please 

feel free to comment on.   

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, we had received written 

communication from the following individuals:  Haden Guest, 

Jerry Bernardo, Theresa Kiteaff, Jeremy Daley, Eric Brown, 

Ryan Marfiote, Cristina Otero, Karen Kosco, Lauren Nisotel,

Alexis Rizzuto and Alex Herbstrict, as well as a petition of 

support. 

          Any additional written communications received a 

5:00 p.m. yesterday will be entered into the case file.  So 

now I'll ask staff to unmute the speakers one at a time.  

You should begin by saying your name and address.  Staff 

will confirm that we can hear you, and after that you will 

have up to three minutes to speak before I ask you to wrap 

up. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks to the Chair.  This is Jeff 

Roberts again from Community Development.  I'll be unmuting 

and muting public speakers, and as the Chair noted, I will 

say your name so you can begin.  I see a number of hands 

starting to go up a little bit. 

          I'll just -- I'm going to read two names at a 

time.  So I'm just going to read who's next and then who's 

after that.   

          The person whose name I read first, you always 

want to start by saying your name, spelling your name so 

that the stenographer has it for the record, and giving your 

address.  I'll confirm that we can hear you, and then we can 

proceed.

          So the first two speakers are Haden Guest and then 

Robert Russell.  So Haden Guest, you can start by saying 

your name and giving your address and -- or spelling your 

name and giving your address.   

          HADEN GUEST:  My name is Haden Guest, H-a-d-e-n G-

u-e-s-t, and I live on 20 Holworthy Street with my family.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  We can hear you.     

          HADEN GUEST:  I am extremely concerned about this 

proposal on a number of levels, and I'm working with members 

of the community to protest it as forcefully as we can.   

          We can start with the most recent issue of the 

parking.  Your diagram is incorrect.  Holworthy Street, half 

of it is not residential parking, it's actually many people 

leave their cars overnight. 

          I didn't have to do deep research for that, I just 

had to look out my window.  If we're talking about up to 800 

customers a day, we are talking about an extreme amount of 

traffic in this residential area where there are children, 

and it's -- I really find that absolutely outrageous.  You 

know, we can smell secondhand smoke in our house.   

          We're less than 500 feet away from this site, 

which I also find absolutely outrageous. And the idea that 

49

12

13

18

20

21

22

we're going to be smelling marijuana all the time I just 

find absolutely outrageous as well. 

          The fact that -- you know, we know the deleterious 

effects of marijuana on the human body, but we also know the 

effects it has on the community.   

          I have lived in Venice, California before this, 

and I've lived -- unfortunately very close to a marijuana 

dispensary.  And I saw the kind of culture that it promoted, 

and I saw the ways in which it really just destroyed the 

very fabric of the neighborhood. 

          This neighborhood is very, very intensely 

undergoing redevelopment right now with the Greenway.  There 

are going to be a lot of people coming and going and a lot 

of kids that go -- including my own, they commute.  They go 

to the bus, going past this very site.   

          I find it really problematic that they're going to 

be exposed to secondhand smoke, they're going to be exposed 

to marijuana.  I really -- I just think it's completely 

wrong.  

          The site is very problematic.  I lived here when 

it was a dry cleaner, and that caused bottleneck then.  And 

that was a small Mom and Pop operation, and they could 

50

22

barely manage the traffic just for a then failing dry 

cleaning operation.   

          So I find is risible this idea that you think that 

you can accommodate all of the customers in this site.  

There's going to be a queue out -- a line.  That is a very 

tight space, I've been in there, and you claim you can have 

that number of pay stations, I think it's wrong. 

          My deeper objection, though, has to do as a parent 

and the taxpaying citizens of Cambridge, and the idea that 

we're going to have to be living so close to this business, 

that -- and we're going to be exposed to secondhand smoke, I 

find it incredibly problematic.   

          And so, I'm shocked that there's a petition in 

support, but please don't be shocked when there's going to 

be a petition vehemently opposed to that, because it's my 

very intention to do rallying of my fellow citizens, to make 

sure that this does not happen.   

          I find it cynical, this idea of an artwork that 

should be placed outside, just to paper over this business; 

I really don't think it's correct.  I think it's the wrong 

place for it in the heart of a vibrant, youth-centered 

neighborhood, and this is wrong.  The bike path is going to 

51

promote athletic youth, and this is wrong to be so close to 

it.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So next is Robert Russell, followed 

by Dominique McCoy.  Robert Russell, you can start by giving 

your name, spelling your name and giving your address.   

          RUSTY RUSSELL:  Sure, thanks.  My name is Rusty 

Russell, Robert Russell, R-u-s-s-e-l-l. I live at 9 Spruce 

Avenue.  

proceed.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  We can hear you; you can 

          RUSTY RUSSELL:  Okay, great.  I live right around 

the corner from Haden, though we haven’t met.  I mean, I'll 

say first of all, you know, I support minority businesses.  

It's great to see black and brown people moving into what is 

frankly a pretty white neighborhood.   

          And also, I, you know, have some questions about 

the use of marijuana, like Haden.  But I think it's been 

more or less approved by the Legislature.   

          I am, however, concerned about the issue of 

traffic and cars.  There's one point I want to make that is 

a point of correction that should be implemented in your

PowerPoint and in your thinking.  Spruce Avenue is not a 

permitted parking street.  It's actually a private street.  

Parking is barred on one side due to fire regulations.   

          But on the other side, my understanding is the 

street is actually owned by the residents.  And so, it is 

not available for customers of your proposed business.  So 

you should know that, and you should make that correction. 

          Like Haden, I'm concerned about the number of 

visitors and when they will come.  I guess my overall 

feeling right now -- and I'm sorry to have to say this -- 

this presentation, I mean, you guys -- you guys should get a 

better team together.   

          Because this has been almost totally incoherent in 

my view, in terms of what sort of business this is going to 

attract and when -- not during the pandemic, but afterwards, 

because that's really what we're talking about.   

          It doesn't make sense now, and I guess my 

recommendation to the Planning Board is continue this 

hearing and get some better data presented in a coherent way 

by people who know what they're talking about, and then we 

can decide.   

          Right now, it's not ready for primetime.  But

otherwise, good luck to you.  You know, I teach at 

Northeastern, it's a great place, and I respect your 

entrepreneurialism.  But I would get some people who 

represent you a little bit more adequately.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the next speaker, there's Tim 

Wieskel, followed by Jessica Pires.  Tim, can you start by 

giving your name, spelling your name and giving your 

address?  I'm sorry, try that again, please.  I didn't get 

the button in time.  You can unmute yourself. 

          Oh, okay, very good.  My name is Tim Wieskel, W-i-

e-s-k-e-l.  I live at 6 Spruce Avenue.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  You can go ahead.   

          TED WIESKEL:  My concerns are with the 

presentation, which is basically inaccurate in some of its 

key slides.  In particular, the slide number 7, which 

purports to show a radius around the proposed installation.  

That doesn't have the installation at the center of the 

yellow circle.   

          If you did put it at the center of the yellow 

circle, you'd see very quickly what Russell was trying to 

talk about here earlier -- namely, you'd see that there's a 

lot more residential property that’s included within the 

54

radius of 300 feet.   

          You see that -- take a look at slide 7 again, if 

you could pull that up.  You can see it.  It's purporting to 

show a circle, and then the installation is over in the 

left-hand side of the circle.   

          So that most of the circle includes in effect the 

building of the Star Market, not the residencies, which if 

you put the installation that's proposed at the center of 

that circle, the boundary would go out over into Spruce 

Avenue, which -- as has very correctly been pointed out by 

Mr. Russell -- is not a permitted area to park.   

          Anybody who parks there can have their cars tagged 

and towed at their own expense, which is not going to 

contribute to customer satisfaction, even if they do find 

the space. 

          The other problem is that the whole thing is being 

predicated on some numbers of foot traffic, without any 

assessment of the character of the foot traffic.  Nobody 

seems to have in their study team spent any time in this 

neighborhood figuring out who goes in and out of Star Market 

over this little bridge.   

          Now, in addition to the new traffic that's got to 

55

be coming in when the Greenway is completed, there's a whole 

lot of traffic now that is very young "students" is the word 

for them; I guess "children" would be more appropriate in 

the sense they're being sent out by parents to get things at 

Star Market.  It's already very crowded as foot traffic. 

          And if you have the amounts that you've been 

talking about realistically coming in on their feet, you 

know, from the buses and the like, it is true that -- you 

pointed out, there is a kind of convergence of three bus 

lines right here. 

          And that's very attractive, I'm sure, to those who 

intend to make a profit off of this business, but it's not 

very attractive to those who'd have to live in the 

neighborhood and make their way back and forth, either on 

bicycles, cars or walking. 

          Thirdly, the space that's designated --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Wieskel, can you 

          TIM WIESKEL:  -- as available for parking 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- can you wrap up, 

--  

please?  

          TIM WIESKEL:  The space that's designated as

available for parking is in fact heavily used by Star Market 

customers.  Now, you're going to see some very active 

citizen interaction on those spaces that are used regularly 

for 15-minute stops to get a quart of milk at Star Market.  

If this were thought through, it might be a feasible idea, 

but I'd --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Wieskel --  

          TIM WIESKEL:  -- urge the owners to look for a 

place where parking is available.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So next -- and I apologize if I'm 

mispronouncing anyone or everyone's name -- Jessica Pires is 

followed by Angelina Kounelis.  Jessica, can you start by 

giving your name, spelling it, and giving your address?   

          JESSICA PIRES:  Hello, my name is Jessica Pires, 

J-e-s-s-i-c-a P-i-r-e-s.  Can you hear me? 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.   

          JESSICA PIRES:  The address --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And complete the address, yeah.   

          JESSICA PIRES:  -- the address is 6 Fairview 

Avenue in Cambridge.

ahead.   

          JESSICA PIRES:  Okay, thank you.  I would like to 

submit my comments and voice in support of this 

establishment.  I'm a longtime resident of Strawberry Hill.  

I have heard comments about what this neighborhood is 

characterized by and who makes us this neighborhood, so I'm 

glad to submit this voice. 

          As a black resident who has grown up here, I went 

to Haggerty School.  I shop at all of these businesses, and 

my first point, which I don't want to belabor, but I would 

like to respectfully disagree with the comments about 

parking and about foot traffic.   

          I find this to be -- though Mount Auburn Street 

itself with traffic is really congested, it is like that 

everywhere around us.  I don't personally feel that this is 

going to make it significantly worse. 

          I do park in that little area.  I always find 

parking if I need to park there.   I know that I'm not 

suppose park there for Star Market, and those who do should 

know that they shouldn't park there either. And just to 

address the parking at night, I never see people parking in 

that space at night.

          I'm someone who rides the 73 bus every day.  

Sometimes it's 71 or 72; it is a very convenient bus to 

take.  I would say the majority of people do actually get 

off at that stop.  I can attest to the hypothesis that many 

people would be traveling via public transportation to this 

location, and that if they can't find parking, they will go 

somewhere else. 

          If this were the very first dispensary in the 

area, I would say I think a lot of would be queuing or any 

of these concerns, but because so many have now started and 

are operating and getting their feet wet, I don't personally 

have any issue with that. 

          I'm someone who suffers from asthma, all of these 

other things.  I'm not concerned at all about smoke in the 

area, because any -- in my opinion -- any logical person 

who's buying product at a place like this is not going to 

smoke it nearby, they're going to go home and participate in 

whatever after school activity. 

          I'm not personally a marijuana user, and I am in 

support of this business. 

          I would also just like to address a little bit 

more about the importance to me as a community member, as

someone who lives in the Strawberry Hill neighborhood, that 

this is a business being submitted for approval by people 

from Strawberry Hill, not someone from outside of the state; 

not someone from elsewhere in Massachusetts, even. 

          These are people who are from Cambridge, and it's 

really important to me that they are residents or former 

residents who are bringing money back into this neighborhood 

-- especially after this pandemic.  So many of the stores in 

this business corridor are closed.   

          There's For Lease signs everywhere.  And to me, 

that's depressing to drive through and see that.  I would 

like to see money coming back in here.  I would like to see 

more life in this neighborhood. 

          Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So there are -- some of the names 

have changed, but I now have a William Taylor as next, 

followed by Ryan Reardon.  So William Taylor, can you start 

by giving your name and spelling your name and giving your 

address.  And you can unmute yourself first. 

          WILLIAM TAYLOR:  Hello, can you hear me?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you. You can start

by giving your name, spelling your name and giving your 

address.   

          WILLIAM TAYLOR:  Yeah, hi.  My name is William 

Taylor, W-i-l-l-i-a-m, last name Taylor T-a-y-l-o-r.  I live 

at 28 Holworthy, right next to Haden Guest.  So I am a 

neighbor that is clearly within the 300 foot radius, and I 

am very concerned about the potential influx of customers 

and the detrimental impact that this business will have on 

the neighborhood, for various reasons. 

          One, the parking I think is a huge issue.  Second, 

the -- just the number of people and the type of people that 

will be coming really concerns me.   

          And like some of the other neighbors had said, you 

know, this is a family community.  I have small children.  

Haden has small children.  Lots of people have small 

children.  We walk from our house to the bus to the 

supermarket, and with such an influx of people looking for 

cannabis, I would be concerned as a parent and as a resident 

what that will do to my community. 

          If we're looking for a business to really active 

this area, I think this is the wrong business.  I mean, you 

know, there's cafes, there's coffee shops -- those types of 

61

businesses have a lot of benefit to the community.  I do not 

believe that this type of business will have the same type 

of positive contribution that some of the other businesses 

that I mentioned could.   

          Safety: If -- like I said earlier, I am concerned 

about the safety of the children.  It does seem a little bit 

like a half-baked plan.   

          You know, this sort of trying to understand about 

second forms of egress, and access via back door -- it just 

doesn't seem like if there's no queuing allowed on the 

street, it doesn't seem like you're adequately supplying 

space within the establishment.  I think the egress is a 

concern.   

          And I've actually -- I've been doing a little 

research, and I do not -- there is a plan in the works, 

based on a transportation study that's only in the design 

phases, but they're talking about changing all of that 

parking in front of this establishment and removing it.   

          It's a design proposal, but so here we have an 

establishment that is going to go in, and then we have the 

Transportation Department that is thinking of taking away 

parking.  I think it's a bad combination.  And I wouldn't be

surprised if people start parking in Star, and then there's 

going to be issues and conflicts with that.   

          But I'm adamantly against it, and I would like to 

see -- I'm in support of this business, I just think this is 

the wrong location. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  So the next name is Ryan 

Reardon.  Can you start by giving your name and spelling 

your name and giving your address?   

          RYAN REARDON:  Hi, can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.   

          RYAN REARDON:  Hi, I'm Ryan Reardon, R-y-a-n R-e-

a-r-d-o-n.  I live at 135 Holworthy Street, Cambridge.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  You can go ahead.        

          THE REPORTER:  Sir, can you repeat your street 

name, please?     

          RYAN REARDON:  135 Holworthy, H-o-l-w-o-r-t-h-y 

Street.  I'm for this business.  I would like to second 

everything Ms. Pires said.  She said it very eloquently.   

          And for parking, past a certain time there's not a 

lot of people that park up at Star Market in that front 

little horseshoe area.  Most of those spots are open every 

day.  There's not a lot of people up at the bus stop just

hanging around.  So I'm for this business.  I think Mike and 

Marcus are great guys.  They're from Strawberry Hill, they 

give back to the community and I think they'll do nothing 

but good if they get a spot to show.  So thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the next speaker: A hand came up 

again from Angeline Kounelis.  I've just unmuted you, if you 

could unmute yourself, please give your name and spell your 

name and give your address. 

          ANGELINE KOUNELIS:  Thank you so much for the 

opportunity.  I'm Angeline Kounelis, A-n-g-e-l-i-n-e K-o-u-

n-e-l-i-s.  And I reside at 55 Keenan, K-e-e-n-a-n Street in 

Watertown.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.   

          ANGELINE KOUNELIS:  And I am the District A 

Councilor in Watertown.  Just to give you a little bit of 

background, about a year and a half ago I received an 

anonymous telephone call on a Sunday afternoon from someone 

who thought that I should be made clear of this particular 

proposal.   

          And I still don't know who the person was, but I 

certainly thank them.  In Watertown, we're not aware of 

projects or plans.

          I contacted the Liza Paden Planning office, and 

asked her to keep me apprised of the ongoing work.  And the 

beginning of this year I saw the notice posted on the window 

of the storefront, and immediately contacted Liza, and then 

eventually she sent me this particular meeting note. 

          One of the speakers indicated that the radius 

circle on one of the charts was not accurate.  And I did 

request from Liza the mailing list, and there are four 

properties in Watertown that are within the 300 foot radius, 

and six people, or six property owners were notified.  Two 

of these properties are common neighbors. 

          I think it's also very important to note for the 

record, even though what I'm going to say is otherwise 

outside -- Sacred Heart Church is on Mount Auburn Street.  

Within that complex is an elementary school.   

          I have great concerns that because of the parking 

issues, folks will decide to park in Watertown -- the 

closest street is St. Mary's Street.  It comes between Mount 

Auburn Street and Belmont Street.   

          And if in fact the patrons were to park there, 

they would be walking past the school and Sacred Heart, and 

also, BB&N -- at least at the Sacred Heart complex, and

where their administering office is.  I'm not sure if any 

students actually are on site at any time.   

          So there are concerns.  Marijuana facilities -- 

cannabis facilities are certainly going to be infiltrating 

an area within the confines of the law, but I think it's 

incumbent upon all of us to ensure that all the guidelines 

are met, and that our communities are going to be safe and 

properly maintained. 

          And we also need to think about litter associated 

with folks patronizing on an in and out basis.  And I don't 

think that Watertown should be the recipient, nor should 

Cambridge.  And there need to be provisions about queuing 

and about littering, and about cleanliness of the area 

surrounding the facility.  Thank you very much for giving me 

this opportunity.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And there is one name, that's 

another hand that's gone up.  Kaspar Torosian, can you give 

your name and address and spell your name? You may need to 

unmute yourself.   

          KASPAR TOROSIAN:  Kaspar Torosian.  K-a-s-p-a-r, 

last name T-o-r-o-s-i-a-n.  A few comments.

you could give your address, please?   

          KASPAR TOROSIAN:  It's 659 Belmont Street in 

Belmont, Massachusetts.  Mount Auburn Street is hardly youth 

area, and to say that kids go to Star Market unchaperoned; 

never see that.  I don't know what they're talking about.   

          The circle where it's centered, I'm looking at the 

circle right now.  It's centered on the front door of the 

establishment. It seems perfectly fine with me. 

          You know, the average person that goes to a place 

like -- that sells product like this, they want to take 

their purchase and go home.  I mean, I don't see why people 

have a problem understanding that.   

          And the pandemic has, like, changed everything.  

Nobody goes into stores anymore.  If they have to go there, 

they're in and out real fast.   

          And the parking is not going away.  I've gone to 

the meetings.  If anything, they're trying to figure out a 

way to make more parking over there. 

          And the only other thing I really want to say is, 

you know Cambridge was all in favor of this type of an 

establishment when they voted on it a long time ago.  And 

this sounds like a "Not in My Back Yard" type of thing.  And

I just want to apologize to the gentleman for all the racist 

comments I'm hearing about, "We don't want those type of 

people coming into our neighborhood."   

          My goodness.  I can't believe what I'm hearing in 

                        st

this day in age, the 21  century and in light of what's 

going on now in the United States.  I'm horrified that I'm 

hearing this from the Cambridge community. 

          And I just hope that both Marcus and Michael, you 

know, understand that that's not the common people that live 

in this area.  It just isn't.  We are not racist.  I give 

them all my support, and I can't wait to see the place open. 

          Thank you very much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So there is another name that 

appeared -- I apologize again for pronunciation -- Aminata 

Lawrence.  I've unmuted you; you can unmute yourself and 

give your name, spell your name and give your address. 

          AMINATA LAWRENCE:  Hello, my name is Aminata 

Lawrence.  Can you hear?   

your address.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.  Please give 

          AMINATA LAWRENCE:  Aminata Lawrence, spelled A-m-

i-n-a-t-a, last name is L-a-w-r-e-n-c-e.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  If you can give your address and 

proceed.   

          AMINATA LAWRENCE:  My address is One Brookline 

Place, Cambridge, Massachusetts.  I just want to say that I 

am in favor of this first.  I want to start off by 

addressing some of the things I heard about "these type of 

people" and having these things in our area affecting our 

children.   

          I want people to keep in mind that this is also 

their area.  This is our area.  Despite the gentrification 

issues, this is our home.  They have taken the time not to 

do this illegally but legally, to make sure that these 

things are happening and provided for the people who need 

them. 

          A couple of things I heard is, "having this type 

of place there."  It's more of if there was a pharmacy, 

would you expect people to get their medication and then 

open up and pop the pills right in front of the place?   

          Are you not going to let CVS open up if it was a 

CVS that was going to be there?  So don't take it because 

it's marijuana as something that's going to be negative.   

          I also wanted to touch base on the safety of

children.  I don't think that any children will be harmed 

due to this store being placed there.  And if someone could 

elaborate on how they feel like a child could be harmed, 

that would help me. 

          Also, another note that I took was "those people." 

Not sure who made that, "those people" statement but I think 

that that should really say a lot about how people are 

looking at this situation.   

          They're not looking at it as minorities who have 

gone to school, got their educations, made money, and are 

coming back to give to their community.  And I think that 

should be taken into consideration, and I am for this.  

Thank you. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So that is -- all the speakers -- 

so I would remind the speakers that everyone only has one -- 

the procedures are that people have one opportunity to speak 

during public comment.   

          I'll just ask if there are other members who 

haven't spoken yet who would like to speak at this time, you 

should click the "Raise hand" button.  Or if you're on your 

phone, press *9. And I'll give it a few seconds, and then 

turn it over to the Chair.       

70

          [Pause] 

          Hi.  I do see one hand that's raised now.  

Catherine, I'm going to say "Wieskel" based on the previous 

speaker.  You can start by giving your name, spelling your 

name and giving your address. 

          CATHERINE WIESKEL:  Sure.  I'm Catherine Wieskel, 

W-e-i-s-k-e-l, and I'm at 6 Spruce Avenue.  Can you all hear 

me?   

ahead.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you, please go 

          CATHERINE WIESKEL:  Great.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I'm sorry about your name, I 

got it wrong again.   

          CATHERINE WIESKEL:  Great.  I would still 

respectfully disagree about the traffic issue here.  There 

are 15 parking spaces there, and based on the number of 

people, I had no idea that there could be that much traffic 

going through there, numbers of people.   

          And I don't think there's any way that those 15 

parking spots out front are going to be able to be managed, 

even with the short in and out time period. 

          And not to mention, you're talking about

deliveries there and trucks dropping off things.  And so, 

that's going to mean no one's going to pay attention to the 

fact that when they can't park there, they're going to park 

on the side streets, they're going to park in the Star 

Market.   

          I mean, I respectfully disagree with those people 

who just said that those spaces aren't used.  Because when I 

walk in at the Star Market, those people are -- there are 

people parking there all the time.   

          The other thing I wanted to say is that in terms 

of the design, I find it really odd that whole issue of the 

basement there where the delivery is.  Of course, there's 

going to be the bike path down there, so there's going to be 

a lot of -- eventually a lot of people and families and 

everything going through there.   

          And how that delivery system is going to work 

seems pretty sketchy in terms of not well thought out to me.  

Because deliveries -- again, in this neighborhood there are 

lots of trucks and stuff like that, and that’s only going to 

add to the congestion here. 

          And I would strongly disagree with the neighbors 

that live particularly close to this space, that I think the

traffic is based on the number of people is really -- the 

proportion is just way out of whack.  And there's just no 

way you should consider it in any way.   

          I mean, if you want to do this, you should put it 

in an area where there is parking and people can come and 

go.  But I mean you're kidding yourself if you think that 

our neighborhood isn't going to be flooded with lots of cars 

that aren't currently here.  And it's just too much.   

          So thank you.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:   So those are all the members I see 

on the list.  I can turn it back over to the Chair and your 

discretion.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  We will now move on from public comment to discussion 

with staff.  If this hearing is continued to a future date 

and additional information is received, there will be an 

opportunity for the public to comment on any additional 

materials. 

          And again, any written comments -- additional 

written comments may also be submitted for the file. 

          So we have received memos on this application back 

in march from the Community Development Department and

Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department staff.  Staff 

from both departments are available.   

          So I'm going to start with Adam, since some of the 

traffic and parking issues associated with this application 

seemed to be kind of part of mind for a lot of folks. 

          Adam, if you could refresh our memories on the 

memo and what was looked at in terms of impacts on Traffic 

and Parking and what the Department has discussed with the 

applicant, that would be very helpful.    

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Can you 

hear me?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, we can.   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  So this is Adam Shulman, 

Transportation Planner in the Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation Department.  Let me see.   

          So we did submit a comment letter to the Planning 

Board on March 12, 2020.  It's not all that different than a 

lot of the other comment letters that have been submitted to 

the Planning Board for the other cannabis stores -- cannabis 

retail stores in Cambridge. 

          For this one, some of the key issues -- well, and 

again, not unlike other ones, was of course parking and --

you know, of course we always look to the applicant to 

determine whether they think there's enough parking to meet 

their needs.   

          And so, that's why they provide -- they're 

required or they're asked to provide, rather, a logistics 

plan; a transportation and logistics plan and a 

transportation summary form and an analysis on trip 

generation and parking needs, so that the Planning Board can 

see what they said, and so that you guys can decide whether 

you have concerns or not on that. 

          So, you know, so I've encouraged, you know, to 

look at that carefully.  But a couple comments that we made 

in our memo, on a high level, this area is not necessarily 

as accessible to transit as, for instance, Harvard Square or 

Porter Square or a Central Square location.  So of course 

this area is served by a couple of bus routes -- by three 

bus routes, I believe. 

          But it's not known as sort of a very transit-

oriented location.  So what we expect is that there will be 

a fair amount of people driving to the site like this at 

this location.  Their study I believe estimated somewhere -- 

a little over 50 percent, maybe 55 percent of their 

75

customers will drive to the site -- meaning, you know, 

nearly 40 percent taking public transit. 

          That's a little concerning on how realistic that 

will be.  They used data from surveys done at a site at 1000 

Mass Ave, which is sort of between Harvard Square and 

Central Square, which is also not a project that's directly 

within -- you know, right there within transit.  But it's 

between Harvard and Central.  It's a little bit closer to a 

transit stop in this site. 

          So they're being very optimistic as to how many 

people would be, you know, not driving.  So they used that 

information to estimate what their parking demands would be 

also.  And I think they estimated in their study somewhere 

around 25 parking spaces needed in the peak hour. 

          You know, and that might be a little bit lower 

than actually needed, given what they were using to base 

those estimates on. 

          On the other hand, if they're doing things like 

appointment-only, then they will have a lot of control as to 

how many people will come and go to the site, and therefore 

also how many parking spaces would be needed. 

          So it kind of goes both ways, I think, in terms of 

76

22

in that -- you know, it -- the parking will be based on the 

demand of people.   

          And that will be based on whether they have this 

as appointment-only and will have themselves control, or 

whether it's not an appointment-only program, in which, you 

know, it will be the market that will decide how many people 

could go there.  

          I think one comment that someone made was that if 

people were to go to this site, drive to this site and can't 

find parking, then they're likely to not come back to this 

site.  I think that's actually a good comment, a reasonable 

comment. 

          On the other hand, if people come to the site, 

don't find parking, drive away, come back again looking for 

parking, find parking and, you know, or not -- drive away, 

come back again, so we don't -- we also don't want -- we 

want to be cautious about sort of the circling, people 

circling around waiting for parking.  Because that adds more 

traffic.   

          And we certainly would be careful, cautious and 

concerned about people trying to park in places that they 

shouldn't park.  And that goes to a comment that I think the

applicant made, or the presenter made, which is people might 

be tempted to park in the Star Market parking lot, which of 

course is for only Star Market customers.   

          And so, that's a concern.  That could become a 

problem.  But that would be a private problem issue between, 

like, two private property owns. 

          But, you know, nobody I think wants to see those 

kinds of problems occur.  Their bike parking plans were a 

little unclear exactly what they were proposing.  There 

weren't really clear detailed plans as to, you know, whether 

they were -- where and whether, exactly where and how they 

were putting in short-term bike parking or long-term bike 

parking, it was a little confusing. 

          Usually we like to see a scaled plan of something 

like one inch equals 10 feet, so we can really kind of zoom 

in and see parking, the bike parking and know that it's 

going to meet the city's guidelines and that it's going to 

be functional, and it's going to be working. 

          They seem to be showing some bike parking down on 

the lower level, but it's -- that -- I'm not sure how then 

those customers get in and out of the store, I guess using 

stairs or not, and how people even access the store if 

78

they're on the sort of lower level, the basement level, the 

-- you know, underneath the bridge pathway. 

          So it's just some things were a little difficult 

to understand in that respect. 

          The loading, they did say that they were expecting 

that they were just going to use loading by parking in the 

parking meters in front of the site.  You know, they did 

show in their application two loading zones -- I think they 

labeled it as loading zones, but there were some parking 

meters.  So it's one or the other. 

          Of course, if no one's parking in (sic) the 

parking meter, then in their delivering product, they can 

park in that parking meter.  But they'll never really know.  

It's hard to know when those spaces will be available or not 

available.   

          So there were some comments I've heard from the 

public, which was very interesting about what actually is 

the real parking utilization of those 15 parking spaces, or 

even some of the other parking spaces on the street on some 

of those other streets. 

          So they did provide a new traffic study 

information, and so, they did go out.  I think there was one

day in November, and maybe one day during the week and one 

day on a weekend, on a Saturday.  And they did -- they 

counted 43 I believe parking spaces that they believe would 

be potentially available to customers.   

          And I think they found that on that one particular 

day, there was -- let me see, so I give you the -- it was 

about eight to 15 available spaces between 10:00 a.m. and 

7:00 p.m. 

          So it's -- that's just one day of data.  So it's 

almost like as I was hearing people from the public talking, 

it was almost like they were all probably partly right.  

It's probably different a little bit every day, and there's 

probably some days someone might go there and there might be 

some spaces -- a handful of spaces that are available.  And 

there might be times when they go there and there isn't.   

          So there -- it would be helpful if there was more 

information, maybe more studies, more days of data to just 

really get a better understanding on what the baseline 

available parking spaces are.   

          However, given what they said, which was there's 

about eight to 15 or so parking spaces on a weekday 

available and only I think on a Saturday between three and 

80

seven available spaces from one day of looking at it:  

That's a fairly low number, when they also said they needed 

about 25 parking spaces for customers during peak times. 

          So the math doesn't quite add up super well in 

their favor, without having a good plan, in terms of how 

they're going to address this issue. 

          The Traffic Department, as always, also recommends 

that if this project is improved, we encourage or recommend 

the Planning Board to implement, to require as part of the 

Special Permit Transportation Demand Management measures.  

So those were in our memo.  We also, if it's approved, 

require some contribution towards transportation -- small 

contributions towards transportation improvements. 

          So that was in our memo also. 

          So I think I'll just -- I think I'll leave it at 

that, and see if anyone has any questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you, Adam.  Do Board members have questions for Adam?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Adam, just one question.  On 

the chart that's part of the presentation, it shows one side 

81

of Spruce Avenue, and it's labeled as permit parking.  At 

least one of the members of the public indicated that Spruce 

is a private way, and that it is not permit parking.  Do you 

know which is accurate?   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  I -- off the top of my head, 

honestly, I don't know the status.  I don't know the 

situation with Spruce Avenue.  I'd have to go look it up in 

the city's parking streets and ways information.  So I don't 

know off the top of my head.   

          I -- you know, I actually don't think those spaces 

were included in the 43 spaces that were evaluated as part 

of the parking study.  But I would have to go back and 

double check that. 

street.     

          So, sorry, I don't -- I'd have to get back to you 

as to whether that street actually is a public or a private 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions for 

Adam?  All right.  We also have Erik Thorkildsen from CDD 

here, if anyone has any questions about the Urban Design or 

other elements of the design discussion that Eric might have 

gone over, either in his memo or with the applicant.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Catherine, I didn't hit my button 

quickly enough.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, okay.  Sorry, 

Hugh.  Before I let Adam go, then:  Hugh, question for Adam?         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.  Is it within the purview of 

the Traffic and Parking Department to change some of the 

meters in the 15-space lot to have shorter durations, that 

might help facilitate use for the local businesses?    

          ADAM SHULMAN:  So yes, in that the Traffic 

Department has the ability -- of course the Director of the 

Traffic Department has the ability to change regulations.  

You know, and things like metered timings -- you know, 

whether it's a 15-minutes or a one-hour or two-hour, things 

of that nature…  or frankly whether there's parking meters 

there or not.  That's definitely something the Traffic 

Department -- and, you know, again, the Director, is 

authorized to control. 

          So yeah, that's something that certainly could be 

evaluated by the Department.  You know, I would just say 

that there's always caution about making time limited 

parking too short, because it becomes really difficult, and 

actually takes extra staff.

          And whether we have the capabilities or not to 

actually enforce it, when -- you know, when they have, like 

a two-hour versus a one-hour: we just -- there needs to be 

more enforcement personnel to be there to actually enforce 

it every hour, checking to see if someone is overstaying the 

time limit versus -- you know, when it's longer time limits 

it takes less need for personnel to enforce it.   

          And we don't really like having time limits that 

are becoming not very well -- not enforceable.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Let me ask one 

more time and pause a little longer this time:  Any further 

questions before I let Adam go?   

          [Pause] 

          All right.  We'll switch over to Erik now.  Any 

questions for Erik Thorkildsen from CDD?                 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I have a question for Erik.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  The portion of the building that 

faces the new Greenway is extremely unsightly now.  It's 

unclear from the plans on the Greenway site whether there's 

going to be trees planted there or not; the Landscape Plan 

says no, the Tree Plan says yes.

          But I'm wondering if you could just give some 

attention to try to help them make that base of the building 

-- paint, or a mural, or ivy or whatever.        

          THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry, Hugh, you just cut out 

for a minute.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I was thinking that the options 

for sprucing up the building might be paint or artwork or 

plantings.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Erik?  Do you 

have any comments on the design facing that future Greenway, 

or any other aspects you want to draw the Board's attention 

to?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  That sounds like a 

really good idea.  I can see on the site plan the property 

line extends several feet out from that façade.  So they -- 

you know, I don't know maybe five feet or something. So, you 

know, there's space there that could be planted.  And the 

façade is certainly an option for some kind of art along 

there, and that would go well with other thoughts we've had 

on other paths through the city. 

          Would you like -- sorry, I should have begun with, 

"Thank you, Thank you, Madam Chair."  And this is Erik

Thorkildsen, E-r-i-k T-h-o-r-k-i-l-d-s-e-n, CDD.  Anyway, 

just a few high points from the memo, if you'd like?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, that would be 

great.       

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.  The wood rainscreen on 

the front façade seems good in concept -- probably some 

details need to be resolved, how it turns corners, and so 

on.  The new location of the entry moved from the existing 

center over to the right-hand edge of the façade also seems 

okay.   

          The art display wall, as you've seen in a lot of 

others of these, seems like a reasonable way to deal with 

the issue -- the conflict between -- you know, pedestrian 

activation and hiding the product from public view. 

          It has clear store lighting above, as we had often 

seen, so the interior is somewhat connected to the outside.  

          Just a few points: The vestibule seems very small 

compared to some of the facilities that we've seen, if it's 

going to be used for waiting.   

          So the whole question about customer access and, 

you know, where are they coming from, how long are they 

waiting, where are they waiting? is really an important

question.   

          The -- in terms of the façade, the applicant could 

consider a few things; perhaps reducing the height of that 

knee wall below the windows to match the lower height on the 

adjoining storefront -- for instance, what you see on the 

left there, and thereby increasing the amount of glazing…  

perhaps adjusting the height of -- you know, lowering the 

top of the art, leave a little bit more space.   

          The entry itself has a sort of odd geometry.   

Because of the angled wall to the right of the façade you 

see a plan.  And so, we thought it might be good to think a 

little bit about the configuration of all that, to sort of 

avoid that little -- you know, trapezoidal nook there to the 

right, so that it's not a, you know, an acute corner. 

          The applicant could consider providing a canopy 

along the façade, and if possible, street trees in the 

sidewalk in front of the facility. 

          Let's see…  And also, it would be good to have 

additional information about the administration and curation 

of rotating art displays.  Adam hit on a few points; we had 

asked also about the bicycle parking.  Really, how does that 

work?  Is there space, dimension plans and so on. 

          So those were really the high points.  Do you have 

87

any questions?     

          [Pause]   

questions for Erik?     

          [Pause] 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do Board members have 

          Seeing no hands and no one is speaking up, Erik 

thank you so much for your memo and for summarizing the high 

points for us now.       

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.  You're welcome.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Okay.  So 

then we can turn to discussion from the Board or additional 

questions for the applicant.  Again, happy to have Board 

members speak up.  Just start with your name or raise your 

hand on the panel, and I'll be happy to recognize you.   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  This is Steve.  I guess I could 

start off quickly.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Can you hear me?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.  Thanks, Steve.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  First of all, I guess we heard 

some comments of opposition, and then that neighbor was

accused of racism.  And, you know, that's really an 

unacceptable slur, from my perspective.   

          Some may oppose, some may support this.  There's 

absolutely no grounds or basis for using that.  Calling 

somebody racist is about the greatest slur that one can use 

in our society.  So I apologize to that person on behalf of 

the Board, and I think that that that was out of step.   

          Secondly, I understand and sympathize with the 

neighbors who are, you know, skeptical and concerned about 

the marijuana dispensary right in their neighborhood and 

with their kids going by and so forth.   

          But as I've said in other such hearings, this 

train has left the station already.  The state has decided 

that such dispensaries are permissible.   

          Our city in particular has made that decision.  

And frankly, while at the beginning of this movement there 

was some -- you know, concerns and speculation about how it 

might actually play out, we now have some experience over 

the past year or two, and I think that we have really seen 

absolute no evidence of any detrimental impact on 

communities or on children. 

          So while I'm sympathetic with the expressed

concern of some neighbors, I don't think that there's really 

a basis for that concern.  And we really need to be focusing 

more on the actual facts of the application. 

          And while there are many elements of the 

application, I think the biggest question, which is obvious 

to me, is the parking.   

          And we've heard some inconsistent numbers, and 

some of the numbers I think do raise legitimate concerns 

about whether there will be adequate parking to support this 

establishment, and what will be the consequences if there 

are adequate parking. 

          Well, I guess I don't know what the answer to that 

is -- whether there is adequate parking, but if there isn't 

adequate parking, what will be the consequences?   

          Well, the consequences will be that this 

establishment will not be successful, and maybe it will fail 

if more of its customers want parking and it can't provide 

the parking.   

          I don't see any great detrimental impact to the 

community if it turns out that this establishment doesn't 

have enough parking.  I'm not sure I believe there are too 

many places where customers could be parking in the

neighborhoods and therefore have a detrimental impact. 

          And if in fact we find that that's the case -- I 

don't think it will be, but if it is -- well, that can be 

addressed with enforcement.  So basically, unless this 

tenant is able to establish patterns whereby there is 

adequate parking for the needs, the establishment simply is 

going to fail. 

          And so, as I say, I think that is the most 

substantial issue, and I think ultimately, it's more of an 

issue and a risk for the tenant than it is for the 

neighborhood.   

          So summarizing, I have no objection to the 

application.  I think that it's not an inappropriate 

location.  I don't think it will have a detrimental impact 

on the neighborhood. 

          Unless I hear something to the contrary that might 

persuade me otherwise, I'm prepared to support the 

application.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you, 

Steve.  Is there another Board member who wants to weigh in 

on this?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, I will.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  This is Mary Flynn.  My first thought 

is -- you know, Steve mentioned he has sympathy for the 

neighbors, and I do as well.  I mean, I think when a new 

type of establishment such as this one, you know, is 

proposed in an area, when it's the first one, I think people 

are very skeptical and scared about the impacts.   

          But as he said, you know, it is now -- it is now 

legal to have these establishments and Cambridge did vote 

overwhelmingly in favor of shops.  So far, we've seen more 

of them along -- you know, Mass Ave and in the squares; not 

too many in the outlier areas.  So this one is unique in 

that way.   

will go elsewhere. 

          But I think Steve is correct in that, you know, if 

parking becomes that difficult, you know, eventually people 

          Adam's point about people circling around:  I can 

tell you I shop at the Star Market all the time, and 

occasionally I will park in that area where there are 15 

spots.  And I'm telling you, it is almost impossible to do 

an easy circle in that area.  You have to go blocks out of 

your way to be able to do it.

          So people may do it once, but they're not going to 

do it on a continual basis when they see how difficult it 

is. 

          So I support the business.  I'm happy to know that 

the gentlemen are from the area and are interested in having 

a business in the area where they grew up.  I do have some 

concerns about the parking, though, even with that.   

          And I'm not sure that I totally feel like we 

should just leave it to, you know, if there's not enough 

then they, you know, they won't succeed.  I actually would 

prefer I think to keep the appointment-only in place for as 

long as we have to, until -- you know, there is more data 

either on the use of the existing spaces there, or -- you 

know, just more data in general about how the parking trends 

work in these areas.   

          The appointment-only just seems like a very easy 

way to do this with the parking that's available. 

          I don't go in that area very many, because -- that 

15 space area, just because it's so -- as Hugh said -- once 

you're in and trying to get out and go back, it's 

impossible.  So I think, you know, when I have gone there, 

there have been spaces.  But I'm usually going off hours.

          So I don't know, you know, I don't know if short-

term parking would help it, but I do think appointments 

will.  You know, maybe as people will get lucky and get a 

space there.  But certainly having the appointments will 

minimize the number of people searching.   

          So in general, I am in support.  I do like several 

of Erik's comments, though, particularly the one about the 

vestibule and taking a look at that in terms of the 

circulation.  And more information on bicycle parking I 

think is important, since we are looking at these 

alternative modes of transportation. 

          I do agree -- I don't think that the bus route is 

going to be particularly helpful for this business, yet they 

are there, and certainly people can use them.  But, you 

know, to me it's quite a ride from Harvard Square out to 

here or back. 

          So, again, just a little bit of additional 

information on a few areas, but in general I'm very 

supportive of the proposal.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thanks Mary.  

Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.  I don't have a problem

with the use.  The location is tough.  I think there's going 

to be a big nuisance problem in this area from the problem 

in the area with parking.   

          I'd also like to see something done with the 

interior of the building to make some room for some more 

queuing, even if it's pedestrians and bicycles.  There's 

still at some point going to be some lines here.  And if 

their numbers are correct, they're going to be sizeable.  So 

I think a little adjustment on the interior would be 

required. 

          And about the driving around the block, well, I 

think a lot of people are going to get dropped off and 

picked up.  There's also a nice, picturesque place across 

the state to drive around while you wait for someone.   

          There are a couple of problems (sic) in the 

neighborhood.  Star Market and the cemetery make very good 

places to cruise the neighborhood.   I know it's not their 

fault, but it does make a tough location if the numbers are 

correct.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Who wants to 

speak on this next?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Hi.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I heard Ted first, 

and then we'll go to Hugh.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So when I first saw the 

proposal and drove by it, I thought, "What a great place for 

a facility." That of course was based on my supposition that 

these stores were all part of the Star Market complex, and 

that people could park there.  Discovered that's not the 

case. 

          So I still think it's a fine location for this 

type of facility, and as Steve mentioned, you know, and Mary 

mentioned, the city voted overwhelmingly for adult-use, and 

it's going to be in all neighborhoods throughout the city, 

and that's just what's going to happen.   

          And, you know, there's a drugstore there in the 

Star Market that sells opioids.  I think they have a liquor 

department that sells liquor.  I mean, this is just another 

retail facility. 

          I agree that the parking is an issue.  I think 

this is one of the smaller facilities we've seen, and I 

think -- so it has a small vestibule, it has a small number 

96

of parking.   

          I think people are -- you know, when things are up 

and running throughout the city and throughout neighboring 

communities, people are going to make a determination, you 

know, do they want to go to a place where it's easy to find 

parking, where it's a large facility and they can easily get 

in it or out, or are they going to prefer something that's a 

little bit more of a boutique, where there may be fewer 

people and it may be a little bit hard parking.   

          So I do agree that, you know, the problem is going 

to be the proprietor's problem.  Either it's going to be 

successful because of the people and product, or it's not 

going to be successful because other places are easier to 

get to.   

          I do think that appointment-only for a while -- 

certainly the six month or a year -- until Traffic and 

Parking can determine that it's no longer necessary is 

really going to help alleviate things in the beginning, and 

until we know how everything plays out, both here and 

through all the other facilities that open up in the city. 

          You know, other than that, I -- you know, I think 

the design works fine from the exterior.  It's certainly an

improvement over the dry cleaner's façade.   

          I agree with Hugh's comment that it would be great 

if there was at least a painting, if not a mural or 

something on the side of the building facing the bike path, 

although I don't know how much these people have control 

over that, rather than the landlord. 

          Those are my comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Ted.  

Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I'm in general agreement with 

the comments expressed by my colleagues.  I think an 

extended appointment-only period that gets relaxed when 

Traffic and Parking determines that that will be okay…  I 

think they can make a couple of changes to the plan of the 

vestibule. 

          And I would recommend that the exit and the entry 

not (sic) could be separated -- either with railings, or be 

completely separate doors and circulation.  I think if you 

were -- and then I'd like to see a plan that would show 

queuing potential inside the store.  There's actually quite 

a bit of space there.   

          You might, for example you could slide the staff 

98

room over.  You'd have quite a large, like a 15- or 20- foot 

square space that could be, you know, a maze of queuing.  I 

think just we should look -- we should see some options, to 

see if that could be a little bit, the flow could be clear. 

          But I don't -- you know, I think the way this is 

going to sort out in the city is that when there are a 

number of establishments, no one establishment is going to 

become a focal point where there are going to be huge 

crowds.  So I don't see how it differs that much in permits 

that we've already given.   

          That's it.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you, 

Hugh.  Tom, I think that leaves you.  Do you want to weigh 

in on this one?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Sure.  Just quickly, 

uncharacteristically going last at this time.  I do have a 

lot of family across the street, and someday I likely would 

be joining them -- hopefully not too soon.   

          So I know this intersection well, and my kids went 

to Haggerty School, and my dearest friend lives on Lawn 

Street, who I see every week.  I've shopped at the Star 

Market for 37 years.

          That goes to the heart of my question about an 

hour ago about this has been a retail establishment in my 

personal experience for 37 years; this is another retail 

establishment.   

          I think with the extraordinary high level of focus 

and really good work by the staff here at Traffic and 

Parking, Urban Design and others from the city here who are 

really looking at this very, very carefully, I'm optimistic 

that we will address as many of the rubs as this new 

business might offer. 

          I would say -- probably using a bad metaphor, " 

home-grown," I'm in support of home-grown, and the home-

grown proprietors of this.  I'm delighted to see that 

they're back here try to do something entrepreneurial in our 

city.   

          I believe, yes, I encourage trees on the sidewalk.  

Hugh's keen comments about the north elevation:  Something 

should be done there, and I think Erik can follow up on 

that, absolutely, given some concerns about increased 

traffic here that the Adams caution about measuring the bike 

parking would be good. 

          But so, extended by appointment use only I think

also goes to the heart of how this will integrate well into 

the neighborhood.  So I'm in favor as well, Madam Chair.  

Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Tom.  Just 

to add my own comments to the mix here, I would say one of 

the speakers during public comment committed on the NIMBYism 

of some of the opposition to these facilities.   

          And I have to say that having sat on a great many 

of these at this point, it is disappointing to me how many 

neighborhoods -- and it is all of them in Cambridge -- seem 

to think that this is fine anywhere except near their 

family. 

          And that is deeply disappointing.  Because it is a 

-- you know, when people talk about, "the type of people" 

that will come to these facilities, we may all hear that 

differently, but it's never heard invitingly.  It is never 

heard less than judgmentally. 

          And as my colleague pointed out, you know, there 

are lots of facilities in this area that also sell legal 

products that are used by many of our neighbors, friends and 

family, and it is really, really sad to me that we have to 

keep having this conversation that this is something that

the city overwhelmingly voted in favor of, but nobody seems 

to want near their home. 

          It is not the city I hope Cambridge aspires to be, 

and I -- you know, again, it's not just this neighborhood; 

it has been literally every one of these applications for 

adult-use that we have heard.  And it makes me sad that we 

have to keep having that conversation.   

          That said, I think there are -- you know, every 

location is unique in terms of its operations.  And there 

are some legitimate issues about Traffic and Parking raised 

with this site, as there have been about sites in the 

Wellington-Harrington, or in North Cambridge that we have 

looked at. 

          And I really appreciate -- and my colleagues have 

been consistent in their messaging that while we definitely 

see this being, you know, maybe not enough parking for this 

particular use, I think -- you know, the comment that this 

was a retail use before, it's going to be a retail use now -

-  and if there's not enough parking for the customers that 

they need to survive, those customers will go elsewhere, and 

the business will not succeed.   

          It is not the Planning Board's job to decide which

businesses succeed.  It's to look at the criteria and apply 

them fairly across the board in all the districts where uses 

are allowed.  And this is one of those districts under these 

circumstances. 

          To me, the big question that we might talk about 

as a Board as to whether or not we would like the applicant 

to come back to us or merely work further with staff on is 

the interior circulation and the size of the vestibule.  We 

have seen a great many of these.   

          This vestibule is somewhat smaller and more 

pinched than many we've seen.  I think the interior 

circulation and queuing and how that works is important in 

terms of how it impacts the public rights of way around 

there. 

          And we want to make sure that it functions well, 

both in the immediate future when it will certainly be 

appointment-only, and then if the business is successful and 

to grow, it needs to be able to accommodate that queuing. 

          So I guess I'd like to hear from Board members, is 

that something you would like the applicant to come back 

with more information on, or is it something you feel that 

we can delegate to staff to work out during the operations

plan?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Catherine, this is Steve.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  You know, we had this discussion 

in other contexts -- in particular on Mass Ave in Central 

Square.  And in that context, if there were customers out on 

the street, it really impacted that retail area, where there 

are many people coming and going along the sidewalks.  And 

that would be detrimental and unacceptable. 

          In this particular context, I don't think we, or 

in any event I, had the same thought of concern.  Even if 

there were a couple of customers standing outside for -- I 

don't think it would be a great impact on the community, on 

the neighborhood, on the city.  So it's of less concern to 

me. 

          And frankly, the interior circulation in general, 

even though we do look at this interior circulation in these 

applications, generally speaking, we're not that concerned 

with interior design.   

          And so, while I or others might have our own 

opinions one way or the other, but what might be best, I 

don't think that we should be devoting all that much benefit 

104

from insights, but I wouldn't dwell too much on it. 

          So bottom line, I don't think it needs to come 

back to the Board, and I would be happy to defer on our 

great staff to work with the applicant and come up with the 

reasonable and best possible solutions.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other Board 

members?  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I agree.  I don't feel the need 

for it to come back, and it can stay with staff.  I think 

Hugh has made an interesting suggestion of moving the staff 

room and freeing up area there.   

          But I think that something that the proponents can 

work out with staff, and ultimately it will be a 

comfortable, welcoming place or it won't be, and customers 

will decide whether they like it or they don't.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Tom?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Steven Cohen said it beautifully.  

I don't believe the petitioner needs to come back.  I think 

there's been really good suggestions by the Board, and staff 

can work this out with them.  And I'm reluctant to extend 

our influence inside buildings too much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I agree with that

entirely.  I think our influence inside buildings should 

really be limited to those cases where we do think it's 

going to be affecting the public realm.   

          So if Board members feel that this is sufficiently 

different from other cases we've seen, where that's been a 

real concern, I'm happy to -- you know, have us move 

forward, and defer that discussion to the applicant with 

staff. 

          As for other people who want to comment on this, 

Lou, did you want to comment?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, just a quick one.  I 

also probably don't think it needs to come back.  But the 

point of a little relocation on the interior of the queuing 

area may give them a better acceptance in the community by 

not having queues on the sidewalk and interfering with 

pedestrian traffic.   

          I think they should take a serious look at that, 

and see if they can't make it a little more friendly for the 

people on the sidewalk.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  So 

it sounds to me like we are prepared to take action on this 

item.  Is there anyone from the Board who objects to moving

forward at this time?     

          [Pause]  

          All right.  Then staff has helped me out so that I 

do this a little more gracefully than I did last week.  So 

bear with me here.  So we can -- it sounds to me like the 

Board is prepared to grant the special permit with 

conditions, after making the findings that will go through, 

that the proposal conforms to the applicable criteria. 

          Again, I'll go through them, but I want to make 

sure that that is -- I want to hear if there's any objection 

from the Board that that is in fact the motion that we 

should be proceeding with.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  It's good.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right, no 

objection.  All right.  So in order to grant this special 

permit -- I need to pull this up -- the Board needs to find 

that this meets the following criteria:   

          So it complies with the zoning requirements that 

it is in a BA, BA-2, BA-3, et cetera. district or a BA-1 

district, as is the case here, only if it is designated by 

the Cannabis Control Commission as an Economic Empowerment 

applicant or as qualifying for its social equity program,

which Jeff you confirmed that that is the case in this 

situation, right?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That is correct.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  It 

is located in a permanent building, which this is.   

          It is not within 1800 feet of another cannabis 

retail store, which it is not.   

          It is not within 300 feet of an existing public or 

private K-12 school or within 300 feet of a public 

children's playground, public youth athletic field, or 

public youth recreation facility -- which it meets those 

criteria.  

products on site. 

          There is no packaging or repackaging of cannabis 

          And then it meets the special permit criteria 

specifically for this use, that the site design provides 

convenient, safe and secure access and egress for clients 

and employees arriving to and leaving from the site, using 

all modes of transportation, including drivers, pedestrians, 

bicyclists and transportation users.   

          We found that this is consistent with how other -- 

the type of access that has been provided at similar uses 

108

throughout the city, and that it is, therefore, a safe and 

secure and convenient for its clients and employees. 

          The location and design of the cannabis use will 

not detract from the sense of activity with opaque, 

unwelcoming façade at ground level and retail areas, and the 

applicant here has shown that they will provide artwork in 

the windows and that artwork will be -- what was the word 

that was used?  I believe "rotating" such that it 

contributes to a sense of dynamic activity within the space. 

          The loading, refuse and service areas are designed 

to be secure and shielded from abutting uses.  These -- the 

loading refuse and service areas in this case are not 

changing from the prior retail use.   

          And most of the shielding as I understand it will 

be by the time of day that those activities will be 

occurring, so as they don't interfere with other uses, or 

frankly the clients of the space. 

          And that the building and site design are 

compatible with other buildings in the area, to mitigate any 

negative aesthetic impacts that might require. 

          And that the facility will provide programs to 

assist qualifying patients in obtaining services under the

Medical Use of Marijuana program.  And again, that can be as 

simple as providing information for those patients on where 

they can participate in such a program.   

          Do any Board members have any objections to making 

any of those findings?   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  No.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  No, this is Tom.       

          MARY FLYNN:  No from Mary.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I hear no 

objection to making those findings.  As is usually the case, 

we would also need to make the findings for the General 

Special Permit Criteria.  Is there any object to making 

those findings that we do for General Special Permits?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  No.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  No.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So the 

conditions that we would need to include:  The CDD and 

Traffic and Parking memos contain suggestions to be included 

in the special permit decision, and then there are also the 

standard conditions for continuing review and certification 

by staff that the conditions are met. 

          Are there other conditions Board members would

like to specifically include?     

          [Pause] 

          Are there any other suggestions from staff or 

anything I've missed?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

Jeff, and aside from the comments that are mentioned in the 

memos, which include Urban Design, Transportation Mitigation 

and also, the just general ongoing conditions to make sure 

that the site conforms with the -- continues to conform with 

the city's requirements regarding Economic Empowerment 

applicants, and business -- relates to the business 

ownership. 

          There are -- I would just make sure that we're 

accentuating some of the points that were made by the 

Planning Board regarding the ongoing operation of an 

appointment-only system.   

          And that would be incorporated into the Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation Department's review of the 

ongoing operations plan for this facility…that there were 

some comments made by Planning Board members which would be 

reflected in the description regarding the design of the 

front façade and the side façade…  that staff would review

improvements per the Planning Board's suggestions, and 

provide approval prior to the building permit stage…  and 

that there would be similarly ongoing review of the 

interior, the space by staff to try to facilitate, improve 

sort of queuing and access and egress, as is possible. 

          Did I just generally cover the main points that 

the Planning Board members raised for us to look at?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Any Board members 

have concerns, or think something was missed, please speak 

up now.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  This is Steve.  Jeff, are you 

saying that it is appointment-only unless and until the city 

permits otherwise?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the -- one of the typical 

conditions as recommended -- I'll try to just quickly pull 

up the Traffic and Parking memo, and if we need to have Adam 

come back to explain it, we can -- so the applicant would be 

required if the Planning Board accepts these recommended 

conditions to work with Traffic and Parking and the 

Cambridge Police Department on an operations plan and an 

opening period plan to be approved by the city prior to a 

certificate of occupancy…so that we could reflect in a

decision that the use of an appointment-only system would be 

a part of that operations plan.   

          So it would be largely to the discretion of 

traffic and parking in the Police Department to determine 

the extent to which that system needs to be used, or at what 

point it could be adjusted to a different system.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes. And that's 

consistent with how we've dealt with this with other 

applicants, right, Jeff?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, that's correct.  In some 

cases, we have noted, and we could note in the decision 

explicitly that it would be for a period of at least six 

months.  But generally speaking it's sort of six months, and 

then up to the discretion of the city through that 

operations plan system that I described.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Do Board 

members want to specify that we want a minimum of six months 

in this case, or are we okay with staff discretion between 

Traffic and Parking and the Police Department?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, this is Mary.  I think I 

would like to see a minimum of six months, but it is kind of 

interesting because of the period that we're in with the

pandemic, since, you know, there are specific rules that 

restrict how the business is operated now.  So I think it 

depends on how long the pandemic regulations stay in place, 

because this is really sort of like a false reality --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.         

          MARY FLYNN:  -- we're dealing with.  So I would 

like to see it be, you know, an evaluation of six months 

post pandemic restrictions.   

          So once we're back to, like, normal operating 

procedures and, you know, people can come and go out of 

businesses the way they once were able to, I'd like the 

evaluation to start at that point.  That seems to make sense 

to me.  I don't know how the other Board members feel about 

it. 

          That's it.  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  For me 

personally, I think that falls into the category of things I 

would leave to the discretion of Traffic and Parking and the 

police.  But if other Board members would like to have that 

period specified in the special permit, we can certainly do 

that.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I think it's a good idea.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Is there 

any objection to having it specified that six months from 

the lifting of the emergency restrictions, or frankly 

hopefully that by that this business is ready to open, those 

restrictions will have already been lifted?  But whichever 

is sooner.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  God willing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  God willing -- 

something we can all agree on.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I do have a concern --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- with us making a six-months 

condition, because it might be interpreted as saying that's 

the time we want to see, rather than just an expression of 

what we think the minimum time is likely to be.   

          So I prefer to leave it in the hands of the staff, 

with a decision indicating our discussion that we feel that 

an extended period is wise. 

          So having looked at a number of staff decisions on 

this previously, the staff is actually quite skilled at 

writing these provisions, and we have done them with six-

month timeframes in them, which very clearly indicate that

that is what the Board is recommending as a minimum period, 

after which it could be left to the usual operations plan 

oversight, to determine whether or not that can be left or 

changed.   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, I'm okay with that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So that sounds 

like, Jeff, we would -- the Board is going to recommend, 

then that we have that at a minimum six months, and then 

oversight through the operations plan process thereafter?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, are we leaving in -- I'm 

fine with leaving it to staff.  But I just want to -- are we 

leaving in the concept of a minimum of six months from the 

lifting of the pandemic regulations or it's just all going 

to be stat?   

          I think that Mary makes a valid point, that if 

we're going to have a timeframe in it, it should not -- that 

timeframe should not be ticking while we are under emergency 

orders related to the pandemic.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I also think it's 

very likely that by that time that the business opens, that 

will not be the case.  But I think it's important to be 

clear about that 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm fine with that, but could I 

just suggest instead of keying it to the I'd say lifting or 

modification, because who knows what's going to happen?  

There may be some permanent --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- restriction.  And it would 

technically never be lifted.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I hear what 

you're saying, Ted.  I think that's right.  I will work with 

staff to get the exact -- I think -- obviously an emergency 

order that is currently in place restricting these things.  

It can only go on but so long.   

          But you're right, that occupancy of buildings may 

be -- and spaces may be permanently changed.  So we should 

be careful to be clear that we're talking about when things 

go back to normal, even if it's a new normal.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I have one other quick one.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I know that the proponent 

agreed to many of the things that were in Traffic and 

Parking.  I didn't go through it one by one, I just was 

curious whether we should ask them whether they are willing 

to go along with all of the conditions Traffic and Parking 

suggested, because there is a significant monetary component 

to it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent point.  All 

right.  Let me turn back to Megan Kemp, then.  Can you 

confirm whether or not the applicant is willing to agree to 

all of the conditions proposed by the two staff memos?         

          [Pause]  

          Oh, did we lose the applicant?   

          MEGAN KEMP:  Sorry, I was just still muted.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  I was talking, but you couldn't hear 

me.  No, I can confirm that.  Everything in the memos is 

fine.  We just want to be -- you know, obviously we prefer 

this six months, but we get the whole situation is -- no one 

knows what the situation is or how long it will last, or 

when things will go right.   

          But we're happy to work with staff.    

118

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Wonderful.       

          MEGAN KEMP:  -- and sort that out, as things 

change.  I just want to be clear on the questions about the 

interior design.  We're just talking about what happens with 

the vestibule, not interior, right?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think the key point 

is that the Board would like you to work with staff to make 

sure that however the circulation occurs with the vestibule, 

and then any queuing that may need to occur in the main 

showroom space, that it essentially doesn't end up trickling 

out into the public sphere?       

          MEGAN KEMP:  That's what I understood, I just 

wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page as to 

what it is that we were working with the staff on.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  There you go.  Okay.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So a very minor matter.  The fourth 

bullet of "Continuing Review" was to provide information 

whether the proposed exterior basement door was an egress.  

And that was covered in the presentation, and they said it 

was not an egress.  So I think we ought to remove that

bullet in "Continuing Review."    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That makes sense, 

since we have established that it is not.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think that this particular design 

of that and the landscaping, et cetera is still on the 

table.    

so --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Absolutely.  Okay.  

Jeff, are there any other suggestions from staff or other 

items that you need clarity on?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I do not have anything left for me, 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Very good.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- just turn it back over.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Then is 

there a motion to grant the requested special permits with 

those conditions, based on the Board's finding that all 

applicable special permit criteria are met?  And if there is 

a motion, remember to start by saying year name.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  This is Steve, so moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louie, second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I will call for a 

120

roll call vote, then.   

          Jeff, are you muted?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I was fumbling with a couple of 

things at the same time.  So on the motion to grant the 

special permit, subject to the stated -- pursuant to the 

stated findings and subject to the stated conditions -- 

Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steven Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Mary Flynn?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Catherine Preston Connolly?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all seven members voting in 

favor.

applicant a chance to assemble, and we'll be back here at

proposal by Gas light Building, LLC, to renovate and rehab 

the existing building at 711-727 Massachusetts Ave and 

construct an addition for hotel use.   

          We'll start with CDD staff summarizing why this is 

before us.

Roberts, once again.  So this, again, is a new hearing that 

-- and just to note that, it was originally scheduled for 

March 2020.  It had to be postponed, but this is the first 

time that the Board is hearing it.   

          The proposal does not trigger a project review 

special permit, which is one of the typical permits that is 

reviewed by the Planning Board, but the site is located in 

the Central Square Overlay District. 

          And in that district, there are thresholds for 

total FAR and for building height that require special 

permit approval from the Planning Board. 

          And the applicant in this particular case is also 

seeking some dimensional relief, and a waiver of parking and 

loading requirements also can be granted by special permit 

from the Planning Board in the Central Square Overlay 

District. 

          The proposal will retain office and retail uses, 

and will add a hotel use, and all of those uses are allowed 

as-of-right in that district.   

          That's it for me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So I 

believe the presenter, Mr. Bluemle?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.  Okay.  You -- 

please begin by introducing yourself and any other speakers 

on your team, and then commence the presentation.  You'll 

have up to 30 minutes, unless the Board grants additional 

time.   

          JULIAN BLUEMLE:  Okay.  So Dear Board, Dear 

participants, thank you very much for meeting us today.  I 

really appreciate the opportunity to present our project 

today, and it's truly my honor to introduce the owner and 

developer, my team and myself.   

          So my name is Julian Bluemle.  I'm the developer 

manager for Chevron Partners.  With me here today are the 

architects from Finegold Alexander, my zoning consultant 

from Trilogy Law.  I have the traffic consultants from BHB, 

and Green Building and LEED consultants from WSP with me 

here today. 

          So next slide, please. 

          So about the owner and developer:  Chevron 

Partners is a developer and asset manager, and we have a 

portfolio of carefully selected historic properties in 

Boston and Cambridge -- four of them you see here in the

slides.   

          Next slide, please. 

          And at this point I'd like to mention the great 

collaboration with our architect, Finegold Alexander.  In 

order to find the right planning partners, about two years 

ago we organized a small architectural competition, invited 

five local architects.   

          We feel very happy that we found Finegold 

Alexander.  Finegold Alexander has a track record and is 

known for mindfully combining historic properties with 

modern additions, and they have been the right partner for 

our project.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          You see the building at 77 Mass Avenue, the former 

Gas and Light Building.  You see it is a perfect fit for our 

portfolio, and one of the first things we did over the past 

two years:  We renovated the historic limestone façade and 

brought it back to life, and we restored the historic light 

sconces in line with historic photographs. 

          If you go to the next slide, please?   

          Here you see during our research, we found these 

historic photographs.  It is very important for us to

preserve the historic character of this building in the 

future, and to restore some of those elements.   

          Next slide, please?   

          Over the past two years, we experienced a very 

collaborative and integrative process with the City of 

Cambridge with the community and with our neighbors.  I'm 

truly thankful that the community at Central Square was so 

inviting, so open and so supportive for our vision that we 

have here at Central Square. 

          And we have a long-term perspective at Central 

Square, and we intend to become a more active member of the 

community.   

          So one of the first things we did is we 

participated in this Arts District project, donated one of 

our walls and what we see today on one of our walls is a 

mural from a local Cambridge artist, as part of this 

project. 

          Next slide, please.   

          Behind our building that's the back, the rear 

alley.  This is where we see the potential for a more modern 

structure.  There's room for some improvement here. 

          Next slide, please.

          And I'd like to summarize our vision and our 

intent with the historic building.  The idea is to renovate 

the historic existing building, that's already ongoing.  On 

top of that, we plan to add a 37-room boutique hotel on top 

of the historic structure.   

          We plan to expand the retail spaces and make them 

accessible, and to improve the existing office spaces.  And 

there will be a new lobby as well for office and hotel. 

          Moving forward, I will hand over now to Sarah 

Rhatigan from Trilogy Law. And moving forward, Sarah will 

describe what this means from a special permit perspective, 

and she will handle all the questions that will arise over 

the course of the ongoing meeting.     

          SARAH RHATIGAN:  Good evening Planning Board 

members.  Thank you so much for being here with us today.  

As with many things with COVID, the three and a half, four- 

month pause and requirement that we stand down on wanting to 

present this has been really difficult for us.  Everybody's 

really excited about this project. 

          I'm going to be very brief, and then be available 

for questions, in terms of the legal and zoning compliance 

aspects of this.

          I thought that the CDD staff has always done a 

remarkable job of summarizing some complicated aspects of 

the zoning ordinance.  The critical piece of this work is in 

looking at Central Square Overlay District provisions that 

really allow this project to happen.  

          [Next slide, please?]  

          Jeff Roberts mentioned the special permits that 

were being sought, but essentially the project requires a 

combination of floor area that allows for a mixed-use 

residential and nonresidential project, an increase in he is 

with the bulk plane setback requirements off Mass Ave. 

          We require a waiver to allow a long-term tenant of 

Bank of America, which is otherwise a formula business, to 

continue to exist on the corner. 

          There's no parking or loading on site because of 

the very constrained nature, and where the development will 

be.  So there is a parking and loading waiver. 

          A few other exemptions and waivers:  We were not 

able to site short-term bike parking on the site, and 

there's an exemption sought for basement use. 

          Next slide, please? 

          These elements in terms of our meeting, we're

really seeking to meet the Central Square design guidelines 

and objectives that the community had set.  It has taken a 

large role in how we've designed the project and the 

elements that we're really seeking to develop. 

          The most central to it is preserving and 

revitalizing the historic building that is the one that is 

really kind of dear to a lot of us, especially people who 

have spent a lot of time in Central Square, as I note a lot 

of us have. 

          The retail improvements will be described in 

detail by our architect, as we go through the plans.  The 

location, in terms of its pedestrian-friendly, bicycle-

friendly location is really a perfect one for us. The new 

addition is really an elegant design that's been vetted well 

with the city and has been really carefully, carefully 

conceived. 

          There's an effort to really revitalize some of the 

business and the interesting flow of people in and out of 

Central Square, and the hotel use is really geared to that.  

High-quality green and sustainable building design:  We went 

through the Green Building review process.   

          And as we've mentioned, the developer is a local

owner, who is here to stay.  The properties that they've 

bought and renovated are really stunning, and their examples 

are a few that were shown in the slide. 

          I'm going to pass this along to our architect, 

Tony Hsiao, from Finegold Alexander, and we'll take it from 

here.   

          TONY HSIAO:  Thank you, Sarah, and also thank you 

very much, Planning Board members.  We'll try to be very 

focused for you.   I know this is a long evening, and 

appreciate your time and attention. 

          So, as I'm sure you're very well familiar with, 

this site is very centrally located at the heart, really, of 

Central Square at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue 

and Temple Street.  And it's surrounded by very significant 

series of buildings of all types and varieties. 

          And most importantly, it also has great access to 

various means of transportation via -- whether it's subway 

or bus, parking, bikes, pedestrian and Zipcar.  So it's 

really at the heart of -- nexus of the urban district. 

          Next? 

          And as we think about this too, the importance of 

this particular project is that it is, we believe, a strong 

130

addition to already a very rich environment in this area.   

          And I think, in thinking about this, we also are 

trying to be very sensitive to the fact that along 

Massachusetts Avenue, of course, there is not only great 

diversity of buildings and uses, but also in building masses 

and heights.  I think that's what contributes to the great 

riches of this city that we love so well. 

          So I think we feel that we're trying to make a 

very positive contribution to this district. 

          Next? 

          And as we think about it in more detail, this 

particular plan does show the location.  The area outlined 

in red describes where the proposed addition occurs on top 

of the existing building -- again, at the corner of Mass Ave 

and Temple Street. 

          Next?   

          And as we come closer in at the site plan level, I 

think what's really important to stress here is that we 

firmly believe that not only is this project adding 

vitality, but activation I think is really critical.   

          The street frontage along Massachusetts Avenue, as 

we know, has already a series of tenants.  And we actually

131

want to enhance that.   

          So we're creating a series of retail frontage, 

which includes also the Bank of America at the corner, to 

activate the entire frontage.  And we're going to make all 

these entrances accessible, so the whole building is 

universally accessible to everybody. 

          And as we move along towards Temple Street, this 

is where we locate the entrance to the hotel and office use, 

which is shown as sort of a bright red arrow at the back.  

And then we have a small service alley at the rear for small 

deliveries in other areas. 

          Next?   

          As we zero in more on the proposed first-floor 

plan, the area in purple represents the existing historic 

building, and then the orange represents the proposed 

addition.   

          So, again, what you see here along Mass Ave is 

that we are illustrating three proposals:  The retail 

tenants, which basically align the edge; the Bank of America 

at the corner; and then as we come back towards the 

backside, we enter into the hotel office lobby through the 

vestibule, and then it connects into this area here.

22

132

          And it also has it possibly connecting to the 

retail tenant as well from the certain areas.  We provide a 

service alley at the back, which also provides access not 

only for some of the hotel functions and usage, as well for 

some of the retail tenants; but also is where we also gain 

several parking bike storage spaces. 

          Next?   

          As we go down to the lower level basement plan 

that we show here again is some additional tenant areas here 

showing on the sort of right-hand side in sort of three 

locations. 

          We also locate the transformer vault, which has 

been carefully vetted; had a lot of careful review of this 

particular, very important component of the building.   

          And then again at the area in the orange, here we 

see in some ways more of the support for the hotels such as 

laundry service, some mechanical, boiler and fire command 

          An additional bike storage parking occurs at this 

and TelData rooms.   

lower level as well. 

          Next? 

          As we move up, we pass the second and third floor,

133

which really consists of continuation of office, and then a 

mixture of office and hotel on the third floor.   

          Here we see on the fourth-floor plan a really 

beginning of the new addition.  And it is shown here in 

orange, and it is held back approximately 20 feet from the 

front of the existing historic building. And that enables us 

to actually create a series of private roof terraces and 

patios that serve the individual hotel guest rooms lining 

along that edge. 

          And so basically, it provides a mixture of hotels 

with some privatized roof deck areas. 

          Next?   

          And when we get to the more typical fifth and 

sixth floors, it's essentially the same distance.  It's a 

continuation of hotel rooms, which basically range in size 

from studio up to two-bedroom suites in terms of the 

mixture. 

          Next? 

          And when we get to the proposed top of the roof 

plan on the proposed addition, what we see here is the 

development of several things.   

          In the right-hand corner, this is where there's a

small, exterior roof deck and putting green roof components, 

which is dedicated for the hotel guest use only.   

          And that also extends, so you see a small terrace 

area lining along the edge of this particular façade, as it 

faces towards Mass Ave. 

          The rest of the roof is basically comprised of a 

mechanical space, which is largely screened in, with access 

to servicing these particular functions on the level.   

          Next? 

          This is the cross section that shows the 

relationship of the proposed addition -- again in orange -- 

to the existing building in purple.  What we, again, are 

showing here is that the building is held back.  It's a 

little over 20 feet, as it conforms to the bulk plane 

setback, as required by the Central Square District Overlay. 

          So I think we have adhered to all the requirements 

with respect to that. 

          The total building is 80 feet above grade.  The 

existing building itself is just a little under 50 feet in 

height.  And at the rear, the distance from the proposed 

addition to the Temple Place Apartments varies between 21 to 

23 feet in width. 

135

          Next?   

          These are just -- happen to be a series of model 

shots.  I actually have had the liberty of having this model 

delivered to my home.  So if there are questions and you 

folks want to see the model, I'll do my best to try to show 

you in my own apartment, but please bear with that.  It is 

in my own residence. 

          So these are particular shots that show the 

proposed addition.  And I think what we're going to really 

stress here is that the intent was to create an addition 

that was intended to be complimentary to the existing 

historic building and deferential as well, but also speaking 

to its own time in terms of the way it's designed and 

articulated. 

          Next?  

          So this is a rendered view that looks up Mass Ave 

towards Harvard Square.  And here -- what you can see here 

is the relationship of the proposed addition for the hotel, 

as it sits against the existing historic building.   

          As we mentioned from the outset, the historic 

building itself has been carefully restored in many, many 

areas. And all the entrances to the openings in the arch

areas will be brought back to accessibility for every tenant 

that occurs along that edge.   

          The addition itself is intended to be a sort of 

contemporary, but complimentary massing.  The idea is that 

it really sort of floats above the historic building.  It's 

developed as a series of frames that are intended to be 

articulated, but also very refined and very elegant.   

          And the frames themselves and scale are in some 

ways proportionally related in part and derived from the 

double height arched openings, but reinterpreted in a 

contemporary way.   

          Within the frames themselves, there are also a 

breakdown in scale articulating a series of window 

fenestration patterns, for the purpose of the hotel guests, 

and also, additional horizontal louver systems, which help 

to control daylight and sunlight into the hotel rooms, as 

well as provide some textural relief as well. 

          Next? 

          This particular other view is taken looking up 

Mass Ave towards Boston facing east.  And I think what we 

also just illustrate in here, again, is the relationship of 

the proposed addition to the historic building.

          And this piece façade along the west side here is 

largely, mostly solid, composite materials in a panelized 

system.  This, of course, is literally on the zero lot line.  

So there's really very little window exposure on this area.  

          And as you probably already well know, the client 

has taken the liberty of creating an artistic mural 

treatment on the existing brick façade on the lower section.  

And we think this is, again, a real opportunity to engage 

art as well. 

          But this shows the relationship of the proposed 

addition to the historic building. 

          Next?   

          And then this other view here, this is now taken 

along Temple Street, basically looking up towards Mass Ave, 

and here we can see how the relationship of the proposed 

addition for the hotel sort of floats and sort of nestles 

around the existing historic building. 

          And we're intending to do a very elegant and 

refined -- to replace the glass system, that essentially 

allows the proposed addition to float around the historic 

building.  And the rear façade is intended to be very sort 

of quiet, downplayed and understated.   

138

          So again, we see here a panelized system, mostly 

consisting of variegated, horizon window treatment for the 

hotel and office uses behind. 

          In addition, what we -- sorry.  In addition, the 

other thing I'm just going to point out here is that at the 

bottom level there, the sort of framed opening, the two-

storied opening there, that is the opening designated for 

the hotel and the office use, and it's also -- again -- 

proportionally a reinterpretation nod to the arched openings 

on the existing building. 

          Next? 

          We're in the early stages of exploring materials.  

I think what we really want to be sensitive to is that 

because of the beautiful nature of the historic building and 

its stone, we want to create a series of complimentary 

material that we believe will sort of really work well with 

that.   

          Of course, the requirements of those material 

selection and colors, all of that will be subject to a lot 

more review with the city and staff as well. 

          These are just the beginning sense about it, 

mostly consisting of some kind of panelized systems,

composite, and the idea that it will essentially act as a 

compliment to the existing building, and the use of wood is 

intended in the deck areas, as it relates to the hotel 

139

terraces.   

          Next? 

          These things we have submitted.  We are targeting 

LEED goals.  I'm not going to get into the details here.  We 

have our engineers on staff who can really answer this, but 

we are trying to aim for the highest level that we can in 

sustainability approach towards the project.  And I think 

these areas, I think we believe we're able to achieve. 

          Next? 

          But some of the other things I think we just want 

to point out, as far as some of these strategies are a 

number of really key things.  Of course, the reuse of the 

existing building allows us to not only preserve and restore 

the historic fabric, but it also mitigates the requirement 

for new materials, as a result of reuse.   

          We're going to propose variegated, vegetative 

green roofs in the areas that also help with stormwater 

management, and a heat island effect in urban locations.   

          We already mentioned a high urban location itself,

and therefore access to public transportation, therefore 

reducing car dependency. 

          We are trying to aim for the highest level of 

energy efficiency for the project in terms of high 

performance envelope, highly efficient VFR systems, and 

therefore to reduce the overall energy consumption, and to 

make sure those selections will be with the intention of 

ETDs, HPDs, and low VLC content, so that we try to encourage 

transparency and occupancy health in the selection of 

materials. 

tenants.   

          Passive daylighting strategies I think are very 

important. The southern façade glazing I think provides 

natural light for both the hotel and office and retail 

          And then the fact of the building of the existing 

building with the construction of the new addition is to 

mitigate the amount of transparency to solid wall, so that 

we're enabling us to allow sufficient light to occur, but 

also to not overdo it in terms of that degree of 

transparency to health on the energy consumption.    

          So these represent some of the strategies.  We can 

get into more details as follows, but that represents the

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  We'll turn to Board members, see if there are any 

clarifying questions for the applicant at this time.  Board 

members as usual, please either start by saying your name or 

raise your hand and be recognized.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  It's Tom.  I was just going to 

see whether Tony could make good on his promise.  There is 

an aspect to the model that I would like to see --    

          TONY HSIAO:  Ok.

          TONY HSIAO:  I know.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I would like to see the 

proportion of the space on the alley, between the two 

buildings behind.

          TONY HSIAO:  -- you know, this is also new for me, 

and, again, I apologize in advance for my apartment.  And I 

don't know, can you -- I'm not sure, but is the camera 

flipped?            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  No, it's good.

it slowly for everyone.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.  That's Mass Ave.  Oh, 

excellent.     

          TONY HSIAO:  Mass Ave, okay?  And, of course, here 

you start to see -- I'm going to come down, and then I'm 

going to come back up again, so --

we're seeing Hugh's old office, but it's --    

          TONY HSIAO:  Okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- Temple Street, of course, that 

I want to see if there's --    

          TONY HSIAO:  Yeah, okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- any way to do that.     

          TONY HSIAO:  Yep.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  And you can do it from above.     

          TONY HSIAO:  I'll do that.  I'll squeak around 

this way and sort of come back to this location.  And again, 

this is just taken from that vantage point.  And again, of 

course --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay, stop right there.  Perfect,

space.  This is -- if you could go a little to your right.     

          TONY HSIAO:  Okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Not quite.

          TONY HSIAO:  Okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Wow.  Okay.  That's very

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, now it's there.               

          TONY HSIAO:  And I'll come back down, just more 

again, like, a little bit lower, at eye level.  Well, the 

best I can, that is.

do have questions in regard to the basement space.   

          The application mentions that there are -- that 

the space has offices that were used by startups, and I'm 

wondering, are there currently tenants in that space?  And 

if so, what are -- are any of them staying, or are they all

going to be relocated?     

          SARAH RHATIGAN:  Hi, I'll -- this is Sarah 

Rhatigan speaking again.  I'll do my best to answer this, 

and if I need any clarification from my client, I will ask 

them. 

          There were some startup tenants in this basement 

area for a number of years, but they, I believe, vacated 

within the past year.  So the space is currently not 

occupied.  But it had been occupied for a number of years 

before this owner purchased the property in 2016. 

          And to be honest, I'm not actually sure what the 

status of that tenant is, if it's still in existence and 

working elsewhere.  I believe that that is the answer.  

Julian can flesh that out.     

          JULIAN BLUEMLE:  So the tenant made a decision to 

-- they needed a larger space; they made a difference to 

leave us.  That vacated the space about a half a year ago.  

          The future intent is what we call "the free tenant 

spaces" here.  We see most likely storage spaces here for 

the office tenants in the upper floors.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          JULIAN BLUEMLE:  And right now the basement is

vacant and most likely will not be occupied until the 

construction is completed.         

          MARY FLYNN:  I see.  Okay.  So it will be more 

support area for tenants on the other floors?     

          SARAH RHATIGAN:  Correct, yes.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you so much.  Appreciate 

it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Any other 

clarifying questions from Board members?  All right.  

Hearing none, we will go to public comment, then.   

          This is a public hearing, so any members of the 

public who wish to speak should now click the button that 

says, "Raise hand" or if you're calling in by phone, raise 

your hand by pressing *9.   

          Because this is a continued hearing, we'll ask you 

to focus your comments on the new materials that have been 

presented at this meeting.  And again, this is one of those 

unusual continued hearings where everything is new.   

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, we received written 

communications from the following individuals:  James M. 

Williamson, Bill Cunningham, Cheryl Patterson Munroe, and 

Kenneth S. Barron.  Additional written communications 

148

received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday will be entered into the 

case file. 

          I will now ask staff to unmute speakers one at a 

time, and you should begin by saying your name and address, 

and then staff will confirm that we can hear you.  And after 

that, you will have up to three minutes to speak before I 

ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair, this is 

Jeff Roberts again.  I see the first name with a hand up is 

Carla Moynihan.  Would you please say your name, spell your 

name, and give your address?  I'll confirm we can hear you, 

and then you can give your comments.   

          CARLA MOYNIHAN:  Absolutely.  Carla Moynihan, C-a-

r-l-a M-o-y-n-i-h-a-n, Attorney at Sherin and Lodgen, 101 

Federal in Boston.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay, thank you.  You can go ahead.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Thank you.  Good evening.  For 

the record, I'm an attorney at Sherin and Lodgen, commenting 

on behalf of InTeahouse INC., the second floor office tenant 

at 727 Massachusetts Avenue.

regularly including local business, governmental and 

educational leaders as panelists and attendees, with 

investors from Boston, New York and China. 

          Since its formation, this women and minority-owned 

business has helped over 100 companies grow, with far-

reaching economic impacts.  Moreover, In Teahouse's presence 

has encouraged other accelerators like MIT's The Engine and 

WeWork to locate in Central Square, further strengthening 

the business fabric of startups in Cambridge, such that the 

Square is now a go to area for innovation hubs. 

          One of the key objectives, as you all know, for 

the Central Square Action Plan, is to preserve the Square's 

cultural diversity, of which InTeahouse is an integral part.

          Specific concerns regarding the hotel proposal are 

similar to those raised in the Central Square Advisory 

Committee report, as well as Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation staff memo -- including the removal of any 

and all parking and loading spaces from onsite, the proposal 

for future loading to occur offsite on Temple Street and 

sharing that loading area with numerous other local 

businesses, and the failure to provide for specific parking 

arrangements that a nearby parking facility actually 

permitted for commercial parking. 

          Furthermore, based on some negative impacts to 

health and safety we've experienced since the fall of 2019, 

from the landlord's preliminary hotel development work, 

including inaccessible, second egress for its office 

tenants, not compliant with code; only resolved after we 

turned to litigation. 

          We're very much concerned for the ability and 

future accountability of this developer to the city's 

special permit conditions, both during construction, as well 

as after occupancy, if the Board votes to approve this 

project.

details regarding the proposed changes to the second-floor 

office space, as indicated in the most current file plans, 

all of which impact our 2015 TI. 

          Likewise, given its strong performance and vital 

role in the Cambridge international community, it is 

profoundly disappointing that the new landlord is seeking to 

evict InTeahouse in order to move forward with this hotel 

project you've heard about today, despite the 15 years 

remaining on the lease. 

          If InTeahouse is forced to move elsewhere, it 

would be a huge loss to the Central Square Community.  Thank 

you for your time and attention.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next name on the list is Doug 

Brown.  Can you start by giving year name and address, and 

spelling your name?  And I'll confirm I can hear you.

D-o-u-g B-r-o-w-n.          

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, we can hear you.          

          DOUG BROWN:  Okay.  I just wanted to quickly 

comment on the project.  I mean, I commend them on the 

design itself, but I have some concerns about the scale.  

The project is seeking a FAR of 4.0 based on it being a

residential use. 

          The base zoning for commercial in the BB zone is 

2.75, so significantly less than 4.0.  What I am concerned 

about is it appears that they are using some kind of a 

loophole to claim additional FAR for their site.   

          LEED in its standards does not categorize hotel 

with residential uses, nor does the IRS.  The IRS doesn't 

consider a hotel to be a residential use of the building.  

It's a commercial use. 

          In the last few years, we've had this and seven 

other proposals for hotels.  And many of them have either 

eliminated housing, or have prevented housing from being 

built by their existence.   

          And those other properties include the White Hen 

Pantry in Porter Square, which changed from residential 

units to hotel; hotel Veritas on Mass Ave in Harvard Square, 

and 907 Main Street in Central Square as well, which 

replaced units with hotel. 

          My concern is that this seems to be an ongoing 

pattern.  And at the same time that this particular project 

is using the residential rules to get a bigger FAR for their 

commercial building, the site's previous owners opposed the

affordable housing project in next door.   

          This residential use will generate no affordable 

units, and it's unclear whether the residential component of 

it will pay into the incentive zoning plan as well. 

          I guess it may be too late for this project, this 

was the first I had heard of it.  But I would like to 

suggest that the Planning Board should consider eliminating 

this loophole going forward, because it allows commercial 

development to supersede any new residential use.  Those are 

my comments, and thanks for your time.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker that I have is Dan 

Totten.  Can you, Dan, give your name, spell your name and 

give your address?     

          DAN TOTTEN:  Yes.  My name is Dan Totten, D-a-n as 

in Nancy -t-o-t-t-e-n as in Nancy.  I live at 54 Bishop 

Allen Drive in Central Square.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.     

          DAN TOTTEN:  And I'm speaking on my own accord 

here.  I would like -- there's so much to say here, but I 

think the site context is really important.   

          And I was really open to listening to what was 

going on here, because this is honestly the first time I've

looked into the details of this.  But it was pretty hard for 

us to get through a long presentation and not hear a single 

word about the affordable housing next door. 

          And I don't know if they're a part of the 

community that this developer claims is inviting open and 

supportive, because they haven't really told us how they’ve 

engaged with them at all.   

          And I think these people have every bit of -- 

every right to weigh in on this project, just like the 

people from Mount Auburn Street came and got to complain 

about their things.   

          But the problem is, we're two hours past the 

advertised time of this thing.  And a lot of these people 

don't even have Internet. 

          I also want to point out there are a lot of 

homeless people in the Square, including some that live in 

the alcoves of this building.  Have they been consulted?  

The tenants that are paying rent to this person aren't even 

being treated fairly, according to the person who spoke 

before me. 

          And so I can't imagine that the affordable housing 

tenants or the homeless people who would love a place to

live have been consulted. 

          And so, that's where I want to go now, is to just 

say that I don't understand why this can't be housing.   

          And if we are serious about doing an Affordable 

Housing Overlay and moving forward in this direction, and 

yet we put forward this proposal that is a boutique hotel:  

We have a boutique hotel going in at Emma's Pizza, we have a 

boutique hotel going in at Patrick -- the one that Patrick 

Barrett's doing, we have boutique hotels going in at Porter 

          And I don't understand why if we're serious about 

building affordable housing, why we don't just take a stand 

and say, "You know what?  A hotel is not what should go 

Square.   

here."   

          The Square is in a crisis.  It breaks my heart.  

Everyday there's a new anchor tenant, business in this 

Square that goes under.  And it's hard -- it's painful to 

watch, as somebody who lives in this neighborhood.  And now, 

if we're going to have a conversation about bringing in a 

hotel, I hope we will have serious conversation.   

          I want to point out that three of the four people 

who you read into the record who gave comment before this 

156

meeting, are members of the Board of the Alliance of 

Cambridge Tenants.  One of them is the co-Chair.   

          Let's have a conversation with these people.  

Let's talk to the tenants.  Please, I hope the developer 

will commit to having a community meeting with the tenants.  

And I will work with them personally, to make sure that that 

meeting happens and is successful.  Thank you so much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Those are -- I'm sorry, there is a 

hand that's raised, of course.  James Williamson?  Could you 

please give your name?  Sorry, let me just push the button.  

Please give your names and your address. 

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Of course, of course.  What do 

you mean by that?  You say, "of course" -- what do you mean 

by that?   

          [Pause]  

          Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I was about to state the hands were 

-- there were no more hands up --  

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- and then your hand raised.  

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  I get it, okay.  So the timer 

isn't working, and as it has been before, and it would be 

nice to be able to tell how much time I have left, if that 

can be reversed -- can that be changed back to where I can 

actually see the countdown clock?   

          And I did ask Swaathi if she could ask the Chair 

just to let the public know how many members of the public 

are actually in attendance, if she can at some point before 

the hearing is concluded, I'd appreciate that.   

          I think everybody would like to know so how many 

people are actually listening in?  Maybe not necessarily 

speaking. 

          So first of all, I have to say I was -- you know, 

it -- I guess people like to complain about Trump, but it's 

perfectly all right for proponents of something like this to 

make outrageous statements that are completely at variance 

with the facts. 

          For example, the community -- so-called community 

-- being welcoming and they're claiming to be local?  I 

guess anybody can claim to be local now?  You just show up 

and buy property, you're -- you know, you're a European 

boutique hotel company and you buy property, and you

suddenly can call yourself local:  I find that quite 

offensive. 

          I'm sitting out here right on the sidewalk, right 

outside the building.  I'll tell you that none of the 

business owners across the street know anything about this, 

and some of them are actually going out of business.   

          None of the musicians at the Cantab know anything 

about this.  Nobody who's really actually part of this 

community know anything about this.  Nor do they feel like 

they're going to have any power or say that’s going to make 

any difference in this proposal, which I think is a sad 

commentary on the situation here in Cambridge. 

          The Community Outreach Meeting was not well 

publicized at all.  But if you bothered to look at the 

record, you'll see that the one person who took the trouble 

to show up from 5 Temple Place objected strenuously to the 

fact that the sunlight -- sorry, now we have an ambulance 

going by, welcome to Central Square. 

          So the person objected -- rightly, I think -- to 

the fact that he's going to -- his apartment -- if you 

looked at the pictures that I submitted, you'll see that 

many of the apartments on that side of the building are

going to be put in shadow.  They're not going to see the sky 

any more, they're not going to have sunlight anymore.   

          This building was the poster child for the 

Affordable Housing Overlay, and -- but once it's used that 

way, the people who want to talk about that don't give a 

damn about the people who actually live in the building.   

          They don't really give a damn about the people who 

live in the affordable housing buildings they're extolling 

the virtues of. 

          So where are they tonight?  Where are the senior 

staff of the Housing Authority?  Where are the members of a 

bigger Cambridge?  Where are these people who care so much 

about people who need affordable housing?   

          They're nowhere, because they don't give a damn 

about the people who actually live in these buildings.  And 

it bugs the hell out of me. 

          And as for historic buildings, this is widely 

recognized as perhaps the most significant historical 

building of Central Square.  Why wasn't it brought before 

the Historical Commission for there to be an opportunity for 

their review and a public review? 

          Because a handshake agreement, as it was described 

160

by Charlie Sullivan, was made with the previous owners, 

rolled over to the new owners, and he signed off on it, 

because he -- you know, because he said to me, he doesn't 

have the bandwidth to do a landmark designation for a 

building of this importance in Central Square. 

          I -- you know --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Williamson…   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Yeah, well, I -- you know, you 

guys aren't going to do what you should do, and I -- you 

know, I predict that you're going to let this thing go 

          And I'm just very -- it just bothers the hell out 

of me that you don't give a damn about the people who live 

in the affordable housing building next door, but then 

you're going to extol the virtues of the Affordable Housing 

          I think there's a lot of hypocrisy in this city.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Jeff, do we 

have any further members of the public wanting to comment 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  At this time, I don't see any more 

hands raised.  I would remind people who are in attendance

that if they'd like to speak, they can push the "Raise hand" 

button, or if by phone you could press *9.   

          [Pause]  

          Think I'll leave it to the Chair's discretion.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you so much.  

All right.  We're going to move on from public comment now 

to discussion with the staff.  If the hearing is continued 

to a future date and additional information is received, 

there will be an opportunity for the public to comment on 

any additional materials.  And of course, additional written 

comments may also be submitted. 

          So we did receive memos on this application from 

the Community Development Department, Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation staff, and there are people from both 

available.  Do Board members have questions for the staff, 

or want to start with one or the other of them in 

particular?   

          [Pause]  

about this one.   

          All right.  Since no one's chomping at the bit to 

say who gets to go first, I'll ask Erik to talk to us first 

          Erik, can you talk a little bit about the design

conversations you've had around this project, and if you 

have any comment on how the historic review has occurred for 

this building, that would have helpful.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yes.  Let's see.  Well, the CDD 

and the Cambridge Historical Commission both feel strongly 

about the value of the existing building.  Its elegant focus 

and details, high-quality materials, pedestrian scale are 

wonderful things for Central Square. 

          And we support the work that the applicant has 

done to protect and restore the building.  We had meetings 

and discussions that the Historical Commission participated 

in, that are reflected in the memo we wrote, which 

principally have to do with really those two things.   

          One is great to help restore the existing building 

-- now all the attention is paid to that, but some concern 

about the potential that the addition might seem to 

excessively dominate the existing building. 

          And so, in response to that, we're suggesting a 

few things could be considered:  That the colors of the 

volume directly over the existing building, particularly on 

those angled panels that frame the window openings, the 

colors be thought about really carefully -- that they should 

163

be in keeping with the existing building.   

          And so, -- and I -- you know, I see that the 

applicant has suggested in their presentation that they're 

open to refining colors as we work on the project. 

          As a way of putting it, in our internal 

discussions we talked about lightening up, it's just a 

colloquial way of putting it.   

          The second point is that it might be worth looking 

at reducing the strong horizontal banding of that element 

that's above the existing building, the sort of horizontal 

belting effect that you get that sort of makes it -- 

strengthens its reading as a blocky element, more or less 

the same size as the existing building, and maybe sets them 

up in competition with each other. 

          And then the third thought was that a slight 

change to the Temple Street elevation could be considered 

that as the building reads right now, and you sort of saw in 

the model views, for which I think the others -- really, 

that's fantastic to be able to see the model in the meeting 

, and particularly in motion -- well, that it sort of reads 

as though you've got the existing building and this addition 

that's like an upside-down L over it and behind it.

          Instead, if the tall, narrow six-floor addition 

behind the building were articulated separately from both 

the existing building and the fifth and sixth floor new 

volume above it -- in other words, if that slab in the back 

retreated as a vertical backdrop to the existing building 

and the new fifth and sixth floor volume, it would help the 

fifth and sixth floor volume to float above the existing 

building, rather than seeming to overhang it. 

          So those were the kind of -- sort of the high 

points of what we thought about it, sort of expanding on 

Charlie Sullivan's response to the concern that it would 

overwhelm the existing building. 

          Basically stepping back a little bit, the setting 

back of the addition, stepping back, seems really 

appropriate and in conformance with, you know, principles 

and guidelines for relating to historical buildings, both at 

the local and even the national level.  So that all seems 

quite appropriate. 

          So thanks.  Does that answer your question?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, that's a good 

place to start.  I see Lou Bacci has raised his hand, so we 

may have some questions for you, Erik.  Don't go far.

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Hi Erik.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Hi.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You're probably going to 

hate this one, but --    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yep.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- especially after what you 

just said.  To me it seems like the new section of the 

building that’s overhanging in that six-story kind of tower 

at the corner of Temple, you know, it has the mitered vase 

above and at the entrance.  

          My thought was, why did we gut the corner?  I 

mean, even if you leave a slot at the existing building?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Mm-hm.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It seems like it would tie 

it down.  Also on the west side, I don't know why it doesn't 

go around the corner.  It seems like it would make it -- it 

seems disjoined.  I kind of like the effect of those beveled 

panels, but it doesn't seem to be enough.   

          So just curiosity.  I think it would look better, 

but that's also a personal preference.  But just like to 

hear what you think.     

166

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  I didn't really 

understand your first point about Temple Street.  You know, 

I guess at a certain point we could sit here and, you know 

have -- it's hard to sort of evaluate how to combine 

personal opinions.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  No, I got you.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  I sort of --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  If you have the east façade 

--    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yep.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- and where the new section 

of beveled panels is on the east façade --    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yep.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- so if you go across the 

roofline and continue to the corner --  

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yep.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- and then tie it into the 

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Oh, I see what you mean.  So 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So it would kind of frame 

entrance way.     

extend, extend --  

the old building.

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  That --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It seemed like it's 

disjointed there.  And where it turns on the west façade to 

that metal panel blank wall, it seems the same there to me.  

I'm just curious for information.  I wanted to hear what the 

professionals have to say.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  No you're -- I think 

your perception of what could be conceived as a difficulty 

with the existing arrangement, your perception and mine sort 

of coincide, actually.  

          And we're suggesting sort of opposite ways of 

dealing with it, where you're suggesting strengthening the 

upside-down L effect, and we were suggesting reducing it by 

making it a sort of back plane and two objects in front. 

          But either way, I think that the point that you 

raise is a valid one.  You know?  You could probably come up 

with different solutions to it, but it's -- it does seem 

sort of like a little hard to understand what the intent is 

with that particular view, looking south on Temple Street. 

          On the west side, personally I sort of like that 

blank end elevation.  It seems like kind of a nice contrast.  

And also, it is a party wall.  So probably they can't wrap 

168

windows around the corner onto the west side -- you know, in 

other words, above that mural.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I was curious of that 

myself.     

site.    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  You know, because that's 

right over Pill Hardware or one of those -- maybe the 

bookstore, which probably is at some point a developable 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steven Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Hi, I just have a few problems.  

First of all, I just want to say that I've worked with Tony 

for many years in the mid-Cambridge --    

          TONY HSIAO:  Hi, Steve.      

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- Conversation District.  Hi 

Tony.  And it's the first time I think he's actually come 

before me.  And working with him, I knew him to be just an 

extraordinarily great architect, and totally committed to 

quality design in Cambridge. 

          And that was my impression all those years.  And 

now that I actually see him present something before me, I 

see that my impressions were exactly correct.   

          So look, there will be details that we'll work

through when staff goes through this and in subsequent 

hearings, but I just want to give my brief first impressions 

of the design.   

          And that is that I think it's a fabulous design, 

and a fabulous project, and we will work through some 

details along the way.   

          But I'm very excited to be reviewing this.  I'm 

looking forward to see the final result actually created.  I 

think it's a wonderful architectural contribution to Central 

Square.     

          TONY HSIAO:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, Hugh, you have 

your hand raised.  I would just remind Board members:  Right 

now we're looking for clarifying questions for the 

applicant, but --              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Oh, sorry about that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It's okay.   

          [Pause]                   

          Hugh?  No?  Okay.

based on that.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I thought we were getting into the 

design discussion, so.    

--            

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, well, so we were 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  When we get there --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, no, we're 

trying to get the -- you know, questions for staff and the 

applicant out there right now.  And so, while we kind of 

Erik on tap, we're trying to get his input on things, if we 

have questions for Erik.  If not, we can get input from Adam 

in Traffic and Parking if anyone needs to speak to their 

          And then we'll have a more open discussion.   

          [Noise] H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  All right.  It's a question for 

memo. 

Erik.   

          I am curious about what will happen with the patio 

areas, because presumably, there's going to have to be some 

form of fence preventing people from simply walking of the 

top of the old building.   

          And so, I'm curious whether there's been

discussion about that, and similarly what type of fencing 

there might be if they get the right to have the sixth floor 

be a public area, or at least an area for the inhabitants?    

So those are questions for Erik. 

          I guess a question for staff as a whole is, I 

assume that the classification of the hotel as a residential 

use and the right to the special permit is in accordance 

with current zoning?   

          And then another question for staff is, you know, 

these hearings are very odd now, and what -- actually what 

communication has been made really to the residents in the 

Temple Place apartments?   

          And comments from some people that I think it's 

surprising that there hasn't been a greater interest from 

the people who are living there because -- you know, I like 

the project very much, but its impact on that building in 

the back is really pretty dramatic, and I think needs to be 

discussed.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So why don't we start 

with the question there for Erik, and then we can have Jeff 

weigh in on the zoning, and any information we have on what 

the outreach report involved.

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.  This is Erik again.  I'm 

looking at the section -- the building section facing west -

- and it shows that the fourth floor has a parapet about 

four feet four inches all around it.   

          So I don't think there's a problem there.  And you 

can sort of see on the elevations where the lower portion of 

the windows is covered up by that parapet. 

          Up at the top, the parapet -- you know, in other 

words the roof level on top of the sixth floor, the parapet 

looks like it's one foot six tall, maybe one foot eight if I 

can read it right.  Yeah, they would need some sort of 

railing up there if that top level was actually used.    

          TONY HSIAO:  Eric, can I add a comment to that 

clarification?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yep.     

          TONY HSIAO:  So -- yes, so not shown there, there 

actually is a railing system that's held back from the edge.  

It's not showing up in this particular process, and that is 

also to code, and allowing no ability for someone to fall 

off the edge.  So it's also on the order of around four feet 

in height, as it surrounds the terraces on the roof.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay, great.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That's interesting.  I would like 

to see that.  I would like to see what the building is going 

to look like from across Mass Ave.  So, you know, whether 

you're going to see that fencing on the fourth floor and 

what you're going to see on the sixth floor.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Jeff, can you 

speak to the zoning and participation -- or the public 

outreach recommends here?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, thank you, Chair, I certainly 

can.  The first point about the hotel us is kind of an 

interesting point.  It's one that was broached back when the 

Board was reviewing 907 Mass Ave.  The hotels were on the 

opposite end of Central Square. 

          So the zoning was amended to allow a 4.0 FAR for 

residential use or for mixed-use by special permit.  The 

hotel use is listed under "Residential Uses." So under our 

zoning ordinance, it's a component of residential uses.   

          There are some districts of the city where hotel 

is excluded from residential for purposes of calculating the 

FAR.  This is not such a district, so this is one of the 

districts where residential and hotel have that higher FAR.   

          Board members might remember that the City Council 

174

approved zoning in another part of Cambridge that kind of 

equalized the hotel and residential FAR.  So that would have 

to be a policy discussion if -- given what the intent is.  

But we did determine that that's the interpretation of the 

zoning regarding hotel use. 

          The second question about communication with 

residents:  So this, like all Planning Board cases, was 

subject to requirements for community engagement.  They did 

hold a meeting.  It was some time ago.  It was, you know, as 

they were developing their application and before we were 

under a statewide state of emergency and stay-at-home 

advisory.   

          I would let the applicant -- and as part of the 

requirements, it's -- you know, the applicants' 

responsibility to conduct the outreach to report back to the 

Planning Board on what they heard and how they addressed 

those comments.   

          So I would sort of redirect the question about 

specifically what did the applicant hear from the abutters.  

I would have them answer that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So I'm 

not sure if that's a question for Sarah or Tony?  But if 

175

someone from the applicant team could speak to the outreach 

process, what was heard and how those comments were passed?     

          SARAH RHATIGAN:  Sure, thanks.  I'll respond very 

briefly, but I believe that Julian Bluemle would like to 

answer that question more specifically. 

          So the Community Outreach Meeting was held quite a 

while ago, but also it's a little difficult to envision how 

we could have such a community meeting now at the current 

time, although we do envision more community outreach if we 

were to be involved in construction and even talking about -

- you know -- operations of a new building.   

          There has been quite a bit of discussion with the 

Housing Authority and the YMCA.  Mr. Bluemle, do you want to 

respond to that more specifically?     

          JULIAN BLUEMLE:  Yes.  Thank you very much.  At 

this point, I'd like to mention when I stated earlier that I 

have a lot of engagement with the community, that it 

actually affects, and it's not just a made-up comment.  So I 

met YWCA and the Cambridge Housing for this about two years 

ago and many, many times thereafter.   

          I personally feel that -- I personally, and the 

developer and the entire team became an active member of the

community, and we discussed a lot of these aspects of this 

future hotel -- specifically with our neighbors of the 

Cambridge Housing Authority and the YWCA. 

          It's, of course, always very hard to get the 

opinion of all the residences there.  Therefore, we -- 

mostly I personally mostly spoke to Deann and Margaret, I 

have to say.  The concerns have been primarily regarding 

shading, and we discussed it a lot starting a year ago.   

          We even conducted a shadow study.  And our 

findings are that since the building is north of our 

building, the additional addition is actually not increasing 

that much more shadow, because there's always shadow cast by 

the existing historic building.  So there's not that much 

shadow impact. 

          Other than that, I stick to my comment.  I'm very 

thankful initially, very happy that our neighbors, including 

the Cambridge Housing Authority, having supportive of our 

project, with a very friendly relationship.  They know 

exactly what is going on.  They know exactly when we do a 

small renovation -- tenant improvement projects in our 

building.  We have of course not started construction yet 

there.   

177

          And I am happy to report there have not been any 

other greater concerns from our neighbors.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you for 

that.  Are there any other questions for Erik?  Or at this 

time, I would also ask if there are questions for Adam 

Shulman from Traffic, Parking and Transportation?     

          [Pause]  

          Going once?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sorry, Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  If Adam could just talk a 

little bit about the loading and parking situation.  Because 

it seemed as though there was concern about loading off of 

Temple.   

          And I guess -- it sounded to me as though the 

existing loading area was going away, but now I see that 

there is some loading area in the building.  So anyway, if 

Adam could just kind of go over his recommendations and 

explain their point of view on it, I'd appreciate it.  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Adam, you 

want to get the highlights of the memo from Traffic and 

Parking?  And I agree with Mary, it did seem from the memo

that off street loading was being lost, and I'd love to hear 

your thoughts on that.   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is 

Adam Shulman again from the Cambridge Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation Department.  Yes, we submitted the memo.  It 

was dated March 19, 2020.   

          And one of key issues that we raised in there was 

the fact that the existing loading zone area that currently 

exists behind this site on their property will be going 

away.  They'll be building that addition there.   

          I think the service alley they talked about will 

be good for -- I think that might work for people to move 

things back and forth, walk things back and forth.  The 

vehicles will no longer be able to access what used to be a 

loading zone in there.   

          So any loading that they either used to have for 

this building or will need in the future for this building 

will -- they will not be able to accommodate any more on 

their property, and will only be able to be accommodated on 

the street.   

          You know, of course there's lots of buildings in 

the city that don't have the luxury of having their own off-

179

street loading zone, and have to -- when they have things 

delivered, or when they have work being done on the 

building, they use on-street, they use the on-street loading 

zones in the area. 

          And this building will need to do the same, 

because their loading zone will be eliminated.  So of 

course, that's not the most desirable thing from a 

transportation perspective, because we generally like when 

projects can accommodate their own loading needs on their 

property, and not have to use -- of course, we have this 

limited off-street parking and on-street curb use. 

          So that was just wanting to make sure that the 

Planning Board fully understands that aspect of the project.  

Doesn't necessarily mean that loading can't be accommodated 

on the street.   

          And what we said was that we think we could, like 

we do for most buildings without their own on-street 

loading, and that's by -- off-street loading, and that's by 

having to maybe add extra loading zones on the street, or do 

other things to best accommodate the need. 

          And we just noted that that could cause some loss 

of other uses -- other things that are on the street, such 

180

as if there's existing parking meters, it's possible that we 

would have to change it into loading zones -- those kinds of 

things.   

          So that was one point to make about the loading. 

          And the other thing for this use, we'd make a 

point about, you know, drop-off pickups.  And it basically 

would have to be used in a loading and on-street.   

          So often what we see from hotels is there tends to 

be a lot of drop-off pickups and taxis -- things of that 

nature.  So that's something that would need to be handled 

on street.  We think we can accommodate that.  We think -- 

you know, but again, it would potentially have an impact on 

the current street itself, probably Temple Street.   

          Then we just made a few points about bicycle 

parking.  They're proposing I think eight long-term bicycle 

parking, which is -- of course -- a positive thing for their 

employees.   

          And they don't have any -- this building, like 

others, that have no sort of setback: you know, we're 

proposing that they contribute a little towards the city for 

short-term bike parking.   

          There are some existing short-term bike racks on 

181

the city sidewalk in front of the site, but we always -- 

during any project, any special large project special permit 

that's creating additional intensity of users in the area, 

it probably means there needs to be even more short-term 

bike parking.  And so, we sometimes look and ask a 

contribution towards that.   

          So in this case, we recommended a contribution to 

the city's bike fund for I think three racks.  And we also 

in our memo recommended to further help mitigate any traffic 

impacts that they would have from this project to implement 

various transportation management measures, which is pretty 

common for projects that have special permits. 

          Regarding parking, I believe they're seeking -- 

they won't have parking spaces.  I believe they're seeking a 

permit from the Board to have zero parking spaces.  You 

know, but again for hotel use, the parking demands tend to 

be very low.  Most of the guests tend to come by taxis and 

Ubers and Lyfts, or even public transportation. 

          So they're I think seeking a reduction of about 12 

parking spaces, and we basically don't think that that's 

going to make any significant problem, in terms of the 

outcomes of this project.

          MARY FLYNN:  Thanks, Adam.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, just a quick one for 

Adam.  Was there any conversation early on in this project 

about retaining the existing curb cut and some kind of -- 

facilitating some kind of loading on that, where the new 

entrance would be?  It seems like it would have made a lot 

of sense in this project to get some loading.   

          I mean, there's retail in this building, the 

commercial use, the hotel use.  Temple Street's not a very 

wide street.   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Yeah.  So I mean, that's of course 

one of the very first things that I asked the applicant 

about was that.  But, you know, I think that may be more of 

a question for them to ask.   

          But I certainly know that they indicated to us 

that that was not something they were either willing to do 

or that they could do to make their project work.

this is Sarah Rhatigan -- would you like a response from us?  

I'm sorry, I think you're asking questions of Adam, so I'm 

happy to wait.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's fine.     

          SARAH RHATIGAN:  I don't want to butt in.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Since Adam referred 

us back to you, why don't you weigh in on that question?     

          SARAH RHATIGAN:  Sure.  I'll just answer very 

briefly, and if there's further discussion, I'll refer it to 

the Design Team.   

          But there was at the very, very beginnings of the 

process of looking at the design for an addition to this 

building, there was quite a bit of discussion about whether 

one could have the hotel lobby and entrance come off of Mass 

Ave?   

          And that would have been the approach that would 

have allowed for the creation of a loading zone in the back.  

And -- because you can't have the lobby and the loading zone 

in the same, small location, right? 

          And it was the overwhelming sort of reactions both 

from the city and from our own design staff that that was an 

approach that would really be a negative for the community,

for the district in terms of you would lose retail access, 

you would kind of interrupt the flow of pedestrian traffic, 

you'd have drop-offs and pickups on Mass Ave interrupting 

the bike path, et cetera. 

          So that led to the hotel entrance on the side, and 

that led to essentially, you know, kind of foregoing any 

possibility of loading in the back.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          SEAN MANNINGHAM:  Sarah, this is Sean Manningham 

(phonetic).  Maybe I can elaborate a little bit --    

          SARAH RHATIGAN:  Oh, thank you, Sean.   

          SEAN MANNIGHAM:  So the other issue as it relates 

to loading, essentially the space where the hotel addition 

is going to be put in place, it doesn't really function 

today like a loading zone, where a garbage truck or other 

trucks could actually back into a loading dock or a loading 

door, so to speak.   

          And in fact, the dumpster that serves 727 Mass Ave 

is a really small, five-yard dumpster on wheels that gets 

wheeled out to a trash truck.   

          And oh, by the way, that's the same for -- I'm not 

going to speak to every entity on Temple Street, but there

are other businesses that operate that same way for -- you 

know, the reason that was alluded to just a few minutes ago.  

Temple Street is extremely narrow.  So turning into some of 

these curb cuts is difficult for trucks.  And they 

essentially just do it on the street itself. 

          The retail uses, which are essentially going to 

stay the same -- you know, whether they're the same tenants 

or a new tenant -- there is a loading zone on Mass Ave just 

to the west of 727 Mass Ave.   

          And one of our goals early on when we were looking 

at where would the entrance of this hotel be is, as Sarah 

was alluding to, we really didn't want to disrupt either the 

loading zone, the parking or the ability of bikes to 

traverse Mass Ave in the future.   

          So that led us to really trying to keep status quo 

with the front of 727 Mass Ave night and really have both 

that and the parking and the loading zone on Mass Ave all 

function in the future exactly as they function today. 

          What we do see and need is a small drop-off area 

for the 37 rooms supporting the hotel.  And we envision that 

space -- you know, would double as the loading zone for the 

hotel, with trash coming out of a trash room, which is 

186

essentially how the building functions today from a trash 

standpoint. 

          37 rooms -- you know, I can't speak to the other 

aspects of the hotel.   I know it's limited use.  There's no 

restaurant space or dining space or anything to that matter.  

          So it's really -- you know, limited trash and 

laundry that would be coming in and out supporting the 37 

rooms.  And again, we see a very small, you know, drop-off 

area supporting that front door.  It would double for 

loading and service as well.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Oh, getting back to Mr. 

Manning (sic).  The area we're talking about is almost 30 

feet wide.  It was used for parking.  It was all chopped up 

into parking spots.  It was just a consideration, because 

these are everyday problems with all of these projects is 

the loading, there's retail in this building -- not just a 

hotel, and office.   

          So I think it creates more of a hassle and more of 

a headache for the surrounding neighborhood than everyone 

thinks. 

187

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

questions for Adam at this point?  Steve and Lou, you both 

have your hands up.  I'm assuming that's just a residential 

thing?  I don't want to miss anybody, but --.   

          Okay.  Steve, if you want to ask a question, 

          [Pause]  

please feel free.     

          [Pause]  

          All right.  We'll move on, then.  Thank you, Adam, 

very many.  Let's go to discussion, which we kind of kicked 

off a little earlier, but we can certainly hear from other 

Board members now, or anyone who's already spoken wants to 

weigh in additionally. 

          Hugh, let's start with you.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, I actually have a number of 

points.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think Erik's analysis of the 

Urban Design of this project is very insightful, and I agree 

with the issues that he's raising.  I would note that he 

doesn't question the actual size of the building, and I do 

not either question the size of the building that’s

permitted under the ordinance.  So I think that's why.   

          I think it's very important that the main color of 

panels on the building be lighter and warmer -- have some 

relationship to the stone, as opposed to just being 

completely different.  I really hate the bronze eyebrows.   

          I think the existing architecture is basically a 

very sleek box, with seven big, double-story openings on the 

first floor, punched openings on the second floor, and then 

pretty small trim pediments over the window, horizontal 

course.  It's a decorated box in terms of Robert Venturi.   

          I think that's what the upper -- what the 

additions should be also, that they should try to keep their 

planer elements at the forefront, and add interest with 

projecting trim and decorations that are in scale with the 

building down below and not overwhelming it. 

          There's a -- so I'm concerned about the 

relationship with the housing building behind it.  I frankly 

cannot imagine how if you build a building that's 25 feet 

taller and 10 feet closer, that the shadows will not be 

significantly different.  At many times of the year, three 

floors of the housing building that get sun will no longer 

get sun.

22

          So if there's a shadow study that doesn't show 

that, it's clearly inadequate.  I think, however, there's a 

worse problem in the adjacency.     

          And it comes from my own personal experience.  My 

house is 30 feet north of the Longfellow School.  When 

somebody leaves the classroom lights on any school at night, 

it's like this incredible spotlight that shines on my house 

and the house next door. 

          And so, I believe we have to consider -- we have 

to take some actions.  One action is on the office floors, 

where the lights might well be on at night, and where there 

might not be blinds, we have to actually provide that there 

isn't significant spill onto the façade of the building -- 

whether that's by an automated blind system on a time clock, 

through some extraordinary lighting system that doesn't do 

it -- but something has to be done. 

          Up above, the windows of the hotel are oversized.  

Like, a 10 foot bedroom might have a nine-foot wide window.  

There's three places where a corridor has a 15-foot wide 

window.  I think the scale of the windows, and particularly 

in the hotel, have to be scaled in a way that is not 

dissimilar in the scale of the windows in the housing.

21

22

          Yes, the window shades will probably be closed on 

both sides, but I think the scale is just lay off.  And if 

you reduce the amount of glazing on the north façade, you -- 

say, you know, one six-foot window per room, which is a big 

window -- you've going to save quite a bit of energy. 

          Point number six, we're asked to give an exemption 

essentially to the Bank of America for its frontage and its 

existing signage.  I don't think we should give them a free 

pass.  Frankly, I'm not concerned about the present 

frontage; they've been there a long time.  I don't think we 

should force them to be less, but I'd like to see a complete 

review of the signage.   

          In particular, right now there's a big sign that’s 

got a white background.  It's mounted over a dark, black 

portion of the building, and it has I believe illuminated 

Bank of America logo.   

          Imagine that sign that has just the illuminated 

logo letters, either with a black box or just floating 

letters.  You keep the logo, you keep the same size of the 

information, but the impact of the building could go down a 

lot, and could bring it much more in conformance with the 

historic building.

          Point seven:  The two-story opening on Temple 

Street to the hotel leads into a lobby that's like 30 feet 

tall and 15 feet square.  It doesn't make any architectural 

sense, but it is out of scale with the existing building 

openings down the street.   

          And I would suggest that the opening hotel be no 

taller than the rectangular portion of the openings down the 

street.  They'll still be 15 to 16 feet tall.  They'll still 

be grand and wonderful, but they won't be out of scale.   

          And so point nine -- and my last point -- is the 

perspectives we've been given are really inadequate for a 

project of this impact.  We need more street-level views.  

They need to be more detailed. They need to show more 

context.   

          I think we should -- I think because of all of 

this, we should not act on this project tonight, but we 

should send them back to continue working with Erik to get 

the design to a place where it ought to be.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That's it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Hugh.  Who 

would like to chime in next from the Board?

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  It's Tom.  It's a very hard act 

to follow.  Thank you, Hugh, for your analysis, much of 

which I agree with, some of which I don't, and I'll just get 

into that.  I mean, I think firstly we very quickly went by 

the western elevation, and I understand it to be a party 

wall, and Erik pointed that out. 

          There is a suggestion that something more should 

be done with that wall.  That's one of the street 

perspectives, Hugh, that got my attention.   

          I felt short shrift after that marvelous mural 

that it's there, that there's a kind of a cartoon of a wall 

there that's either pregnant for another mural, or could be 

treated in its abstraction in a more imaginative way than 

just be back in the house.  Because it's a very large wall 

facing City Hall and facing the Post Office. 

          But starting there with the detail, I'll actually 

go all the way back to Steven Cohen's first comments.  I 

think it is from a massing standpoint -- and I find the 

scheme very appealing -- I think appropriate.   

          And I think because of the possibility to fund the 

restoration, the continued restoration of this important 

building in the Square, it's something that I want to get 

193

right and see whether we can't move forward. 

          I, too, am concerned about the relationship 

between the two buildings.  Hence my action to have a look 

at that model to see what the space felt like between the 

two buildings.   

          I was reassured it feels wider in model than it 

shows in plan.  It looks longer and skinnier in plan to me 

and the model was somewhat reassuring.  But Hugh's analysis 

of light pollution from the hotel and the office complex is 

of primary concern. 

          I don't know what we do about the shadows.  I 

agree I don't quite understand the proponent's typifying 

that there won't be minimal effect, I think there's very 

real effect.  I don't know what you can do about that 

exactly, without some really high tech tricks. 

          So that sort of -- that's where I am, Madam Chair, 

at this point -- thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Tom.  

Other Board members want to comment on the project?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, I will, it's Mary.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I really -- I don't have a lot to

add, obviously the two colleagues who spoke before me are 

the design experts on the Board, and, you know, I think Hugh 

has certainly done a very detailed analysis.  I think the 

point is, though, that it needs additional work and study.   

          I do feel that -- I don't have a problem with the 

overall scale of the building.  I, you know, I think the 

height is fine, the FAR is fine.  It's just that the new 

section just feels too heavy to me.   

          And I think, as Hugh said, you know, it's -- maybe 

it's the eyebrows.  Maybe it's the materials and the 

absolutely contrast, or -- you know, the big contrast, as 

opposed to something that blends a little bit more with the 

materials below. 

          So I think, you know, there is a lot of potential.  

And certainly, we do need to think about the relationship to 

the apartments behind the building.  So, you know, in 

general I like the project very much.  I think it just needs 

additional work in terms of the design. 

          Yeah, I think I'll leave it there.  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Let's see.  

Who haven't I heard from on General Discussion?  Ted, you 

want to chime in here?

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah, sure.  So I like the 

concept of the project, and I like a lot of the design.  I 

was very off put by the bronze, and then when I saw the 

model being all white, I felt a lot better about the design.   

          And I don't know, you know, whether the bronze was 

an attempt to match City Hall or the building next to it, 

but I just found it very jarring.   

          And maybe it is the eyebrows, maybe it is a lot of 

things that -- you know, I was really curious what you and 

Tom would have to say about it.   

          You know, I don't know what we do about the 

building being next to the apartment building.  I cannot 

believe that it will not have a tremendous negative impact 

on the people who live on that side of the apartment 

building.  And I'm really curious whether someone from the 

Cambridge Housing Authority could come and speak about it, 

tell us what they think.   

          You know, I appreciate the developers talking to 

them, but talking to them two years ago before they may have 

seen plans -- you know, I'm just uncomfortable about that, 

and would like to feel better about it, and I do not know 

how you could do it.  I think Tom -- Hugh's comments were

very interesting.   

          I do want to see renderings from across the 

street, from across Mass Ave.  I am also -- there's a 

comment that the penthouse facilities would be mostly 

shielded, mostly screened.   

          That does not give me a lot of comfort.  I've been 

very distressed about a number of buildings that we have 

improved with what was promised us about shielding of the 

mechanicals. 

          And then we end up with very different rooflines, 

because, you know, the engineers told them in the midst of 

construction: "Well, you have to move [this], you have to 

move [that]" and we end up with very different appearances.   

          And I really would like to know now when we 

approve things what the roofline is going to look like, what 

the mechanicals are going to look like, and how they're 

going to be screened.   

          You know, I agree that we ought to let Bank of 

America stay there.  I have no problem with continuing 

someone that’s been there for a long time.  I think Hugh's 

comments about the signage, maybe that could be better, 

something we could all take a look at.

          Other than that, you know, I like the concept of 

it.  I like what it does to the historical building.  But I 

am uncomfortable about its impact on the neighboring 

building is my primary concern.   

          I'm not terribly concerned about traffic or 

parking or issues on Temple Place.  You know, I think it is 

what it is, and it seems getting off Mass Ave is the right 

way to go.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Lou or Steve, do either of you want to add additional 

comments at this time?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I'll go.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Not much more.  I agree with 

Ted, we need to see this mechanical penthouse.  It looks 

like very transparent screening and in close proximity to 

the housing building next door, noise and abuse through 

this. 

          And the exterior of the building seems very 

disjointed.  Like I said to Erik, I would like something 

done on that west façade to spruce that up instead of just 

having a flat façade.  It is a very long view down Mass Ave.

I think it needs some work. 

          The Temple Street side, I understand about the 

floating aspect of the upper stories, but it's just very 

disjointed to me, it needs to be grounded somehow, or have 

some kind of continuity.  It just doesn't work for me.  I'd 

like to see some work done on it.   

          That's about all I have.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve?  

Anything to add at this time?  Steve?  [Or is he muted?] 

Steve?   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Oh sorry.  Didn't realize I was 

muted.  So just a few quick comments.  I think first of all 

the Mass Ave Corridor -- especially I hear the Corridor of 

Central Square is very important, and I think is a priority 

in terms of the -- you know, the visual environment that we 

create in the city. 

          And therefore, I think making this building work 

right is the first priority, even if hypothetically it has 

some relatively minor compromise on some of the lesser 

buildings right behind it.   

          I think over the years in various studies, there 

have been suggestions that the buildings in Central Square 

199

should be taller.  And this certainly isn't going to be a 

12-story building.  But it is going to be somewhat taller, 

and I think it should be. 

          So while I'm not suggesting that I don't care 

about the impact on any other people or buildings, I think 

in terms of prioritizing, that making this building work 

well is the priority.   

          And I think to the extent that the height has some 

impact on the buildings behind, I think everything is a 

compromise and prioritizing, and I think that’s a priority 

that I could readily support. 

          The only other subject I would raise is that the 

actual design of the additions -- and I guess we've heard a 

couple comments that perhaps the windows are too large, and 

the materials.   

          And I guess it' s sort of a question of being 

somewhat meek and, you know, trying to fit in perfectly with 

the existing building and materials and scales and so forth, 

versus being somewhat more bold with somewhat, you know, 

different materials and colors and trying to make it work, 

but be bold. 

          I think -- you told me I have to address this, and

I hope I'm not misjudging his concept here, but -- I'm 

obviously seeing something bold here that it sort of, you 

know, is building on what is there, but it's bold. 

          And I think there's a time and place for bold.  I 

don't think we always -- you know -- have to be meek.  So, 

you know, I'm sure there are other approaches that would be 

fine.   

          But I kind of like this bold approach here.  It's 

set back, of course, and -- you know, I would feel totally 

differently if it weren’t appropriately set back.  But with 

the setback, I like the bold contrast. 

          You know, I'll have more to say as the design gets 

further developed.  But generally speaking, I like the 

direction that they're going.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  Just to add my thoughts here, I agree with Ted.  I 

would appreciate kind of a refresh on communication with the 

neighbors, and any communication from the Housing Authority 

or any group of residents who live there would be welcome.  

Just knowing that that conversation is ongoing I think is 

important.   

          You know, the buildings will be neighbors for a

long time.  It's important that they be in conversation with 

each other, both architecturally and for residents, 

literally.   

          I think the light pollution is a problem we should 

try to get a solution to.  I agree with -- I think it was 

Tom -- who acknowledged the shadows are probably a big 

issue, but, or -- I don't want to put words in your mouth, 

Tom -- Tom acknowledged that the shadows maybe an issue, but 

doesn't know what to do about them, and I would echo that.  

I don't know that the shadow problem is solvable. 

          The light pollution problem is.  And I would like 

to see some real effort put into figuring out how we're not 

going to have big spillover lighting problems, given the 

proximity to residences.   

          I think Hugh offered a lot of interesting 

suggestions, and I don't pretend to know what the right 

solution to that is -- whether it's a design solution of 

reducing the total glazing, or a technology solution or some 

combination thereof. 

          But I think that’s a really -- given that we're 

talking about a very tall building near some residences, I 

think it's a very important problem to address, as the

design is further developed. 

          I agree with my colleagues who commented that it 

seems appropriate to let Bank of America stay.   

          I also think that, you know, to the extent the 

owner can work with their tenant to bring the signage back 

closer to compliance with what is expected in Cambridge -- 

that would be certainly welcome, and further the historic 

nature of the building, and be beneficial to everyone. 

          I do think that the Mass Ave Corridor is visually 

the most important, but I think that trying to decide what's 

most important between visuals and residents, I'm going to 

make sure that our residents have a livable situation.   

          And I don't want to shortchange the visuals, 

that's really important too, but if we need to make some 

sacrifices to make sure that people have -- you know, a 

place to live that doesn't drive them crazy, I think that's 

-- you know, I'm certainly open to exploring any compromises 

that are necessary to achieve that.                     

          I'd prefer not to compromise.  I'd like to have a 

place that -- you know, doesn't severely, you know, 

negatively impact the residences, and still creates a 

beautiful place.  And if we can achieve that, that's going

to be an easy permit to vote yes for, so.   

          I'm hearing pretty clearly from Board members that 

we think there's further design development that needs to 

occur here, and so, we're not going to act on this tonight.  

          Are there anything -- additional thoughts from 

Board members that they want to send the applicant away with 

things to work on and further develop in the design, or 

further studies, anything else like that that they should 

come back with when we next see them?     

          [Pause]  

          Okay.   Let me turn to staff.  Staff, Jeff, am I -

- is there anything else that I need to do at this time?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  For the purposes of these meetings, 

it's my suggestion that the Board take a, kind of a 

concluding action to continue the hearing until such time 

that the applicant provides revised materials in response to 

the Planning Board's comments, at which point the continued 

hearing would be scheduled and notification would be 

provided.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  All 

right.  Thank you for that, Jeff.  Do I have a motion from a 

Board member to continue the hearing in accordance with 

204

Jeff's comments?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mary Flynn, so moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second? 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis Bacci, second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou, who seconded.  

Excellent.  Roll call vote, then, Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Back to roll call on continuation.  

Louis Bacci?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Mary Flynn?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Catherine Preston Connolly?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.             

          [All vote YES]

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all seven members present 

voting in favor.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Then that 

concludes the business on our agenda for the evening.  Are 

there any additional comments from staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I do not have additional comments.  

I'll wait a couple seconds to see if any other staff members 

would like to say anything? 

          [Pause]  

          It sounds like I'm not hearing anything.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Do Board 

members have anything to add before we adjourn?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Then the 

meeting is adjourned.  Thank you all very much for coming 

this evening.
