Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Steven A. Cohen, Mary T. Flynn, 

                  Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, and Nikolas 

                  Bowie    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY: Welcome to the June 30 

mtg of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My name is Catherine 

Preston Connolly and I'm the Chair.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to a 

statewide emergency order limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles D Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 

2020, temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law, as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city-permitted events due to COVID-19 dated May 27, 

2020.   

                    This meeting is being audio and video 

recorded, and is being streamed live on the City of 

Cambridge online meeting portal and on cable television on 

4

Channel 22 within Cambridge.  

          There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings.   

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their name before speaking, and all votes 

will be taken by recall.   

          I would also just remind Planning Board members, 

when you do want to be recognized to either speak up and let 

us know immediately, or use the raised hand function within 

the webinar.  Waving and other hand signals are actually not 

terribly effective, because I can only see so many of you at 

once. 

to speak. 

meetings. 

          So if you can remember to do that, that will help 

make sure that I recognize you appropriately when you want 

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it's time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

          So we'll start tonight by asking the staff to take 

Board member attendance and verify that all members are

audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

Jeff Roberts from Community Development.  I'm just going to 

read the names of Planning Board members that we appear to 

have in attendance.  I'm going to read through the list 

first, and then I'm going to ask if people are audible. 

          The Planning Board members present are H Theodore 

Cohen, Steven Cohen, Mary Flynn, Hugh Russell, Tom 

Sieniewicz, Associate Member Nikolas Bowie, and the Chair, 

Catherine Preston Connolly. 

          It appears that Louis Bacci is having trouble 

connecting.  We will check again later, and record if he is 

able to be present.  But for the time being, for the members 

who are present:  H Theodore Cohen, can you please note 

whether this meeting is audible and visible to you?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It is audible and visible to 

me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and you are audible and 

visible to us.  Steven Cohen?  Can you tell us if the 

meeting is visible and audible to you?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes, it is.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and you are visible and 

6

audible to us.  Mary Flynn, is the meeting visible and 

audible to you?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, it is, both visible and audible.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and you are visible and 

audible.  Hugh Russell, is the meeting visible and audible 

to you?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes, it's visible and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And you are visible and audible to 

us.  Thank you.  Tom Sieniewicz, is the meeting visible and 

audible to you?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes, the meeting is visible and 

audible to me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And you are visible and audible to 

us.  Thank you.  Nikolas Bowie, is the meeting visible and 

audible to you?                     

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes, and you're visible and 

audible to me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and you are visible and 

audible to us.  And Catherine Preston Connolly, is the 

meeting visible and audible to you?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, it's visible and 

audible to me.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Great.  And you are visible and 

audible to us.  Thank you.  That's seven Planning Board 

members present.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  All 

right!  The first item on the agenda, then, is an Update 

from the Community Development Department.  Jeff, if you 

would introduce the staff present at the meeting as well, 

that would be good.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  We are -- 

I am Jeff Roberts, the Director of Zoning and Development.  

With me on the Zoning and Development team are Swaathi 

Joseph -- she is the one running the slide deck tonight for 

the presentation portion. 

          I also have from Zoning and Development team 

Daniel Messplay, Liza Paden, and Sarah Scott.  Iram Farooq 

is with us, the Director -- I'm sorry, the Assistant City 

Manager for Community Development.  Erik Thorkildsen is here 

from Community Development from the Urban Design team; and 

Suzannah Bigolin, also from the Urban Design team in 

Community Development is present.   

          So those are the staff that are with us this 

evening.  Just for a quick update for the Board:  Tonight we

have another agenda of General Business items, primarily in 

Design Review, as well as looking at Board of Zoning Appeals 

cases, as the Board of Zoning Appeal will begin its meeting 

under remote format next week. 

          In terms of the future Planning Board agenda, 

there is no meeting scheduled for next week.  Starting in 

July, we have begun to schedule Planning Board cases that 

were postponed from back in March.   

          So July 14, we'll be hearing a case on a cannabis 

retail store at 1686 Mass Ave.  That was a continued case 

that was postponed from March. 

          We also have two cases for July 21 that were 

postponed that have not been heard yet; another cannabis 

retail store case on Mt Auburn Street, and a proposal for 

hotel development in Central Square, 727 Mass Ave.   

          We don't have any items scheduled for July 28, and 

we're currently working out the schedule for August.  We 

expect to have a number of meetings in August, and we're 

working out what the details will be on the dates. 

          Just as a small preview, we know that we have at 

least four outstanding special permit cases to be scheduled.  

We have at least two zoning petitions that have been

referred that will need to be heard, and at least one 

comprehensive permit application that will need to be 

reviewed by the Planning Board before going to the BZA.  So 

we expect it's going to be a very busy August. 

          As for other upcoming events, the Ordinance 

Committee is beginning to hold hearings.  They will have 

hearings on July 8 and July 22, on the Affordable Housing 

Overlay Zoning Petition, which was filed again in June by 

the City Council Ordinance Committee.  There's also an 

Ordinance Committee hearing scheduled on July 7 to discuss 

the city's cycling safety ordinance. 

          So that is what we have upcoming for about the 

next month, and we'll have more updates as we go, and we'll 

be keeping our webpage updated as well.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  If there are 

any questions from Board members, please remember to state 

your name before posing any questions.  No?  Okay.  Okay.   

          Well, then, the next item would be approval of 

meeting minutes.  However, the Board has not received any 

new transcripts from past meetings to approve this meeting.  

So we can move on to our next agenda item.

Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Steven A. Cohen, Mary T. Flynn,  

                  Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, Nikolas          

                  Bowie, and Louis Bacci 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Next item on the 

agenda is a Design Update for Planning Board case #296, a 

previously granted special permit for a building addition at 

57 JFK Street.  We will begin with CDD staff, summarizing 

why this is before us, and I believe Erik Thorkildsen is 

going to walk us through that.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yes, thank you.  This is Erik 

Thorkildsen, CDD.  The Planning Board granted a special 

permit in 2015, and an amendment in 2019 for a three-story 

office addition over the existing building at 57 JFK Street, 

which has two stories and a basement, and that will continue 

to be used for retail. 

          The project is subject to continuing design review 

by CDD staff.  Some design changes have been made that staff 

wanted to review with the Planning Board for your feedback.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thank you, 

Erik.  So the presenter on behalf of the project is Raj

Dhanda.  Please begin by introducing yourself and any other 

speakers from your team, and then you can begin your 

presentation.  You'll have up to 30 minutes, unless the 

Board grants additional time. 

          [Pause]    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  I believe Raj is muted.     

          RAJ DHANDA:  Yes.  So I'm going to ask -- this is 

Raj Dhanda -- I'm going to ask Peter Quinn to make the 

presentation. 

          PETER QUINN:  For the record, my name is Peter 

Quinn of Peter Quinn Architects in Davis Square, 259 Elm 

Street in Somerville.  Yeah, we came before you quite a 

while ago with this project, having gone through extensive 

Design Review with Cambridge Historic Commission, and then 

we came for a special permit on the project. 

          And I must admit I can't remember what the date of 

that was, but I believe it was a couple years ago. 

          What we're doing now is really outside the area of 

what we had received the special permit for.  But because 

the whole building was looked at the in the special permit 

application, I believe that's what puts it under -- puts it 

in this meeting tonight.

          And just to -- if you could go to the third sheet, 

Swaathi, I would appreciate it. 

          [Pause]  

          PETER QUINN:  Excellent.  Well, the one that has 

the existing conditions in the photos.  (Yeah, there you 

are.)  So this is the existing building a couple years ago, 

it hasn’t changed much, but the main focus of the work that 

we're showing you tonight is that we would like to remove 

the ramp that we see in the upper right-hand photo.  That 

ramp is a noncompliant ramp, so it's not officially a 

handicap accessible ramp.   

          And what we're proposing to do is to absorb that 

into the retail space behind it.  As you probably all know, 

Staples has moved out, and/or is in the process of moving 

out.  

          And once that occurs, you know, the building is 

potentially able to get reconfigured, and we can also 

continue with some of our early construction efforts to 

prepare for the addition on the roof. 

          The other area of interest tonight is one of the -

- creating a new entry on the side street off the public 

pedestrian walkway.  And this is something that had been 

13

12

suggested I think by this Board back when we first came in, 

and it certainly was recommended by the Historic Commission 

on several occasions. 

          So if we could go to the next slide.  [Pause] 

          So this is what we would propose we do with the 

removal of the ramp.  You can see how that storefront 

material is just continued down, and to match the existing.  

We had always proposed to use this over scaled C-Channel for 

our signage delineation.  And that has continued in this 

proposal here. 

          The steps on the left that you see are -- we're 

going to try to make them a little safer.  If you've ever 

been up and down them, you know they're quite steep.  So 

we're putting in a tread with a nosing -- they actually have 

no nosing right now -- and also providing a middle handrail, 

which it needs.   

          [Pause]  

          Could you go to the next slide, please?  

          This is the corner view, where you can see how 

that ramp has been taken out, the brick has been continued 

and essentially just matching existing wherever we can. 

          And off to the right you can see the new, proposed

projection from the building creating an entry mark.  We can 

go to the next slide, I think.  There's a picture of it.  

          [Pause]  

          So what we're trying to do here is there is an 

existing opening here.  And we're modifying it to create an 

entry into a retail space, and an entry into a completely 

handicapped accessible entry into the building.    

          So I think actually this provides a much more 

immediate means to get into the building for people who are 

on this pedestrian walkway, and probably a little bit safer 

when they come out, because there's no traffic here. 

          And if you go to the next slide, I think you'll 

see the view across the park?   

          [Pause]  

          Yeah, there it is.  So you can see how that 

deepened sea channel provides our signage.  And then the 

thing -- the sign -- I'm sorry, the entry mark is projected 

forward. 

          [Pause]  

          If you could go back to page 3, I'll show you.  

          There you go.  So the plan on the right is showing 

you how we absorb the space from the ramp.  It essentially

just is included into that large retail space there.   

          And then in the center of the drawing on the 

right, you see the two doors that create the new entry into 

the building, with a wide, approximately eight-foot wide 

corridor into what was the atrium space. 

          And there's also a new entry provided for that 

particular retail space in the corner as well.   

          Could you go back up one more?   

          [Pause]  

          Yeah.  So this view is showing the proposed 

addition on the building.  But our focus here is really just 

on this portico entry and the corner on the left.   

          And one more up, you'll see the view from the 

other direction.  So from JFK this is all filled in 

consistently; the brick is matched, and the building is just 

brought down into that corner.   

          That's really the sum of it. Thank you.  Happy to 

take any questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Questions or 

comments from Board members?  Again, make sure to say your 

name before you start your comment or question.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'm Hugh Russell.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Hugh, go ahead.          

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I have a -- there's the stairs 

shown in your entry.  Does that stair go up, or does it go 

16

down?   

          PETER QUINN:  Well, that entry is actually 

existing.  That stair is a new stair for a new tenant in the 

basement.  We're still working out exactly how that will 

work, depending on the tenant's needs.  But that's an 

internal building code matter at this point, as well as a 

tenant negotiation. 

          So we've had -- I think Raj can explain that, but 

there's been real interest in how that basement space could 

be used effectively.  Yeah.  You're referring to the 

stairway to the left of the --             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Right.     

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I understand where the center was; 

there were escalators.     

          PETER QUINN:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And you're not certain what is 

going to be there?     

          PETER QUINN:  That's right, that's right.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  And the second question:  I 

believe there's a change to the transformer in the plans we 

approved?  Is that true?     

          PETER QUINN:  Yes.  Well, it's a little more 

complicated than that.  After we got the special permit, you 

know, a few years ago, we entered into a long -- I would say 

protracted negotiation with Eversource that went on and on, 

to the extent that the original assumption that we had made 

that we supply the building from the transformer -- the 

common transformer that's in the street -- disappeared.   

          And at the point, we were not only required to 

bring in a transformer onto this property, but to create an 

entire switch station for it.  So it's really got a very 

extensive reconfiguring of utilities -- electrical utilities 

for this building, and for the future addition. 

          And unfortunately --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So that's why you're seeking 

reapproval?     

          PETER QUINN:  I believe we -- well, it all occurs 

in the back of the building, where it meets the building 

that [Raj?] also runs from Elliott Street, in an area where 

there's a concrete wall right now.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Well, from a legal point of view, 

if we've not approved it, it represents a change in design 

that is something that we should be addressing tonight.  I 

have a question about that, because in the previous plan, 

there were a half a dozen dumpsters in that location. 

          I do not see any dumpsters in the plans we were 

furnished, which are different than plans that are shown 

now. And so I don't have any idea how you're going to do the 

trash, and it's certainly something we are interested in.     

          PETER QUINN:  I see.  I'm afraid we'd have to come 

back with a separate presentation.  That would be required.  

Raj, do you have any comment about that?   I know you've 

spoken with Inspectional Services about that utility 

proposal.  Raj? 

          RAJ DHANDA:  Yes? I'm sorry, the question?     

          PETER QUINN:  The question was whether you have 

any information about the approvals for the utility 

transformer and other aspects of that work in the back?   

          RAJ DHANDA:  The Eversource folks have approved 

the land that we have, in putting the transformer and the 

switch gear there.  This was really their idea.  As Peter 

just said a few minutes ago, we were promised a different

setup, but that's been imposed on us by Eversource.   

          PETER QUINN:  I think if we in fact do need to 

come back and get approval for that design review, you know, 

we'd be happy to do it.  I think we just need to know that 

that is the case.   

          We have filed -- we're about to file those 

drawings, you know, for a building permit, and I think we 

were under the impression that we can do it by right, but I 

may be wrong about that.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Are there 

other questions for the applicant from Board members at this 

time?  We will have a chance to ask Eric for additional 

questions, and perhaps have Eric or Jeff weigh in on whether 

or not this would be a change that requires our approval as 

well. 

applicant?       

          So other questions from Board members for the 

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, Catherine, I have one -- this 

is Mary Flynn.  We received some communication from the 

public that stated that there are new plans for the project, 

which include proposed housing units and significantly 

change the design of the project -- I'm not sure that the

change is even included.   

          Could you update us, please, on what the actual 

plans are for the future of the property?   

          RAJ DHANDA:  At this moment, we are exploring a 

possibility of change, in the use of the -- and design of 

the addition.  But really, at this moment, it's just 

something we are thinking about, and we are trying to get 

some input.   

          This particular approval we are looking for is 

simply to enclose the ramp and to create the new entrance on 

Winthrop Street, which has been a wish of many folks in the 

neighborhood and in the associations, and the city, and 

Historical Commission. 

          If and when those things come up, obviously we'll 

be in front of you.  At this moment, we need this simply to 

be able to finish the corner and a new entrance.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  So the future plans that 

you're contemplating, I would assume that -- and correct me, 

please, if I'm wrong, that the first two floors  will remain 

as they are now, is that correct?  

          RAJ DHANDA:  That is correct.  There would be 

nothing changing on the first two floors and the lower

floor.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?       

          [Pause]   

unmute yourself?     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, do you want to 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I was saying I'm not sure this 

is for the applicant or for Eric, but can I assume that by 

enclosing the ramp there is not a GFA issue?  That it falls 

within what is currently allowed?   

          RAJ DHANDA:  Peter, you want to answer that?     

          PETER QUINN:  Yes, I can answer that, this is 

Peter Quinn.  In Cambridge, a covered ramp like this would 

already be included in the GFA calculation.  So enclosing it 

on the sides makes no difference in terms of how GFA is 

calculated.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I note that 

Lou Bacci has joined us.  Lou, can we do a quick sound 

check, even if you don't have a question, just to make sure 

that you can see and hear us, and we can see and hear you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, I can see and hear you.  

I've been listening all the time, just a bad connection.    

22

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Glad you 

could join us.  All right.  So unless there are other 

questions for the applicant, we can turn to questions for 

the staff.  And we haven't received written materials from 

staff, but Eric has obviously reviewed the revised plans 

with the applicant, and is available for questions from the 

Board?   

Eric?     

          Any questions for Eric?  No?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell.  What do you think, 

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Well, let's say.  The expansion 

of the retail space east of JFK Street to the façade, and 

the elimination of the existing ramp -- concerns of 

accessibility are addressed elsewhere in the building, which 

it looked like they are; the expanded retail space will 

bring the shopfront closer to the street, and so make the 

interior more visible; which sounds like a good thing. 

          The change to the steps at JFK Street entrance 

also seems good.  The existing steps have always seemed 

oddly steep, and one of the sets of drawings that we 

received at the CDD, the other step -- not the step we're 

looking at here that's labeled presentation -- the other

step goes, the step will actually be extended so that they'd 

be at a less steep angle.   

          So that would be a good thing to resolve, where 

this set of drawings shows the steps -- you know, the rises 

in the same location, as they are right now. 

          On the steps that -- the regulations on guardrails 

ought to be checked.  It looked like there are some pretty 

big openings there, but that's not really our building. 

          On Winthrop Street, the addition of the projected 

canopy over the entrance seems fine.  The applicant could 

consider getting it further east, so that it's also over the 

entry to the retail space at the building's northeast 

corner.   

          There are some other minor changes to the façade, 

that I don't think particularly matter -- elimination of a 

horizontal mode that, about four feet above the floor.  And 

it looks like the upper portion of the windows -- the upper, 

say, quarter of the windows, there's a gray zone shown 

there, I assume that's blind, not the fascia of a drop 

ceiling. 

at it.     

          So those were the thoughts we had just on looking

          PETER QUINN:  May I respond to that?  This is 

Peter Quinn.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think if the Board 

has questions for you, they can --    

          PETER QUINN:  Sure.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- ask.  I think, you 

know, right now we wanted to get Erik's input.  But if Board 

members have additional questions, we can certainly make 

time for that.  Are there Board member questions further for 

staff, or do you want any further clarification from the 

applicant?       

-   

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, it's Mary Flynn.  To 

Hugh's question about the review of the electrical conduit -

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good point.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Need clarification on that, please.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think that’s a good 

reminder, Mary, thank you.  Jeff, the question has been 

raised as to whether or not the changes to the transformer 

room and the changes that are necessitated to trash 

collection and pickup because of that -- are those things 

that would require Board approval?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So this project is in a status that 

we call, "Continuing Design Review."      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The Planning Board approved a set 

of plans, and there were a set of plans attached to the 

amendment approval from last year.   

          At this point, the plans should be in substantial 

conformance to the plans that were approved by the Board, 

but there are items that require refinement, as the design 

process moves along, and it's the role of CDD staff to 

review those changes between the Planning Board approval and 

the issuance of a building permit to make sure it's all in 

conformance. 

          So there are items that staff will look at as part 

of that detail review.  There is an issue where staff is not 

-- can't -- staff doesn't feel like we can make the 

determination on our own whether or not it's in substantial 

conformance; we bring it back to the Planning Board to look 

at. 

          So the advice that we seek from the Planning Board 

is whether the -- whether the new plans remain in 

substantial conformance.

20

21

22

          And, as Hugh pointed out, if the trash facilities 

have moved in some substantial way, that's an issue that the 

Planning Board might want to say needs to be looked at again 

before it can be approved as being in substantial 

conformance.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So is that 

something we would -- you know, need -- could we opine on it 

tonight, or do we need to push it to a later meeting?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I believe any advice that the Board 

would have would be appropriate.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It sounded like the issue that Hugh 

brought up was that it's not clear, based on the current 

proposal, whether there's any change being proposed to --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- the trash handling.  So that's 

something that the Board could ask for clarification on.  

Certainly, staff would look for clarification on that, and 

if the plans that we saw had trash handling in a different 

place than what was originally approved, that's something we 

would likely bring back to the Board to look across.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.

          PETER QUINN:  Sorry, Madam Chair, the sound 

quality is really bad.  Can I ask that people who are not 

speaking mute their microphones?  I -- we're getting a 

double -- at least I am, I'm hearing everything twice, and 

it's very hard to -- 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Is that -

- I think that sounds better, for me at least.  Hopefully 

that addresses the issue.  Okay.  Go ahead, Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I was just going to ask, is there 

anything else I need to clarify, if anyone couldn't hear me?  

No?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No.  I think we're 

good.  All right.  If Board members don't have any further 

questions, then, for the applicant or for staff, we can go 

to public comment on this matter, yes?  [Pause]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any members of 

the public who wish to speak should now click the button 

that says, "Raise hand," and if you're calling in by phone, 

you can raise your hand by pressing *9.  

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, we have received one 

written communication on this matter, from Marilee Meyer on 

behalf of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association.

          [Give that a minute for people to raise their 

hands.] 

          Okay.  I'll now ask staff to unmute the speakers 

one at a time.  When they do, you should begin by saying 

your name and address, and then staff will confirm that we 

can hear you.  After that, you will have up to three minutes 

to speak before I ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So this is Jeff Roberts again.  

I'll be managing the unmuting.  So the first speaker is a 

phone number with the last digits 3-1-1.  Please start by 

saying your name and address.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, Heather.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  I have one small comment that --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I just want to confirm that we can 

hear you, thanks.    

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Okay.  I have one small comment 

that I'm sure I have said before, but as far as I'm 

concerned, the ramp is the only nice thing about this 

building.  When I have been there, it is the thing that 

attracts people.  So if you want to get rid of it, fine, but 

29

understand that it was actually the good feature of the 

building.  Thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  And the next speaker is 

James Williamson.  Can you please start by -- I'm just going 

to unmute you now -- start by saying your name and address?     

          [Pause]  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So we -- if you're speaking, we 

can't hear you currently.  Can you --  

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  I'm --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Try --  

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  -- yeah, can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Just say your name and address and 

we'll confirm.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Yeah, I have trouble with the 

headphones, and now I can barely hear you.  I've been having 

-- you know, so -- but you can hear me okay?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Can you say your name and address 

please?   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Can you hear me okay?

Williamson, and my address is 1000 Jackson Place in 

Cambridge.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  So I was a little disappointed 

that apparently you only received one written communication.  

I sent an e-mail in, and Brad Bellows also sent e-mail.   

          I guess it's -- you know, the procedures for the 

Planning Board aren't very -- some of them aren't really 

well communicated very clear to the public, one of which is 

by when exactly we have to have written comment in for it to 

get before you, before the meeting or the hearing. 

          So I guess neither Brad Bellows' really thoughtful 

extensive comments nor mine, which were somewhat parallel 

were before you. 

          Brad points out -- I think when we were both at a 

meeting with Mr. Dhanda, where he was presenting his new 

idea for the building -- a change of use to residential and 

an additional floor, going up to 70 feet and moving the 

terrace upper stories closer to Winter Park, which was 

concerning to a number of us, but. 

          The main idea that I think Brad shared with us was 

that if in fact there is going to be a new and different 

31

proposal with a different design, and if that -- and there's 

a question of how that new proposal and new design would be 

integrated with the two-story retail podium, if you will. 

          And that was discussed to some extent at this 

informal meeting -- if there's going to be a question of 

integrating the new proposal to the existing two-story 

retail podium, then there are obvious questions about how 

much sense it makes to go forward with this proposal before 

it's clear what the ultimate, integrated design might 

actually -- the shape that that might actually take. 

          So I think that was a really useful is it that 

Brad presented, which I support.  I'm glad to hear members 

of the Planning Board -- Hugh Russell, you bring up the 

trash issue.   

          For me, you know, I'm okay with filling in where 

the ramp is.  I appreciated the insights about being careful 

about the treatment of the stairs. 

          But my big concern is there's this very 

interesting and historically important retaining wall -- 

stone wall.  Chris Macken just sent me pictures that he went 

and took earlier today, many of you are aware of it, and Mr. 

Dhanda does own three relevant buildings -- three relevant

properties, where there is this pathway where the trash has 

been, that Hugh Russell asked about, and that was once a 

walk-through, I'm convinced, because there's clearly a 

cinderblock wall that was added, blocking off the ability to 

walk down some stairs, and then you can confronted with a 

cinderblock wall. 

          That wall could be opened up, and there could be 

this wonderful opportunity to have a walk-through, or a 

pathway through there, where you could also open up the 

historic retaining wall, and maybe even have a little patio 

back there behind the IHOP building that has the IHOP in it. 

          And what might be an obstacle is this Eversource 

thing.   

          And so I just think that this is something that 

deserves careful attention by everybody who has a chance to 

be involved in maybe shaping this project, before it gets to 

the point where it's too late to open up this -- I think 

wonderful opportunity -- you could just walk down through 

there on your way to --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Williamson --  

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  -- school if that's where 

you're going, or you could walk up to Winthrop Park, and I

just think it's a wonderful opportunity.  I think it's been 

recognized by people at the Historic Commission, but 

obviously there are things that would have to be done to 

ensure its possibility.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you, Mr. Williamson.  As you noted, we actually have 

received additional communication since 5:00 p.m. yesterday.  

Those will be added to the record.   

          Given our current circumstances, I'm only able to 

kind of recite out those that were received in time for our 

notes here.  But that doesn't mean that those messages were 

not received or reviewed by Planning Board members.  So I 

want to assure you of that. 

          Are there any other members of the public who want 

to be heard on this matter?  If so, please raise your hand 

virtually or by pressing *9 on your phone.   

          [Pause]  

          Nope? All right.  Seeing no others from the public 

who want to be heard on this matter, I ask the Board, is 

there a motion to close public comment for this item?   

          PARTICIPANT:  So moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second? 

34

          PARTICIPANT:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Roll call vote?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Can I just ask the Board members 

who made the motion in second say your name, just so we have 

them for the record?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Jeff.  Tom Sieniewicz 

made the motion.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steven Cohen, second.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So a roll call on that vote.  Lou

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Catherine Preston Connolly?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.     

          [ALL MEMBERS VOTE YES]  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Board 

members, is there discussion on this matter?   

          [Pause]            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Can I raise my hand?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.  Hugh.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I would think that we could 

leave the question of whether there was adequate trash 

planned by the building for staff review, and if they find 

there isn't any applicant that says, "We just don't want to 

provide adequate trash" then it would come back to us.  

Hopefully that would not be the case. 

          In terms of the new entry ramp and entry on 

Winthrop Street, I'm fine with those changes.  So that's my 

comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you very much.  

Are there other comments from Board members?  Tom?             

36

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Interested in Eric's observation 

about two sets of plans, and also the rise to run issue on 

that step, that stair.  We all have experienced it as steep.  

I believe Mr. Quinn's presentation indicated he was going to 

change the treads to add a nosing. 

          But rise to run would be dramatically improved if 

the stair was made longer.  I guess that's something that 

this Board member would very much like to see in the 

proposal, that the stair be corrected.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Other 

comments from Board members?  Okay.  Then, are we prepared 

to conclude the Design Update, by finding that the design 

remains in substantial conformance with the approved plans, 

and the conditions of the special permit, subject to 

continuing Design Review by staff? 

          If so, I would entertain a motion at this time, 

just remember to say your name when moving.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steven Cohen, so moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom Sieniewicz, second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Roll call 

vote.

                  Nikolas Bowie and Louis Bacci 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Then we can move on 

to the next item on our agenda, which is a Design Update on 

Planning Board case number 179, the Station Plaza area in 

the Cambridge Crossing PUD.  And again, here we'll begin 

with CDD staff, summarizing why this is before us.  And I 

will turn to Suzannah Bigolin for that.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Madam Chair, this is Tom 

Sieniewicz.  I will be recusing myself from this matter at 

this point, thank you.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.    

          SUZANNAH BIGOLIN:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This 

is Suzannah Bigolin from CDD.  The Planning Board reviewed 

and approved the East and West Station Plazas at Cambridge 

Crossing in October last year.  And at the time, you had 

made some comments to be explored in continuing review. 

          The applicant and Design team has made revisions 

in response to those comments, so we thought it was 

appropriate to come back to the Board and get feedback on

those changes.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Then, we will 

turn it over to a presenter from Divco West, who I believe 

would be Mike Johnson?  If so, please begin by introducing 

yourself and other speakers on your team, and then you can 

commence the presentation.  Again, you'll have no more than 

30 minutes, unless the Board grants additional time.    

          [Pause]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  If you're speaking, 

yeah, you might need to unmute yourself first. 

          MARK JOHNSON:  Yep, this is Mark Johnson with 

Divco West.  Can you hear me??      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, we can hear you. 

          MARK JOHNSON:  Very good, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          MARK JOHNSON:   So I will be the first speaker, 

followed by Chris Matthews of Michael Van Valkenburgh 

Associates, Landscape Architects.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          MARK JOHNSON:   All right.  I would like to begin 

by thanking the Planning Board for resuming its work in this 

unprecedented time and for hearing our request this evening.

We appreciate the Board's effort in moving projects forward. 

          Again, my name is Mark Johnson, I'm Director of 

Development for Divco West, and with me here tonight are 

Antony Galluccio and Darren Baird from our Legal team, Chris 

Matthews, Paula Thompson of Beals+Thomas Civil Engineers; 

and Tom Goemaat with Divco West.   

          As Suzannah explained, we're here this evening to 

ask for approval of certain changes to the design of the 

MBTA Station Plaza.  As you may recall, in 2017 Divco West 

entered into an agreement with the MBTA, and agreed to build 

plazas on MBTA-owned land surrounding the new Lechmere 

station. 

          The Planning Board granted design review approval 

for the plaza in October of 2019, and at that point the 

Board requested that we study several modifications.  We are 

returning tonight to ask for your approval for the design, 

which incorporates those modifications. 

          Before we begin, I want to give you an update on 

Divco West's support for the City of Cambridge and the East 

Cambridge neighborhood.  Divco West made financial 

contributions to the mayor's Disaster Relief Fund for 

pandemic support, and to the Cambridge Summer Empowerment

program, which is sponsored by My Brother's Keeper in the 

City of Cambridge. 

          In addition to these donations, Divco West 

corporately sponsored NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and as seen 

in the photo, we actually donated billboard space to the may 

mayor's Disaster Relief Fund, as shown in the photo.    

          Anthony Galluccio, our local counsel, is here 

tonight and is working with us on this, and we recognize 

that COVID relief is an ongoing challenge, and we're going 

to continue to work with the city on this. 

          [Next slide, please?]  

          The pandemic has also led us to think of new and 

creative ways to active the Cambridge Crossing site.  We've 

migrated our site activation program online.  So all the 

events continue to be free and open to the public. 

          Our CX Summer Night concert series has been moved 

online, and features free music by local bands and free 

cooking demonstrations by local chefs.   

          The photo here is of Will Gilson of Puritan on 

Cambridge Street, what would be opening a new restaurant on 

Parcel W in Cambridge Crossing.   

          In addition, we also hold weekly artist talks and

weekly virtual fitness classes with Club High Rise, also 

pictured here.   

          And we're doing all we can to bring people 

together in this unprecedented time.   

          [Next slide, please?] 

          Additionally, as part of the evolution of the 

public realm in placemaking ideals at Cambridge Crossing, 

Divco West in 2019 worked with the City of Cambridge to 

rename two main future city streets within Cambridge 

Crossing, in honor of Cambridge women -- Harriet Jacobs and 

Gertrude Morgan, shown on this slide.   

          [Next slide.]  

          I also want to give you an update on what's 

happening on site.  The Green Line Extension is well 

underway.  As you may be aware, the old Green Line Viaduct 

that spanned over Monsignor O'Brien Highway has been 

removed.  And this is a photo of the new Green Line taken a 

few days ago. 

          When the Green Line Extension Project was 

suspended, and its future was very much in doubt, Divco West 

partnered with the City of Cambridge and donated $12.5 

million dollars to the MBTA. And we look forward to the

opening of the new Lechmere Station next year.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          We're working hard to advance construction of the 

buildings that the Planning Board has approved.  We work 

with Inspectional Services and the Department of Public 

Works on working safely during the pandemic, and each of our 

General Contractors has submitted plans describing their 

safe work procedures and practices.   

          I'm just using the letters on this slide.  Lab 

buildings on Parcels E, F and G, the office building on 

Parcel H, the apartment building on Parcel I, and the retail 

buildings on Parcels W and Q1 are all under construction, 

and we are scheduled to start construction on the east and 

west components of the station plaza on August 31. 

          [Next slide, please?] 

          As I mentioned earlier, Divco West entered into an 

agreement with the MBTA in 2017 that covered a range of 

issues.  Divco West granted the MBTA a property right that 

it needed in order to build the Green Line Extension, and 

during those negotiations it came to light that the MBTA was 

going to leave crushed stone in the area surrounding the new 

Lechmere station.

          Divco West thought this would be a missed 

opportunity and negotiated the right to operate MBTA-owned 

land, these areas that were to have been crushed stone. 

          It's important to remember that the agreement 

between the MBTA and Divco West places a number of 

constraints on the design of the plaza.  The diagram on the 

screen shows all of the property ownership and easement 

rights.  The plazas are located on MBTA-owned land, and 

extend into Divco West's own land. 

          We're only allowed to build on the land 

surrounding the MBTA station pathways, bicycle parking, 

utilities, and bicycle racks -- in other words the area that 

the MBTA has not currently occupied. 

          There are further constraints as to what can be 

located within the maintenance easements that run along 

either side of the viaduct, that Divco West granted to the 

MBTA. 

          So with that background, I'll turn it over to 

Chris Matthews of Michael Van Valkenburgh Landscape 

Architects to review the plaza design that the Planning 

Board approved in October, and the modifications that will 

address The Board's comments.

          At the end, I'll ask Chris as well to review the 

staff comments we received on Friday, and how we propose to 

address those.  Thank you.   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Thank you, Mark.  Swaathi, if you 

can go to the next slide, please?  So Chris Matthews, with 

Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates. 

          So this is another view of the site plan.  And as 

Mark mentioned, the project sits at the east and west plaza, 

at a side of the North First Street, which extends first 

Street across the O'Brien Highway into the Cambridge 

Crossing neighborhood.   

          And these two plazas really create the public open 

space, and they connect the MBTA station, the bus drop off 

area, and their bicycle shelter with the rest of the 

neighborhood and with East Cambridge itself.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          So this is a view of the West Plaza that we showed 

you was approved by you back in October of last year.  The 

station Head House -- south side of the image -- with the 

plaza designed to the north of that, there's a series of 

brick bands in a concrete paved plaza with plant beds, to 

create this kind of lively crossroads of the station, you

know that thresholds the neighborhood.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          So a view of that plan from October.  This is 

looking from First Street towards Building Q1, which will 

have an information sign for the entire neighborhood on its 

south-facing wall.  So you'll be easily able to see that 

when you come out of the station.  We've got plants growing 

up on the side of the building. 

          And then in the plaza we have an idea of this 

raised planter, created from the reclaimed granite blocks 

that we've been digging out of the grounds of Cambridge 

Crossing, and shade trees above it.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          And now looking, this is a view more from the exit 

of the station, looking towards Building Q1, and you can see 

a pedestrian cut-through on the west side of Q1, which takes 

you into -- over to the North Point Boulevard.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          So this slide summarizes the changes that we've 

made, thanks to your comments.  We've added trees to the 

raised planter, added three trees.  We've reoriented the 

brick bands.   

47

          And although they're not really pathways as such, 

they are indications of sort of direction of movement.  So 

we've reoriented them to avoid some conflicts with GLX light 

poles, and to provide sort of more intuitive circulation. 

          We've enlarged the plant beds on the west side of 

the plaza, between the plaza and the MBTA bus drop off area, 

just to accommodate the grades of the GLX project.  And also 

because of that, we've adjusted the limit of work very 

slightly in that area.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          [Pause.]  

          [Next slide, please, Swaathi?]  

          So this is the updated view.  It is very similar, 

spot the difference.  Really, the only difference in this 

slide is the added trees in that slightly enlarged seating 

area in the middle of the plaza.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

those trees.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          Likewise, the view here represents the addition of 

          On the east side of North First Street, the plaza 

is actually underneath the Viaduct.  So we're on MBTA land.

This is the plan that you saw and approved back in October 

of last year. 

          And I think -- you know, one of the main questions 

that you had at that time was, "So we need to have a grade 

separation between the sidewalk on North First Street and 

the plaza itself, in order to work with the grades that the 

GLX project is leaving us with, and to allow for universal 

accessibility." 

          So we had a low retaining wall on the west side of 

the plaza, between the plaza and the sidewalk, and there was 

a concern about how that separated the two.  So I can show 

you slides later on of how we dealt with that. 

          You'll also notice the site stairs on the 

northwest corner of the plaza, which you were concerned 

about, and we've figured out a way of removing those stairs 

too. 

          Sort of sectioned through that plan -- it's a 

little bit small on the screen, but you can see how there 

was a retaining wall between the sidewalk and the sidewalk 

on North First Street and the plaza, it dropped down a 

couple of feet at the point.   

          [Next slide, please?]

          And a view from close to the MBTA bike shelter, 

looking towards North First Street.  This is, again, the 

plan that we saw in October, or the view that you saw in 

October.  Next slide, please? 

          So the updated plan, which we think is improved -- 

-- thank you for the comments -- we've been able to 

eliminate the site staircase from the northwestern corner. 

          The biggest change is that we elevated the plaza 

to be at the same level as the sidewalk.  So we were able to 

move the retaining wall between the two, and so, where we 

take up the grade difference now is on the east side of the 

plaza between the plaza and the bicycle storage area. 

          What that has meant is that if you can see the two 

circles, the two white circles on the west side of the 

plaza, it appears from the GLX Viaduct.  So there's limited 

head clearance under there now -- seven and a half feet.   

          So what we've done is added three backless benches 

between those piers to prevent -- certainly to prevent 

people cycling under there, but also to sort of signal the 

first thing there's a lower head clearance in that area. 

          We've enlarged the Bluebike station on North First 

Street to 23 bays.  If I'm right -- I think it was a comment

from Hugh about the orientation of those bike racks.  We've 

now orientated it with the general geometry of North First 

Street.   

          It's a little bit anomalous here, because the bike 

lane comes in and swings around, but the bike rack's now, 

aligned with the entire street, and we've committed to fine-

tune that in the field with city staff, when the bike 

station is ready to be installed. 

          We've eliminated all the site stairs, and made 

some adjustments to plant beds and a brick banding to make 

the circulation a little bit more intuitive.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          So in section, you can now see the retaining wall 

is shifted over towards the MBTA bicycle center.  So that's 

where we take up the changing grade.  And you can also see 

the Viaduct pier, that I spoke about with the lower head 

clearance on the west side of the plaza, with the benches 

underneath to limit movement underneath that area.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          So this is the same vantage point, and we showed 

you the view in October.  Now, that retaining wall is moved 

into the foreground, so you can see some other large,

changing grade naturally invites a nice spot for people to 

sit on the edge of the plaza.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          So we received additional comments last week from 

staff.  The space between Q1 and Q2 they felt was 

unresolved.  In fact, Swaathi, if you go to the next slide, 

yes.  So these are the same comments, but graphically 

represented.   

          So the area between Q1 and Q2, which is the top 

left of this slide, the comment was that it was unresolved, 

and that's true.  That area will be fully designed as part 

of the Q2 project -- designed and built as part of the Q2 

project. 

          There was a comment that the hardscape was a 

little bit too narrow on the corner of Q1.  And so, we're 

going to widen that from 10 feet to 12 feet wide. 

          We've added four backed benches on the west side 

of the plaza.  That plant bed will actually be built as part 

of the Q2 project, but we will add those benches as part of 

this portion.  And we've changed a backless bench near the 

bus drop off on First Street to a bench in the back and 

arms.  And we've also shown -- graphically shown the bus

drop off location. 

          So the MBTA bike racks, we've requested that they 

be moved.  We've been unable to get GLX to agree with that, 

so the bike racks remain on the north side of the station.   

          [Next slide, please?]  

          So the East Plaza, the four staff comments:  I 

think if you go to the next slide, Swaathi, it would be 

better if I described them there.   

          So yes, as I mentioned, we would decide -- make 

the final decision on the Bluebike location in the field, 

with city staff when the time comes, and we've added six 

short-term bicycle parking spaces on the northeast corner of 

the plaza. 

          [Next slide, please?]  

          Oh, that was the last slide.  So we had -- 

actually Swaathi, I'm sorry.  Could you just go back to that 

last slide?  So we had had a request from city staff to 

study and additional stair connection in the southeast 

corner of the plaza, so where the retaining wall returns, 

there was a thought that a small stair in there might be 

helpful for people going to the bicycle storage area. 

          We did look at that, we have talked about it.

We're in the context of the GLX plans, and there are a bunch 

of utility lines underneath that area that make that not 

possible, unfortunately.  But we do believe that with the 

length of that.  The retaining wall, though, there's ample 

space to walk at grade around the wall itself. 

          So that concludes our presentation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  Are there questions from Board members for Mr. 

Matthews or Mr. Johnson?  If so, either virtually raise your 

hand, or start by saying your name.  

          [Pause]  

          All right.  How about any questions for staff?  We 

do have Suzannah here, again.  In this case, we did receive 

a memo, but Suzannah is available if we have any questions 

about the memo we received, or anything else has come up 

that folks want to ask about.  It's very -- Oh, Lou, can you 

unmute yourself?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I am.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  There you go.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  A quick question about the 

plaza, has anyone looked at possibly putting the Bluebikes 

station under the Viaduct support, instead of the benches, 

54

and maybe putting seating, and maybe another planter out 

where the Bluebikes location is now?  It looks like it would 

be a good swap, especially if they nosed in both sides. 

          With the low head height there, also the benches 

make a perfect opportunity for somebody to skateboard under 

that viaduct.  But that was my -- and also, maybe, possibly 

an opening in the granite wall, the granite blocks going to 

the bike storage from the main plaza.   

          It looks like it would be a -- the way it's drawn, 

it looks like quite a congested area, and could be a nice 

place to come in from. 

          And the only other thing I had was on the west 

plaza is are we concerned with any interference in the bike 

lane from the bus stop?  Those are my two.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah.  I can field those, Mark, 

unless you have something that you wanted to lead off with?  

          [Pause]  

          Good. So yeah, Lou, the Bluebikes -- there's a 

couple of things.  We looked at dozens of different 

variations on the theme.  Now that we've 23 bikes there, 

it's too long to fit under the piers.

22

          The other thing is that the Bluebikes are powered 

by a solar panel, so we had to move them out to a point 

where they would actually get good -- you know, enough 

sunshine to power the station; that's why ultimately, we 

picked that location.   

          On the question of the connection between the 

plaza and the bike storage area, if I understand you 

correctly, that -- we did look at that in the southeast 

corner of the plaza, and that would require stairs.  The 

point that I made earlier -- those stairs wouldn't work, 

because of the utility lines under there that we can't touch 

and we can't bury any more.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So is the elevation change 

behind the seat wall?   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS: Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The granite black wall?     

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  That's right.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay.   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah.  It's something around 20 

inches or so, yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Probably about -- 

approximately what it was before?

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  It is, yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  But on the Bluebikes 

station, I'm thinking more of nose in on both sides of the 

Viaduct facing each other would be shorter.   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  That's true, but we don't have 

any sun under there, so --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Well, where do you get the 

sun under the current design under the Viaduct itself?   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  I think we have a section in our 

appendix, but if you see how we've located it, the southern 

end of it is right at the limits of the Viaduct.   

          We can't go beyond that, because of the MBTA 

maintenance easement.  So the Viaduct's high enough there 

that the sun year-round will fall on the solar panel that 

they have.  We've done shadow studies of that as well. 

          So in the end result, this is possibly not its 

final location?   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Correct.  This is the location 

that we think works best in response to the comments we had 

from you in October.  But, as you know, you, in the field we 

can put them wherever city staff thinks they work best.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  My curiosity is where it 

57

will be with that it will get sun, then, if we're tied into 

a solar panel.  I don't know if we remotely put the solar 

panel in the sun and move the bikes wherever we want?  It 

seems doable.  I just don't -- you know.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:   Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And we can't move it very 

much if we need that end to be out in the sun.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah, I mean, it comes as a 

package.  I'm not familiar enough with how the Bluebikes 

work, but they come as a package.  The solar panel is part 

of the -- you know, is part of the rack.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, the storage rack, yep.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  I'm not sure that you could make 

that removed, but I don't know that for certain.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It was just an idea to 

ponder.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah.  It's a tricky spot.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It seemed like you used up 

kind of a crappy little space better than just some benches, 

and a better seating area out at the sidewalk would have 

been --      

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yean.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- preferable.  Just 

something to think about.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Well, you know, I mean, to that 

point, all the benches are circus mounted.  So when the time 

comes, we would be able to discuss all about the city staff.  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That's all I have.  And like 

I said, the other one was just a little conflict on the west 

plaza with the bike path on the sidewalk in front of the bus 

stop.  I don't know what we're doing to address any --      

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  That is all GLX area, and Mark 

could speak at great length about our ability to coordinate 

with them.  And I think that we've done a good job, as far 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  But it shows it in your 

as we can do.    

questions?   

limit of work?       

that, Swaathi?   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Do you want to just go back to 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Page 5.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  I may not have understood where

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, no, I got you.  The 

West Plaza plan -- [you can just keep advancing, Swaathi, 

I'll -- yeah, keep going, keep going, keep going.  This one.  

Oh, back.  I'm confused now.  Yeah, go back one, please.  

Yeah, that one.] Is this what you were talking about, Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Now I'm blocking you.  I'm 

off looking at the drawings.  The -- page 5, the "128 2020," 

see the bus stop in to the east of the West Plaza?       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So we have the bike lane 

crossing in front of the bus stop --   

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- on the sidewalk.  

Concerned -- just concerned with delineation, some kind of 

warning -- lots of bikes, lots of pedestrians.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That's all.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah, we do have the little -- we 

-- I'm not sure if you can see on the plan, but we've 

striped in little crosswalks there on the cycle track.  Can 

you see the white lines?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, between the trees I 

60

see them.  I guess.  It just looks like a conflict area, 

that's all.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay. It sounds like 

that's something that we can ask staff to keep an eye on, 

and obviously will require coordination with the MBTA as we 

go forward.  Are there other Board members with questions or 

comments, either for the applicant or for Suzannah?             

          HUGH RUSSELL: I have a comment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Actually I have two comments.   

          On the West Plaza, I cannot comprehend why the 

MBTA won't shift those bike racks around so people can get 

to their station from the north, but I hear you that you've 

done everything that you can.  So the city will have to go 

out there with a chainsaw and fix it after its built, I 

guess.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  I might join them.             

          HUGH RUSSELL: [Laughter]  

          MARK JOHNSON:  This is Mark Johnson speaking.  I 

can attest that we have tried our best, and the answer is 

repeatedly no.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  So on the East Plaza, I had

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  If you advance, Swaathi, I'll say 

"stop." Keep going, keep going.  That one.  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I've been wondering if you park 

your bike in the MBTA bicycle storage area, the fenced in 

area, where are you going to want to go?  And I assume that 

you're going to want to go to the train.  Or, you want to -- 

you know, get off the train, you want to pick up your bike. 

          Now, I can't tell whether there's another entrance 

off that slide to the right that's the closest one or not.  

But --      

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  To the station?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- let's assume for the moment that 

you decide to go to the North First Street kiosk.  So you 

have to walk.  And the only place you can cross on the First 

Street is at the crosswalk at the corner, because there's no 

crosswalk in that whole block.  There's one at each end of 

          So having a logical pathway to get to that 

crosswalk seems to make sense, and trying to get -- to 

facilitate crossing the street in the middle of the block is 

the block. 

a bad idea.

          So to some extent, the Bluebikes stand -- you 

know, is aligned with that notion you're not trying to 

cross.  And also, you don't want to cross the bike lane. 

          So I'm inclined to think the Bluebikes are in the 

right spot, but the East Plaza is there to have special 

events.  It's not really a "desire line" (sic), to get to 

the station itself, or to cross O'Brien Highway.   

          So that's my observation.  I think the present 

design is pretty -- responds to what people will actually 

want.  So I'm going to mute myself.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

comments or questions from Board members?  If not, we can 

move to public comment on this matter.  Any members of the 

public who wish to speak should now click the button that 

says, "raise hand." If you're calling in by phone, again you 

can raise your hand by pressing *9.   

          We had not received any written comments from the 

public on this item, as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday.  A couple of 

raised hands -- and again, give it a minute or two.   

          Okay.  I'll now ask staff to unmute the speakers 

one at a time.  You should begin by saying your name and 

address, and staff will confirm that we hear you.  After

that, you'll have up to three minutes to speak before I ask 

you to wrap up?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks to the Chair.  I'll jump in 

again.  Once again, we have I believe Heather Hoffman by 

phone.  Can you give your name and address to confirm?   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley 

Street.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  You can go ahead.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Well, I wanted to comment on the 

incredible technical innovation that I hope will spread 

through every multibuilding development -- that thing called 

a map: Post it, where people might be wondering where 

they're going to -- how to get to where they want to go.   

          I can't -- it -- the number of top-of-the-building 

signs that will no longer be necessary because there is a 

map to show people where the buildings are, it just boggles 

my mind. 

          And we have asked for this for several 

multibuilding developments, and yet this seems to be the 

first one with this incredible technological innovation that 

only goes back a few thousand years.   

          So I am incredibly excited.  I trust Chris to do

beautiful trees and all of that stuff, I won't question his 

design sense, but I had to say something about that map.  

Thank you.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  Madam Chair, may I speak?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure.   

          MARK JOHNSON:  So just to say thank you for that, 

and the map is on the -- as Chris presented is on the Q1 

parcel facing the mean head house.   

          In response to Hugh's comment, there is a south 

head house to the right of the East Plaza, to the east of 

the East Plaza.  So the pathway that comes out of the 

bicycle cage leads you to an east head house, a second way 

into the station. 

          And just one closing comment:  Staff had also 

raised another comment that Chris was going to speak to that 

of requesting a transit screen on the East Plaza.   

          Our view is that that function is really well 

satisfied in the MBTA station and bus station, and in every 

building lobby, and we're really relying instead on the sign 

that we're putting on the south face of Q1 for community 

announcements and for transportation-related announcements.  

Thank you.

public comment, it's James Williamson.  Can you give your 

name and address, and I'll confirm we can hear you?     

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Yeah.  James Williamson.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And your address, please? 

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Oh, 1000 Jackson Place.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  You can proceed. 

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  So Chris, can you go to the 

image of the East Plaza with the -- that shows the temporary 

bike storage, please?       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  So, Swaathi, if --  

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Or, Swaathi.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  If you could scroll down.  You 

mean the plan?   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Yeah, that's not it, but yeah, 

yeah.  There's one that has the little image of the 

temporary bike storage location.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah.  If you scroll down, 

Swaathi, I think it's the next slide.  Yeah, this one?

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Oh that one, yeah.  Mm-hm.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  So I realize there's nothing 

more important in Cambridge than bicycles and bicycle 

amenities and bicycling.  Some of us haven't really had the 

greatest experience with people riding their bicycles over 

the last dozen years or so.  And so, we're a little wary, as 

I am, about the behavior of bicyclists. 

          And what interested me -- and I'm glad that one of 

the -- Lou asked some questions about location of the bike 

station -- with sort of prompted some additional thinking on 

my part about some of this… 

          In that location, I imagine bicyclists just 

traversing the plaza to get to that spot to park their 

bicycles.   

          And my question is, is that the optimal location 

if you -- you know, because you said you've thought about 

it, and I would -- I gather you may well have -- is that the 

optimal location for it, in terms of avoiding the conflict 

of people walking and enjoying being in the plaza, and 

having people on their bicycles cutting through them as

they're walking at one diagonal pathway in particular, and 

is there maybe a better location for the temporary storage, 

if there's going to be one? 

          And the second observation I have is -- getting 

back to what Lou said about the West -- the bus and bike 

raised the cycle track conflict.   

          One of the problems -- it's not exactly a floating 

bus stop, but it has some of the same characteristics -- it 

is not a wonderful thing to be crossing a bike track or a 

cycle track to get to a bus stop.  As I'm getting older, 

it's even less appetizing with people racing along on their 

bicycles. 

          So not just a crosswalk, but there are other 

notions of what could be done to help make that safer for 

pediatricians to cross the cycle track to get to where they 

could board the buses. 

thank you.    

          Like, maybe a little signal, for example.  So 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right, thank you.  

Okay.  Is there any other public comment this evening on 

this matter?  All right.  Seeing none, do I have a motion to 

close public comment on this item?

questions about the Design Updates we've seen on this matter 

tonight?  Let me see.  And you can use your "Raise hand" 

button or just start talking giving your name. 

          All right.  If there's no further discussion, are 

we prepared to conclude the Design Update, and do Board 

members have any specific additional matters to be addressed 

by staff through continuing Design Review? 

          Okay.  Hearing none, is there a motion that we

members, we have one more item on the agenda, which is a BZA 

case.  Do Board members want a brief recess before we move

                  Nikolas Bowie    

          Then our next item on the agenda is a BZA case 

that we heard July 9, 2020.  The Board has requested to 

review one case -- a proposal at 1618 Forest Street, and 

we'll have CDD Staff begin by summarizing the case.  I think 

Liza is on tap for that.   

          LIZA PADEN:  Yes, thank you.  This is Liza Paden 

of the Community Development staff.  So one of the Board 

members asked to see this case, and/or review it at his 

meeting, and in particular this is an application to the 

Board of Zoning Appeal.

located to the west, it would be located in the Basement 

Overlay District, and would be a Planning Board special 

permit.  So I'd like with that to turn it over to the 

applicant, who is also here online to discuss their 

proposal.   

          NICK ZOZULA:  I don't know, can you hear me, Madam 

Chair?  Thank you, Ma'am.  Attorney Nick Zozula, McDermott 

Quilty & Miller.  Sorry, my Internet's not great, so I don't 

have video, just the audio.  So I apologize for that. 

          But with me today from Akelius is Kayla Tierney 

Pepdjonovic who's the head of Boston Central for Akelius, 

who's the property owner and developer, as well as Marc 

Winn, who's on the line too, I believe, who's the 

construction manager for Akelius.   

          Finally, with me as well is Rich Rankin, CI 

Design, who is the architect on the project.  And, as Liza 

just mentioned, these are actually two projects -- sister 

projects -- the properties are located on Forest Street just 

south of Porter Square between Mass Ave and Beacon Street.  

          And [it] actually consists of two buildings across 

the street from each other, which were both built in the 

early 1900. Each were four stories, and contained a total

combined between the two of 123 units. 

          Akelius acquired the property in early 2017, and 

in the last few years they’ve begun a process of kind of 

complete interior renovations of units as they become vacant 

actually through the leasing process, and once they acquired 

the property, they realized that neither one of these 

buildings provides any accessible units, because of -- you 

know, when they were built in the early 1900s, that wasn't 

top of mind.  It wasn't a prevalent building issue. 

          And so, they also realized once they took 

ownership of the property that their exists a large, 

underutilized basement space in both buildings, and that are 

frankly no longer needed anymore, due to -- you know, 

current utilization of, you know, boilers and AC units, 

condensers and things that, you know, back in those days 

were located in the basement and now -- you know, just don't 

take up as much space and are no longer needed of that size.   

          So what they're proposing to do is to recapture 

and repurpose this space into additional dwelling units, 

while also making -- a majority of those units -- or 

actually all of those units, one of the buildings provide 

accessible units, in excess of what would be required to the

overall building if it were built today. 

          And so, to that point, what they're proposing -- 

and I apologize we don't have a formal presentation, but 

this will take another minute or so only -- is that at 16 to 

18 Forest Street, what they are proposing to do is add seven 

new, accessible Group 2A units in the basement, and renovate 

one of the additional -- one unit that's existing in the 

basement, and make it accessible in the lower level of that 

building.  That would increase the unit count in 16-18 

Forest from 57 units to 64 units in total. 

          In that unit mix, in the basement, which we know 

is important here, in the Basement Overlay District, is four 

studio units; 2 one-bed units and 2 two-bed units.  And 

those would all be new, Group 2A accessible units.   

          On the other side of the street at 17-19 Forest 

Street, which doesn't seem like it's on the agenda tonight, 

but it is a sister building, and it is a project going 

before the Zoning Board of Appeals on July 9 -- that we are 

proposing to add eight, new standard units and two renovated 

standard units.  So those would not be accessible units in 

the opposite building, but it would be 10 total renovated, 

new units in the basement, 17-19 Forest Street.

22

          And that would increase the unit count in that 

building of a net from 66 units to 74 units. 

          All of those are one-bedroom units.  So for this 

project there would be no expansion to the existing building 

space, except to provide accessible access to those new, 

accessible units at 16-18 Forest. 

          So it would be -- or Akelius would be -- the 

proposal is to increase the unit count from a total of 123 

rental units to 138, across both buildings. 

          And again, eight of those would be new, accessible 

units, categorized as Group 2A units that would be 

accessible via two entry vestibules, each which could 

contain limited access, limited use of lifts and stairs, 

which we would submit will greatly enhance accessibility at 

this long existing and frankly aging property that is 

currently without any accessible units -- due, again, to the 

building configuration and prevalent building standards at 

the time over 100 years ago. 

          I would like also to note one other thing: That 

the existing basement ceiling height in these units is 7'6", 

so there is clearance, although it is a little short down 

there.  Rich can expand on this a little further, but there 

76

is sufficient building height based on our review to allow 

for these units.   

          And to the point of the accessibility, we have 

worked with the Massachusetts Architectural Access Board 

last year, to approve these basement units.  And we did 

obtain a few applicable AAV variances for this project, 

which I'm happy to walk through with Rich, if there are any 

questions on that once we conclude. 

          And finally, before -- Rich may want to add 

something, or Kayla or Mark on our team, but in talking with 

Liza and Jeff, we understand that, you know, if this was the 

next zone over, that this would be considered part of the 

Basement Housing Overlay District, which our understanding 

is why we've been asked to discuss tonight before our BZA 

hearing. 

          And, you know, we reviewed those -- the 

applicability and the standards of 20.6, and we would 

suggest and submit to the Board tonight that the project is 

entirely consistent with the spirit, intent and scope of 

this district, because 18 -- out of these 18 new renovated 

basement units, 16 of them -- a majority of them -- a large 

majority --are studios and one beds, which is in line with

what the Basement Housing Overlay District looks for, to 

have all studios and one-beds. 

          And to note that the two beds that we're proposing 

in the basement of 16-18 Forest happen to be accessible 

units, new accessible units, which will provide some larger 

units, and a greater availability for two beds in the 

basement, which otherwise wouldn't be available in the 

building. 

          With that, I don't know, Rich -- or Rich from CI 

Design would like to add any more.   I know this is a lot of 

talking about individuals, so I apologize.  But Rich, if 

you'd like to add anything, feel free to chime in.  

Otherwise, I've said my piece of this. 

          RICH RANKIN:  Yeah, thank you, Nick.  Richard 

Rankin, CI Design.  I think Nick did a good job of giving an 

overview of the project.   

          And again, we're prepared for our presentations 

tonight, although I think the Board has access to some of 

the materials that we submitted for our BZA hearing. 

          We'd be happy to answer any questions that the 

Board may have regarding the project, I guess, at this 

point.   

78

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Then let me turn it over to the Board members.  Are there 

questions for the applicant or for staff at this time about 

the project?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Hugh, go ahead.         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  A question for staff.  These are 

buildings that are very similar to others that we've given 

permits for; why aren't they in the Basement Overlay 

District?  Does the staff remember why?    

          LIZA PADEN:  Well, the -- when the zoning was 

drafted, it was drafted to include the District of Business 

A2, which is the North Mass Ave Overlay District.   

          And it was then amended to include any portion of 

another residential district, that if you had a building 

that was in the Business A2 and then the abutting Residence 

B District, then you could use this Overlay District for 

that.   

          But this building is entirely in the Residence B, 

and I believe that they felt that the Residence B being a 

one and two-family district was the predominant character, 

and so, not some of the large, multifamilies on Mass Ave.

questions from Board members?  Okay.  Hearing none, we can 

go to public comment.  Any members of the public who wish to 

speak on this matter should now click the button that says, 

"Raise hand." If you're calling in by phone, you can raise 

your hand by pressing *9. 

          [Pause]  

          Okay.  I'll now ask staff to unmute the speakers 

one at a time.  You should begin by saying your name and 

address.  Staff will confirm, then, that we can hear you, 

and after that you'll have up to three minutes to speak 

before I ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, the first name is James 

Williamson.  Can you give your name and address, please?   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Yeah, James Williamson, 1000 

Jackson Place.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  I wasn't planning on sticking 

around this long, but I thought -- well, see what it is, I'm 

not clear about something, maybe others are -- is this in or 

outside the district that was arranged as a result of

lobbying by Chestnut Hill Realty to allow basement 

apartments.   

          And so, if it's not in the district, why would it 

be eligible for what's prescribed or allowed in the district 

would be a first information question. 

          But all the usual questions come up, which are the 

Engineering Department weighed in, back when that was being 

considered on flooding issues.  Everybody now is very 

concerned about climate change.   

          Basement units really aren't the greatest idea, 

probably, if we're going to have flood conditions in major 

portions of Cambridge, which MIT are studying together with 

city staff, because it's considered urgent enough to warrant 

that.   

          So that's one obvious concern.  The other is if 

this is about parking, everybody wants to get rid of 

parking, but nobody wants to give up their car.  So of 

course, you know, I don't know -- a dozen additional units 

on a small residential street is going to create more 

pressure and competition among neighbors for the parking 

that everybody thinks we shouldn't have, but fights tooth 

and nail to retain.

          So I -- you know, there's the obvious questions 

about this request.  But I'm sure you'll have your own 

considerations.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  And Jeff, 

just to clarify the point that was made earlier, this is 

outside the district to get a special permit for basement 

units, but -- which is why they're seeking a variance from 

the BZA, is that correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, this 

is Jeff Roberts.  Liza's explanation was correct.  So it 

doesn't apply in the Residence B Zoning District.  It is -- 

I believe it may be in the boundaries of the Basement 

Housing Overlay District, but the provisions of that 

district only apply to a structure that is located only or 

partially within a Residence C, C1, C1A, C2A, C2, C2A (sic), 

C2B, C3, C3A or C3B base zoning districts.   

          So all the Residence C family of districts, but 

not the Residence B.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  Is 

there anyone else from the public who wishes to comment on 

this now?  All right.  Seeing none, is there a motion to 

close public comment for this item?

          [ALL VOTE YES] 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Is there 

additional discussion of this item by Board members, and any 

opinions on whether or not we wish to transmit a report to 

the BZA on the item?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Catherine?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, we have had so much 

discussion about basement apartments in the past, and now 

there is the Overlay obviously of basement apartments and 

climate change.   

          However, it seems to me this is an ideal situation 

for basement apartments, assuming there is not a flooding 

issue, and having looked at the site again today, I think 

we're in an area of Cambridge where flooding is -- even in 

the worst case is very unlikely. 

          But I would -- so I would be, you know, supportive 

of the concept of basement apartments in this location, 

especially the increase of accessible units.  But I would 

assume that engineering would provide something to the BZA, 

and that also Traffic and Parking would add something with 

regard to the parking issues.

          I gather the units currently have virtually no 

parking except for a small lot in the area.  For some of the 

units, it is certainly conveniently located to all sorts of 

public transportation, which we hope after we get out of 

COVID-19, people will be riding subways and buses again. 

          So personally, you know, with a couple of caveats 

about getting additional information for the BZA, you know, 

personal I think this is a fine location for the basement 

apartments, even though it is outside explicitly the Overlay 

District.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other comments 

from Board members?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Hugh, why 

don't you start?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  So this is in a neighborhood 

that was Zone C2 up until 1980, 1870 something.  Then it was 

downzoned to C1 until 1984, and then it was downzoned to B 

in 1984.   

          So the actual intent behind that rezoning was to 

prevent infill development on the few sites remaining where 

it could be done.  In fact, the present zoning is way under 

85

the actual buildout.  No doubt the neighborhood will come 

and talk to the Zoning Board about what the logic of the 

zoning is. 

          But I would tend to agree with Ted that this is an 

appropriate project, and it's only kind of a curious zoning 

history on this small area, a few blocks.  That means it 

wasn't able to be included, because of the Residence B 

Zoning, and that I would favorably recommend this to the 

Zoning. 

            

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, thank you Catherine.  I agree 

with my colleagues.  To me, it seems to make a great deal of 

sense, and I do like the fact that it is in a good location, 

vis-à-vis public transit.  I do think that there is a chance 

that some folks who might occupy these units would have some 

sort of transportation of their own, whether it be a van or 

a car or whatever. 

          And I think that is probably going to be one of 

the major objections from the neighbors -- would be the 

parking situation.   

          So I do think it would be really important for

Traffic and Parking to weigh in on it as well, and -- you 

know, for the proponent to think about are there, you know, 

alternatives that they could propose for providing some 

level of parking. 

          And, you know, I don't think it has to be a lot, 

but -- you know, just some that would help to perhaps 

alleviate the neighbors' concerns.  That's it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Anyone else 

from the Board want to comment on this?  All right.   

          So what I'm hearing is that there is a sense that 

the Board would like to forward a favorable recommendation 

for the relief, but also advise the input from DPW's 

Engineering Department on flooding and Traffic and Parking 

on parking solutions would be important to consider as well?  

          If that's the case, I would hear a motion to 

forward such a favorable recommendation.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So moved, Louis Bacci.  

Thank you, Lou.  Is there a second?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh Russell has
