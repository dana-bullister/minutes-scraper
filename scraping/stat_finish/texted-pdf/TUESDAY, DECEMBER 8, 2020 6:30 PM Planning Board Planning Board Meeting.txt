CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good evening, and 

welcome to the December 8, 2020, meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board.  My name is Catherine Preston Connolly and I 

am the Chair.   

This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open Meeting 

Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary emergency 

restrictions on city public meetings, city events, and city 

permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended last on October 

26, 2020.  

This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online

proceedings. 

All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their name before speaking.  All votes will 

be taken by roll call.   

Members of the public will be kept on mute until it 

is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

I will start by asking Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible.

Director of Zoning and Development.  I'm just going to check 

all the Board members.

on the agenda is an Update from the Community Development 

Department.  Please also introduce any Staff present at the 

meeting.

IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Chair Connolly.  I'll 

start with staff introductions: Jeff Roberts, our Director of 

Zoning and Development was just doing the roll call.  We are 

joined with pretty much the entire Zoning and Development

team so Swaathi Joseph, Liza Paden, Daniel Messplay, and 

Sarah Scott.   

And from our Community Planning Division at CDD, we 

have Drew Cain (phonetic), who has been working on the 

Envision Cambridge process; and Erik Thorkildsen, our Urban 

Designer; and then we are joined by our colleagues from the 

Traffic, Parking and Transportation Division -- the Director 

Joe Barr and Planner Adam Shulman. 

In terms of items coming up, on the Planning 

Board's agenda, tonight's meeting includes two public 

hearings; the first is a special permit for a residential 

development at 600 Mass Ave, and then a zoning petition in 

the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest.  It's an Overlay change. 

And this is a reconfiguration and refiling of a 

petition -- new version of a petition that the Planning Board 

has heard before.  So I won't saw a whole lot more about 

that. 

Our next meeting will be December 15, when the 

Board will have a continued special permit hearing for 727 

Mass Ave, and a special permit amendment for 2 James Way.   

And the following meeting will be December 22, and 

that will include a special permit -- PUD special permit

continued hearing for the Cambridgeside changes, as well as 

an amendment to the existing PUD special permit. 

          And we hope that we can cancel the December 29 

meeting of the Planning Board.  We are holding that as a 

tentative, but I expect to cancel that.  So that will take us 

to the end of the year. 

          In the items of interest at the City Council 

tomorrow the Council's Neighborhood Long-term Planning 

Committee will hold a hearing on the Jerry's Pond area, 

including the relatively new owners of the site IQHQ and the 

neighborhood stakeholders to get an understanding of what 

IQHQ are planning, as well as the desires and vision of the 

neighborhood. 

          Tomorrow as well at the Ordinance Committee, there 

will be a hearing on the Cannabis Delivery Ordinance that the 

Planning Board heard just a couple weeks ago. 

          And then on December 16, the Ordinance Committee 

will hold their hearing on the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest 

Overlay District Zoning Petition that the Board is hearing 

tonight. 

          And on December 17, the following day, they will 

have a hearing on retail use and home occupation zoning, 

9

which the Board heard last week.  So that's it for my update.  

Thank you very much.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Are there 

any questions from Board members?

No?  Okay.

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Then the next item is 

approval of meeting minutes.  The Board has received a 

certified transcript for the meeting held on November 10, 

2020.  Are there any questions or comments from Board members 

on that transcript?  If so, please say your name?    

[Pause]   

No? 

Okay.  Is there a motion to accept the transcripts 

as the meeting minutes?

Then we will move on to the next item on the 

agenda, which is a public hearing on Case PB #369, a special 

permit application by Cifrino Mass Ave Realty, LLC to 

construct a residential addition of 46 units to the existing 

commercial building at 600 Massachusetts Avenue, pursuant to 

Section 19.20, Project Review Special Permit, Section 20.300 

Central Square Overlay District and Article 2 definition of 

Gross Floor Area. 

why this is before us.     

As usual, we will begin with CDD Staff summarizing 

SARAH SCOTT:  Thank you, Chair Connolly.  This is 

Sarah Scott.  I am an Associate Zoning Planner with CDD.  So 

as you mentioned, the applicant proposes to demolish a

portion of the existing building a 600 Massachusetts Avenue 

in order to construct a new building containing 46 

residential dwelling units and ground story commercial 

spaces. 

The project will add 35,348 square feet to the site 

for a total of 93,263 square feet. 

The site, as you mentioned, is in the Central 

Square Overlay District, which was most recently amended in 

2017, with provisions intended to encourage additional 

residential development with supporting ground-floor retail. 

The applicant is seeking several distinct special 

permits, which are listed in the CDD memo, along with all 

applicable criteria.  Many of these special permits are 

contained in the zoning for Central Square, and generally 

allow increased development potential on the lot after 

Planning Board Review. 

In the case of this proposal, the applicant seeks 

various types of dimensional relief, as well as a special 

permit for building height. To grant these special permits, 

the Board needs to make a finding that the development meets 

the planning goals for Central Square. 

Additionally, this proposal just exceeds the 

13

threshold for a Project Review special permit requiring Urban 

Design review and Transportation Impact review.   

Lastly, the applicant seeks a special permit to 

exclude basement space from the definition of, "gross floor 

area." 

space. 

begin.

I will finish by noting that the Central Square 

Advisory Committee reviewed the proposal at their meeting on 

December 3 and sent a report.  All members of the Committee 

are in support of the project, though they expressed some 

concern about the viability of the Green Street commercial 

And that's it for me.  Staff are available to 

answer questions at the appropriate time.  Thank you.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Sarah.  All 

right the presenter on behalf of the applicant is Kevin 

Crane.  You have up to 30 minutes for your presentation, 

though the Board may allow additional time at our discretion. 

Please introduce yourself and the project team and 

KEVIN CRANE:  Good evening.  Am I being heard?    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, you are.

KEVIN CRANE:  Okay, thank you very much.  Madam

Chair and members of the Planning Board, my name is Kevin 

Crane.  I'm the attorney for the applicant in this particular 

instance.  My office is located at 104 Mount Auburn Street in 

Cambridge.   

          Our designated panelists include Peter Quinn, who 

is the architect for the project.  There's an associate from 

his office by the name of Estalin Cambiasaca -- he's also a 

designated panelist.   

          We also have on board in case there are any 

questions on their particular expertise areas:  We have 

Chelsea Bouchard from VHB, who is the Traffic Consultant for 

the job; and we also have Stephen Sawyer, who is the Civil 

Engineer associated with the redevelopment.   

          Mr. Thomas Cifrino, who is the representative of 

the Cifrino family and the manager of the real estate, and 

also actually the operator of the Supreme Liquors, which is 

on the site, was also a designated panelist.  But I learned 

today that he had to have emergency eye surgery tonight, so 

he will not be on both.   

          As far as ownership of the building, the Cifrino 

family has owned the property for three generations.  They've 

operated various retail businesses on the site over the

years, including the iconic Manhattan Market, which is a 

historical note. 

As far as the description of the property, 

preliminary on Mass Ave there is the Supreme Liquors, which -

- again -- Mr. Cifrino operates.  Chipotle is next to his

Supreme Liquors, and Supreme Liquors is a tenant of the LLC 

that owns the real estate. 

Next to Chipotle is the vacant Sleepy Mattress 

site, and then on the Green Street side it should be noted 

that there is a four-story brick structure, which has been 

vacant for at least 10 years -- maybe closer to 15.  And that 

is being redone presently, subject to an as-of-right building 

permit.  

This is the so-called Bakery Tower.  Evidently when 

the market was being operated, it was a bakery.  And that is 

being presently renovated into an office space.  It's four 

stories; you can't really see it from Mass Avenue, it's much 

more presentable from Green Street. 

The other tenant in the building presently is the 

Tae Kwon Do operation, which is a significant community 

asset; heavily used by the community, and my client has gone 

overboard to make accommodations to keep the Tae Kwon Do

operation on the site.   

          The plan is that when the construction would start, 

they would be relocated from where they presently are, which 

is on Green Street, behind the vacant Sleepy Mattress spot 

into the renovated Bakery Tower.  And then when the building 

that's before you tonight would be constructed, that they 

would then relocate to the basement of the new building. 

          As noted, we appeared before the Central Square 

Advisory Committee last Thursday, and there was unanimous 

support.  We had also presented to them two years ago when 

the project was first brought up. 

          I'd also just note that we have in the file the 

various community outreach and engagement matters, which 

we've done over the past couple of years.  And if there are 

no other questions for me at the present moment, I would turn 

it over to Peter Quinn for his presentation.  Thank you.     

          PETER QUINN:  Thank you, Kevin.  Good evening, 

everybody.  Good to see all of you again.  Yes, thank you, 

page 2 is great.  The kind of orangish color rectangle in the 

middle is our site, and just to give you a little familiarity 

with where we are here.  Of course, Mass Ave is full of the 

transportation nodes.

To the left of the site is the Barron Building 

immediately and then the Homes Building at the corner, where 

Prospect comes in. 

Behind us and below in this drawing is the 

municipal garage across the street.  And to the left of that 

is the 237 Franklin Senior Tower.  So it's got quite a bit of 

activity, of building volume around it.   

Across the street, of course, are many three and 

four-story buildings as well. 

So the site itself is about 21,000 square feet, and 

if you could see it from Google satellite view, you'd see 

that it actually is an amalgamation of about four or five 

buildings that have been held together for over 100 years for 

the most part.   

And what we're doing is taking -- of these 21,000 

square feet on the site, taking about 10,000 square feet of 

it away, which is primarily a one-story building on the 

right-hand side, this orange polygon.  And that will be the 

site.   

It varies in width -- and you can go to the next 

page, please.  It varies in width quite a bit from about 45 

feet on the Mass Ave side -- this is the new site I'm talking 

about, the part we take out -- and it goes from 45 to 75 

18

          And the overall length is about 190.  So it goes 

right through the block all the way from Mass Ave to Green 

Street, and then is actually part of our design organization 

feet.   

as well. 

          We just are showing here some neighboring 

buildings.  I'm sure you're all familiar with them, including 

the library, which is attached to the back of the municipal 

garage in the middle there. 

          Why don't we go onto the next one, page 4?   

          Okay.  Yeah, so we'll show the massing in a little 

bit, but I wanted to just point out how many different 

building heights there are in the area.  There's quite a bit 

of variety.   

          Not only do we have the one-story to the right of 

our proposed building, which is the brick building in the 

center here -- not to jump ahead of course, but that's our 

building mass there -- we also have the Barron Building which 

is about 10 feet shorter, and then the Holmes Building shows 

itself at about 72 feet.   

          The Franklin Street tower is, you know, well over

100 feet higher than what we're proposing.  So we're right at 

the 70.2 that’s based on that zoning method for calculating 

the height of the building. 

          And across the street on Mass Ave, the buildings 

are in the 40-60-foot range as well. 

          We can go to the next slide, please. Thank you. 

          So we did an Urban Design Study where we really 

looked carefully at a lot of the buildings in the 

neighborhood to see what kind of features they have.  Of 

course, the other thing that we see most of is the very 

strong base on many of the buildings where there's commercial 

activity.   

          Then we have the middle part of the building, of 

course, which is organized around the round windows and 

groupings of windows, and this is our residential level. 

          And then finally at the top, a lot of buildings 

have a cornice, or they have -- you know, a set back addition 

with space.  So we have a top floor, the sixth floor, which 

is set back about 10 feet here.    

          We can go to the next slide.   

          What we've tried to do -- and I'll go into this in 

detail when we get into the actual design of the building is, 

we've tried to set the building up in the same pattern of a 

20

base, a middle and a top. 

          Next slide, please? 

          In the back of the building we have a unique 

situation where you can see in the lower -- in the middle 

right there's a sort of view of what up until recently was 

the present view.   

          The left-hand part of that photograph is the Baker 

Building that Kevin referred to.  That's now been restored, 

and we actually have opened up the base of that to create a 

new entry to the offices that will be in that building.   

          And there will be a lobby right there in the 

street, adding quite a bit of activity and [37:58 

indiscernible glazing].  You can see a little bit of it; if 

you look at our rendition on the left, you'll see the way 

that the side has been opened.  There are four of those big 

windows like that that are just off the edge of the picture. 

          There's also something here on this -- there are 

two things I want to point out on the façade of the existing 

condition (sic) is that there's a really lovely cornice on 

the one-story part of the building.  It's probably the best 

feature of that.

          And we actually have to take this down in order to 

be able to build our project, because the only way you get to 

the site is through Green Street.  But we will recreate it 

and modify it a little bit.  We've been in discussions with 

Historic about that, and they're fine with it, as long as 

they get to see how we put it together. 

          The second thing is that there's this very large 

opening that looks like a garage door with some other things.  

And that's actually driven by this very, very large 

electrical transformer that we have to have in the space.  

It'll be in the basement, as is presently planned.   

          And I'm happy to say that we came to some agreement 

with Eversource in the last week or so where we'll be able to 

reduce the size of this opening considerably. 

          So I assume we'll be back for a second hearing, and 

we'll have all that to present to you then. 

          Could we go onto the next slide, please? 

          So for zoning compliance -- I won't go into this 

too far, because the staff Memo I think summed it up pretty 

well.  But I do want to point out that there is something 

that will come up I'm sure tonight about the parking 

exemption, and specifically whether we are building out the

site to less than 90 percent of the maximum capacity of the 

site that will be allowed. 

          The way the zoning bylaw reads is that we are able 

to be exempt from certain fee for the waiver of the parking 

if we don't build more than 90 percent of what the maximum 

permitted on the lot is.   

          So if you can go on to the next page, please.   

          Yeah, so we did an analysis of what you could build 

on this site.  It's in our zoning areas.  And we came out to 

an FAR that would be about 23,000 square feet larger than 

what we have proposed.  It's as if you could build a whole 

another story over the entire site.   

          And this assumes that the site is clear, which is 

obviously not something that the owner is entertaining, but 

the way the bylaw is written, it seems like this is the kind 

of exercise one must do. 

          And at the same time, the CDD did its own 

calculation and came out to a number even higher.  So we're 

well below the 90 percent threshold for this.  I believe that 

we are eligible for both a parking waiver and the fee that is 

associated with it.   

          Next slide, please?  I'm sorry, the next -- just

skip to the -- yeah, that's it.   

          So now we're going to the building design.  As I 

mentioned, as you can see on the Mass Ave side, which is on 

the left, we have a bit of a narrower façade.  We have a -- 

and on the back side of Green Street, we have a much wider 

façade. 

thank you. 

          If you go to the next slide, I think you would see 

a little clearer.  Got mixed up there. 

          This is our basement.  We can come back to that if 

need be, but go ahead to the next slide, please.  Yeah, so 

          In this case, on the Mass Ave side, we have a 

residential entry, which has a sequence of vestibule and 

lobby.  And just above that on the page is one of our new 

commercial spaces occupying the space more or less that was 

occupied by the mattress retail store that closed there 

recently. 

          And then going through the building on the right- 

hand side, fronting on Green Street, is another commercial 

space of about the same size.  And both of them are in the 

mid 3000 square feet or plus or minus.   

          And parallel with that along the lower part of the

blue area, this is a walk-through building that was of course 

is controlled for access, but it does allow residents and 

even some commercial users to be able to go all the way from 

Mass Ave through to Green Street. 

          Going to Green Street takes you to a forecourt that 

opens up the space between the Bakery building, which is -- 

and Supreme Liquor -- which is on the lower part of the page 

and our new building, which is the blue-toned area.  So this 

is an outdoor space that has a ramp as well as steps to take 

you up to the patio level, and then into the building.   

          Can we go to the next slide, please? Thank you. 

          Yeah, so this is a typical level.  This happens to 

be the second floor.  You can see the Bakery building is the 

hatched area below that's four stories.  Ground floor is 

retail, but the upper three floors are new offices built in 

that old brick building.   

          And then we have a connector, which is also hatched 

-- just a little rectangular area connects the buildings to 

an elevator and to a stairway. 

          And then the blue area is our residential floor, 

and that has a range of units.  We have a very good variety 

of units, all the way from studio to three-bedroom.  Of

course, they're smallish.  These are urban locations, but, 

you know, they have a lot of nice features.  Many of the 

units have access to balconies.   

          This floor doesn't should it because many of the 

units have access to roof decks that are built on top of the 

existing one-story.  You can see in the right-hand side 

there. 

          If you go up to the next slide, this is an upper 

floor, and you can see 1-2-3-4-5 units there have, you know, 

have roof decks of one kind or another.  This is actually the 

top floor of the building. 

          Keep going to the next, please? 

          Now we're getting to the façade design.  So this is 

a little bit of a street context here.  Our building, of 

course, is the -- I guess you'd call it a building just to 

the left of center.  We are taking down a piece of the 

existing façade, which we got approval from, from the 

Historic Commission. 

          To the right, that is a façade that is retained 

where Chipotle is and Supreme Liquor. 

          Beyond that, you can see the brick building.  That 

is the side of the Bakery building facing Mass Ave has a few

windows in it. 

          To the left of our project is a three-story, mixed-

use building.  And our building is -- of course you see the 

45 feet or so that fronts on Mass Ave and then it gets wider 

in the back.  And so, you're seeing a little bit on the left 

there where it gets wider.  That's quite a ways back. 

          It's also the small connector between the brick 

building and our new building, and that's the stairway and 

landing area that allows a transfer of egress and so forth 

into the new building.   

          Next slide, please? 

          So we see here some of the components of this Mass 

Ave.  You know, we have -- actually there's probably a better 

slide if you can just go to the next one, if you wouldn't 

mind.  We'll come back to that façade discussion in a minute.  

I'm sorry to jump around.  We're going to go around the 

building counterclockwise.   

          This is the building -- I'm sorry, clockwise -- 

this is the side facing the three-story building to the front 

left.  And so, you can see what we're doing here where we 

have -- we set the building back a little bit where the 

windows are, so we can have windows on that side.

21

22

          And there are cutouts for balconies and we have a 

window pattern which is a temporary window.  The siding that 

we're using is -- it looks like clapboard, but it's actually 

a metal siding that is -- has a fairly wide exposure to the -

- it's approximately eight to nine inches. 

          And then at the top level we have a metal panel 

system as well.  So it's all clad in metal -- very durable 

and prepainted.   

          If we can go on to the next slide, please? 

          Yeah, so here you're seeing the back side with the 

restored Bakery building on the left-hand side, and its new 

openings, including the opening that leads you into the 

lobby. 

          And then between our new building and the Bakery 

building is the forecourt that I mentioned, and beyond that 

you see the stair tower and landing area. 

          And then to the right are our new building, with a 

rebuilt façade of the cornice -- I'm sorry, cornice building 

and new openings placed in that.   

          And again, at this level, you're looking into 

commercial space on the ground-floor, as well as this 

Eversource access door that we'll be able to present in a

reduced version the next time we meet.   

          Just beyond that and above it is our new building. 

And this is the same sort of materials that we showed just a 

second ago.  You've got siding, the windows truly have 

balconies in this case.  And then at the top level, a major 

setback, which creates roof decks approximately eight feet. 

          Can we go onto the next one, please?   

          This is a little bit of a blowup.  You'll see a 

little more detail.  And so, we -- you know, we have this 

kind of strong brick face with setback; the new building 

about two feet behind that brick wall, so that brick wall 

still has its linear presence.  We also have -- that you see 

on the street line.   

          And then we've also taken that new cornice, the 

rebuilt cornice, and wrapped it into the courtyard as well.  

You'll see that in the 3D in a second. 

          Can we go on, please?   

          Yeah, so this is -- this is the façade that you 

would see on Mass Ave that connects -- the left-hand side 

which is Mass Ave and Green Street side on the right.   

          This is showing -- you know, kind of a very, all 

the residential units are expressed here.  And you have

windows, you have Juliet balconies, you have bedroom windows, 

you have generous balconies for residential use.  These are 

cut out, and finished with some nice materials. 

          And then the back side of the building on Green 

Street, we changed the materials slightly, but it's still the 

same windmill pattern.  And we have some of the same 

elements.  But they're completely separated by this patina 

green connector that joins the Bakery building to the new 

building. 

          You can see how the cornice wraps around the front, 

and how the front is stepped back slightly on Green Street 

from that cornice façade.  And then we do the same thing as 

it wraps around and comes in to that courtyard, kind of 

creating a full residential commercial base to that building. 

          And we're hoping that with this courtyard -- or 

forecourt as I've been calling it -- we can create an 

opportunity to really get some interesting activity at street 

level on Green Street so it's not just a utilitarian service 

area.   

          We will have a major commercial tenant there at 

some point, as well as this door that you see in the lower 

right-hand corner.  That's actually Tae Kwon Do's new entry 

30

that will go immediately down to the basement, where they'll 

have a -- you know, a very generous floor plan with a high 

ceiling. 

          If we can go on to the next; building materials.  

Next slide, please?  Yeah. 

          So the materials that we're using are all very 

durable; as I mentioned, the metal siding that we tend to use 

a lot of…  Stone and stone veneers.  Windows will be clad and 

highly energy efficient.  This is a LEED goal building, so we 

will be fairly rigorous about it. 

          If you can go to the next slide, please?  Thank 

you. 

          And this is the back side of Green Street -- 

similar kind of materials, just different colors.  And of 

course the rebuilt brick wall will be a historic type brick 

that we'll use as well. 

          Next slide, please?   

          [Street views.]    

          Thank you, next.   

          Yeah.  So this -- these are, you know, photo 

montages where we've taken our new building inserted into 

photos.  You can see this is our view from across the street,

approximately where an H Mart entry is.   

          And the building lines are -- you know, there's 

some alignment that we've been able to do with those other 

windows and, you know, sometimes you just can't do that 

because the scales are different.   

          But there is a kind of general use of the 

vocabulary of generous windows and a spandrel panel, which 

you see for instance on the Barron Building to the right, and 

a kind of framing of those windows. 

          And then as you go up farther, a stringcourse that 

defines an edge separating the secondary thing -- the upper 

part of the façade, and then the cornice line at the very 

top, before you have the step back.   

          Can we go onto the next slide?   

          This is the view that I was trying to mention 

before, where we have a very strong façade, and then it 

changes as you turn the corner and becomes kind of an 

expression of the building inside.   

          If you go back one slide, you can see how this is 

actually a really common phenomenon in a lot of these older 

buildings.  The Barron Building, for instance, has this very 

strong clay tile -- glazed clay tile façade, which I had the

pleasure of working on about 20 years ago and restoring it.  

          And the side -- I was always fascinated by how the 

side of the building just completely changes.  It's almost 

like it's not meant to be seen.  And, you know, perhaps there 

should have building there at some point.  But in our -- if 

you go back, go -- continue on, please -- yeah.   

          So what we've done is a similar idea.  It's clearly 

defined at the side line, and then move on as the building 

goes back with a sequence of -- you know, the actual building 

use. 

          We can go on to the next, please?   

          This is a blowup of the façade detail at the base, 

where we have a fully glazed base and to the right at 

residential entry marked by the canopy here at 600.  And at 

the left part of that, there's also the entry into the 

retail.  So this canopy shares both a residential and retail 

          We have -- of course this is a very high ceiling 

space; part of the zoning bylaw that requests I think at 

least 15 feet. And there's also -- you can see the windows 

coming down above with their framed stone cladding around the 

entry.

          I just want to say that, you know, the Staff report 

did have a lot of comments about this façade and what could 

be done to improve it and to continue working with the Staff.  

The Staff -- CCD (sic) has just been great to work with, and 

we -- you know, we certainly look forward to kind of refining 

this façade and getting, you know, the proper detail, should 

the Board approve this project.  And I know this will be an 

area we'd probably start with immediately, you know, to kind 

of define this a little bit. 

          Can we go on to the next?  Next?   

          This is a 3D model from Green Street standing back 

probably just about where the courtyard for the senior 

building is.  Looking across, you see the Bakery building 

and, you know, the new entries that we put in there.  There's 

actually, some of those openings were there.  They were 

bricked up on the left-hand side, so we never really used 

them.   

          On the right-hand side, again, are rebuilt cornice 

and one-story structure turning into the forecourt, and then 

marking now the address.  And you're seeing -- if you look 

way up that stair tower and elevator penthouse that was done 

in the patina.

          Next slide, please?   

          This view takes you from the other direction -- 

perhaps from the second story of the parking garage or 

something like that approximately.  Again, you can see all 

the same components there.   

          And we're able to successfully I think make some 

interesting window alignments with these two very different 

buildings.  But they did have a lot in common in terms of -- 

you know, the scale of the buildings, so you can see that 

across there. 

          So that ends our presentation.  I'm happy to take 

any questions, go back over any slides or go into the actual 

drawings that we filed.  Thank you.  Thanks very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  We will 

actually go to public comment first, and then save Board 

member questions and discussion for after we hear public 

comment.  So we will now move to that. 

          And this is a public hearing.  Any members of the 

public who wish to speak should now click the icon at the 

bottom of your Zoom screen that says, "Raise hand."  Or if 

you're calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by 

pressing *9.

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had not 

received any written comments from the public on this case 

from Patrick W. Barrett and Kenneth S. Barron in addition to 

the report from the Central Square Advisory Committee.  

Additional written communications received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will be entered into the record. 

          I'll now ask Staff to unmute the speakers one at a 

time.  You should begin by saying your name and address, and 

staff will then confirm we can hear you.  And after that, you 

will have up to three minutes to speak before I ask you to 

wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I can get started -- this is Jeff 

Roberts again from Community Development.  The hand that I 

see raised at this point is a Carol O'Hare.  So you can 

unmute yourself.  Please begin with your name and address.  

          CAROLE O'HARE: [58:49 audio unclear]  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  There appears to be 

something wrong with your audio.  It's -- we can't hear you.    

Why don't you try one more time?     

          [Pause]   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We're not hearing you, Carole.  If 

you can hear me, we have a suggestion, which is that if you

look at your e-mail from the meeting -- if you look at your 

e-mail registration from the meeting, there may be a phone 

number that you can call into, and you may want to disconnect 

from your computer on Zoom and call in by phone, and then you 

can press *9 to raise your hand.     

          [Pause]  

          I think I'm going to -- unfortunately I'm going to 

have to stop Carol O'Hare's audio.  But again, if you can 

hear this, Carol O'Hare, you can look to your registration e-

mail to find the phone number to call, and then press *9 to 

raise your hand.  That was the only hand that was raised.   

     So we can give a minute to see if Carol can reconnect.  

But in the meantime, if there's anyone in attendance who 

would like to speak, please push the "Raise hand" button or 

press *9 if you're connected by phone.   

          [Pause]  

          I don't see anyone.  It might be if the Chair 

wishes to do this, the Board could ask some questions, and 

then we could go back to public comment, to see if that 

speaker is able to reconnect?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, I might give her 

a few more seconds, Jeff, to reconnect.  But then I agree we

can start our discussion with questions, and then if she is 

able to reconnect give her an opportunity to speak at that 

time.  Give her, like, you know, 15 more seconds or something 

just to facilitate that best we can.   

          PETER QUINN:  Excuse me, Madam --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          PETER QUINN:  -- Chair.  I didn't get my address to 

-- at the introduction, so I think you need it for the 

record, it's --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          PETER QUINN:  -- if I may --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.     

          PETER QUINN:  -- 259 Elm Street, Somerville Mass.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All right.  

Why don't we go to Board questions for the applicant, and 

Jeff if you can keep an eye on whether or not Ms. O'Hare area 

is able to reconnect and let us know, I'll check back in with 

you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I will certainly do so.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Awesome.  All right.  

Do Board members have questions for the applicant?

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Hi.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Before you start, I did notice 

someone just connected.  So we could jump back over.  So if 

this -- I see somebody connected by telephone.  If this is 

the speaker who wished to speak before, you can press *9 on 

your phone, and it will pop your hand up.     

          [Pause]  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Once again, if you're connected by 

phone and you're wanting to speak on this hearing -- there we 

go -- okay.  So I will now allow that speaker to talk.  You 

can unmute yourself by pressing *6 and give your name and 

address.    

          CAROL O'HARE:  My name is Carol O'Hare, 172 

Magazine Street.  Can you hear me??   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, Carol, thank you.  We're glad 

we finally got you.      

          CAROL O'HARE:  Wow.  I've never spoken at a Zoom 

meeting before, except to look at this building.  It was nice 

to see all of you guys after all this COVID housebound stuff.  

And I am pleased to be recognized.

          So I saw the first rendition of this building some 

months ago when it was presented at open houses for the 

community.  And I have to say that it is such an improved 

presence that I give the architect and CDD kudos for how much 

better it looks now.  I'm glad the yellow stripes and the 

kind of cutesy stuff that was happening on Mass Avenue has 

          I do think that the façade that faces east with all 

that in and out and -- I think there's too much going on over 

there, even though it's nice that it's lively.  It just seems 

disappeared.   

so jumpy.   

          And, you know, it's -- I understand the building 

across the way has some windows -- a few windows in it that 

are in that blank brick wall, and that that is totally 

distinct from the façade, but this one is a little over the 

top in that regard, I think. 

          However, it is such an improvement and that's it.  

That is my comment.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you for your comment.  I will 

turn it back over to the Chair at this point.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  I want to 

also say thank you for persisting.  Our technology is

imperfect sometimes, and we really appreciate the folks who 

are going to the extra effort to be heard at these meetings.  

          Niko, let me turn back to you.  We just started to 

get questions for the applicant.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Hi.  I've personally always 

thought that the buildings in Central Square are all too 

short.  Like, it's along a major artery, it's right by the T.  

It seems like there should be skyscrapers there.  So why is 

this building only four stories or five stories?     

          PETER QUINN:  It's actually six -- this is Peter 

Quinn speaking.  It's six stories.  It's important for us to 

keep the building under 70 feet.   I know we have an 

application in that says slightly over, but that's a zoning 

calculation, which goes to the top of the roofing. 

          From our building code, this is just short of 70 

feet.  And 70 feet is the magic number at which once crossed 

you have a high-rise building, and there's so many more bells 

and whistles that it would, you know, really kill the project 

in terms of costs. 

          However, you know, you are allowed to go 80 feet.  

So essentially, that would be, you know, almost another 

story.  So it's really -- it's also then an issue of how we 

41

build the building.   

          So in this case, we'll have a double podium, and 

then -- which is made out of steel and concrete.  And then 

we'll have four stories of wood frame on top of that -- fire 

rated, but nonetheless there is a limit to height. 

          So that's -- it's basically a cost benefit, and 

trying to save, you know, a reasonable frame to build, put 

this building up affordably.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Thank you.  So my second question 

is, do you own the, or have an easement to the air rights 

above the Chipotle building?  Or what happens if the Chipotle 

building decides to build higher?     

          PETER QUINN:  I can answer that again -- Peter 

Quinn.  So that's all part of the same lot.  The owner could 

build over that.  These are -- you're talking about long-term 

leases that would be extremely expensive to break.  But, you 

know, in general that is available. 

          However, you know, we took the part of the building 

that is actually -- other than Tae Kwon Do -- not used at 

all, and developed our building there.  It's not to say that 

something wouldn't happen in the future -- perhaps way in the 

future.

          The zoning, you know, in theory would allow some 

building there, as I mentioned.  We're not built out to the 

          So, you know, it's just something that we try to 

take the best shot at what was available in terms of 

maximum. 

footprint.   

          There's also a natural breaking point, which as I 

mentioned, the building is sort of a composite of I think 

five different buildings.  I went back and researched them 

with the old maps, and it seems to be at least five 

buildings.  Chipotle was one of the last ones built in that 

way.  So there is kind of a logic to it internally. 

          I forgot to mention, Madam Chair, that we do have a 

physical model, which you can see on the screen.  And I'm 

happy to show that around, if that's something?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, please do.   I 

know a lot of Board members really --    

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- presume get a lot 

of benefit from seeing the model.     

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.  And, you know, we did pay a 

lot of money for it, so I'd hate not to show it.  But you can 

43

see our building right there in the center of the screen.  To 

the left of it is a three-story building I mentioned before.   

And there was just a little problem with the model maker.  At 

the last minute, he couldn't get that to work right, but 

there are some crenulations there. 

          So Estalin, my associate, will take us around the 

site.  You can see in the background there the Franklin 

tower, 17 stories, 180 (sic) feet high.  Estalin, why don't 

you give us another long shot, then maybe looking west. 

          ESTALIN CAMBIASCA:  Hello, everybody.  My name is 

Estalin.  I'm with Peter Quinn.  This is a view looking at 

the building.  This will be the façade facing the south -- 

Mass Ave here.  This is going up to Harvard Square and down 

to MIT to the left.     

          PETER QUINN:  If you can see the cursor, it's -- 

you just have to move it very slowly.     

          ESTALIN CAMBIASA:  Oh --        

          PETER QUINN:  So that the --    

          ESTALIN CAMBIASA:  Like this?     

          PETER QUINN:  -- camera can pick it up, yeah.  So - 

-    

          ESTALIN CAMBIASA:  Anyway, there's the T down that

way.  And I'll just take you around the building, just so you 

guys can take a look at just the overall height of the 

building, in accordance to the neighborhood.     

          PETER QUINN:  So the bank building on the right is 

right on the corner.  And then across the street from that 

with the number on it is the Central Square building.  The 

donut-shaped building is the mixed-use residential building.     

          ESTALIN CAMBIASA:  Mm-hm.     

          PETER QUINN:  The parking garage is in the lower 

left too.     

          ESTALIN CAMBIASA:  Mm-hm.     

          PETER QUINN:  That's the back side -- what I refer 

to as the back side.  It's the Green Street side.  And you 

can see opening that up, we're trying to get a lot of windows 

in there and create some activity, which will stabilize some 

of the street light from that area.   

          Interestingly, the tower has a courtyard similar 

to what we're building, you know, about the same size, though 

it's much deeper and it goes through the lot.  But it does 

have a kind of forecourt as well that leads into the 

building.     

          ESTALIN CAMBIASA:  If anybody would like me to show

any specific view, I was being happy to show you it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do Board members have 

any requests for specific views of the model?     

          [Pause] Okay.     

          PETER QUINN:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.         

          KEVIN CRANE:  Am I heard, or I'm mute?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We can hear you.         

          KEVIN CRANE:  Okay.  Just quickly, in further 

answering about the question on the height, there's also an 

issue of the zoning actually allows up to 80 feet by special 

permit from the Planning Board, but if we were going to go 

beyond 80 feet, which people seem to be thinking about, you 

know, a variance procedure would be triggered, unless there 

was some change to the underlying zoning.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  Okay, thank 

you.  Niko, I want to make sure that you had -- you're all 

set.  Okay, good.  Then I will move onto Hugh.  Hugh, did you 

have questions for the applicant?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have four questions.  I guess I'll 

do them one by one.  So I was trying to understand is there 

any fossil fuel used in the residential building, or is it 

46

sort of following the Zero Net energy requirement?  

Suggestions?     

          PETER QUINN:  This is Peter speaking.  It's all 

electric, 100 percent.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  Next question, there's a lift 

shown in the middle of the building, and there are doors at 

the basement level, but there's no doors shown on the lift 

shaft at the first-floor level.  What is the lift for?  Where 

are the doors, and who uses those?  For usual tenants, or for 

some other purpose?     

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.  I didn't really point that 

out.  I apologize.  This is Peter Quinn speaking again.  That 

is a platform lift used primarily for trash.  So we have a 

trash collection in the basement through chutes, and a trash 

room, and it's compacted, put on flats with wheels and put on 

that lift and brought out at the assigned time to the street 

-- Green Street.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Then down the ramp?     

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah, and down the ramp, yep.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Oh Okay.     

          PETER QUINN:  But it's not -- excuse me, it's not 

used for passengers, actually.  You have to press a button

and it goes off up and it's really meant to be a managed kind 

of a situation.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  I'm a little concerned that 

the residential building is not secure, because of the doors 

into it from commercial spaces in the Bakery building.   

          Now, I think your presentation you indicated that 

the first-floor corridor is common area that could be used 

for egress from the commercial spaces, and there's a door 

before you get into the residential elevator, but how do you 

keep people in the building secure from other people?               

          PETER QUINN:  So your question is exactly one that 

I've been working through with the owner over the last couple 

weeks.  So we -- you know, we'll probably make a resubmission 

here of I'll be able to show you how we are taking care of 

that.  So I have addressed that issue a little further than 

what's in these plans, which were submitted some time ago. 

          But, you know, that's an internal plan diagram.  

But, you know, suffice it to say, both you and the owner are 

in agreement on that issue that we need to provide security.  

So we have done that.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, well, that's something that 

the Staff can follow up on.

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And the last question I have is, it 

really doesn't relate to the residential building, but how do 

you get wheelchair access to the Tae Kwon Do space into the 

Bakery building?  There seems to be an existing elevator, but 

it also -- it looks like it's way too small to meet the 

standards?     

          PETER QUINN:  This is Peter Quinn again.  Yeah, so 

there is a lift in the existing building, which we managed to 

get approval from the MAAB and that does have a platform that 

meets the minimum size for a lift.  It would service all four 

of those floors, the lobby and the four floors of the 

offices. 

          If they need to bring in something larger, then 

we'll use the new elevator in the new tower.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, thank you.  Those are my 

questions.     

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have some comments, but I think 

that will be the next round.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          PETER QUINN:  Thank you.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Any further questions 

for the applicant?  How about for Staff?  We received memos 

from CDD, Traffic, Parking and Transportation and from Public 

Works.  Do -- Tom, do you want to start with questions for 

Staff?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, no.  I had questions for the 

applicant.  I was raising my --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, you can do 

applicant too, if that --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- raising my analog hand, and 

then my virtual hand.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Just simple questions?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Applicant is fine, 

yep.  Go ahead.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Other members have addressed many 

of my questions, but about the electric vault in the 

transformer, does that transformer serve more than just this 

property, Mr. Quinn?     

          PETER QUINN:  No, it doesn't.  Although it could.  

But it doesn't, as it's presently wired.  What the building 

has right now is an antique system of old transformers that

definitely need to be replaced.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.     

          PETER QUINN:  But with the new uses and all- 

electric building, of course we're going to be quite power 

hungry.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.     

          PETER QUINN:  So we're, you know, starting off with 

a new vault.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, simply this:  If it served a 

broader community, then I would be more concerned about it 

being inundated by floodwaters, but --    

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- if it's just your building and 

only your building that would go down because of poor 

planning that's a different matter.     

          PETER QUINN:  Well, we did -- we do actually have a 

floodgate behind those doors, so.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.  And then I'm -- on the 

second-floor plan, are there balconies from the units that 

stretch over the roof that contains Chipotle?     

          PETER QUINN:  No.  There's about an eight-foot-wide 

space before you get to the Chipotle building, which is kind 

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.  Right, right.  That -- right.          

51

of a remnant of the existing building.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  But there's roof areas there?     

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Maybe I don't understand the 

section.  There's roof areas there, and I saw --    

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- plants or something on that 

roof?     

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.     

          PETER QUINN:  Or directly outside those units.  So 

it's kind of hidden, the balcony area, and then the 

mechanical equipment that's on Chipotle and --             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Right, and so, that --    

          PETER QUINN:  -- that's stored, that will be 

screened, yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  And the existing parapet on that 

commercial structure is at a sufficient height that we're not 

going to see a railing then poking up on the Mass Ave side of 

the building, right?     

          PETER QUINN:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Above it.

          PETER QUINN:  That's like a western front, where it 

stands up --  

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.     

          PETER QUINN:  -- you know, like seven or eight 

feet.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.  I guess that's it.  There 

was a question about ventilation coming off the restaurant, 

but I'm sure it's something you've thought about.  It was in 

the Staff memo as well.  Do you consider that to be a hazard 

to the enjoyment of the residential units?     

          PETER QUINN:  I think we will have to manipulate 

that machine a little bit, possibly get a modern, filtered 

system.  But I think it can be managed, yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Something you're aware of, okay.     

          PETER QUINN:  Oh yeah, yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  All right, thank you.     

          PETER QUINN:  Thank you.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Those are my questions, Madam 

Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you, 

Tom.  Corinne, do you have questions, either for the 

applicant or for staff?

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes, thank you.  My questions 

are for staff.  I have five questions.  My first question -- 

they're all about procedure, so I'm looking at the Staff -- 

the CDD memo on page 8 of 14 about the special permit request 

to exempt basement GFA.   

          The CDD notes that the -- that we anticipate moving 

the Tae Kwon Do operation to the basement, and that that 

would be consistent with area planning objectives.   

          But are they -- is the applicant required to do 

this, or is this just a gentleperson's agreement that they 

would do it?  I think if we're exempting the basement, I'm 

just wondering what kind of security we have with that?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, I can try to -- this is Jeff 

Roberts, I can try to field that -- so the zoning, I think 

what was reflected in the memo is just what the owner of the 

site has said that they would do. 

          The zoning doesn't really control the tenancy of a 

space, doesn't --            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Right.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- establish who has, who can be in 

there, who has to be in there.  But the zoning for the 

exemption of basement space is fairly broad.  It says that if 

54

it serves the -- so I can -- I'll just look at what the 

criteria says from the -- that the use is occupying such 

exempted GFA to support the character of the neighborhood or 

district, in which the applicable lot is located.   

          So that’s -- in terms of in zoning terms, that 

would mean that the use just generally speaking, if it's 

retail use or if it's a particular type of supporting use for 

other parts of the building, then the Planning Board could 

make that finding, if the Planning Board agreed with it.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  But for example, I do agree that 

the Tae Kwon Do would be an example of community use, but 

could -- is this just a gentleperson's agreement that they 

would do that, or could they for example say, "never mind, 

we're going to make it the office space" and then they’ve 

gotten, like, free basement?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well in -- it's Jeff again -- in 

granting a special permit, because this does require a 

special permit, the Planning Board could put conditions on 

the use of the space in general.  It wouldn't -- I wouldn't 

recommend trying to limit to a specific tenant.   

          I don't know that that would be appropriate, but if 

the Board wanted to stipulate that there would remain a

retail use or supporting retail use, then in order to make 

that finding that would be a type of condition that the Board 

could impose.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.  And then I have a similar 

question just about whether -- so in regards to housing, the 

layouts of the units, the CDD memo notes that the layouts of 

the units seem reasonable, et cetera.   

          But is there any requirement -- it's noted in the 

memo that these are as presented, but there's, I'm not sure 

if the distribution of the units is required?  Like, is there 

a mechanism for us to be able to say that we approve this 

conditional on there being x number of two-bedrooms, X number 

of three-bedrooms?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, the Board is -- you know, is 

reviewing the project as proposed.  So if it's important to 

the Planning Board to establish that the proposed number of 

two or three-bedroom units, or the proposed mix of units be 

the final mix of units when it is seeking a building permit, 

then -- again, that could be incorporated into the Planning 

Board's decision. 

          There's also -- in addition to that, there are 

requirements in the zoning for inclusionary housing, which 

56

have some minimum requirements if they are applicable.  I'm 

not sure if we established at this sort of stage of the 

process whether there would be requirements via zoning for 

family-sized units.   

          But certainly, the units that are provided through 

inclusionary have to be, you know, have to be kind of 

distributed throughout the building and have to match, 

generally speaking, with the market-rate units in the 

building in terms of the finishes and the quality.   

          The thing the zoning does provide is that more 

space can be allocated to larger size affordable units, and 

that -- again, that determination is made with our Housing 

Division at the time of the building permit.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  My next question is 

about Green Building requirements.  It's under the 

Sustainability section of memo to the Planning Board, page 13 

and 14.   

          The memo notes that this project is expected to 

reduce energy consumption by more than 28 percent.  Is that 

compared to the building's use now or a hypothetical building 

of the future building size?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's an excellent question.

Generally, it's usually characterized as a reduction from a 

baseline building.  And I wonder if Swaathi can help me out 

in this case, whether the baseline that's being referred to 

there is at the standard energy code, or is it the stretch 

code, or is it the LEED baseline standard?           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  So -- hi, this is Swaathi -- so 

the -- for the Green Building review, we actually checked 

against both.  In the Net Zero narrative, it is the 2013 as 

ASHRAE standard, which meets the stretch code requirements.  

But in the green building narrative, LEED only requires 2010 

ASHRAE standards.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  My next question is 

also in the Sustainability area.  The CDD memo notes that the 

Net Zero narrative includes a study of the solar energy 

potential of the site, and that it could accommodate a 

photovoltaic panel array.   

          Staff recommends pursuing this as a possibility.  

Is there a way to retire that?  Would we stipulate that as a 

condition, or is that just another sort of gentleperson's 

agreement?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, this is Jeff again.  In this 

case, I don't think there's a -- I don't think there's really

any agreement, but it's a question that could be posed to the 

applicant as to whether they have thought, more about the 

potential of installing a solar array at this stage of the 

process, and whether they think they would be able to do 

that.   

          It has, you know, implications for the development 

of the project, so it's really more a question for the 

applicant to answer and to say whether or not they're able to 

do that.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you, Jeff.  I would like 

to ask the applicant what they think about installing solar 

panels on the roof?   

          PETER QUINN:  Oh, hi.  This is Peter.  So we're 

required to make a certain percentage of the roof solar 

ready.  Of course, there are structural considerations and 

electric considerations that have to be brought to bear on 

that.  And so, we will do that. 

          I would like to see how all the final mechanical 

systems play out on the roof.  I've done my best to predict 

how that would look.  But that will -- you know, kind of push 

things around a little bit.   

          But, you know, there's absolutely no reason why,

you know, one couldn't put the solar panels up there once, 

you know, the building is a little further along.  It's just 

-- you know, there's economic decision to go with that as 

well.   

          But the roof itself would be, you know, completely 

available to do it -- the part that I mentioned.   

          I also -- if I can, I just want to respond to your 

question about the basement.  I'm going to add some 

information that perhaps I should have in the presentation, 

if it's okay with you?  We are actually excavating the 

basement to create a very high ceiling down there, 

approximately 10 feet, because the Tae Kwon Do has 

specialized need for a high ceiling, as you can imagine when 

people start flipping over. 

          So this is a -- this is just -- this is not a 

trivial cost, this is a very, very expensive basement, and 

it's certainly not something that, you know, we're just -- 

you know, casually undertaking.  The owner is looking to use 

this as a primary commercial space.   

          And, you know, Tae Kwon Do is its tenant.  They 

have a long-term lease, and they're a member of the 

community; has no intention of doing anything other than

renting its space in the basement to them.  So I'll leave it 

at that.            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.     

          PETER QUINN:  Yep.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I think I counted my questions 

wrong, Madam Chair.  I have two more questions for staff.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So the Traffic Parking 

recommendations, I'm looking at their memo, and they had some 

good recommendations.  I wanted to know how we adopt those 

recommendations procedurally?  Do we cite them as a 

condition?  For example, they thought that it was reasonable 

to request $250,000 to help repair the Green Street Garage, 

since there will be no parking here.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  Typically, we 

do include Staff recommended conditions in our motions.  

That's true for both CDD memos as well as for Traffic and 

Parking memos.  But I think this memo was a little less clear 

on whether or not the applicant had agreed to those 

conditions.  So I think it would be good to have the 

applicant weigh in on where we are with that discussion at 

this time.             

stairway to the Central Square subway station on Mass Avenue.         

61

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I'd like to ask that of the 

applicant.         

          KEVIN CRANE:  I can answer that question -- Kevin 

Crane.  Based on the memo that we received from Mr. Barr in 

response to my response to the initial memo, we are further 

discussing the issue of any requirement for a fee. 

          And also, we will be discussing with Traffic and 

Parking this issue of a possibility of a vision of moving the 

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.  Thank you.  My last 

question is about the DPW memo.  So they mentioned that they 

had some concerns about the proposal as it's presented.   

          I don't remember seeing that kind of language in a 

DPW memo before, so I just wanted to make sure that that will 

be addressed at some point with the engineering permits, and 

that the Planning Board doesn't need to worry about it, or is 

that something we should be asking more questions about right 

now?       

          PETER QUINN:  May I speak?  This is Peter Quinn.  

I'm going to just pass the mic to our Civil Engineer, Steve 

Sawyer, from Design Consultants.  He's worked in the city for 

many, many years.  I think he can address -- he can give you

an overview of where we're at.  Steve?     

          STEVE SAWYER:  Good evening.  Steve Sawyer, Design 

Consultants, 120 Middlesex Ave, Somerville, Mass.  Yeah, so 

the comment that Cara Felice had given, I don't think they 

were that substantial.   

          Number 1, we were just -- you know, there were kind 

of devil's in the details there and I'll try and keep it 

short.  Basically, she was asking for us to handle not only 

the new roof with the stormwater, but the renovated roof of 

the single story, which we can accommodate.             

Basically, we'd just be increasing the size of the tank in 

the basement.  I think the other was phosphorus treatment, 

which we worked through that.  There's proprietary units that 

can handle that, which is not a big deal. 

          And then finally, I think it was where we were 

discharging the stormwater instead of Mass Ave, route the 

stormwater out to Green Street, which is possible.  It's easy 

to get the piping done or -- or not easy, but we're 

excavating the basement.   

          There's fairly heavy construction that’s going to 

be happening in the basement, so we can accommodate the 

construction of other stormwater facilities as the DPW has 

63

required.   

          I've done many of the -- you know, it's a 

stormwater permit which we typically don't get involved with 

until the building permit application, which we will do and 

handle.             

questions.    

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  Those are all my 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you, 

Corinne.  Let's see.  Any other Board members with questions 

for staff or the applicant before we move to more general 

discussion and comments?  As Mr. Quinn noted, there do seem 

to be some issues still being worked out on this project.  So 

particularly with regard to traffic and parking.  So if your 

questions are of a nature of is this something you can look 

more at?  That’s okay too.  That can also be in comments.  

          Joe, did you want to say something regarding your 

memo there?      

sorry.    

          JOE BARR:  No, I just clicked on the wrong button, 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY: [Laughter] The joys of 

Zoom.  Okay.  All right.  Well, let's move to Board member 

comments, then.  Again, you know, comments on the application

as it exists today and/or things you'd like to see if an when 

it comes back to us.  So who would like to kick us off on 

64

discussion?     

I start off?    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Catherine, this is Steve.  Could 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure, absolutely.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I must say that I have really 

fundamental concerns about that whole concept of this 

project.  The way it's designed, well -- you know, looking 

back, Central Square has historically been the urban core of 

the city of Cambridge.   

          And as it developed, it was always, you know, 

substantial multistory buildings throughout.  Now, back 90 

years ago in the Depression, for all sorts of weird tax and 

other reasons, in many of those buildings, the upper stories 

were removed.  And it's just been a flaw in the neighborhood 

and in the city ever since. 

          You know, now that Cambridge and the Square has 

risen, and now that finally economically and otherwise 

there's opportunities to bring it back to the dynamic urban 

core that it was with multistory buildings, I'm troubled that 

we have an application which achieves that multistory

building for precisely half of the site. 

          And the other half of the site is left in that 

diminished one-story building, which probably goes back to 

that Depression, but with design, you know, with all of the -

- you know, the open windows and patios and so forth, one 

would look at it and say, "No, this isn't like that side is 

going to be developed in a multistory building next year."  

No, that's never going to be developed again.  It's always 

going to be a lost tooth in the streetscape of Central 

Square. 

          You know, I don't think that this is the sort of 

design and concept that is appropriate in this location.  I 

think that this one-story building, which was, you know, cut 

down and diminished 90 years ago -- this is the time in this 

market, in this economy, and with our approach to urban 

design and with our vision of what Central Square should be 

as the urban core, I think that this entire site should be 

built up. 

          Now, it doesn't all have to go to the same level, 

and maybe the right side could be just three stories tall and 

the left side could be taller.  I mean, there are some 

variations and options that you could do.

          But leaving the one-story site on the right and an 

almost semi-suburban, you know, residential thing on the left 

simply doesn't work for me.  It's not acceptable to me.   

          I want to add just one other point.  It's one that 

I have tended to raise in several hearings lately, and that's 

about parking.  I would love to live in an urban world where 

nobody had cars, nobody needed cars, and we didn't provide or 

need to provide for parking.   

          Unless I'm seriously mistaken, we don't live in 

that world.  And especially in a residential building like 

this, which I presume is not going to be having low rents, 

it's going to have high rents, or if it turns out to be 

condos, there's going to be expensive condos. 

          You know, the folks who are going to be living 

there are going to be folks, you know, who may not use their 

car every day.  You know, they're right on the T.  They're 

not going to be -- hopefully not using their car every day.  

But they're going to be owning cars.  You know?   

          And so, the question then is right, where do those 

cars go?  Well, if they go in the streets and they go in the 

neighborhood, that's a problem.  If they all go in the 

municipal garage, well that's a good thing, but, you know, we

need that municipal garage for, you know, cars for all the 

folks who live and work there -- many of whom don't have the 

opportunity to park in their building. 

          But if we're talking about a new project and a new 

building where there is the opportunity to provide parking, I 

think it's almost necessary, it's almost irresponsible not to 

provide for that.  Again, you know, if I could be persuaded, 

if I could believe, you know, that these tenants aren't going 

to have cars, then I'm all in, that's great, it would be 

wonderful if nobody had cars.  I just don't believe that 

that's the case. 

          And again, if this were an office building, I'm 

totally good without any parking at all, you know?  The 

office tenants and users can come by T, can come by -- you 

know, by bus, can walk and can do whatever they want and we 

don't need to provide parking, I'm all in. 

          But for a residential building here, I'm sorry in 

the world and the culture that we live in, I think we're 

deluding ourselves if we think that there isn't going to be a 

demand for parking. 

          So, you know, I am fundamentally opposed to the 

whole concept and design.  The parking is a secondary matter.

I just don't think that this is consistent with my vision of 

what Central Square could be and should be.          

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thanks, Steve.  

Who would like to speak next on this project?  Mary?   

          MARY FLYNN:  So in regards to parking, I agree with 

Steve.  Not that I think that you have to have parking for 

every unit, but I am concerned about there not being parking 

for the three-bedroom units.   

          I mean, if the intent is to try to provide units 

for families, I think we are being shortsighted to think that 

those people are going to do everything by public 

transportation or bicycle.  I think it's much more realistic 

to think that two bedrooms or one bedrooms and studios -- you 

know, those might be people who are willing to do that.  But 

once you have kids in the mix, I think it changes up the 

transportation needs. 

          I hadn't really looked at it as broadly as Steve 

has.  I did sort of wonder down the road what would happen to 

that gap, and -- you know, given that there is all of the 

fenestration and everything along that west wall, you know, 

the question in my head was, you know, are you going to rip 

that all out someday and put an extension on?

          And, you know, obviously you're investing a lot of 

money in this right now, so I don't think you'd be doing it 

anytime soon.   

          I would like to see a bigger plan if that's 

possible.  I mean, I think we would all be supportive of -- 

well, I shouldn't speak for everybody, but I think in general 

the city is supportive of housing.   

          So, you know, if we could get more on the site, 

either through additional height or building out over the 

other buildings, that would seem to make sense.  If that's 

not a possibility, either because the applicant has no 

interest in doing it or financially it doesn't make any 

sense, then just in terms of this project itself, I mean, I 

do -- I like the building.   

          I think the architecture is interesting.  There 

probably should be some more refinements, as was discussed.  

The point that Hugh had raised earlier about the security was 

one concern that I had as well.  So I'd like to see more 

about how that is rectified or improved.   

          And I was also happy to hear Attorney Crane mention 

that they are going to continue discussions with Traffic and 

Parking on the subway stair access as well, because I think

that is an important thing to explore as much as possible, 

and I think the earlier memos were a little bit -- the 

information was somewhat conflicting. 

So I mean I think I would like, if possible, the 

applicant to really explore a broader program.  But, you 

know, again it's an economic issue for them.  And, you know, 

in general, I do like the building that they have proposed.  

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you Mary.  

Hugh?

HUGH RUSSELL:  All right.  Took a second to get the 

unmute button.  I think this is a very challenging problem 

that has been solved in ways of immense ingenuity.  So I'm 

very almost in awe of what Peter Quinn has accomplished.     

PETER QUINN: [Laughter] Thank you.

HUGH RUSSELL:  In general, I like the architectural 

expression of the street front, but there is something that I 

don't like.  And I read the report of the Central Square 

Advisory Committee, who had seen an earlier version.  And 

Erik was able to get me a copy of that earlier version.   

And there were parts of that that I thought were 

better; specifically, it wasn't a red brick façade, but it 

was a gray brick façade on Mass Ave, and that basically all 

71

sides of the building at that middle zone were similar tone 

gray.  And I think that makes the building much more 

coherent.   

          I think the -- putting a red brick façade on a gray 

building is a throwback to something that was done 100 years 

                    st

ago.  It's not a 21  century building thing.   

          And so, it's like a quasi -- it's a nod to history 

that I don't think works well there. 

          The other thing is the current expression makes it 

looks like it's office building.  And it's not.  So I would 

like to see some clues on the Mass Avenue façade that it is 

in fact a residential building.  The studio apartment on the 

left side, you know, could have a French balcony.   

          I think work is needed to be done.  It's pretty 

challenging, because the -- there's a bunch of small bedrooms 

that face Mass Avenue.  They have huge windows.         

People are going to probably have their blinds drawn a lot, 

because they're so huge -- you know, if those windows stay as 

big as they are, we should have a condition that the window 

blinds be a dark color, so that when they're closed or 

partially closed, there's a uniform appearance to Mass 

Avenue.

          This is something that is routine in the Lowell 

Historic District; I've done hundreds of units of housing 

there, and it works. Because, of course, real buildings 

didn't have curtains.   

          As another -- so I think the west façade being a 

lighter color gray I don't like at all.  I think it should be 

the same gray as the south and the east.  If Erik feels it 

should be a little bit lighter, that's fine.  But I think all 

-- the whole building should be the same general tone and the 

same color.  Again, there are things at the top that are 

different colors, that works well. 

          So I'm concerned that the -- both the Green Street 

retail and Mass Avenue retail don't have doors directly out 

onto the street.  Now, I guess on Green Street it's a problem 

because the floor level is higher -- presumably because of 

the substation below it.   

          But almost every retail store and every retail 

street, there's a door often in the middle of the front of 

the façade, so when you walk by you know how to get in.  And 

I think you should think about that. 

          The -- I support carving out space for the T stair.  

Those are very narrow stairs.  They're only one person wide,

they're treacherous.  Having a better stair would be of great 

benefit.   

          You know, the bike lane is kind of loosely planned.  

Other parts of the basement are loosely planned.  I think 

carve out space for the stair, you know, rotate the water 

tank around so that it goes more south rather than east-west.  

I think really you should try to do that. 

          A small point, in the brick façade and courtyard, I 

think there should be piers between the windows.  That's the 

way brick works.  You can't have these, you know, 30-foot-

wide openings in brick without steel.  Yes, I know the 

steel's there, but I think if you've got piers on the Green 

Street side, there should be piers on the pedestrian passage 

way.   

          Let's see.  Oh, and I'm worried about the Chipotle 

air conditioning equipment, because it's only about 15 feet 

from people's windows, and I understand they can't get out 

onto the roof, but still if there's noisy equipment out 

there, older equipment, you know, it could make the tendency 

of a lot of those apartments pretty bad.  And I think you 

need to demonstrate that the equipment is a -- has, you know, 

isn't too noisy.

          My last point is -- oh, the solar-ready roof:  

There are two tiny little patches that you could put several 

solar panels in.  I don't think you can get 29 kilowatts in 

those tiny patches.  And what the problem is, you've got all 

this duct work running across the roof.  Now, maybe you can 

mount solar panels above the duct work, but you also have 

some larger machines.   

          I'm guessing the duct work isn't in the building, 

because you're trying desperately to stay under the 70-foot 

height limit to meet your economic feasibility goals.  And -- 

but I think there's a lot of roof there.  They could see the 

sun if there wasn't this maze of duct work and machinery in 

the roof.  I think you should work on that.  So those are my 

points.   

          I guess I should say that except for the 

uncertainty in the discussions with the Traffic and Parking 

Department, I would have prepared to vote favorably for this 

and leave these kinds of design development things to be 

monitored by Staff.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Hugh.  Lou?   

75

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I like everything 

everyone said.  Of course, and I have to disagree with Hugh a 

little bit, I do like the red brick.  And I was asking for 

more -- going to ask for more detail in this Mass Ave façade.   

          Now, I know they've used this thin brick façade; I 

don't know if that has too much capability to detail that 

further.   

          I like the nod to history a little bit.  Yeah, as 

always, parking I think is a big problem.  I don't know -- 

and to Steve's point about this should be a much larger 

proposition, I think he's also correct.  That way we could 

have probably gotten some parking provided.   

          It's very difficult in this site the way it sits.  

It's in a tough spot.  It does have a garage close by.  I 

don't think family-sized units and no parking really mixes. 

          Other than that, I think it was a pretty 

imaginative way to reuse this site, and I hope no one builds 

over Chipotle or the liquor time anytime soon.  It kind of 

ruins a lot of work by everyone.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Other 

Board comments?  I don't see other hands, but I'm happy to 

hear from other Board members.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  All right.  So I want to focus -

- I appreciate what all the, my other colleagues have talked 

about, and I want to focus on the housing piece here -- 

really speaking to the public and the applicant, because my 

fellow colleagues on the Board have heard me say this lots of 

time. 

          So we need all types of housing in Cambridge, and 

most urgently we need affordable housing.  So it's exciting 

to hear about a project with 46 housing units.  But I want to 

spend a minute being really explicit about who this housing 

would help. 

          So first of all, only nine of the 46 units are 

proposed to be affordable.  This is the minimum requirement 

of the Inclusionary Housing Zoning ordinance.  I encourage 

the applicant to exceed the minimum requirement, to make half 

of the units affordable, even though it's not required. 

          From an economics perspective, assigning a unit as 

affordable doesn't mean that the owner would collect zero 

dollars of rent per unit; using a studio apartment as an 

example, a market-rate studio apartment in Central Square 

goes for about $1800 to $2000 a month right now. An owner 

would collect a maximum of $24,000 a year in rent from a 

77

          If the studio were designated affordable, the owner 

could collect at least $10,000 in rent per year and up to as 

much as $17,000 of rent per year.  So that spread is not 

          And I've used a studio as the most generous example 

for the owners, because affordable studios can only charge a 

maximum of 25 percent of an occupants' income.  All other 

types of housing you can charge up to 30 percent of people's 

studio. 

huge.   

income.   

          So the difference between market rate and what you 

can collect on an affordable unit decreases for all the other 

sized units.  You can charge more for one-bedrooms, two-

bedrooms, et cetera.   

          Furthermore, when we're thinking about cost, these 

units are bonus units.  So it's not displacing other income, 

it's adding potential income, while the building expenses 

benefit from economies of scale. 

          And again, speaking to the applicant via the 

representatives, I think when people think about affordable

housing, they might celebrate nine units and think, "This 

means that nine low-income families will have housing."  But 

it is not that simple.   

          There are minimum and maximum income requirements 

to be allowed to be in the rental pool.  And those are tied 

to median area income.  So the smallest income could have and 

live in this new building would be $41,000 a year.   

          So someone working full-time at the state minimum 

wage would not be allowed to apply for affordable housing 

here.  Someone who was earning the city's minimum wage of $15 

an hour working full-time would not qualify to live in these 

apartments. 

          And regarding who gets to live here, because of 

occupancy standards imposed by federal rules, many families 

who need affordable housing can only live in three-bedroom or 

larger apartments.  So to use an example, if I'm a single 

parent with a 6-year-old boy and a 10-year-old girl, I am 

only allowed to live in a three-bedroom apartment.  I cannot 

qualify for a two-bedroom apartment or a one-bedroom 

apartment or a studio. 

          So if the applicant keeps the plan as it is, you're 

offering only one affordable three-bedroom apartment.  And in

the city, three-or more-bedroom apartments are what we need 

the most.  So I urge the applicant to think about their role 

in the community and their power to address this affordable 

housing emergency. 

          So even though it's not required, applicant would 

still enjoy great profits if they reorganized the space to 

yield more three-bedroom apartments, and if they designated 

up to half of the housing units as affordable.  Those are my 

only comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you 

Corinne.  Tom?  Let's hear from you next.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I 

appreciate my fellow Board members who were concerned about 

parking.  I went back to at least the memo that was supplied 

by us referencing the Special Permit Criteria in the 

ordinance and the findings that we'd need to make in order to 

alleviate the parking.   

          And I feel constrained by those, irrespective of 

how we might feel about where those cars might park and the 

planning processes under which the property owner has 

proceeded in good faith and some thinking by a lot of good 

people in the Central Square planning process; have come up 

80

with what they think is the correct approach on parking. 

          So it still remains to be seen whether we can make 

the findings, but I feel constraint by what the ordinance is 

directing the Planning Board to investigate. 

          I too think the site is underdeveloped, but -- and 

Hugh's by far a greater expert in housing dimensions than I 

am; I've done a fraction of the number of multifamilies that 

he has, but there are windows on the party wall to the east, 

to the -- well, to the west of the site on the east wall of 

the existing structure, which would mean if we built over 

Chipotle or the liquor store -- and I hope you don't, because 

that's where I get my liquor -- but if you built over there, 

you'd have to set back from that wall some significant 

distance. 

          And the dimensions of housing are fixed, obviously, 

by the modules of bedrooms and access to light.  And so, the 

dimension of this building may be as skinny as you can be, 

but to get units on two sides but making it wider can help a 

little bit, but not that much if you get too wide. 

          So it's very hard to do develop over the entire 

platform of the site without it converting almost instantly 

to a commercial use.

          And to Corinne's impassioned points, we need 

housing.  And I think that's also consistent with what the 

planning process is in the Central Square groups that have 

come before us are advising this Board of as well, that we 

should promote housing whenever we get a chance.   

          So we're sort of fixed by the architectural and the 

planning dimensions of housing, which may mean that this site 

will always be a missing tooth, unless you're considering a 

commercial use upstairs. 

          The western storefront approach, as it was 

described, which is the great tradition in Central Square of 

the walls that face the public thoroughfare, which is our 

Main Street -- Mass Ave -- are always different from the 

sides.  And that's a wonderful thing.  It's a deference to a 

-- and an understanding of a civic responsibility to build a 

magnificent and quality public realm, and all the sides can 

be more economic.  I like that. 

          I would say that there's magnificent examples which 

were referenced here tonight and we shared photographs -- 

thank you.  I just wonder whether the wall on Mass Ave is 

civic enough; is of high enough quality.  And I know Peter's 

worked pretty hard on it, as we've been told tonight.

          But I was slightly taken aback by the fact that 

we're using thin brick.  I agree with my colleague Lou here; 

that's not a substantial material.  It's not a real material, 

it's trying to simulate a brick, right?  And is that really 

                                                           st

the front civic wall, is that the best we can do in the 21  

century for putting our best face forward is a thin piece of 

ceramic, rather than an authentic material?   

          So I wonder whether in fact the spirit of that 

Mass Ave elevation is consistent with the tradition of making 

strong civic gestures to our Main Street.  So I would 

encourage more looking at that.  A very complicated problem; 

I agree with Hugh.   

          There are a couple of details that catch my eye, 

but they're details:  the intersection of the Chipotle wall 

with this wall which overlaps it looks awkward, it's not 

resolved architecturally.  The model that we were shown gets 

it right; it's a straight line.  So I'm sure Peter's aware of 

that and has struggled with that.   

          The kind of wholesale divorcing of the commercial 

level from the wall above.  If you look at it structurally, 

these brick piers coming down the landing on thin piers below 

-- there is a transition, it's a different use, but those are 

83

details that strike me as not quite resolved yet, but details 

that wouldn't hang up a vote on the project tonight, in my 

opinion. 

          But I would defer to the sense of the Board.  

That's where I am on this.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Tom.  Niko?         

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Thank you.  So I agree with the 

sentiment of Corinne's statement that I would like to see a 

lot more affordable housing and just all the more housing in 

general.  I think if you were to, you know, survey every plot 

of land in the city and ask, "Where should the most housing 

be?" I would say immediately above one of the entrances to 

the Red Line, which this is.   

          And so, it just seems like there should be just, 

like, a 100-story residential skyscraper right here.  And I 

think it's a missed opportunity to not take advantage of that 

to the greatest extent possible.   

          But I -- nice Catherine --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.            

          NIKOLAS BOWIE: [Laughter] -- I strongly agree with 

the other Board members about parking.  I think the -- you 

know, the years' long planning effort that went into, or that

the city of Cambridge conducted over the past three, four, 

five years indicated that eliminating the lines on cars is a 

major priority of the city.  It's a major priority of the 

planet, and the way to eliminate the use of cars is to not 

provide space for people to have their cars. 

          When we say that we want parking available in this 

building, what we are saying is don't house people there, put 

your cars there instead.   

          People who want to move here and live in this 

building understand that, you know, if there isn't a garage 

as part of the building, it's going to be more expensive and 

more of a pain to bring their cars here.  That's a cost that 

everyone makes when they consider where to live. 

          And so, I think to require the applicant to 

substitute in effect housing, or housing people for housing 

cars, that is inconsistent with all of the messages that we 

are receiving from the rest of the city regarding the 

importance of housing and the harm that cars produce, both 

for our environment and for the larger planet and for 

congestion, frankly. 

          So all that's to say I like -- I'm an architect, I 

like the building, it looks great.  I'd like to see more of

it, and I think the absence of a parking garage is a benefit, 

not an objection.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you, 

Niko.  Just to add a couple of thoughts myself, I do agree 

with the Board members who commented that only kind of 

building half the site seems like a lost opportunity.  I 

would prefer to see a project that undertook that.  I would 

also note that there has been some housing built not far from 

here.   

          I think back to the 10 Essex Street Project that we 

permitted not that long ago, or maybe it was that long ago.  

It's built now, anyway.  There ought to be some data 

available on how much parking is actually needed by those 

buildings, and I would encourage the applicant in Traffic and 

Parking to get us some examples.   

          You know, if you're going to say that folks in 

these areas are not going to cause parking demand, it would 

be helpful -- you know, we had this debate on 10 Essex, just 

to get them down to 50 percent parking. 

          I'd love to hear how that worked out.  You know, if 

in fact that parking is being leased up at less than the 

demand, and the Traffic and Parking records indicate that

that reflects the actual car ownership in the building, that 

would be good to know.  Yeah.   

          There are other buildings that are not quite as 

contemporary in Central Square, but, you know, make the case 

and I think that would be certainly easier for this Board 

member to be supportive of.   

     I do think that Traffic and Parking is correct in 

looking at the potential for needing to house cars offsite is 

the major kind of traffic and parking impact that this 

project has, and appropriate mitigation is necessary.  And 

so, the applicant is going to need to continue to work with 

Traffic and Parking to determine that. 

          I think the T stairwell is an excellent idea and 

would be a tremendous community benefit, as would some 

contribution to the continued maintenance of Green Street 

Garage.  They're not the only things that could be done, but, 

you know, right now this Board member is supportive of the 

mitigation measures outlined in the Traffic and Parking memo. 

          Yeah, I think overall my concern is that this 

building isn't ambitious enough.  It doesn't provide as much 

housing as it could, it doesn't -- it isn't -- it hasn't 

maximized its potential for solar, it hasn't amazed its

potential for the retail.  I do think not only is it a 

security concern, but a viability of those retail spaces to 

not have direct entries from Mass Ave into the retail spaces. 

          You know, I worry that by being so focused on 

keeping this at, you know, a seven-story building and, you 

know, making it economic that we're under those conditions, 

height we're actually losing a lot, and potentially frankly a 

lot of revenue for the developer if it were more ambitious.  

And I would prefer to see the project expanded so that it can 

achieve more of what I think its goals are and our goals. 

          So my sense from the Board at this time is that 

there are enough issues here that we would like to see 

explored further, that we're going to continue the hearing at 

this time.  Are there any comments from the Board?  Any last-

minute things?  We want to make sure the applicant and Staff 

are talking about before they come back to us?     

          [Pause]  

          No, okay.  Then is there a motion to continue the 

hearing to a future date?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Lou, so moved.

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  All right.  

So the next item on our agenda is a public hearing on a 

zoning petition by -- I apologize for how I'm going to 

butcher the name -- Arvind Srinivasau et al to create a new 

Section 20.955, additional Quadrangle Northwest District 

modifications applicable in the existing Alewife Overlay 

District.   

before us.   

We'll start with CDD Staff summarizing why this is 

JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

Jeff Roberts with Community Development once again, and this 

is a refiled zoning petition that the Board has now had 

several sessions to discuss, starting late last year.   

I'll remind you that the Board's task with the 

recommendations is to make an advisory -- with petitions is 

to make an advisory recommendation to the City Council.   

And I'm kicking this one off in a little bit of an 

unusual place, because the last time the Board had a hearing 

on this petition, they actually asked for staff to do a

little bit of work into looking at the zoning language, and 

that's the bulk of what the Planning Board has received along 

with the refiled version of the petition. 

          So I just wanted to give a quick overview of what 

we provided to staff, and then turn it back over so the 

petitioners can talk. 

          We were asked by the Planning Board to kind of 

simplify the language a little bit.  There was some general 

sense of the Board that there were elements of the petition, 

or at least elements of the development proposal that were 

viewed favorably by the Board, but that the Board wanted to 

see the language presented in a bit clearer way. 

          So what we provided, along with the summary of the 

Planning Board's comments was a draft of the zoning, which 

looks a bit more like the kind of PUD type zoning that the 

Board tends to be more familiar with for these kinds of 

proposals. 

          So the zoning has a few different parts to it.  The 

first part establishes the overall parameters for what we're 

calling a Master Plan development within those zoning 

district.  It has a minimum parcel size, meant to ensure that 

it would be for a substantial development that would provide

22

kind of a -- sort of extra ability to look at how it benefits 

the area. 

          It -- the zoning draft that we submitted then sets 

forth what the basic required elements of a Master Plan 

proposal would be; those are fairly standard at this point.  

It sets forth the criteria for approval, which in this case 

would be fairly simple.   

          It includes conformance with the Alewife plan, 

conformance with the Climate Change Preparedness and 

Resilience Plans, and development resulting in the completion 

of at minimum pedestrian-bicycle crossing, and that was 

something that was discussed the last time, and we'll talk a 

little bit more about it. 

          In terms of how the zoning works, it establishes 

that as a -- kind of a criteria for approval.  It doesn't 

necessarily say, you know, how it gets done, it just says 

that that's an element of the development plan. 

          And then the final piece of the draft lays out what 

the specific modifications are that the Planning Board can 

approve through this type of a special permit Master Plan 

review process, including the increased height that was 

proposed, allowing that density bonus of 0.25 FAR to be

applied in exchange as a bonus for the bridge.  That's in 

current zoning, but doesn't currently apply to this specific 

district. 

plan. 

          And then it also includes the GFA for floor area 

exemptions for ground-story light industrial uses, 

modifications to parking and setback standards, which are 

intended to allow outcomes that are in line with the Alewife 

          So we drafted this, and it was shared with the 

petitioners' representatives.  We met with them to talk about 

it.  They pointed out a few areas where they had some 

substantive comments, and we thought it would be helpful to 

discuss those with the Board.   

          I think that they explain those comments fairly 

clearly in the response letter that was shared with the Board 

last week.  So I'll let them speak to that, but happy to talk 

about this further with the Board later on.  Thanks.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thank you, 

Jeff.  All right so then we'll move to a presentation by the 

petitioner and, I gather, Jay Doherty, from Cabot, Cabot & 

Forbes is representing the petitioner.  Please present the 

petition in your presentation and introduce any other

presenters from your team, who will be speaking tonight.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and 

thank you to all members of the Board.  You've been very 

generous with your time and working with us on this.  And 

thank you as well to the CDD Staff.   

          I think as Jeff indicated; we are largely in 

agreement with the draft of the petition as it has been 

reworked by CDD.  There are two or three areas where we think 

we would need some further clarification in order to do what 

we would like to do with this project. 

          I will touch briefly on those two or three areas.  

They are set forth in the letter of December 4 to you.  

Before we do that, if I could just take a moment -- I'm going 

to jump a little in this presentation.  I would ask Swaathi 

to go to page 6 if she could.   

          And that is that I have found in conversations 

around the city that a lot of people are a little mystified 

by what this zoning really is for, and why we have undertaken 

it.  And the explanation is in these two or three slides.   

          This graphic that you see in front of you is the 

current zoning of AOD-1 at 55 feet.  Were we to simply pursue 

a project that ignored the active ground-floor uses and

ignored the bridge, we would build a four-story office lab 

project, and that would fit fine within the 55 feet. 

If you could advance to the next slide, please? 

However, we believe that creating a neighborhood 

place here and bringing the bridge to -- creating the bridge 

to span the tracks is vital.  It's vital to the area, it's 

vital to how we see our interests in the area.   

As you may know, in addition to the Quad, we've 

recently acquired 67 Smith, which I'll touch upon, and we 

hope and expect to acquire further partial next week. 

The difficulty is that the light industrial uses 

and the ones that we know, the consumer- facing businesses 

and the light industrial, really do need a 20-foot ceiling 

height.   

standard. 

In addition, while it's not shown here -- you'll 

see it in the next slide -- the bridge by necessity must tie 

into the building at a height of about 20 feet.  The bridge 

is about 21 feet clear by necessity.  That's the MBTA 

And when it comes to this side of the tracks, one 

of the difficulties is that the bridge must integrate with 

any projects over on this side, because unlike the north

side, there simply is not room to build an independent 

ramping system for the availability of ramps to ramp down 

from the 20 feet or so of the bridge down to grade. 

          Now, there is a very substantial benefit in that 

when you integrate the bridge and land it at this plaza 

level, you create the opportunity to integrate it with 

multiple transportation systems -- elevators, bike rentals, 

plaza areas; as well as a true ramp that wraps around this  

building.   

          So the reason we requested that the AOD -- that you 

consider this AOD-1 petition is to make it clear that we 

would -- to make it available to us to go ahead and adopt 

these integrated uses without surrendering half of the 

proposed floors of the office and lab building.  That's the 

very basic rationale of why we're here and why we're doing 

          So having said that, if we could go please to page 

3 of this, and I will briefly touch on the areas where we 

have some different needs than the CDD petition ultimately 

this.   

concluded. 

          The first is that as you look at this, you see that 

we will need to obtain for the successful development of this 

97

bridge several easements from the MBTA.  Those are easements 

that are -- most of the project outside of the CC&F property 

is held by the MBTA; the span of the bridge, the northern 

ramp that's within their right of way.   

So they're going to need to supply us with a number 

of easements, both to the permanent bridge, the construction 

of the bridge, and for the siting of at least a couple and 

perhaps multiple piers to underpin the bridge and support it.   

And this is something we've been talking about with 

the MBTA for quite some time, and this plan as you see it is 

the plan that has resulted from those discussions, and we've 

considered a number of things, but this is the current plan 

that will continue to be the object of our attention. 

In addition, we will need an order of conditions as 

to that northern ramp; it does cross a floodplain.  And in 

addition, we will need the city to cooperate in causing the 

pedestrian easements that were granted to 160 Cambridge Park 

Drive as part of its approvals to actually be converted into 

real easements that cross between the ramps and Cambridge 

Park Drive. 

Now, the fundamental point that we want to express 

that is at some variance with the CDD draft is we don't 

98

control these approvals.  These approvals can be denied to 

us.  These approvals could be subject in order of conditions, 

for example, to litigation.   

If the underlying project has as a condition of its 

permits a need for it to in effect guarantee that it will 

supply these approvals and these easements, but that they are 

not within its control, we won't be able to finance the 

project.  And the project is what produces the dollars to 

build the bridge. 

So the language of the petition -- and I don't 

expect, by the way, that we ever need to think about this, I 

think we will with the cooperation of all involved get this 

done, and we're happy to take the leadership role in getting 

it done, but we can't have a condition that reads in such a 

way that we will build this under all circumstances, no 

matter what else happens or what else happens in terms of a 

denial of approvals.   

I will note quickly that while we've had great 

cooperation from the MBTA -- recently, the MBTA Real Estate 

Department's entered the discussions, and they've begun to 

talk about appraisals and values, which was a little 

surprising, given it's a big piece of public infrastructure.

          I will tell you that in the past when we've had 

those discussions on other public infrastructure -- and I can 

give you the details, it was in Cambridge -- in Newton at the 

Riverside Station -- we've been unable to complete the public 

infrastructure.   

          And that was a partnership I had with the City 

Aldermen in Auburndale and we just couldn't get it done 

because the MBTA ordered an appraisal, and the appraisal just 

destroyed the economic value of being able to do anything.  

So we abandoned that public improvement. 

          I don't expect that to happen here, but we can't 

have a project where the Planning Board in the part of its 

special permit can't take latitude to be able to deal with 

those uncertainties.   

          This is a one-year long planning and interesting 

process, and even when we come back to you for the special 

permit, it's not going to be complete.  We need to do a great 

deal of soil testing and structural, and there's a close 

integration between how you build this and how it works. 

          And therefore, we need the language to give the 

Planning Board the ability to issue a special permit that 

contemplates that this could happen.

          Our proposal very simply is that if it should 

happen -- and we don't believe it will -- that we have the 

ability to complete as best as possible our obligations by 

making a -- what I call a backstop financial contribution, 

that would reflect what is needed to help complete this type 

of bridge. 

          And we anticipate that that would be a significant 

amount.  That would be set as an alternative, as a backstop 

at the time of the special permit for the project.  We should 

be more advanced in the design, but we won't be complete, so 

we do need to ask that you consider giving us a financeable 

zoning whereby you have the ability in the special permit to 

contemplate this.   

          That is unequivocally the most important point 

we're facing if we have to guarantee the delivery of this 

bridge, we won't be able to proceed with it.  It just won't 

work for financing purposes.   

          Secondly, you may have noticed that we have 

acquired 67 Smith.  In our original petition, we sought to 

have the AOD-1 properties able to similarly contribute to the 

bridge.   

          Now, the zoning provides that abutting properties

such as our property Cambridge Landscaping, can contribute 

and obtain a bridge bonus and obtain the ability to a Master 

Plan and yield the 85 feet.  If in fact they can make an 

easement or land donation -- and I misspoke about Cambridge 

Landscaping, because it's AOD-2.   

But our original concept was that a project like 67 

Smith, if developed, would be able to make contributions and 

we believe that this is very useful.  It's very useful for a 

couple of reasons.   

One is the MBTA has expressed real concern that 

there be diverse sources of funding -- that diverse entities 

be committed to funding this bridge, to providing extra 

capital if it's needed, and to being available to commit to 

long-term financial commitments in order to maintain, repair, 

replace or improve the bridge.   

And therefore we are asking the provisions of the 

zoning contemplate that a project in AOD-1 such as 67 Smith, 

be able to complete a Master Plan, take advantage of the 

ground-floor active use, the 85 feet in height, and if it's 

amenable to you, to obtain the 0.25 FAR bonus.   

There are two minor points.  One is that we have -- 

we contemplate doing a central parking garage that is

primarily a garage, but that is fronted on Mooney Street by a 

genuine residential development, probably with the type of 

active ground-floor space that we've talked about before, 

notwithstanding that it's residential. 

          There is drafting in the current zoning petition as 

drafted that says that the entire ground floor of the garage 

needs to be light industrial or community facing space, if it 

wants to be an 85-foot building.  And I don't think we can 

deliver that with an operating garage.   

          So we're asking that we have the ability to build a 

garage up to 85 feet in height, irrespective of the ground-

floor uses, and not have a requirement that those two be 

light industrial or consumer-facing businesses.   

          They will likely be mixed-use buildings in terms of 

having a frontage of residential, and they will be shared use 

parking garages -- a parking garage, it's a singular garage. 

          The last thing and I will be done is that the 

definitions this accompany the petition for light industrial 

or consumer-facing businesses refer to businesses that 

absolutely require the 20 feet in height.   

          And therefore, if you're talking about a genuine 

craft brewery, if you're talking about an Iggy's bakery, 

103

those uses fit neatly.  We're concerned that there's a little 

bit of narrowness, and that we believe it would be beneficial 

to activating the street and serving the area if a limited 

amount of that space could be dedicated to restaurants that 

may not be industrial in character, that may not be like 

Iggy's. 

          Because we think the area badly needs restaurants.  

We don't intend and are not asking to supplant the light 

industrial or the consumer-facing businesses, we're simply 

asking that there be a modicum of ability to introduce some 

ancillary restaurant uses, simply because we think they're 

vital to the area in terms of an area that lacking food 

services.   

          So those are the points that we cover in the letter 

that we sent you, and where we are hoping that we can 

persuade you to accommodate those so that we can proceed with 

the project, and the zoning that will allow us to proceed 

with the project.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  If there are -- and that concludes your presentation 

for tonight?  Yeah.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  Yes.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Then we will move to public comment.  This is a public 

hearing.  Any members of the public who wish to speak should 

now click the button that says, "Raise hand."   

          If you're calling in by phone, you can raise your 

hand by pressing *9.  As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board 

had received one written communication from the Highlands 

Quad Committee on this case.  Written communications received 

after 5:00 p.m. yesterday will entered into the record.   

          I will now ask Staff to unmute the speakers one at 

a time.  You should begin by saying your name and address, 

and then Staff will confirm that we can hear you.  After 

that, you will have up to three minutes to speak before I ask 

you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  This is Jeff Roberts.  And 

I'm going to all -- we did have a request from some speakers 

before the meeting, and I wasn't sure if you wanted me to 

begin there?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That would be fine.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  So I'm going to call -- so 

there was an advance request to speak from John Chun.  And 

unfortunately, there are I think maybe because the link was 

105

forwarded, there are several John Chuns appearing.  So can 

only the actual John Chun raise their hand and the others 

maybe lower at this point?  I think that that works. 

          Okay, so the first speaker is John Chun.  You can 

unmute yourself.  Begin with your name and address, please.          

          JOHN CHUN:  Thank you, Jeff.  And can you hear me?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.           

          JOHN CHUN:  Okay, great.  Thank you, Jeff.  I'm 

sorry about that.  I forwarded some of the invites to some 

folks, and that resulted in multiple John Chuns.  And good 

evening, everyone and Madam Chair.   

          And my name is John Chun, from 48 Loomis Street.  

So we as a neighborhood committee, we got together on a few 

occasions and we came up with a letter that we submitted to 

you on Sunday evening. 

          And I'm going to go through much of the letter, and 

then I'm going to hand over to the rest of our Committee 

members for them to continue on. 

          So the Cambridge Highlands Quad Neighborhood has 

reviewed the Srinivasa zoning petition and the December 2, 

2020 CDD memo to the Planning Board.  The Highlands Quad 

Committee reiterates that we are not now, and never have

been, against development.   

That being said, the Moody Street development in 

AOD-1 is one of the largest ever proposed in Area 12.  And it 

directly abuts the Highlands. 

We sent our Letter of Request on May 14, 2020 to 

the City Council and concerned CC&F.  Since then, we have met 

with the CC&F to discuss our concerns and request, which we'd 

like to reiterate today.   

In addition, we'd like to speak on the following 

from the CDD memo.  Some of these may be the results of our 

misreading of the memo.  So any clarification will be 

appreciated.   

One, the increased maximum height of 85 feet 

regardless of use plus four feet of flood control and the 

rooftop mechanics is a major concern for us, as we do not 

want to see this area becoming another Kendall Square, with 

the towering buildings. 

Number 2, the bridge over the railroad tracks is 

only a pedestrian bridge.  We believe a shuttle bridge will 

be needed to better serve the neighborhood. 

And number 3, the bridge is only required for the 

additional FAR, but not with other incentives such as the 

107

maximum height.  Was this intended by the CDD in the memo?  

     Number 4, there is no time limit to special permits.  

We believe there must be clear time limits that can be 

extended only through a comprehensive review process, 

including public hearings, the developer seeking to extend 

the previous granted special permits must supply updated 

documentation every time an extension is sought. 

          Number 5, while the memo gives a way to the Alewife 

District Plan, there is no mention of a public amenities, 

such as libraries, schools, fire, police stations, and parks 

with benches where people can walk to and enjoy.  How can we 

ensure the vision for these public amenities outlined in the 

Alewife District Plan is met through these special permits?   

          Also, how can we ensure to track the types of 

retailers that can enrich the neighborhood? 

          Number 6, the memo doesn't call out for traffic 

impact studies for the surrounding areas, such as Concord 

Avenue and cross streets.  And we believe it should be 

included. 

          Number 7, the memo doesn't mention how a place like 

Blair Pond just outside a development can be protected.   

We feel that the special permit provisions provide what it 

108

advantageous to developers, while not addressing how public 

amenities in the neighborhood can be added, other than the 

bridge.   

We'd like to ask the Planning Board to reconsider 

the petition and mandate inclusion of the steps to ensure 

such public amenities are added as the area is developed. 

We fear that the current petition will result in 

overbuilding of the area, with the towering buildings not 

fitting for this neighborhood.   

And some property owners in AOD-1 expressed to us 

that they do not want to be part of the petition, contrary to 

what we are being led to believe.  Our question is, what 

would happen to the petition if not all property owners in 

AOD are on board?  Thank you so much.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker -- thank you -- is 

Elizabeth Feigenbaum.  You can unmute yourself and begin with 

your name and address, please.   

ELIZABETH FEIGENBAUM:  Hey, I'm Elizabeth 

Feigenbaum, 82 Normandy Ave in the Highlands.  Can you hear 

me?

ELIZABETH FEIGENBAUM:  All right.  We -- as John 

said, we are not against development.  We want to see this 

area developed.  But our concern really is it's going to end 

up like Fawcett Street or the Triangle, and we're interested 

in a livable neighborhood for residents and we're interested 

in a livable neighborhood for residents and for the 

businesses.  The people will come with the businesses.   

And we've gone back and forth with Cabot, Cabot & 

Forbes, and are concerned that we're being given a bunch of 

promises that nobody will be held accountable for. 

So we also want to review with you the request we 

sent to the City Council on May 14 in 2020.  And these 

include a 50-foot-wide no-build green zone to be set aside 

and planted with minimum eight-inch diameter at breast height 

trees between the Highlands residential abutters' property 

lines and the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest Overlay District, 

with CCF's buildings and building height setbacks of 35, 45 

and 55.   

The current zoning allows a 25-foot-wide buffer, 

which is too close to a residential area of small-sized 

homes.  And CFF -- CCF did agree to a 50-foot wide, but part 

of what they agreed to was for land that they don't own, we

later found out from other property owners in the area. 

It also would include the developer's four-foot 

elevation above ground level and height of rooftop 

infrastructure's mechanicals in the total heights of all 

buildings and the public parking garage.  No motor or 

autonomous vehicle access to the Highlands currently or in 

the future.   

And in terms of the Blair Pond Reservation, we have 

a lot of concerns about Blair.  There's going to be an 

enormous impact from the number of people that are going to 

be moving into the area. 

As you know, it's public property on and managed by 

DCR as an urban wild.  And we want a commitment from CCF and 

other owns of the 26 acres that they will contribute annually 

to a conservation fund overseen by DCR, work with the Blair 

Pond Association and DCR to prepare for and manage this 

increased usage.   

And I actually saw a bunch of DCR people out there 

a couple of weeks ago and went out and spoke to them so they 

are thinking about this too.   

Improve and maintain the site. Blair needs help.  

It needs work.  And very importantly, to provide an

accessible dog park that is attractive, that people would 

want to go to, away from Blair Pond Reservation, to minimize 

the impact of dogs on the reservation.   

And I'll stop there because I'm at my three 

minutes, and let another member of our committee pick up from 

there.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker with an 

advance request is Susan Agger.  Can you raise your hand, 

please, if you're -- you are now allowed to speak?  You can 

unmute yourself and begin with your name and address.     

SUSAN AGGER:  Hi.  My name is Susan Agger.  I live 

at 1 Loomis Street in the Highlands, and I'll continue with 

this list that Lizzie was starting from, so Number 5, 

Independent Hydrology Study of runoff and other impacts of 

site elevation on the surroundings, with flood mitigation 

plan.  There's just some concerns that even with the increase 

in street level that it might change the groundwater and the 

flow of water in the area.   

Use integrated pest management, similar to what is 

used on the golf course at Fresh Pond, so that it doesn't 

impact water supply and is environmentally safe, as well as 

salting in the winter, just as it doesn't have a deleterious

effect on the environment in that area.  They use permeable 

paving materials and xeriscaping, if possible, where 

necessary. 

building heights. 

          Six, independent shadow study of impacts of 

          Seven, seek input from abutters concerning the 

following:  Hope Bridge, Amenity Bridge connection over MBTA 

tracks between the Triangle and the Highlands quad.  You had 

mentioned that a little bit earlier.   

          The shuttle bike pedestrian with handicap 

accessibility and motorized bikes and scooters, bike-sharing 

amenities on CC&F property and Alewife T station and on the 

northern side of the bridge. Also bridge ownership and 

maintenance needs to be established and clear, with MBTA 

approval, of course.  Independent traffic study including 

bike path connections. 

          And then with regard to property management, 

preconstruction baseline survey of abutters' properties.  

Communicate with residential abutters about construction 

schedules.  Noise reduction where that can be done, with 

shielding of mechanicals.   

          Install low-noise technology, automatic garage door

openers and motors such as fans and noise-generating 

equipment.  And just comply with the city noise ordinance.  

Trash, recycling, commercial deliveries and commercial and 

residential moves, et cetera, to comply with city noise 

ordinance. 

          Locate dumpsters and rooftop utilities such as 

pools, HVAC vents away from abutters.  Screen rooftop 

mechanicals, again, for noise and also for aesthetics, on- 

site 24/7 property management and security.   

          And also, we would hope that they would control 

dust and dirt during demolition and construction to protect 

the workers and abutters in the Highland conditions.   

          Also, with regard to lighting, there is shielded 

lighting to not impact the area of Alewife.  Show lighting 

plan and reduce exterior interior security lights and 

signage, especially on buildings facing abutters and Blair 

Pond.   

          And lastly, set and enforce building turnoffs and 

turn-ons for lighting times for after hours, weekends, and 

three-days weekends.  And I'll stop there and let the next 

person continue.  Thank you.

Jonathan Agger.  And if that person is present, can you raise 

your hand.  I think it might be this person.  Can you unmute 

yourself and begin with your name and address?     

          JONATHAN AGGER:  Yes.  This is Jonathan Agger, 1 

Loomis Street.  So I -- just continuing the same theme, we're 

really looking for a focus and commitment on amenities that 

can help to bridge the development with the Highlands for us.   

          It's an opportunity to expand our neighborhood, and 

we'd like to ensure that it's not just an industrial 

development, but it is a place that has facilities that we 

would like to go to and to encourage anyone who's residing 

there to come join us. 

          So with the focus on that, number 9 on our list was 

around site plantings (sic) and a management plant -- plan, 

sorry.  Greenery and tree planting to comply with city supply 

and mitigation and tree canopy recommendations installing 

benches, tables, play spaces, paths and similar structures to 

residential and commercial tenant use, and for the public. 

          Number 10, homeownership provides another housing 

option, in addition to the city's 20 percent affordable 

housing mandate.  And so, we'd like to have consideration for 

that.

          And finally, we'd like to see a filing of a signed 

letter of understanding of the city that directly ties the 

zoning changes to the completion of the proposed development 

and public benefits.   

          And with that, I will yield my time.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker who 

signed up was Danica Maury.  If you could raise your hand if 

you're present and you would like to speak?     

          [Pause] 

          Okay.  You can unmute yourself now and begin with 

your name and address.     

          DANICA MAURY:  I think I -- my name is Danica 

Maury.  I'm at 23 Normandy Ave.  I apologize, I think I was 

listed to speak erroneously.  I had selected not to speak, 

but I just want to support the comments of my neighbors and, 

you know, we very much would like to see good development 

here that integrates with the feel of the neighborhood and 

preserves the environment, and has the right amenities to 

support our current residents and those who come in. 

          And so, thank you for your consideration and I'll 

yield the rest of my time.

you on the stop.  And the next speaker who is on the list of 

requests is Ann Tennis.  I'm going to make a stab and say 

that this maybe is Ann Tennis.  Can you unmute yourself and 

identify yourself, please?   

          ANN TENNIS:  Hi.  This is Ann Tennis at 71 Griswold 

Street.  I would like to restate what my peers have said -- 

that the Cambridge Highlands has never been against 

development, and we are not against development now.  

Actually, we're rather known in the city to work with 

developers for a mutual ending. 

          With that said, this parcel is a total of 26 acres 

in the Quadrangle, and it is a massive parcel of land.  And 

it really needs to be developed in the correct way with a 

look to the entire 26 acres, not just a portion of the 6.5. 

          During the past two to three years, the City of 

Cambridge has spent thousands, if not millions of dollars, 

and a massive amount of hours on, "Envision," a look at the 

development of the city of Cambridge for the future.  This 

took a lot of money, a lot of time and input from many, many 

people in the city.   

          However, in reality, this is really the third 

iteration since the 1980s and the original Fish Book and none

22

of these have really been actually used during a large-scale 

development.   

          We need to really take a step back, and we need to 

look at Envision and the Alewife plan.  We need to work with 

CDD, we need to look at the existing businesses that have 

been in the area for years, and we need to work with 

developers. 

          What we need to do is look at the entire 26 acres.  

What is the vision of this massive amount of property for the 

future?  What should be there?  We really think it should be 

a neighborhood, may be a library.  Maybe a PlayStation 

satellite, maybe a body of water with benches and gathering 

places for people and kids.  Who knows, maybe we could put a 

nursing home or congruent housing in there, intertwine the 

young with the old.  Possibly even a school.   

          Who should be there are families.  There should be 

families integrated with businesses.  This is our area, it 

belongs to the city, the neighbors, the businesses and we as 

a group, we want to do this right.  Let's not jump into 

something and we're going to be sorry for it later.   

          So I guess where I'm coming from is to relook at 

Envision, the Alewife plan, and in closing I'd just like to

thank you very much and we do look forward to working with 

everyone to a mutual ending.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Joseph Sultan.  You can unmute yourself and begin.         

          JOSEPH SULTAN:  Thank you.  Thank you, Madam Chair 

and members of the Board.  I just want to verify that I am 

audible?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.         

          JOSEPH SULTAN:  Great.  My name is Joe Sultan.  I 

presented in front of you guys or spoke in front of you guys 

about a year ago.  I live at 199 North Harvard Street in 

Boston, and how I relate to this is our family owns a half 

dozen buildings that as of this year with the acquisition of 

67 Smith by CC&F, we directly abut CC&F to the south now.  

Most of our buildings are on Spinelli.  We have had and 

currently have some properties on Smith as well. 

          This project, as I said a year ago, holds a lot of 

promise for our area.  We've been in touch with Cabot, Cabot 

& Forbes and the neighborhood group.  And we'd like to be 

respectful of the concerns of both, as well as protect our 

own property.  We've been there for 30 years now -- actually 

going back to the 80s, if we go back to some of the Smith

Street buildings that my father owned that we no longer have. 

          It's come up this evening.  Other speakers have 

mentioned it.  There were presentation materials.  There was 

some back and forth about a 50-foot no build zone.  That 

would impact our land quite severely. 

          In 2005, our setbacks were increased 25 feet.  We 

can live with that.  We can work around that.  That's not a 

problem, but doubling that would be difficult for us. 

          We abut residential and open space in the area.  So 

that's a concern that I voiced with both the neighborhood 

group and Jay and Jacob.  And we feel that the concern was 

heard by both of the abutters.  Literally in a physical 

sense, we are between the neighborhood and CC&F.  That was 

the one thing that we had a big question mark around, they 

heard us, we appreciate it.   

          We've been there a long time.  We're happy as IB-2 

landlords.  We're happy with the area, people that live and 

work around us.  We've always known change would come, and 

this is an exciting prospect.  

          To echo what the neighborhood group has said, 

nobody is against development in this area, it's old and it's 

worn.  The bridge, the amenity space, is something that our

tenants have been asking when it's ever going to come.  Their 

employees are clamoring for the. 

CC&F would raise the tide in the area if this is 

done the way that they're proposing.  We want to be 

respectful of the neighborhood group.  We've shared a border 

with them for a generation.  Their concerns are important to 

us.  We've lived quietly next to each other.   

But the area is due for change.  It's ripe for 

change.  It's what our tenants need.  They have other choices 

in Watertown, in Waltham.  We had a tenant go to Billerica.  

Trust me, there's restaurants that don't take 45 minutes to 

get to at some of these other sites. 

In summary, very quickly, we don't disagree with 

CC&F's development.  We'd like to make sure the neighborhood 

group is respected in the process, and we'd very much like to 

see the area develop as Ann said in the right way.  Thank 

you.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  And there's one more 

hand raised, which is Lee Farris.  I will say before we start 

just a last call that if there's anyone who's in attendance 

that still wants to speak, please push the, "Raise hand" 

button, I'm seeing some more hands.  If you're calling by

phone and you want to speak, press *9 on the phone.  So Lee 

Farris, you can begin with your name and address, please.

LEE FARRIS:  Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk.  Can you hear 

me?   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can, thank you.

LEE FARRIS:  Great.  I'm speaking for the Cambridge 

Residents Alliance, and I submitted a letter for us this 

afternoon, so I'd like that entered into the record.    

We want to generally agree with the concerns and objections 

raised in two letters from Doug Brown, which I included.  The 

letters were from September and from October, I believe. 

So there needs to be a maximum number of years -- 

we proposed 10 years to complete the project.  There needs to 

be a signed memo of understanding that nails down the bridge 

result.  And we think that the proposal still diverges from 

the Alewife plan in several important ways, and should be 

made to align with it.   

And with Envision, we would like to see more 

comprehensive zoning in the area, rather than creating an 

entirely new and untested type of permit.  So we welcome the 

changes that the -- the approach that CDD is taking.   

And we have additional concerns that include

ensuring that the proponent will support a future branch 

library or a fire station or other important public amenity 

located within the quad and that that proponent recognizes 

the city still needs to build the promised bridge at the 

other end of the quad.   

          We agree with the three concerns raised by the 

Planning Board that were cited in the CDD memo, and one of 

which is that the proponent should be required to include a 

bridge over the train tracks.  We want to specify that we 

think that that bridge should be able to carry a small 

shuttle bus. 

          Responding to the proponent's response to the CDD 

memo where they wanted to add commercially reasonable 

language, there if the city allows this, the zoning must 

specify the time that is meant by, "substantially delayed" 

and the lengthy amount of the financial commitment to a 

specific time benchmark, so that if the delay increases the 

cost of the bridge, the proponent will provide an amount 

adequate to complete the bridge at the time that bridge 

approvals are granted. 

          So the proponent's proposed amount of a flat $10 

per nonresidential GFA square foot is likely not sufficient.

The proponent asks that the zoning allow for a limited number 

of restaurants, et cetera.  If that is allowed, there needs 

to be specific limits on the amount of square feet, such as 5 

percent of the ground-floor or some other specific amount. 

And we oppose the idea of saying that the 

structured parking should not be subject to the ground-floor 

use provisions.  This is not at all in keeping with the 

Envision Alewife Plan.   

I hope you will take the opportunity to read over 

the letters from Doug Brown, and I hope that tonight the 

Planning Board will continue this case.  Thank you.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is Mike 

Nakagawa.  You can unmute yourself, begin with your name and 

address.   

MIKE NAKAGAWA:  Hello, this is Mike Nakagawa, 51 

Madison Avenue, North Cambridge, the other side of the 

Alewife area, on the other side of the T station.  You can 

year me, I presume?   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

MIKE NAKAGAWA:  I just had a few points that came 

up.  I wasn't actually planning to speak, but I do want to 

recall that 15 years ago the Concord Alewife study, shifted -

- we looked at how much should be developed in the Alewife

area, and there's a conscious shift to increase development 

near the T station and move it away from the Highlands 

neighborhood area -- that is farther from the T.   

And now that the Triangle is all built up pretty 

much, it's duplicitous I think to go back and say, "Well, we 

want to increase the amount that we intentionally moved 

before and say that the whole area should now be the 

increased allowances we made for the Triangle." 

And then noting that the more recent Alewife zoning 

looked for light industrial use to -- because we didn't want 

this to become just a whole big commercial space.  So there 

was an intention to limit the activity in the area to some 

degree, and not to restrict it entirely, but light industrial 

uses that people they employ were intentionally part of that 

I would also note that the bridge is in the wrong 

corner of the Quadrangle to benefit everybody.  While it's 

great to have a bridge, the people at other parts would have 

to walk backwards in order to get there and then walk back 

process.

If we used the amount that would -- of funding for

the bridge in that corner somewhere else, it would be much 

father along a bridge that would benefit everyone.   

          Of minimum, if we could move the bridge to follow 

along the south side of the tracks instead of the north side, 

they might be able to add a connection to it that's a little 

closer to other residents in the Quadrangle -- not residents, 

but occupants in the Triangle, whether they be workers or 

residents. 

          And I just want to point out the commercial tax 

rate of Cambridge is half of that of Cambridge is half of 

that of Boston.  Developers always complain of costs, so we 

don't really know how much this all comes together, but I 

would just keep those in mind when you're considering this 

proposal.  Thank you very much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  And Doug Brown is the -- 

I'm sorry, Doug Brown is the next speaker, if you can unmute 

yourself again.    

          DOUG BROWN:  Can you hear me, Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.    

          DOUG BROWN:  Hi, Doug Brown, 35 Standish.  You've 

previously received my comments on four separate occasions 

regarding prior corrections to this petition, and I would

begin by supporting past communications submitted by Green 

Cambridge and the Highlands Quad Committee.   

          Regarding the proposed zoning language, I'd 

strongly support the rewrite that was presented by CDD, 

because I think it addresses many of the loopholes that exist 

in the current proposal.   

          I would also raise the following concerns:  I think 

the zoning -- the approval, sorry, needs to be limited to 10 

units.  Any longer than that, and we run into problems with 

plans are no longer in keeping with our overall urban 

planning direction.  And we don't want to create another 

north point, which at last count would be 27 years from start 

to finish. 

          I'd say we also need a signed letter of 

understanding, mainly because we're still not getting a 100 

percent promise of a bridge, and in fact the latest 

application to the Conservation Commission includes site 

plans that don't even mention the bridge. 

          Given that they’ve now purchased four more acres, I 

think they should be required to provide a pro forma showing 

the value of the proposed upzoning, before we sign off on it.  

I'm assuming it would be enough to pay for a bridge.

          I'm also frustrated that they continue to disguise 

this as a property owners' petition, and they disguise it in 

the form of a citizen's petition.  And I think this does an 

extreme disservice to any citizen who's actually written and 

submitted zoning to your group.   

          Can someone please tell them to stop doing this?  

Honestly, it's embarrassing.  It's not -- and if they won't, 

then the citizens who signed the petition should be forced to 

stand up and actually present to the Ordinance Committee and 

the Planning Board. 

          Lastly, I'd say it seems problematic that we're 

already changing the zoning in Alewife before the Alewife 

District Plan has even been reviewed or accepted by the City 

Council.   

          And I have -- as a member of that study group, I 

have significant concerns about what this indicates for the 

future planning of the Alewife area, as it means that we're 

going to allow individual property owners to pick and choose 

what they want.   

          I also wonder that there's other zoning projects in 

the wings that have sort of been prenegotiated without public 

input.  Don't get me wrong, there's significant upside to

redevelopment in this long-neglected corner of West 

Cambridge, provided the developer in question commits to both 

good design and truly significant public benefits. 

          But without proper planning, I think any chance to 

create a great neighborhood will be lost.  And so, like other 

members of the Envision Alewife Working Group, I support 

limited upzoning in this area, but only when it's coupled 

with clear public benefits, such as bridges, libraries, 

public parks, open space, and proper streetscapes. 

          Thanks for your time and good luck with your 

deliberation.

speakers that had their hands raised.  I'll turn it back over 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you, Jeff.  

We will now move on from public comment to Board discussions.  

Board members, I am going to invite either questions or 

comments from all of you.  So if you want to virtually raise 

your hands, we'll kick off the discussion.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thank you.  Yeah.  I have a 

number of questions, either for Staff or for CC&F, mostly 

referring to the language in the proposed -- staff's proposed 

zoning text, which is way superior to earlier drafts that we 

were looking at, and they've gone very far in I think 

addressing a lot of the issues that we have raised.  But I 

still have a number of questions.  So I'll just go straight 

through them.   

          In the definition of "development parcel" where 

this is a definition of greater of three acres of 75 percent 

area of the lot or combination of lots, in existence as of 

August 27, 2020 and b) held in common ownership, the question 

is when does it have to be held in common ownership?   

          Is it at August 27, 2020 or whatever date we plug 

in there, or is that at the time of the application for this 

Master Plan?  I think that needs to be clarified. 

          I also think that it hooks back in later the 

definition of "development parcel" with the application of 

Section 20.95.111 as to what consists of the lot or the 

parcel when determining what can have increased FAR and what 

can have increased height.  That is not clear. 

          Going to -- the first time it shows up in ground-

floor tenanting and activation plan is the first reference to 

community- focused businesses, which I believe is better than 

the definitions of consumer-facing businesses, but I really 

don't understand why both Staff and CC&F consistently refuse 

to define the term. 

          Referencing the Alewife Plan, the Alewife District 

Plan, which I have read and reread many times now searching 

for definitions of community-focused businesses or consumer-

facing businesses, and they really don't exist.   

          And that creates a problem with the whole text, 

because it keeps referring to things that could be simply 

clarified by simply defining what is meant by either the 

community-focused business, or the consumer-facing business.  

It would clarify a lot of the ambiguities in here. 

          And throughout the rest of text, it flip flops back 

and forth between community-focused business and consumer-

facing businesses.  So I don't believe they were intended to 

be two different things, but the text has to be made 

consistent.   

          In Section 20.930.3 Master Plan approval, it says, 

"Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan 

incorporating all requested special permits."  I mean, does 

131

that mean the Planning Board is either going to have to give 

everything or reject the plan completely?   

          I assume that was not the intent, that the Planning 

Board would have the option to grant some but not all 

requested special permits? 

          You know, I think the reference in the plan as 

Staff has written with regard to the requirement to build the 

bridge is correct.  I do understand the issue of despite 

their best efforts, the MBTA might at the last minute say no 

for whatever reason.   

          I can understand wanting to try to address that 

issue, but it seems to me, you know, granting greater height 

and greater FAR and not ending up with the bridge that was 

promised, but with some money of whatever amount, that the 

city may not be able to use to build another bridge, it just 

-- you know, we're giving away -- you know, height and FAR, 

which I'm not necessarily opposed to.   

          But if there is supposed to be some sort of quid 

pro quo, it's unclear that the city would ever get what it 

intended to get.  And I think that really needs to be 

addressed somehow, or if not made 100 percent clear to the 

City Council that this is what they're agreeing to.

22

          That then leads into Section 20.930.4 about the 

additional FAR, and I don't understand the language as it 

relates to the provisions of 20.9511.   

          And again, I understand the desire to make 

reference to other parts of the ordinance as a shortcut, but 

in this situation, it is not clear what this is siting.  

Because it says, you know, the provisions of paragraph 1 of 

Section 11 may be applied to a publicly accessible pedestrian 

bridge.   

          You know, first of all -- I'm sorry, first it 

starts out saying, "the additional FAR applicable to public 

improvements set forth in Section 11 shall be applicable to 

the Quadrangle Northwest Development parcel and the 

provisions of paragraph 1 of Section 11 may be applied to a 

publicly accessible pedestrian bridge.   

          So is -- it seems to me there's a possibility of 

two bonuses being given; one for building the bridge, and 

under Section 11 you could get bonuses just for building -- 

just for giving an easement to allow for a bridge, or for 

building the accoutrements that would allow for a future 

bridge. 

          And so, I don't think that was what was intended, 

right now. 

to get it. 

height.   

133

but I think that language needs to be clarified as to what 

bonuses you get and for what purpose.  If, you know, Section 

11 was intended to apply to a lot of situations in this 

instance area, we're talking about one specific situation 

          And I think it needs to be made 100 percent clear 

as to what the bonus is for and what they have to do in order 

          Down in -- well, the issue of the height of the 

building.  You know, it's fine.  I too question why a stand-

alone parking facility should be granted the additional 

          If the additional height is to make it financially 

feasible to have light industry and community-focused 

businesses, they're not going to go into a stand-alone 

parking garage, and why should that parking garage get the 

benefit of the additional height?  If there was some other 

quid pro quo for that, then let's make it clear what it is.  

          And with regard to minimum parking requirements, 

this says, "Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be 

waived."  Other places through the requirements, it talks 

about, "maybe."  Was there a clear intent that there had to

be no minimum parking requirement at all? 

          The reference in the Section 6 about applicable 

yard requirements and limitations, again references the urban 

form and mobility recommendations of the Alewife District 

Plan as approved by the Planning Board.  Is that something 

that this Board has already approved, or is it intended to be 

approved in the future?  It is unclear to me what we're 

talking about. 

          Again, those are really my language questions.  But 

I also question the ability of other buildings in this area, 

which may be on noncontiguous lots, if they simply contribute 

some small amount to either the construction or the bridge, 

where if it's not constructed to money to pay for it at some 

unknown future time, why they all -- why those other 

structures also get the benefit of the FAR bonus?  It doesn't 

seem to me that that is appropriate.   

          Those are my comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you, Ted, 

for those detailed comments.  That was a lot to chew on.  

Hugh, let's turn to you next.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Well, I'm always in awe of my 

colleague, Ted Cohen, for his very careful and thoughtful

readings.  And I'm not operating at that level, shall we say.   

          I think this is a relatively modest change that's 

being asked for here.  And it's been explained as to why 

these changes would allow for a bridge, and would allow to 

accomplish the intent of the 20-foot-high ground-floor 

spaces. 

          So I don't think it's difficult to report those 

changes, because I think, you know, they're not terribly 

significant.  Yes, there's additional height, but it's at 

quite a distance from the Cambridge Highlands residential 

neighborhood. 

          I think I would support incorporating the responses 

of the Cabot, Cabot & Forbes to -- and the points were very 

convincing to me.  As an architect, I've certainly been 

involved with projects that have been unfinanceable and have 

not proceeded.   

          And developers try to avoid that situation, but I 

think here they're trying to -- trying to take their revised 

language, they're trying to provide something that is 

equivalent to the city that would be a fallback and that they 

really don't want to have to fall back to.  And if they don't 

have the language, they're not going to get up to the plate.

          The parking garage is a different kind of an animal 

in a commercial building.  Parking garages are not profit 

centers.  They're service spaces.  So to require the parking 

garage to do something very special that nothing in the first 

20 feet -- presumably not even ramps to get up above -- it 

doesn't make sense.   

          The -- what's happening with the parking garage in 

this site is that they are using an above-grade parking 

garage screened from the city side by apartments facing the 

railroad track and across the track, you know, hundreds of 

feet away facing the commercial building.  This makes the 

rest of the project more feasible.   

          And so, I think it's reasonable to not require in 

the parking garage footprint the light industrial space. 

          Now, I've been reading the various versions of the 

Cambridge Highlands Committee's reports and recommendations.  

And so, the December 8 memo -- is mostly about things that we 

would address during the Master Plan process.  And I don't 

think are appropriately in the zoning.  They're basically 

Design Review. 

          But I think they are -- some of them are certainly 

appropriate to have in a Letter of Understanding, a Letter of

Commitment, before the City Council passes.  That's become 

more common now when an owner comes and asks for zoning, the 

City Council responds and says, "And here are the public 

benefits." 

          And so, protections for Blair Pond, you know, I 

promise not to have a vehicle access to the Highlands over 

some defined period of time -- shadow studies, shadow 

impacts, property management, you know, site planting, home 

ownership, those are all studies that could be in the Letter 

of Conditions with the Council.   

          But I think we don't generally get involved with 

those.  We get involved with regulating zoning.  And I think 

that we have within the standards in the zoning the ability 

to respond to many of the design issues that are brought up.   

          So I guess this is a long way of saying I support 

this petition and feel that it is in fact ready to go to the 

Council.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh, just I want to 

clarify before I move on to the next Board member.  You're 

supporting the Staff version of the petition with the 

petitioner's changes as detailed in their memo response, is 

that correct?

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes, in principle.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, got it.  I just 

wanted to --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Obviously, we've been --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  There are so many 

versions of the petition going around right now, I want to 

make sure we're all talking about -- we all know which 

version is being supported.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  Who 

would like to speak on this matter next?  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I 

appreciate Ted's analysis and I also observe that he's coming 

in fresh on the second hearing, he didn't sit on the first, 

and that gives me an idea that maybe we should run two 

Boards, right?   

          Try to do one case and have a second inning and a 

second Board when it's fresh.  So I really appreciate his 

careful analysis.  I am certainly not working at that 

altitude either, at the moment.   

          Mr. Doherty convinced me in the first hearing -- 

and I don't remember when that was; a long, long time ago

that he was uniquely positioned and uniquely well suited to 

do deals with the MBTA and I understand the history of his 

development practice.  In fact, that’s proven.  For whatever 

reason, he has the magic fairy dust that has -- he has the 

ability to actually get things done with the MBTA. 

          And on the basis of that, I was swept up in a 

narrative around getting a bridge finally done connecting 

these two districts and ultimately the Red Line station at 

Alewife, and how important that is as a piece of 

infrastructure that this Board and the city has looked 

forward to for years and years and years. 

          And so it's a pretty simple equation for me.  I 

think that the zoning and the planning and the Master Plan 

process we might go through it absolutely facilitated by the 

construction of that bridge. 

          Now, I go further and say this:  We have the lowest 

tax rates in the Commonwealth, because we're a well- managed 

and fiscally stable city.  It's not the money, you know?  If 

we had the way to do it, this city's got the will and 

probably the money to build the bridge.  So we need Mr. 

Doherty's expertise to get this deal done. 

          And so, it's pretty simple for me: No bridge, no 

140

deal.  So we have to figure out a way, as Ted more eloquently 

put, the City Council somehow figures out some mechanism so 

he can finance his project, but we don't just get a pot of 

cash and an empty promise, we actually GE this bridge.  And I 

at this late hour after 15 hours staring at this computer on 

Zoom today, I can't figure out what that mechanism would be.  

But that's ideally what I would see. 

          Now, the revised zoning language to me looked 

pretty straightforward, except -- and acceptable, except for 

this one detail. And somebody smarter and with more rest than 

I could figure it out.  That's where I am.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Tom.  All 

right.  Other Board members?  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Well, I feel like I'm 

operating on a lower level than some of my other Board 

members, fellow Board members at this hour too.  But I do 

appreciate Ted going through all of this, because it is a 

great deal of detail.   

          So clearly any of the inconsistencies or questions 

that he has I think need to be answered before -- you know, 

as part of the recommendation to the City Council.  I mean, 

the answer I suppose could come now or at the City Council

meeting, but clarification is important. 

          I think I understand what Mr. Doherty is saying, 

and, you know, there is part of me that says, "yeah, no, we 

absolutely need a bridge.  So we shouldn't agree to anything 

that allows an out of sorts, because Tom is right, we don't 

need the money.   

          You know, we need the project to move forward, and 

if he has the capabilities of getting it done, you know, the 

trick is to figure out what he needs us to be able to do so 

that he can get his piece done, and the city gets what it 

wants.  And, like Tom, I don't know exactly what that 

mechanism is right now. 

          You know, but I can -- there is part of me that 

also comes back to the idea that the worst that would happen 

is that we would get a building that has an 85-foot height 

limit and additional FAR, but it's going to be for light 

industrial uses, which supports the whole notion of the jobs 

and the type of economy that we're trying to foster in that 

part of the city.   

          So, you know, I don't think I have my head wrapped 

around what this means for the rest of the area, and how all 

of these bonuses and everything play out vis-à-vis other

projects within the area.  And I'm not saying that I don't 

want the bridge.  I'm just saying that the -- you know, the 

worst case to me doesn't seem all that bad. 

          So I think I would at this point, in addition to, 

you know, clarifying the issues that Ted raised, I think I'm 

okay with the Staff's revision, with the language proposed by 

the proponent on the commercially reasonable efforts and the 

additional FAR on the other public improvements. 

          The one thing I don't really understand and that I 

have a problem with is the 85-foot height limit on the 

garage.  You know, I mean, again, think of goes back to our 

earlier hearing, where people were saying, you know, I mean, 

if we are really going to try to limit automobile use, and 

try to get people into other forms of transportation, you 

know, why are we going to be allowing for more parking by 

allowing for a greater height?  

          So I mean I -- that just doesn't make sense to me, 

but I'm perfectly content with the other paragraphs.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  You're welcome.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I've got Lou, 

Steve and Niko still to weigh in on this.  Who wants to jump

in?     

here.   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  This is Steve.  I'll weigh in 

very, very briefly.  I really have nothing of great substance 

to add.  I agree with the comments, and I support the change, 

but with one caveat.  And maybe it reflects a lack of perfect 

understanding on my part, and there's a lot to understand 

          But that is, my understanding is that as part of 

this development, and it's an essential, necessary part of 

this development, there will be the bridge.  And I'm not sure 

about all the mechanisms and the technicalities, but I would 

be very upset, I would feel betrayed. 

          I would feel angry at myself for supporting such a 

thing if I found a few years down the road that this 

development went forward and lo and behold, no bridge. 

          So I will leave it to those of you who are more 

attuned to the details and the ins and outs of this matter.  

But certainly, I want to express my unqualified view and 

expectation that the changes that we are recommending here 

are, you know, with the understanding -- at least from my 

perspective -- contingent upon the understanding that there 

will be the bridge.

          By the way, I care about the bridge.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks for clarifying 

that, Steve.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou, would you like to 

go next.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Sure.  I kind of agree with 

Ted.  There still seems to be a lot of ambiguity into some of 

the clauses in here. I do have a question for Mr. Doherty, 

though.  If you had a crystal ball, what kind of a timeframe 

would you think if everything went right that you could be in 

possession of the permits and acknowledgements to do this 

bridge?   

          JAY DOHERTY:  I can tell you that my resolve is to 

produce it in 24 months.  We need about one year of 

cooperation with the MBTA.  There is a lot of integration of 

construction and design.  That's kind of the hard thing to 

understand here.   

          So, you know, we think we might be able to do one 

thing if we can put piers and podiums here, or can we really 

put them between the tracks and make them work?  

          I have built over a live rail maintenance yards,

it's doable.  It's a little tricky.  The difference here is 

we have traveling diesel commuter trains.  So you start 

thinking about crash barriers and stuff like that. 

          I think within the year we will be able to achieve 

the design.  The actual construction process, however you 

want to do it, whether you want to do a trust system on site, 

or do some prefabrication, I don't think that's -- that's not 

where the -- that's probably a little bit less than a year.   

          So I think two years is reasonable, and we want to 

get -- we need to get into real detail beyond the schematic 

plans.   

          We need to work with Miguel and his team.  But we 

want this bridge open, so that it opens before any building 

project.  You know, you take a CEO out onto a site and you 

say, "there's going to be a bridge."  Well he's, you know, 

you get the reaction that you get.  "I've heard about it for 

40 or 50 years; I don't believe you Jay."  

          If he sees it in construction, that's a different 

story.  And that's the objective I'm aiming for.  And we'll 

get there.   

          The -- what we're talking about is the kind of 

stuff that, you know, when some lawyer for a lender from

Chicago calls and says, "I don't understand what's going to 

happen if you get refused by the MBTA," and I try and 

persuade them the MBTA isn't going to refuse this, refuse us, 

he doesn't care.  So he gives the lender a lot of grief and 

they turn to us.   

          So it's really mechanistic.  I appreciate if you 

appreciate it, and I further appreciate that yes, a lot of 

what John and the Highlands are talking about, what all of 

you were talking about, that's a product of the Master Plan 

and the special permit.  And we welcome that.  And most of 

what John and his colleagues were talking about, those were 

things that we're prepared to do. 

          And on our own part, for the special permit of our 

site, we're comfortable with the 50 feet.  Other projects 

will have to take that on with their special permit.  That's 

why we asked the staff not to mandate it for everybody in the 

area.   

          But I'm enthusiastic about this.  I think it's 

going to be a great thing, and we will prepare it so it can 

handle shuttles.  And I want to get after it.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thanks.  And by the way, the 

prints you used on your cover sheet I'm fairly familiar with

-- Storrow Drive over to the Esplanade.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I just got done with it.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  Yeah, it's beautiful.  It's 

beautiful and Rosales, Miguel -- Rosales and his partners did 

that bridge.  It's a great model for us.  It has a lot of the 

same characteristics.  That’s what we're looking to create, 

and Miguel and his team are on board to help us design this.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yep.  You clarified a lot.  I 

just didn't know if we were talking about a decade or five 

years, two years.  So that's why I wanted to clarify that.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  This is -- as soon as we know what 

we're building to in the envelope of the project, which 

includes this zoning, we hit the gas pedal.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Gotcha, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Niko?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I don't have anything further to 

add.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  So 

for my part, I think Steve represented my sentiment on this 

pretty well, in that I feel like we need to end up with a 

bridge here, and other folks have noted that we're not sure

what that mechanism looks like to ensure that we end up with 

a bridge and not a payment. 

          But it sounds to me in listening to the comments 

from my fellow Board members that this Board is prepared to 

forward a positive recommendation for the Staff text with 

revisions, some of which are from the CC&F memo, some of 

which are the clarifications and definitions Ted has 

suggested or requested. 

          And I guess I want to kind of dig down into are -- 

do we want to note -- do we want to recommend the CC&F 

language for addressing the bridge, or do we want to note 

that the Board feels it's very important we end up with a  

bridge, and the CC&F language is one way to address that, but 

we stop short of recommending it for fear we end up with a 

payment, not a bridge?   

          I guess that to me seems to be the big, open 

question that there isn't real unanimity about.  Do Board 

members have reaction to that?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  We need to end up with a 

bridge.        

          MARY FLYNN:  I think -- this is Mary -- I think 

that I would prefer to not recommend one way or another on

that particular --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.         

          MARY FLYNN:  -- language.  I think, you know, again 

it's sort of -- you need somebody who's really kind of expert 

in sort of law plus real estate financing to really, I think 

understand what the variety of mechanisms might be.     

So I don't think it's really our area of expertise to craft 

language.  So I think crafting the intent as opposed to the 

language is more what we should be sending to the Council.  

And they can seek advice from the Law Department or whoever 

they think they need to.  That would be my opinion.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  We could 

certainly -- Ted, let's get your input.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, in response to your query 

--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I think this CCF language does 

not guarantee a bridge.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Given everyone's best 

intentions, it just does not guarantee it will happen, but 

would allow the additional height and the additional FAR

without the bridge under certain circumstances.   

          And I may be okay with that, as long as City 

Council knows that's exactly what might happen.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  You know, I agree with Steve 

that I would be very upset and offended if there were no 

bridge, since the entire proposal has been premised on their 

ability to get the bridge.   

          It may be that if the bridge were not a question, 

the 85-foot height and the additional FAR might make sense in 

and of themselves to guarantee light industry and the 

consumer-facing spaces, but that's not what has been 

presented to us so far.  

          And if, you know, I just want the City Council to 

know exactly what is being proposed to them, and what they 

might end up with.  And then they can make, you know, their 

political decision on what they're willing to trust or what 

they're willing to live with.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  You know, from a planning point 

of view, we've wanted a bridge for so many decades.        

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

151

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And I agree it's not in the 

optimal place, but, you know, I'm willing to accept that the 

city has been unable to get it where the city wants it, and 

if Mr. Doherty and CC&F can get it at this locale, then even 

if it's second best, it's a great option.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.                 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  May I say some more?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  There was a little piece in Mr. 

Doherty's -- one of his comments, where he describes standing 

with somebody who wants to build a building and sign a lease 

for a building to be built, and saying if the guy doesn't see 

the bridge or they do not see the bridge under construction, 

he's not going to be able to get the guy to sign up for a 

          I think it's even more important for the housing  

bridge.   

--     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- being 10 minutes' walk from the T 

station is one thing, and 30 minutes' walk is very, very 

different.  So it's essential for his development that there 

be a bridge.  And so, he's really got a lot of skin in the

game.   

          And I think he's -- Tom has mentioned he's got a 

terrific track record, being able to accomplish these things.  

But the fact that we want a bridge is only part of it.  He 

really, really needs the bridge for his investment in the 

land don't make sense.  And that, I think is as strong a 

guarantee as you can get.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Steve?     

          [Pause]  

          Steve, you're muted.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sorry.  Yeah, I would only chime 

in briefly with your last comment, in that I certainly agree 

that an owner/developer's financial interests is the best 

assurance that something will be done.   

          I don't necessarily agree, however, that having 

that bridge is essential to the viability of this project 

from the developers' perspective.  It's certainly desirable 

for many reasons, but I don't think it's essential.   

          So I would not want to be relying purely on the 

developers' financial incentives to build that bridge.  I 

would want to build more of our own requirements and 

expectations and requirements that that bridge get built.

          If we did not think that that bridge would be 

built -- I don't know, just thinking back to the process, I 

think it's possible that we would not have been quite as 

forthcoming and supportive about some of the other changes 

the developers have proposed, and that we are now 

recommending.   

          I think the bridge has always been an essential 

part of our hopes and expectations here, and I'm not sure 

exactly what the mechanism is or should be, or what the 

Council will do with that issue.  But I wouldn't rely solely 

and entirely on the developers own internal financial 

motivation.  I don't think that that's enough.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So I think what 

I'm hearing is that the Board is somewhat divided on this 

issue.  And I think perhaps we should advance a 

recommendation that reflects that; that says that, you know, 

the Board as a whole is in general supportive of the CDD 

text, but notes that CC&F has suggested some alternative 

language.   

          And that the Board is divided on it because -- for 

precisely this reason; that there is both in terms of the 

bridge and whether or not it needs to be required absolutely

in the zoning or not, there is division within the Board.   

Do Board members generally feel that that is -- I 

mean, you know, this is ultimately a political decision that 

we can -- to Ted's point, you know, as long as the City 

Council understands the implications of agreeing to CC&F's 

decision, or CC&F's language, it is Council's decision as to 

whether or not to make it mandatory…

Does that seem like a reasonable way to proceed?     

STEVEN A. COHEN:  Well, it is their decision.  It's 

up to us make a recommendation.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I just don't 

think we -- I mean, we probably do have a majority to just 

forward the CDD language without CC&F's revisions, based on 

what I'm hearing.  I guess my question is, do we want to do 

that, or do we want to reflect that there is some division 

within the Board?

STEVEN A. COHEN:  When you say there's division, 

are there members of the Board who would be satisfied with 

this development going forward without the bridge?    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I believe I heard that 

that is the case, yes, that there are Board -- and please 

correct me if I'm wrong, but I heard that there are Board

members who are supportive of the zoning, even if we end up 

with a payment in lieu of a bridge.

MARY FLYNN:  So I think my position is, again I 

would -- I definitely want the bridge.  Don't get me wrong.  

I really, really want the bridge, I think it's going to make 

the entire area work or go a lot better.   

But I don't want to make the zoning so restrictive 

that it -- you know, throws the whole project out, right?    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.

MARY FLYNN:  Because the alternative of what you 

can do as-of-right doesn't seem to be in the best interest of 

anybody.  You know, either the neighborhood or the 

developers' point of view. 

So, again, I mean, you know, having grown up here 

it's sort of hard to say.  I mean, I worked on the Fish Book, 

okay years ago, right?  So, you know, I've been looking for a 

bridge for 40+ years, right?  So it's hard for me to say 

this.   

But again, I think when you look at the types of 

jobs the city is trying to encourage, and if we end it -- if 

all we ended up with was a project that gave us some of the 

types of jobs that we're looking for -- again, I don't think

an 85-foot height limit and a little bit of additional FAR is 

hugely problematic.  But I agree that that's not what we're 

striving for. 

          So I think Ted is right.  It's just that you have 

to just sort of lay it out that these are kind of the choices 

to be made.  Our preference is that we do everything we can 

to get the bridge without killing the project.   

          And whatever mechanism we need for that, somebody 

has to figure it out, but clearly none of us can figure it 

out this evening.  So I don't know.  I hope that clarified, 

but --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  And that was 

what I heard, Mary.  And I guess -- and I don't think you're 

alone in that.  Hugh, am I correct in thinking that is more 

or less where you fall on this question as well?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'd say my -- it's -- I'm not 

entirely aligned --      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- with my colleague.  I think that 

without the bridge, the development won't go forward in the 

form it was presented to us.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And so, -- but we have the ability 

to put language in there that can kill it.  And we have to 

avoid that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Well, if I could just chime in 

briefly -- you know, if we say that the bridge is essential, 

you know, then that makes a clear statement and to some 

extent, you know, holds the developer's feet to the fire.   

          If it turns out that it is impossible, infeasible 

financially unrealistic -- whatever it is, well then, he'll 

come back to us and tell us that, and persuade us of that, 

and we will make a change, an appropriate change so that an 

appropriate development can go forward. 

          You know, people aren't going to run away and do 

nothing.  But I think making a clear unqualified statement at 

this stage that this bridge is essential is important.   

          I don't think there should be such an easy out of 

writing a check.  "Here's a check, now I don't have to build 

a bridge." I would rather not give that option right now and 

-- as I say, you know, if circumstances change, we'll deal 

with it later.   

          There will always be a project here, but we should

be very clear about what our preference is at this earlier 

stage.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I'm going to have to 

agree with Steve on this.  We need to give Mr. Doherty two 

things:  An incentive to work as hard as he can to get this 

bridge, and a little bit of motivation from us when he goes 

to negotiate this that Cambridge really wants this bridge.  

     And I don't think -- like -- I agree with Steve, 

writing a check at some point to cover this is not really 

what we want.  If that was the case, then they should be 

brought it to us this way.   

Either the political side of the world wants this 

bridge or they don't.  And right now, they told us, "We want 

the bridge," so. 

I hate to put too fine a point on it, but it's the 

bridge.  And I don't think the people in the area of the 

development are really willing to give up all their sky and 

so forth for not getting the bridge.  I think they are 

willing to make a little bit of a sacrifice if they got this 

bridge in the area.   

So a lot to be concerned here.  The City Council's

got to know we want the bridge, or do they want the bridge?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Iram, you wanted to 

weigh in?   

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Yes, thank you, Chair.  Just one 

thought, and I'm not sure that this is necessarily going to 

unstick the impasse, but one thought might be to suggest that 

the Board does recognize that there is a challenge in terms 

of getting a project financed if there is this sort of 

uncertainty related to the zoning, or to the execution of the 

project. 

an easy out.   

          But perhaps the financial contribution could be 

sufficiently significant that it would be -- that it would be 

          You know, I think the concern that Board members 

are raising is that we wouldn't want to have something that 

feels like an easy out, and there's not a number that's 

articulated, and it's appropriate for the Council to be 

figuring out what that number ought to be. 

          But the Board could certainly suggest that that be 

a substantial enough figure that it's not going to be easy to 

-- that it's not going to be a preferred option.   

          So that's just one thought.  The alternative, of

course, is to provide the recommendation that notes that the 

range of discussion that the Board is having.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, Mr. Doherty is raising his 

hand.  I don't know if you want to.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I was -- sorry, 

I see you, Mr. Doherty.  I am just wanting to make sure that 

I hear from any Board members first who want to offer 

thoughts on this.  Okay, Mr. Doherty, why don't you go ahead.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  I just wanted to be clear that we 

were not seeking an option to liquidate our efforts to put 

the bridge in place.   

          What we -- we understand that when we come back to 

the Board with a Master Plan and special permit, that the 

Board will be making a judgment on whether or not our efforts 

and our progress is sufficient, and therefore going to yield 

the desired result. 

          So the language that we offered could be 

strengthened, but we're not seeking to have optionality.  

What we are simply doing is trying not to create a situation 

where the ability we need to have now, which is to make a 

significant investment in planning the bridge, it's probably 

161

22

a seven-figure investment to figure this out and get it done, 

here that can be hindered now, because of essentially making 

us the guarantor of the bridge.   

          We're not looking for optionality, we're not 

looking for the ability to write a check, we're trying to 

create a mechanism that is recognizable, that's been used in 

other localities.  I think it's even been used in Cambridge 

that is a go to hell scenario.   

          And I don't expect it to take place.  Particularly 

the more we partner with the city to work with agencies like 

the MBTA, I very much doubt it will take place.   

          But I don't want to create something where our 

ability to deliver to you is hindered by not recognizing that 

the financing that provides the funds has to be financing 

that's achievable and making us a guarantor of the physical 

delivery is a little bit challenging for financing purposes.   

          But we're not looking for optionality, we're not 

looking to simply show up at a Planning Board hearing for the 

special permit and say, "Ah, forget it." The Planning Board 

we think will be sitting in judgment of us.  And we intend to 

be fully credible when we're making the kind of progress you 

would expect we would have to make when we come up to the

special permit.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Ted?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I assume everybody's good 

faith in this, although do want to protect the city from 

somebody at some point in time not acting in good faith, or 

deciding that it's easy to take a different out. 

          I guess one way out of it is to have language 

following on what Mr. Doherty said that if a bridge becomes 

an impossibility, for whatever reason, that CC&F has to come 

back to the Board to make a determination of that 

impossibility, and then may allow the additional height and 

the additional FAR for -- on other terms. 

          And perhaps it's writing a check to the city, or 

perhaps it's, you know, putting in a public park or a fire 

spot for a fire station, or any of many other things that one 

could imagine that would justify changing the zoning. 

          You know, that's a way to get around I think our, 

you know, sort of loggerheads right at the moment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, just to clarify, 

though, if we're going to make that kind of substation, 

wouldn't it need to go to the City Council for them?  We 

could make the determination if it was impossible, but in

terms of what would be substituted, doesn't that have to 

essentially be a Council action?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, perhaps it is -- 

ultimately becomes an amendment to the zoning.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Although maybe -- I don't know, 

we get into, you know, a lot of planning issues of -- you 

know, if we try to amend -- excuse me -- you know, this 

petition right now, to set up a whole, you know, different 

categories of things that might be accepting -- I mean, it's 

not like the, you know, in the getting the -- the pathway.  

It was clear.  You know, "We'll give you the path and you'll 

give us this different zoning."     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And so, here it's been proposed 

all along, "We'll get you the bridge and you give us this." 

And now we're hearing, "Well, we need this one, you know, 

option in order to get the financing."   

          And I don't dispute that that may be true, but, you 

know, I'm just trying to -- you know, brainstorm on certain 

ways to get -- to move this along right now, other than 

simply saying, you know, "It's the bridge or nothing, and if

you can't get the bridge, then you'll have to come back to us 

and we'll amend things."  And maybe that's where we have to 

end up, if we and City Council feels that it is indeed the 

bridge or nothing else.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Sorry, at the risk of sounding 

like a broken record.  But I mean, the moment the Council 

invokes the zoning, the value of this property goes up 

immensely.   

          And, you know, to Mr. Doherty business is business.  

He may want to trade the property at that point.  I mean, 

that kind of stuff happens. 

          So, you know, my long speech about how he's an 

important mechanism here:  Again, I think that the City 

Council and the Ordinance Committee have to figure out what 

the mechanism is here.   

          I think the Board -- my sense and my fellow Board 

members is that, you know, it's very important that we get as 

clear an incentive to get this thing done.   and I believe 

what Mr. Doherty is saying, that he's trying to get it done. 

          And I think Iram was onto something.  You know, 

let's come up with some short-term mechanism that keeps his

feet to the fire and go from there.  And he's right.  He has 

to go through another hurdle, right?  He'll have to show up 

here for his first project with a special permit and when 

he's empty-handed and telling us a longwinded story about 

how the T's impossible, we're not going to want to hear it.  

          [Laughter] 

          So I guess there's that other check and balance of 

whoever owns the property coming up next.  That's my -- I 

think we're ready to --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- essentially send that sentiment 

to the -- and maybe we're, you know, masters of the obvious, 

but send that sentiment to the City Council.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, I guess I'm just 

at this point trying to get a handle on what that sentiment 

is that we're framing, and whether or not, frankly, we've 

articulated enough for Staff to write up.   

          So Jeff, let me ask you that question.  If I had a 

motion now to forward a positive recommendation for the Staff 

text, but reflecting the discussion the Board has had 

regarding the Bridge and the various mechanisms to 

incentivize and/or guarantee it, would that be something that

you felt like you were equipped to do?  Or do we need to hash 

it out further?        

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Putting me on the spot here.  I 

think that there has certainly been a lot of discussion.  And 

with this amount of discussion, I'm sure we can come to -- 

you know, to put it together into a narrative that reflects 

the different views expressed by Planning Board members.   

          I think it's -- you know, it sounds like the tricky 

part here really is in the -- just the mechanics of how it is 

supposed to work.  It seems like the majority of the Board 

has the view that the bridge is really an essential element 

of the planning for this area.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And there's some different 

viewpoints about the mechanics or the extent to which as part 

of this zoning proposal it should be, either there's --  

     I guess there's a range of views about -- you know, 

from very strict, and if it can't happen and it -- something 

else will have to be negotiated to something more creative 

that would provide some way to satisfy the developer that's 

here's needs, as well as providing the city with the 

assurance that it needs in order to ensure that it's going to

You know, this will, as was pointed out, this will 

be a broader discussion of the City Council to make that 

determination of tradeoffs, and what's the ultimate public 

be completed. 

benefit.   

So I feel like the -- while it's true that Board 

members have been express different views, I think it's part 

of kind of a maybe a tapestry of the narrative that looks at 

this issue from different angles, but ultimately seems to 

maybe it'll be emphasizing the importance of the bridge for 

the planning of the area. 

So I think I can -- I think I can do that, and 

certainly we'll send it to the Chair for review.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Is -- I guess the one question that 

I would note, there are some of the other -- some other 

requests that were made by the petitioner, and I wanted to -- 

there was some discussion of them, but maybe not a conclusive 

discussion on all of them, so --   

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  I'll just kind of spin through 

quickly.  So other contributions to the bridge, I think Ted

mentioned this -- that this was something that was in the 

original petition, which I didn't -- or at least one of the 

prior versions of the petitions that I don't think we focused 

on very carefully.  It was left out at the CDD draft text.   

          But essentially that would expand the FAR bonus 

that's available for -- and it was originally intended when 

it was -- the zoning was adopted in 2006 for, you know, 

physical accommodation of the bridge, in order to get that 

density bonus.   

          The proposal would expand that really widely across 

the district, and could be achieved with a funding 

contribution, and I think while there's -- we discussed, and 

I think while there's logic to having contributions from a 

variety of sources, and that's actually what was recommended 

in the Alewife plan, the Alewife plan didn't recommend 

spreading that 0.25 FAR bonus probably across the area. 

          So it's something that, you know, we have a bit of 

a concern with.  Again, not that it's necessarily a bad idea, 

but it's something that we hadn't really studied or planned 

for. 

          So that was one point.  And I don't know if others 

-- I think Ted indicated some concern about that.  I don't 

169

know if others on the Board had differing views about that?    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I would agree that I 

would prefer to limit the FAR to 0.025 FAR, to the one site 

that will have the Master Plan.  How do other Board members 

feel?  Does anyone disagree with that?  Let's be efficient 

about this.     

[Pause]  

No one's disagreeing with that, Jeff.  So I --  

JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- would say we are 

not recommending that revision.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  I appreciate the clarity.  On 

the garage heights, I think there were some mixed views that 

were expressed, and we talked about this with the CC&F folks 

as well.   

I think the one thing I would point out that was 

maybe more compelling to me than the argument about the 

garage or the points made about the garage is that fact that 

I believe under their plans, it's proposed to be a 

residential building with a garage attached to it, and the 

Alewife plan didn't anticipate having those kinds of light 

industrial uses in a residential building.

So that's just one thing I would point out.  But it 

sounded like there were some Board members that had some 

other concerns about just the garage height in general.  

Yeah.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I think I heard 

concerns -- and maybe I'm just projecting my own views on 

this, but I heard concerns about a stand-alone garage being 

allowed to be 85 feet.  If it were part of a residential 

building, this Board member at least would be more amenable.

MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  I was one of the people who, 

yeah, was concerned about the stand-alone, but I don't have 

the same objection to 85 feet if it's associated with the 

residential building.  So.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  So if that's the consensus of 

the Board, and you can -- I would like to give you a chance 

again to see if anyone --   

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

JEFF ROBERTS:  -- disagrees, but we could 

communicate a favorable view that, you know, noting that it 

would apply to a residential -- if it were to apply to a 

residential building, the height could be acceptable, but not 

-- and not have to require the and industrial use of the

ground floor, it could be another use --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- residential or retail kind of 

use.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  Does anyone -- 

do any Board members object to that?     

          [Pause]  

          Seeing none, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Hugh.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Again, something Mr. Doherty said 

sparked a thought in my mind.  So how do -- we want to have 

the garage, the bridge.  Do we have to have the bridge 

physically at least, before we vote the Master Plan permit?  

I don't think so.  So there has to be some process of 

convincing us at the time of the Master Plan permit that the 

bridge is going to happen. 

          I think that's -- and if they can't convince us 

that -- they can't make that argument at the time they come 

before they come before the employee, then I think we have to 

rethink the whole development.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  But I think it doesn't have to 

physically be there.  They come and they say, "Okay, we got

this agreement, we've got the design, we've got the budget, 

we commit to paying for it," that's fine, you know?    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.

HUGH RUSSELL:  So I think maybe the language of the 

Master Plan and the bridge are intertwined, in that we make 

to make a finding or it could be a Master Plan permit that we 

are convinced that the bridge is going to happen, but that it 

doesn't have to be there.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I -- oh, Ted, 

do you want to weigh in on that suggestion?     

H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  I agree that it doesn't 

have to be there, and the proposed language says that the 

Master Plan can incorporate conditions that will ensure its 

completion.   

And what I was going to say when you were 

discussing it with Jeff is that -- but the language that CC&F 

has proposed said that provided that if the proponent 

demonstrates that despite commercially reasonable efforts, it 

can't satisfy such a condition, the project shall be allowed 

to proceed upon payment.   

Now, if we changed, "allowed" to "maybe" -- the 

project "may be allowed to proceed" from, "shall be allowed, 

173

" that puts it back into the purview of the Planning Board to 

make a determination whether without the bridge that the 

payment would be satisfactory to allow the project to go 

forward and the Master Plan to go forward. 

          So that's a simple change.  It may still create 

some problems for Mr. Doherty getting his financing, but I 

think that's a simple way to get around a lot of the things 

we've been discussing about.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So okay.  So Jeff, Mr. 

Doherty, did you have something you wanted to add?   

          JAY DOHERTY:  I just wanted to agree.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JAY DOHERTY:  The language -- we're not as much 

wedded to the language as to giving the Planning -- as to not 

binding the Planning Board by rigid language in the zoning 

petition, that they cannot -- that you cannot make that 

judgment, that you cannot apply your criteria, that you 

cannot come to a decision. 

          So what Ted is talking about I think is in the 

spirit of what we're trying to do, is -- the language is 

spongeable to how you do it.  And I think that works.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Jeff, did we

have one more --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- provision in the 

memo we needed to see whether or not we were forwarding a 

positive recommendation on?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  The one last piece was about 

the request that restaurants and coffee shops and similar 

uses, ancillary type uses, could be allowed at the ground 

floor of these buildings, rather than exclusively the light 

industrial and types of uses that are envisioned in the 

Alewife plan. 

          And it came up in public comment, but I don't know 

if it was discussed by Planning Board members.  We talked 

about it a little bit.   

          I think one of the points that was raised in public 

comment was a similar point raised at the staff level, which 

is that it suggested a somewhat open-ended and it might be 

reasonable if the Board wanted to recommend that to have some 

kind of limitations around it, so it didn't completely 

displace the intended use.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So this is the 

suggestion that -- instead of just light industrial, that 

175

22

some amount of the ground floor use could be used for 

ancillary restaurants or coffee shops, et cetera. 

          Do Board members want to allow that?  Allow it with 

some limitations or stick to, "If you're getting this height 

bonus, you must use your ground floor for light industrial 

uses"?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I like the restaurants.  I think the 

proper regulation is come up with, you know, enough square 

footage to do the appropriate number for this particular 

Master Plan.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And it might be, you know, a few 

thousand square feet.  And I don't know what the number is, 

but --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Right.  Some ratio.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I'm hearing that 

people are amenable as long as the amount of the square 

footage devoted to such uses is limited, and that we do still 

get actual light industrial uses out of the height bonus?       

          COLLECTIVE:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  I would agree with that.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.       

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I agree with it in principle.  

I'm a little bit skeptical about getting light industrial 

uses here, but it's certainly an aspiration and a goal.  So 

I'm all in.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  There's a lot of extra FAR 

and height here.  I hate to say it this way, but should there 

be some kind of onerous per square feet payment to the city 

if they -- as mitigation if they can't provide this bridge? 

           I know we say we don't want the money, we want the 

bridge, but at some point, I don't know where the carrot and 

stick end.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  And I think 

that was what Iram was suggesting -- that essentially that 

while, you know, the Planning Board would not only have to 

make a finding that, you know, that the bridge was 

practically an impossibility, but that there would be a 

payment that was large enough to make it not an easy thing to 

ask for. 

          Whether that's calculated on a per square foot 

basis or otherwise I think is -- or how big that number needs

to be should be part of City Council's negotiations, and we 

can -- I think it is appropriate to note that to the extent a 

payment is possible, if the bridge is an impossibility, we 

would like to see that number be high enough that it truly is 

going to be an impossibility before anyone is seeking to make 

that payment.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  High enough to be extremely 

painful, but not so high as to kill?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Correct.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Right.  Just onerous.     

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  All right.  

We have given Jeff and his team quite the drafting challenge 

here, but I'm going to make our job a little easier by 

suggesting that we forward a positive recommendation subject 

to all of our discussion this evening, the various tweaks, 

clarifications and recommendations and variety of Board 

points of view that have been discussed.  Is there a motion 

to forward such a positive recommendation?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  It's Tom, and so moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Lou, second.    

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right, Jeff.  Roll 

call vote.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Louis Bacci?   

178

LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?

H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Mary Flynn?

JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?

TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Niko Bowie? 

NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes. 

JEFF ROBERTS:  And Catherine Preston Connolly?

CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.

[All vote YES]   

JEFF ROBERTS:  So that's eight members present 

voting in favor.

very much.  And thank you Board members for everyone's really 

thoughtful discussion on this.  It is a sticky issue, and one 

I know we all care a lot about.   

          And I appreciate the time and energy everyone put 

into discussing it fully.  That does conclude the business on 

our agenda.  Are there additional comments from staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I would just say on that last one, 

not to backtrack, but the -- you said it several times, but 

I'll say it one more time for good measure, it's a 

recommendation based on the CDD drafted language with the 

noted recommendations regarding the provisions in the CCF, 

so.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, that's correct.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  All right.  Board members 

have anything additional to add?     

          [Pause]  

          Nope/Then the meeting is adjourned.  Thank you all.       

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you, good night, bye.
