Overview of Partnership check-ins 

 

Context 
• 

The purpose of the check-ins is to strengthen direct 
connection between CBAC and each Partnership, and 
understand where each Partnership is and how CBAC can be 
helpful moving forward 
CBAC understands that the world has shifted dramatically in 
the past 7 months, and recognizes the severity of the crises 
we are living in, including the impact on nonprofits, their staff, 
and the people they serve; amid these crises needs have 
shifted, and implementation plans/strategies have changed 
CBAC funded very different kinds of Partnerships, and 
Partnerships may be in very different places – CBAC is seeking 
to understand how partnerships are now approaching their 
work and how timelines may have changed 
CBAC wants to be in partnership with Partnerships to help 
them meet their goals, even as these goals may become 
further modified  
CBAC still needs to bring definition to all of what it expects the 
Implementation phase to entail, and hearing from 
Partnerships will help; this includes considering what will be 
required to receive Year 2 funding 
CBAC and Partnerships may benefit from comparing 
Partnerships’ previous (pre-Covid) plans and their revised 
plans from Spring 2020

CBAC’s Expectations 
• 

CBAC sees these as conversations in which it is 
seeking to listen and learn from Partnerships to 
inform future conversations, decisions, and 
supports; CBAC is open to hearing what 
Partnerships need, even as CBAC is unsure how it 
may respond  
CBAC wants each Partnership to succeed in 
Implementation, and recognizes that we need to 
be in ongoing communication and hear honest 
feedback to learn/understand where each 
Partnership is and how to help 
CBAC knows that Partnerships are all at different 
phases in the development of their Partnerships 
and in their progress toward/ in Implementation, 
and CBAC is looking to view each Partnership in 
light of its own respective timeline/ phase 
These conversations will provide CBAC with 
information and insights that will complement the 
data HRiA is collecting

Impact of Covid on families  
• 

Covid is hitting families very hard – and concrete ways that this project has supported families, including connections to 
referrals, other supports 
All of the needs from the Needs Assessment have been worsened by Covid, and Covid has really dramatized and 
strengthened the view of inequity that we face; deeper needs related to Needs Assessment have been made more obvious 
and strong; critical role of Partnerships in responding to enhanced struggles and needs, their ability to pivot, be flexible, 
have human touch, and scrambling to just keep up 
Each of these Top Tier Needs impacts the others – if one is impacted, impacts the other; the pandemic reinforces 
interconnection of Top Tier Needs, and has a multiplier effect for families – they are much more deeply impacted; interplay 
of those Top Tier Needs will make it harder for families to move in the direction we intended, and demonstrating the 
impact that we had hoped for may take that much longer  
If you add hunger/ food security, pandemic has reinforced that the Top Tier Needs are still the needs that families are 
struggling with; deepest needs that families have remained the same 

• 

• 

• 

•  With the Needs Assessment, a lot of the things that were lower tier needs are playing into this in very real ways – e.g., food 
security, reliable childcare/ kids not in school further exacerbates different needs; single parents are in real crisis right now, 
and some parents don’t want to send children anywhere right now  

•  How elevated mental health aspects have become in this moment; that didn’t feel like linchpin of all Partnerships in 

January and now it is 

o  Most Partnerships felt challenged to tackle mental health from the outset given lack of services pre-Covid; are 

there any specific actions CBAC could take to support that focus moving forward? Lack of services could be a 
barrier to meeting goals 

• 

Reaching the financial security goals are going to be much harder and timeline for doing it will be much longer; when a new 
Needs Assessment is conducted, it may be that the financial security piece emerges much more strongly 

•  We are charged with doing periodic Needs Assessments – and similar needs will exist likely exist, if not be amplified  
 
Partnerships’ response to Covid and support for families   
• 

Fact that Partnerships are so different from each other feels like such a strength; the way different Partnerships have built 
themselves, even though so challenging, provides opportunity to see different ways partners have been built and are 
operating 
Partnerships – some strong partners before, some came together in order to apply – opportunity to learn about different 
strengths and challenges that Partnerships face because of that contrast  

• 

•  Hard and uplifting to listen to Partnerships – hard because of struggles, and uplifting because of what they have actually 

• 

• 

been able to do and the amazing work that nonprofits are doing  
Really heartened by different kinds of interventions we have heard about – some that already were in place and some put 
in place, the ways Partnerships are handling volume of services and delivery in different ways  
Partnerships’ pivot from moving families forward to stopping them from going under; what does that mean for CBAC’s 
expectations? 

 
Timeline for Implementation 
• 

• 

Thinking about our timeline generally and to the extent that Year 1 is still getting up to speed, could the timeline be 
extended beyond 3 years? When do we think about a Year 4 – is that after Year 2? After Year 3?  
Partnerships seem to be in a different place then they anticipated – and in terms of spending of money, Partnerships are by 
and large billing out and will have run through year 1 funding by the end of the year 
As Partnerships are seeking more money and more time, may require revisiting of logic model 

• 
 
CBAC’s role now and moving forward: What should CBAC consider about its role? What support(s) might CBAC provide to 
Partnerships moving forward?  
Use of Community Benefits Funds   
•  Might we consider another round of emergency grants – potential for modest round to help more nonprofits, especially 

given confusion and uncertainty around more stimulus funding; is another round really a possibility?  

o  We don’t know yet – possible tension around a round for nonprofits generally and a Year 4 for Partnerships; City 

staff is looking into it 

• 

Is there anything CBAC can do around services that are so in demand/ needed – i.e., mental health? Anything CBAC can do 
to advocate for/ remind people of the need for mental health services – both paying for them and increasing availability?  

 
CBAC’s role making connections/ referrals  

City of Cambridge                                                                                                                                                                    cambridgema.gov

• 

From vantage point of the Department of Human Service Programs, because the City itself delivers some of the same 
services – e.g., employment services, supporting people around paying rent if they get behind – is there a way in which the 
City can connect with Partnerships and make them aware of services/ opportunity for warm handoff? Did we miss the 
opportunity? How might the City help Partnerships, and support them in realizing services like this?  

o  Could be referral to Partnerships, could be Partnerships adding another partner  

•  Opportunity for deeper connection between City and nonprofit organizations? Amid crisis, how do City and nonprofit 

organizations work together to address needs of community?  

It is tough to structure warm handoff – takes a lot of time/ energy/ relationships  

o  Provide clarity about what City can do to support Partnerships/ families, and what a handoff could look like 
o 
o  CBAC can lift up the intention to help build the connection, not that CBAC is doing or supporting the handoff  
o  CBAC can facilitate knowledge that may be available through Partnership-related services, and HRiA is capturing 

that information in a way that could be useful to other Partnerships 

o  CBAC could facilitate connections/ sharing/ meetings between Partnerships on particular topics– e.g., discussion 

about intensive virtual case management 

• 

As a connector/ referral – how to connect in ways that are mutually beneficial and strengthen both nonprofits and City 
services – opportunity and complexity/ struggle; would need to go about with care, that has folks at the table in a way that 
makes sense  

o  CBAC can help Partnerships connect with and learn from each other, and also respond to interest in being 

connected to other organizations that may be able to help staff understand best practices for staff in a virtual 
world  

•  Needs Assessment – Partnerships could provide great apparatus to reach families directly 
 
CBAC’s role with services 
•  What role does CBAC have in making more services available from scratch? Or is our role as more of a connector/ referral 

vs. creator role vs. advocate and exposing dramatic need - people are aware, but may not know the extent of the problem  
CBAC is not in the position to create services – yet if there is a real glaring need, CBAC could support provision of technical 
assistance to Partnerships   

 
CBAC’s role with communications and advocacy 
• 

CBAC can be an advocate – e.g., look at mental health in a much more holistic way, including healing through the arts/ 
churches  
Advocacy entails any role of convening and helping facilitate discussion, further collaboration, amplifying of needs and 
messages  

o  Any time CBAC is learning from nonprofit organizations/ hearing from families and then going back to the City, 

that is an important advocacy role  
It makes sense for CBAC to go to City Manager, less clear about going to City Council  

o 
o  Also, advocacy around funding – could CBAC be making case for more money from business sector downstream? 

Should CBAC be advocating for more community benefits money during budget process?   

o  CBAC can help ensure community benefits funds are distributed equitably 
o  CBAC can use the resources we already have in place to make the case for why funds are important and the value 
of collaboration – that is why we invested money in HRiA/ evaluation, and the Needs Assessment is another way 
to amplify 

o  CBAC members could use the channels they have available to them – e.g., Ellen/ DHSP reports to City Council 

annually; Paul reports back to MIT folks that are involved 

• 

o  Can we do a better job telling developers and business community how important these Partnerships are?  
CBAC should consider how we are reporting out in a more structured way – think about the ways we use all of what is 
happening and what we learn moving forward  

o  Thinking together with Partnerships whether through continuation funding and/or additional funders 
o  With vacant business community seat on CBAC, opportunity to both share the benefits of Community Benefits

funding and find someone that could be connector for others moving forward  

•  Needs Assessment – Partnerships could provide great apparatus to reach families directly 
 
Draft of potential parameters for Year 2 renewal 
Year 1 review –  
1.  Identify key successes and lessons learned  

Year 2 intentions –  
1.  Provide an overview of what the Partnership and its 
service delivery model – including virtual service 

City of Cambridge                                                                                                                                                                    cambridgema.gov

2.  Identify how many families/ clients the 

Partnership served, how, and who they were; 
if different than the Partnership’s original (or 
Spring 2020 revised) plan, indicate how 
3.  Identify how the Partnership employed CBAC 
resources; if different than the Partnership’s 
original (or Spring 2020 revised) plan, 
indicate how 

delivery – will look like in the months ahead/ for the 
year, including how the Partnership intends to 
integrate its learnings from Year 1 

2.  Identify the number of families/ clients the 
Partnership expects to serve in Year 2 

3.  Identify how the Partnership anticipates using CBAC 

resources in Year 2 

Reactions:  
•  Year 1, number 2: In addition to services to families, also hear about goals, how they have been modified, 

and what happened in meeting of goals  

•  Given what they are struggling with, would there be any benefit to delaying running through these 

questions?  

•  We should keep schedule for Year 2, and be asking for data that we feel critical to get – balance of 

understanding what nonprofit organizations are going through right now and asking for what we need/ what 
is essential – and is not interrupting service delivery  

•  For Year 2: reiterate/ be clear that it is okay that plans have shifted/ changed   
• 
•  While there may have been delays and/or shifting in staffing, large portion of funds have been going to 

If there are remaining balances, helpful to allow some flexibility to roll over any funds 

staffing in order to shift and continue to provide services  

 

II.  Next Steps 
 

Committee Chair & membership –   
• 
• 

Lisa Peterson is here through January; City Manager has asked Ellen Semonoff to be Chair, and she has accepted 
Advertising for new members through 12/4 – openings for a resident and a business representative; potential for 
involvement from existing members in interview process 

 
December meeting, including HRiA presentation  
•  HRiA update: In process of administering 2 surveys that focus on partnership- and systems-level; HRiA has received all but 2 

submissions –  

and then compare in future years 

o  These are intended to collect baseline data as best we can, to help inform us how partnerships are doing right now 

o  Asked 1 person from each partner organization to complete both surveys 
o 

Social network survey (“Partner tool”) – is validated/ standardized, widely used in different fields/ sectors to 
assess how partners work together, allowing for greater confidence in tool and results  

o  Organizational capacity survey – focuses on outcomes and indicators specified in overarching logic model – focus 

on maximizing specifics for each partnership 

o  HRiA expects to have synthesized learnings from social network survey approximately 1 month after receiving all 
completed surveys, and can begin to look at organizational capacity survey by partnership upon completion by 
each partner  

In the 4th quarter of year 1 (i.e., early 2021), HRiA will begin qualitative data collection
