WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.”

F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction 
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion, 
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine 
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a 
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible

Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

ORDERED: 

WHEREAS:  With summer fast approaching, parents of school-age children are 

The Governor recently ordered the closure of all schools and childcare 
centers through the end of June, with remote learning for school-age 
children through the end of the academic year; and 

Uncertainties remain over how deep into the year cancelations and 
closures due to the covid-19 pandemic will last in Cambridge, and the 
closures of our public schools, youth centers, and after-school 
programming have hit local families with school-age children 
particularly hard in recent months; and 
 

seeking clarity as to whether summer camps, youth centers, and youth-
centered programming will be available this summer, and what 
contingency plans the City may be offering in the event that these 
camps and programs must be scaled back or altered due to the 
covid-19 pandemic 
 

These programs, which are currently closed, might be able to open 
sooner than schools, and may be able to counter the learning losses 
likely from the extended closures, and will be instrumental in beginning 
to address the loss of school year programming as well as summer 
learning loss; and 
 

 

Any opportunity to provide summer learning opportunities in a safe 
manner will be important to address achievement and learning gaps, 
especially for our most vulnerable students; now therefore be it 
 

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the 
Assistant City Manager for Human Services and other relevant City 
personnel to determine whether summer camps and youth-
programming and the Mayor’s summer youth program will be allowed 
to proceed this summer, to put together contingency plans for 
Cambridge youth in the event that these programs must be scaled 
back or canceled due to the covid-19 response, and to report back to 
the City Council and the community on this matter in a timely manner;

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

Social Distancing in Harvard Square

I was advised to write to this address with my proposals regarding social distancing in Harvard Square.

I am writing in the hopes that you will address the particular problems that densely populated areas, such as Harvard 
Square, pose to the project of social distancing.

Social distancing is, at this time, the single most effective way to combat COVID-19. Maintaining the full six feet of 
distance with others is impossible in Harvard Square because it is so densely populated during the day with people who 
come to hang out and make purchases from the numerous eateries. Even now, during the Stay at Home Advisory, social 
distancing is not happening in Harvard Square. This is troubling to me because I am a resident there. I live on JFK Street. I
am not able to leave my apartment to take a simple walk and be safe at the same time. 

My proposals:
1) Block off all parking spaces so that people can move into the street in order to maintain six feet of distance. (I got this 
idea from the great work that is currently being done in densely populated parts of Boston.)
2.) Instate fines for unmasked "car loitering" with the windows down. Fines are the only thing that works. When wearing 
a face mask was mandated only about half of the people in Harvard Square wore masks. Now that the fines have gone 
into effect about 70 percent wear them. 
For those of us for whom the lockdown has meant an increased workload with fewer resources to accomplish that work 
and less pay, it can be baffling to see how many people are simply not working at all. Unfortunately, Harvard Square has 
become a lockdown destination site where people sit in their cars for hours chatting in their seats. This is a problem 
because pedestrians can find themselves just two inches away from an unmasked person who is siting in a car. There 
needs to be a fine instated for unmasked "car loitering."
3.) Instate a fine for caretakers of children who bike unmasked in Harvard Square. I never used to see small children 
riding their bikes in Harvard Square but now I see it all the time. These children often are not wearing masks (but they 
are over 2 years old) or sometimes their masks are flying in the wind around their necks as they breeze down the 
sidewalk. I think that child-biking on sidewalks should be prohibited in Harvard Square. The children simply quickly get 
too close to pedestrians not only endangering others but also endangering themselves and whomever they go home to.
4.) Close a number of streets in the area entirely, including especially Memorial Drive, in order to create a safe walking 
path for residents. There is simply too much car traffic and foot traffic even now under lockdown and with unpleasant 
weather. As the lockdown is eased and the weather improves, I cringe at how densely populated the area will be. We 
need to act now. I don't think that the lockdown should be eased at all, especially given that many places (including 
California) have had much stricter lockdowns and with good results. Easing up a lot for them means looking like 
Massachusetts at our strictest. (It's no wonder Massachusetts in particular has such a high death rate for this disease.)
But if big business really must get its way here (as it always does), we must take measures to counteract that damage. 
Closing streets is a good start. 

Please help make Harvard Square safer. Thank you for your consideration of these proposals.

Sincerely,
Angela

Dear City Manager,

Ari Ofsevit <ari.ofsevit@gmail.com>
Saturday, May 9, 2020 5:46 PM
City Council; City Manager; Clerk
Please revisit decision regarding Memorial Drive

I continue to be concerned that the City has decided, based on the "advice" of a "panel of experts" (despite no such 
advice or expertise being put forth) that the City continues to keep Memorial Drive's Riverbend Park closed citing 
concerns about virus spreading.

As you know, this park was set aside by the legislature in 1985, and the power to close it lies with the City Council, not 
the City Manager:

SECTION 3. The metropolitan district commission is hereby authorized, upon receipt 
of a request to that effect from the city council of the city of Cambridge, to 
suspend on any given Sunday the prohibitions as set forth in sections one and two of 
the use of motor vehicles on Memorial Drive in the city of Cambridge. 

Thus, the council order asking for it to be opened should reign supreme here, not the word of the Manager. If the City 
Manager wishes to keep the park closed, he should contact the legislature to change the state statute. It is quite clear 
that opening the park would not pose a threat to public health, and that by allowing people to better disperse, may 
allow for positive outcomes to overall public health. The Council has directed that it take place. State law is on the side 
of the council. If the City Manager feels that there is a legitimate threat to public safety, he should go before the Council 
and present his case to them, not act as if the power is vested in him to make this decision. According to state law, it is 
not.

While at first there were legitimate concerns, it is now quite clear that few infections spread out-of-doors, and if so, only 
between people close together. Riverbend Park is an active parkway: it is rare to see people staying still or near each 
other there. If you are interested, here is a good primer on how the virus spreads from a professor at UMass. Simply 
jogging near someone is unlikely to spread the virus (but giving even more room is better). Getting people outside is 
better than people staying inside, where they can spread the virus to each other.

If the City's advisory panel does see the need to keep the park closed, they should offer formal guidance as to why. This 
should not be "the City Manager is afraid of someone taking a photograph with a telephoto lens" but should be based in 
science. It's also worth noting that despite their qualifications, this panel might not have the time or expertise to focus 
on this sort of issue, but that a professor from the Harvard School of Public Health (here) and if that isn't good enough, 
here is another article quoting experts from Harvard, BU and Johns Hopkins.

I look forward to speaking about the resolution of this manner with your office on Monday.

Thank you,

Ari

Memorial Drive

Memorial Drive is regularly closed to create Riverbend Park. While traffic volumes have decreased and the need to 
safely spend time outside while maintaining distance from others has increased, the City of Cambridge and Mass DCR 
have refused to take advantage of this opportunity to close off the roadway and allow people, who are already cramped 
in the normal park area along Memorial Drive, to get the fresh air and space they need.

The DCR has seen great results closing roadways elsewhere in the Greater Boston Region, why not here in Cambridge? 
Where is the leadership? Cities around the US and the world have closed off roads to give people more space. As this is a 
roadway that is already regularly closed for this purpose, this seems like the lowest hanging fruit, and yet, the city 
continues to fail its citizens.

Please put forth the effort needed to close this space off, and other roadways throughout the city, to give residents the 
much needed space to exercise. All of these closures would be very cheapo and quick and if problems arose, could be 
changed just as easily. There is no reason to not at least pilot this. Just look at the successes in Seattle and Oakland.

Dear councilors and city manager,

Please accelerate street openings for residents in Cambridge

I learned depressingly today that, yet again, the city and DCR have chosen to keep Riverbend Park closed to pedestrians 
for the upcoming two Sundays. I am confused by the continued lack of action on the city's part with regards to closing 
streets, now that the city council has twice passed orders asking the city manager to pursue closing streets—whether 
that be Memorial Drive or streets throughout neighborhoods.

The justifications provided by the city manager in the past (and keep in mind that we've been kept in our houses and 
apartments for two months now) has been that if we open streets, 'excessive gatherings' might occur. In the meantime, 
the following cities in the United States have introduced programs to open vehicular lanes for pedestrians, and/or create 
slow-speed shared streets to discourage through traffic. These closings have been undertaken safely.

Many thanks for your time.

I am boggled by the fact that the city continues to act as if it's normal to continue asking pedestrians and cyclists to 
constrain themselves to our six-feet sidewalks, even as we are supposed to "social distance" at six-feet distances from 
one another. I am also boggled by the fact that we haven't taken advantage of the positive experiences in other cities to 
make the daily lives of people just a little bit happier, without putting them in danger. Please take action.

The City Needs to Open Streets to Pedestrians

Dear City Manager and to whoever else this will apply to:

I am a long-time Cambridge resident of Central Square living in a condo building with no central air conditioning and no 

outdoor space to speak of, similar to many of the living situations in this city. I and everyone that I know of in my 
building have been wearing masks and practicing social distancing as best we can in this town of tight sidewalks and few 
areas of green space, but it is near impossible to maintain at least 6' from other people just walking to the grocery store, 
going for a mind-clearing walk, or trying to find space to exercise. I encourage the City Manager to get out and walk 
around any of the Squares, the park in front of the library, or the Charles river path to see just how difficult social 
distancing really is at the moment.

I know the City Manager was tasked by the City Council to look at closing Memorial Drive and other streets for these 
purposes, but up till now there has been absolutely no action, and in fact even the short section of Memorial Drive 
usually open to pedestrians on Sundays has been kept close for "safety." I find this incredibly short-sighted and 
unresponsive to the needs of our citizens. By keeping all the streets for automobiles only, people here are forced to walk 
in busy streets to avoid other passers-by, or simply ignore the 6' social distancing advisories that are posted in stores all 
over Cambridge.

Other cities all across the country including New York and indeed the world have already closed miles and miles of 
roads to automobiles for weeks. Even nearby Brookline and Watertown have found more room for pedestrians. The 
weather is rapidly getting warmer and more and more people will be needing to escape their small apartments, and as I 
said most of us are not lucky enough to have yards or the car necessary to escape to more rural areas.

I ask that the city manager take the council's request and the safety and health of Cambridge's residents seriously by 
moving with haste to shut roads to traffic. An obvious starting point would be to immediately work with DCR to close 
Memorial Drive. It is obviously not necessary for automobile traffic in this current environment and it is plenty wide to 
easily enable social distancing. Currently, people are walking on the river path, which is increasingly crowded and too 
narrow to keep 6' from passerbys. To continue to do nothing in this moment is to further endanger the people of 
Cambridge.

Sincerely,

Pete Septoff
Hancock St.

I am writing to ask you to protect the health and safety of my family and all Cambridge residents by not weakening the

If you are driving your car, you use a seat belt. Even if there are no cars around.

If your child is biking, she puts on a helmet. Even if there are no bikers around.

If you must go outside during a deadly pandemic, you wear a mask. Even if there are no people around.

Because too many people are getting sick.

Because too many people are dying.

Re POR 2020 #107

Dear Councilors:

Carolyn Magid
71 Reed Street

It is outrageous that the official Twitter account of the Cambridge Police Department was used for someone’s 
personal political commentary. Twitter is a public medium. The public has a right to know how 
Superintendent Albert has been disciplined and how we can be sure that the problem has been corrected. I 
urge you to support Policy order #107.

Hello,

Best,

Eric Fritz

I'm a resident of Cambridge and I'm writing to say I support POR 2020 #107. Everyone needs to be accountable for their 
conduct, especially people charged with upholding the law. It's important that Cambridge Police Superintendent Jack 
Albert faces consequences for using a police department twitter to attack the people he's supposed to protect.

Hi Councilors --

- Frank

Following up to say I support POR 2020 #107 and glad to see the council is considering action here. Thanks for your 
leadership!

Hi Councilors,

I'm sure you have received other emails about this, but I think the city needs to ensure that whoever in the police 
department who used official police communications to make an aggressive political statement is 1) fired and 2) their 
name released so we know they are no longer affiliated with the city in any way.

I generally think the Cambridge police department is pretty good by most objective measures, but it has had a huge PR 
problem for as long as I've lived here. I think a lot of the scrutiny probably stems from the 2009 Gates incident that got 
national coverage, but now every year I read another news article about police misconduct. This is an opportunity to fix 
this.

The reasons why this tweet is such a huge problem are 1) most residents of Cambridge are the "liberal fucking jerks" 
whom the tweet attacked, and those residents probably won't feel comfortable knowing there may be a police officer 
out there who is armed and thinks this way about the people they are supposed to protect, and 2) we're in a disturbing 
era where there are riots in places like Michigan by armed right-wing thugs, and we need to be sure that our law 
enforcement officers are not going to take sides based on politics.

Please act decisively to show your constituents what strong leadership looks like. I know that the city has layers of 
bureaucracy that sometimes interferes with swift action, but you know as well as I that if you want to make something 
happen you can make it happen. If you think there is a better but equally strong option than what I suggested, please 
do that.

By the way, my brother was fired from a public service job for something similar when he was much younger. I love my 
brother, and I felt really bad for him, but I'm glad it happened because I think he is a better person now. That incident 
definitely influenced my feelings about whether or not anyone should ever be given leniency for stuff like this. (They 
should not.)

Sincerely, a "liberal fucking jerk,"

A Plan for Public Communication in Cambridge, MA, During the Coronavirus Pandemic  

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention trains epidemiologists in a program known as the 
Epidemic Intelligence Service. One of its core principles is that “a pandemic is a communications 
emergency as much as a medical crisis.” [Charles Duhigg, New Yorker magazine, May 4, 2020] 

The City of Cambridge has begun to meet the communication emergency but much more will need to be 
done to guide, inform, and keep the confidence of the public over the course of the pandemic that 
seems sure to last at least a year and possibly much longer.  The situation will evolve over time, there 
will be new medical information, and guidance will change as activities are resumed and the number of 
infections falls or rises.  

I am proposing a three-part plan to supplement the City’s current communications with residents and 
the public about the pandemic.  It would not require universal broadband access and could be rapidly 
activated. 

1.  Streets, Sidewalks and Public Parks 

60-100 large-screen television displays in windows of public libraries and storefronts in strategic 
locations (e.g., pharmacies, banks) showing a 3-5 minute “loop” of public service videos, such as from 
the CDC, current local guidance, bulletins, and alerts. These can be kept current as the guidance changes 
and will build awareness of the need for everyone to “stay tuned” and on the same page. 

Small yard signs, such as those used by political campaigns, in parks and other open spaces with 
location-specific guidance. Installation at access points and other high-visibility locations will ensure 
general awareness of guidelines and awareness of alternatives to activities that should be avoided. 
Relatively low-cost but durable signs can be replaced as guidance changes. The City of Somerville is 
using such signs in neighborhood parks. 

2.  Local Press 

 
Public health advertisements in the Cambridge Chronicle and Cambridge Day with the text of email 
bulletins and reminders of current public guidance. Not only would regular advertisements reach off-line 
audiences, including many elderly, their placement would support local reporting on the many other 
aspects of coping with the pandemic crisis. Newspapers are among the most vital local businesses and 
deserve public support. 
 

3.  Expert Briefings 

Regular public briefings by the Public Health Commissioner and other health and medical experts with 
Q&A. One possible model for this is the informal off-the-record briefing that Broad Institute CEO Eric 
Lander held with over 250 local residents by Zoom last week. The public is and will remain hungry for 
current information about the pandemic and what we should be doing, and local experts need to hear 
from the public to provide reassurance and correct misinformation on a regular basis.

For the foreseeable future, until a vaccine, effective treatment, or widespread immunity are developed, 
every citizen, every resident, everyone is on the front lines and has an important role to play in 
combatting the virus. In order to do this they will need trustworthy sources of information that will 
change over time as normal activities resume in stages, the number of infections declines or rises, and 
treatments improve.  The three elements of this plan can help to keep every resident informed in a 
difficult and uncertain period.

Policy order 107

I am writing to express my support for transparency on the discipline the police officer who wrote the offensive tweet 
will face. I was especially saddened and angered when the officer was revealed to be a superintendent. It confirmed the 
opinion I had of our police department from many years of living in Cambridge. The contempt in which they seem to 
hold the residents and political leaders is disgraceful.

I don’t know how you change such a culture and the current commissioner seems to be trying but without transparency, 
we have no idea.

Policy Order POR 2020 #107

I was very distressed to learn that an offensive and partisan tweet referring to Rep Kennedy by name and Senator 
Markey by inference appeared on the Cambridge Police Department Twitter account. I understand this was meant for a 
personal account and was taken down. However, I think such a Tweet is unbecoming of a public servant. I am therefore 
writing to urge you vote yes on POR 2020 #107  requesting that City Manger work with the Policy Department to provide 
information to the City Council about what disciplinary action has been taken as result of this incident and to provide a 
report on how social media protocols for the official Police Department account and officers’ personal accounts have 
been revised as a result of this to prevent future incidents.

Below is a link to the Policy Order.

Dear City of Cambridge,

I am scared of the police. 

Michael [Kel] Monroe <michaeljeremymonroe@gmail.com>
Monday, May 11, 2020 4:35 PM
City Council
City Manager; Clerk
Why I strongly support POR 2020 #107

And I'm a clean-cut white 44 year-old law abiding citizen small-business owner that brought literally millions of 
dollars into the Cambridge & massachusetts economy.

But it's because I have literally seen Cambridge police officers literally screaming, SCREAMING like a drill seargent 
through an open car window at a short woman who was just making an understandable traffic error in a complex 
construction-screwed intersection - and all she wanted to do was ask a clarifying question.

She was yelled at and insulted, violently.

Her kids were in the back seat.

I have seen this sort of behavior a truly unfortunate number of times so that, for one person (me), it suggests a 
pattern that is TRULY disturbing. It suggests a baseline of utter bitterness, a level of just-on-the-edge-of-boiling for a 
LOT of officers.

You KNOW, dear readers, that it wasn't always like this. How did we get here?!

Departments love to say "one bad apple," yet the data suggests (as with any organization) that it's about the culture 
at large. The truth is, a rotting barrel spoils almost all the apples, and the ones that aren't are the shining 
exceptions.

The amount of incidents I've seen just while driving and walking and biking around Cambridge for the last 10 
years horrifies me. It makes me NEVER want to call the police for ANY reason. 

OK, I get that police officers are not necessarily paid to be nice and are not T-Mobile customer service agents, right? 
Oh wait...why do I have that perception? Have I been bullied into thinking this?  

Hold the phone - once upon a time, police officers were EXPECTED to have a HIGH LEVEL of ability to interact, 
dare I say this -- in a CARING way with the people they protect and serve. This doesn't emasculate them. This 
doesn't mean they are any less savvy, intelligent, nor does it suggest that their ability to be "tough" when the 
situation justifies it is somehow lacking.

Some of the most inspiration police officers in the past (whether in higher up positions like the superintendent, or a 
beat cop) were AMAZINGLY wonderful people. They cared - they never let their feathers get ruffled. They had good 
humor. But when I look at the Cambridge Police Department, from the top to the bottom, I see a whole pack of 
ruffled feathers. I actually see men (to be perfectly frank, it's always been men when I've observed these things) 
who seem like powder kegs on the verge of explosion.

Isn't it interesting how sayings like "To Protect And Serve" being stencilled on patrol cars has diminished as to 
almost not exist anymore.

Isn't it interesting how cops look more and more like the military.

3.17.a

Isn't it interesting how adversarial the relationship between the police and the policed has so often become.

Isn't it oh-so-coincidentally interesting that there has been a lot of verified racism and bigotry among a WAY-TOO-
HIGH number of staff in police forces throughout our nation. Cambridge, sadly, seems to be no exception to this.

Once, you had to actually live in the town you policed in. You had to be a member of the community - live with and 
be among the people you serve everyday. run into them at the grocery store, the library, at the park with your kids.

What the H-E-Double-Hockey-Sticks happened to that?

I get this is long-winded. I'm sorry, but the amount of time it takes a police officer to hurl vitreol at a traumatized 
pedestrian takes up a lot of "long-winded" space in their consciousness forever after things like this. You read a 
Tweet like the one in quesiton? Your faith in your public institutions notches lower, and lower....

It leaves a mark. Most of us feel like we're about to be abused when we have a run-in with a police officer. When 
they're nice it's like, "Oh thank f*****g GOD they were actually OK."

And lowest.

So do I support POR 2020 #107?

Yes, yes I do. I think the standards for everyone - EVERYONE involved in law enforcement needs to be about 5 
flights of stairs higher in terms of caring, in terms of emotional intelligence and an understanding of psychology, in 
terms of screening for those who have a palpable JOY at yearning to serve the communities they're part of, while 
also possessing all the usual requirements in terms of nuts and bolts.

Being UTTERLY DEVOID of any evidence of racism & mysogyny and hot tempered-ness is actually NOT ENOUGH. 
They need to share, in their own words, why they are PASSIONNATE, UTTERLY passionnate about those issues 
and how they have no place in a civil police department in this day and age.

I am so horrified by the Cambridge Police, and indeed the default level of fear for ALL police is truly sad. I didn't 
grow up feeling this way, but this is bad. Cambridge, PLEASE DO SOMETHING about the bigger problem.

It's time to dispose of the rotten barrel. This needs more than a band-aid solution. This one action is TINY compared 
to the titanic problem under the hood of this broken down car, and that problem is the philosophy and process 
involved in hiring the kinds of people who make up law enforcement at large.

I hope you feel the gut punch of how terrifying a human being wearing a police uniform has become.

To whomever is reading this, thank you.

For the love of God this doesn't go far enough.

Sincerely,
Michael Monroe

As your constituent, I'd like to register my support for POR 2020 #107. I found police Superintendent Jack Albert's 
comments despicable, and personally, I think he should be fired. No one who believes things like that should be running 
the Cambridge Police department. At the very least, the public should be aware of what action is taken to address 
this issue.

In support of Policy Order #102 re Mask mandate

Dear mayor, councilors, and city manager,

I support clarifying the mask mandate (Charter Right #1, POR 2020 #102).  I strongly support requiring people to wear 
masks.

Changes from the manager’s policy that I would like to see:
1. A graduated schedule of fines, with a written warning for the first offense, and a lower amount such as $25 or $50 for 
the second offense.  I would want police to offer a re-usable mask at each offense.

2. Gather and report to the Council on demographic data on enforcement, including race, age, unhoused, etc.

3. Require masks to be worn in public spaces indoors. Outdoors, people should have a mask with them which must be 
worn when distancing is not possible.

4. Align the policy with the state policy.

Lastly, I would like written clarification on what the enforcement mechanism is.  If a resident sees a gathering of people 
without masks in a public area, should they call the police, 311, do nothing, or something else?  What should a store 
employee do if someone enters without a mask? 

Could the city create a way on SeeClick Fix to report situations where people are without a mask?

Could the city print and distribute signs for storefronts saying that masks must be worn inside?

Also, I would like to understand why I am seeing police cars parked near parks or in Central Square, but I do not see 
officers walking around and talking to people about masks.

Sincerely,

Lee Farris

Comments at council meeting tonight

I support restaurants using street space for outdoor seating because it could help them make up for some of 
the lost revenue from smaller occupancy limits due to physical distancing requirements.

I also just wanted to add that earlier today Boston and Providence announced they are looking into this as well 
as other street layout changes like widening sidewalks to allow for physical distancing. Cambridge should 
seriously consider these ideas and other changes to its streets to do what it can to address the needs of 
people and businesses during the pandemic.

Cambridge City Council 
Cambridge City Hall

Cambridge, MA  02139 
 
 
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Members of the City Council: 
 
I am writing to you regarding Policy Order #4 (POR- 2020 #107) and to offer my support of 
Cambridge Police Superintendent Jack Albert. 
 
I have known Superintendent Albert my entire life.  He was born and raised in Cambridge.  A 
CRLS graduate, he always aspired to serve his city as a police officer.  He trained, studied and 
worked hard to obtain a positon with the Cambridge Police Department.  During his more than 
30 year career he rose from patrol officer to Superintendent of Police and all along the way 
earned the respect of his fellow officers and the members of the community he serves.  
 
I am here asking that the Council recognize that he made a mistake with regard to use of the 
CPSD twitter account but his entire career should not be judged based on this one instance.  As 
soon as Superintendent Albert realized his error, he took immediate responsibility, spoke to his 
supervisors, and apologized to his fellow officers and the Cambridge community.  In addition, 
he made calls to both Representative Kennedy and Senator Markey to apologize for his 
remarks, and his apology was accepted by both men.   
 
No one should be judged based on one mistake and I hope you look at his entire 32 year career 
and the good he has done for this community.  Therefore, since this is a personnel matter, I ask 
that the Cambridge City Council allow the city manager and commissioner to follow the 
appropriate laws and policies regarding internal disciplinary matters and not make this a topic 
of further debate.  
 
Sincerely,

Melissa Ludtke, 30 Buena Vista Park, May 11, 2020 
 
Tonight I am speaking about Covid-19 in light of the City Manager 
update. Let me begin by thanking you as City Councilors for your 
steady hand in steering us through this unprecedented time in a 
pandemic. 
 
While the present circumstances call on us to respond in ways that most 
of us didn’t anticipate, so, too, does our obligation to shape a livable 
future for our children. 
 
Little about our Covid return to daily lives will be normal, nor should 
they be. Medical experts caution that a return to normal endangers all 
of us, 
 
This we know about Covid-19. 
 
But as Cambridge envisions its post-pandemic future, will you, as our 
representatives, show foresight and demonstrate courage in weaving 
into your policy prescriptions the essential awareness of the dangers 
posed to all of us by inaction or even slow action on climate change? 
 
Just as returning to normal isn’t an option with Covid, it isn’t an option 
with climate change. 
 
Virus-like, the temperature rises as by-products of burning fossil fuels 
invade and threaten human existence in progressively consequential 
ways. Covid puts in stark relief racial and class inequities, and science 
reminds us that exposure to miniscule air pollutants leads to asthma and 
respiratory illness, rendering the most vulnerable more prone to death 
from Covid. 
 
So the circle turns – of climate, Covid, and our need, your need, to 
insist, starting now, THAT our city’s transition post-Covid be just and 
that we accelerate our move off of fossil fuels.

Yes, unemployment is record high. Yes, the pandemic has lessened our 
economic resources. Yes, to the many valid excuses that are certain to 
be raised as hurdles to why you should not act decisively and justly on 
climate change to bring us to a new sustainable normal for our city. 
 
If you don’t act, the tipping points of climate change will descend like 
this pandemic. Some will ask then, if we knew this, why didn’t we act?  
 
Author Rebecca Solnit, who has tracked human responses to disaster, 
speaks about what constitutes hope in their wake.  
 
“What I call hope is really just full recognition of the unpredictability 
of the future … My vision of hope is a sense of radical uncertainty, 
with the possibility of intervention, to shape the future.  
 
“In disasters,” she said, “there's always a power struggle.”  
 
As Rebecca wisely observes about this pandemic: 
 
“Disasters shake things loose. And the things that we regarded as fixed 
and unchangeable can suddenly be changed. It's been fascinating seeing 
people in power suddenly say, ‘Well, actually, we can put all these 
homeless people up in hotels. Actually, we can change unemployment 
insurance and sick leave. Actually, we can find $3 trillion to throw at a 
problem. … The powerful are often scrambling to restore a status quo 
that worked very well for them. The less powerful are often saying, 
‘Wow, everything has changed. We're not ready to change it all back.’ 

Here’s hoping you’re ready to listen to those saying to you: “Wow, 
everything has changed … let’s keep going.”

Throughout the COVID-19 emergency, the City’s Recycling Center at 47 Hampshire

As a result of the ongoing pandemic, many households across the City are 
experiencing an increase in recyclable trash items, including plastic bags which have 
been temporarily reintroduced for groceries, and paper and boxes from home-delivered 
packages; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Department of 
Public Works and any other relevant City departments to reopen the Recycling Center

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER

COUNCILLOR CARLONE 
 
WHEREAS:  Whereas on Sunday, May 3, the official Twitter account of the Cambridge Police 
Department, in response to a tweet about Rep. Joe Kennedy III, replied publicly, 
“Another liberal f--- (expletive redacted) jerk who just happens to better than the clown 
he’s running against. Sad for us.”; and  
 
The City of Cambridge Police Department should not make statements attacking 
public officials, and the police should not publicly insult Massachusetts’ residents they 
are sworn to protect; and 
 
The Police Department deleted the tweet soon after, issued an apology, and identified 
Supt. Jack Albert as the author; and 
 
The Police Department has said Supt. Albert will be subject to disciplinary action but 
that “Pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws, the Department would be restricted 
from disclosing any specific disciplinary action” publicly; and 
 
Incidents like this erode confidence in the Police Department during the ongoing 
COVID-19 emergency and raise questions about the Department’s social media 
protocols for its officers and its official account, which posts official updates about 
urgent situations including shootings and public safety threats; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Police Department 
to provide information to the City Council about what disciplinary action has been 
taken as result of this incident, which may be in executive session if required by state 
law; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Police Department 
to provide a report on how social media protocols for the official Police Department 
account and officers’ personal accounts have been revised as a result of this to prevent 
future incidents.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that Lesley University terminated the 
contracts of many dining services workers, custodial staff, and public safety staff, as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the closure of campus; and 
 
Attempts to redeploy these workers, who are disproportionately people of color and 
immigrants, through their subcontractor have not been successful; and 
 
This tragic decision has left many vulnerable community members without pay or 
benefits and runs contrary to the University’s mission statement, which claims to 
prepare students to “… strive for social justice and equity”; and 
 
The 2020 CARE Act includes $14 billion for the Higher Education Emergency Relief 
Fund, of which Lesley is projected to receive $1,997,859, and the bill specifically 
mentions that recipients of these funds must retain current employees to the “maximum 
extent practicable”; and 
 
Pay cuts taken by the highest salaried employees, as announced by both Harvard and 
MIT, could easily pay for retaining some of these workers; and 
 
During this pandemic, we must do all we can to protect the most vulnerable including 
the lowest paid workers and contractors; and 
 

President Janet Steinmayer to reverse course; and 
 
Local 26 was able to secure medical benefits for Lesley dining hall workers according 
to their existing contract, but not wages, and the union does not represent other types 
of essential workers on campus including custodial or public safety workers; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Members of the Lesley University community have drafted a petition calling on 

Packet Pg. 149

WHEREAS: 

The petition demands that Lesley University administration protect food service, 
custodial, and public safety workers through the following steps: 

5.5

●  Guarantee continuity in wages and benefits for Lesley University food 
service, custodial, and public safety workers through the end of the 
spring 2020 semester 

●  Guarantee hazard pay and provide Personal Protective Equipment 

(PPE) for the food service, custodial, and public safety workers that 
remain on campus 

●  Modify paid leave policies to allow flexibility for workers who 

become sick, have a dependent become sick, or have otherwise been 
exposed to COVID-19; now therefore be it 

 
RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

 
That the City Council go on record in solidarity with all Lesley University workers and 
in support of the demands of the community petition; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of 
this resolution to Lesley University President Janet Steinmayer

Subject: 
 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
This past Tuesday, May 5th, the School Committee and administration had a Regular Meeting and heard 
Public  Comment  about  distance  learning  and  the  FY21  budget,  in  the  context  of  COVID-19  recovery 
planning. I’m thankful to everyone that tuned in and signed up to provide their testimonies. Community 
engagement and feedback is so crucial to this planning process.  
 
Following Public Comment, Superintendent Salim gave a presentation 
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n-mkdRsFSlNbZnanfOEqIw1y7pc-lkr7-4O-tC4gCTo/edit> on 
CPS’s plan and its updates. The takeaway from the questions and comments of both community members 
and School Committee members is that we need all hands on deck for much more structure in short-term, 
mid-term, and long-term planning to address the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis and to be prepared for 
the upcoming summer and fall.  
 
The School Committee also agreed that prior to voting on the FY21 budget, it is very important to think 
about what COVID-19 concerns still need to be addressed. The motion to vote on the budget has been 
placed on the table, pending these discussions. 
 
On Tuesday, May 7th, the School Committee is convening for a Special Meeting with Public Comment 
<https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2020/SC_Notice
_5_7_20_Meeting.pdf> at 6:00pm to continue engaging community members in this conversation around 
what we need in our COVID-19 recovery and distance learning planning. On Friday, April 24th, the 
Department of Elementary and Secondary Education sent out updated guidance on remote learning 
<http://www.doe.mass.edu/covid19/learn-at-home/remote-learning-experience-guide.docx> (with specific

<http://www.doe.mass.edu/covid19/on-desktop/2020-0424sy-requirements.docx> to reflect the new

I also want to add that my Office will soon place the CRLS senior class photo on the lawn signs in front 
of City Hall. We are working on ways to make graduation special for our seniors. Please feel free to 
purchase a CRLS Class of 2020 lawn/window sign as another way to support the senior class.

Date: May 7th, 2020 
Subject: Food Insecurity Work and Resources Update 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council,  
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to devastate our community, I wanted to share an update on the 
work being done to ensure no Cambridge resident goes hungry during these challenging times. Since this 
public health crisis began, Food For Free has risen to the occasion, helping coordinate the operation of 
school meals distribution sites, and partnering with the City to organize the Cambridge Community Food 
Line, which delivers fresh produce and shelf-stable items to residents’ homes on a weekly basis. 
Currently serving roughly 2,000 households each week, the Community Food Line has reached capacity, 
despite interest in its services growing every day. To address this high need, Food For Free has begun to 
move some residents off the delivery list for the Community Food Line, instead offering them gift cards 
to local grocery stores within a one-mile radius of their homes. This effort helps them keep food on the 
table, while ensuring that those who specifically need delivery service, such as elderly or immuno-
compromised residents, can still access the critical resources they need.  
 
However, as we know that our community will continue to weather this public health crisis and its effects 
for months to come, I have been searching for more proactive ways to ensure this high level of need can 
be met long-term, and sustainably. After I reached out to Project Bread, UMass Boston, and the City’s 
Department of Human Services, we recognized a unique opportunity to use the existing food distribution 
recipient list from the Community Food Line to launch a targeted outreach campaign encouraging 
residents to apply for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. Through partnering 
with the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee (CEOC), their trained employees have made 447 
calls to residents to date, not only offering prescreening services and helping residents apply for SNAP, 
but also connecting them to other invaluable resources, such as unemployment benefits, housing 
assistance, City-run relief programs, and more. CEOC staff are able to provide support in Amharic, 
Portuguese, Haitian Creole, and Spanish, and outside translation services are available as needed, to 
ensure a language barrier does not prevent a resident from accessing the help they need. 289 residents 
have been reached so far, with follow-up calls being scheduled to confirm residents have received the 
benefits they apply for. Voicemails outlining residents’ options are being left for unanswered calls. CEOC 
expects to have called all 1,900 residents by May 15th, and will publish a report soon after. The chart 
below illustrates the callers’ findings, so far, on the areas residents have needed guidance on.

It is critical, now more than ever, that residents have the information and tools they need to keep 
themselves and their loved ones safe and healthy. By having trained callers who are knowledgeable about 
various benefits available, we are connecting residents to the crucial resources that will help them keep 
afloat during these difficult times, and ensuring our existing programs remain sustainable and accessible 
long-term. I cannot thank Project Bread, UMass Boston, the Department of Human Services, and CEOC 
enough for their partnership and for their diligent efforts in fighting food insecurity in our City. 
Throughout these last several weeks, I have been heartened to see the dedication of my colleagues on the 
City Council, across other City Departments, and beyond in supporting Cambridge’s most vulnerable 
residents during their time of need. It is times like these that I am reminded of a favorite Cambridge 
saying, “one City, one family,” and I believe these efforts to uplift our community truly exemplifies that 
spirit.  
 
 
Thank you,

Cambridge Vice-Mayor

Wheeler, Councillor Toomey and Councillor Simmons; School Committee Member Rojas, Member 
Fantini, Member Wilson, Member Rachel, Member Weinstein, and Vice-Chair Bowman, Student 
Members Sophia Green and Hersh Kanner.   I will give a brief overview of our agenda.  We will be 
hearing from our City Manager who will discuss some of the City supports for our schools. We will then 
hear from the Vice-Chair who will discuss the budget further and aligning this budget specifically with 
the district plan that's been in place and is in year three. We will then have an overview of the budget 
process thus far. And the district plan and the equity work that is being done and Superintendent Selene 
will present that. After that, we will also hear from the building equity bridges team who will be here 
shortly. Finally, we'll have a discussion on key takeaways from community and principal meetings from 
Superman superintendent, saline, and then we'll have a discussion. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  2:48   
As I've communicated to School Committee members and the City Council, I've shared some 
communication of some of the meeting. that we've had thus far. So some of the material, hopefully is not 
new. And some will be new to reflect on. And so I hope that we can have a robust conversation about the 
budget. So without further ado, I will toss it to the City Manager to give a overview of our city supports 
that exist for our Cambridge Public Schools. 
 
Louis DePasquale, City Manager  3:27   
Thank you, Madam Mayor. First of all, it's is really a great opportunity for me to be here today. We were 
just at the Valente Library all afternoon, talking about the financial position of the city and the raging 
agency presentation and we got to do it at the Valente Library and gave the rating agency an opportunity 
to take a tour of both the school and the library and it's a pretty impressive building. One of the things that 
we really stressed today was the fact that the relationship that we have as a city with the school in the city 
is not the relationship that other cities have. I wish it was, but it isn't. I mean, I've been Budget Director 
for over 20 years, I was Assistant City Manager for 14. And now this is my fourth year as City Manager 
and I can tell you in those 38 years, one of the best things this city does is the relationship the City 
Manager had with the Superintendent in terms of getting things done, the relationship the Mayor had with 
the School Committee and the City Council, and the relationship of the teams of the Mayor, 
Superintendent and the City Manager had to make sure that we will always moving forward with the best 
possible budget for the children of Cambridge.  I think we're going to go over a few things here today, but 
it's clear to me that I'm very proud, after watching Bob Haley and Rich Rossi, really demonstrate the 
importance working with the Superintendent and listening to the City Council who has clearly made it 
clear that the education budget is a priority. This is where we need to invest that money. I think we have 
done that, we will continue to do that in terms of operating budget abd in terms of capital budget in terms 
of school. I'm just going to go over a few items today to demonstrate the team effort because it really is a 
team. Cambridge is so successful not because of any individual or any group, it's because all of us can 
come together and really figure out how to do what's best for all the residents of Cambridge. I think 
financial position certainly plays a major role in that. I do think it's something we do incredibly well. I 
will say when you are meeting with rating agencies, and we'd make our presentation on what we're doing, 
especially around school buildings, they are amazed but they're even more amazed that we can do it and 
still keep tax bils down, still keep the strong position we're in and still keep a debt stabilization surplus. 
All these things have a relationship on it on how we go day to day.   
 
Louis DePasquale, City Manager  6:01   
I'll start off with the Capital Projects.  The King Open School, as I said, which we did in the Valente 
Library was a $160 million project and in the current bond schedule that we have here right now, which 
goes from 20 to 24, the last payment of that is in this schedule. We have already paid off the MLK in 
terms of started the bond process. If you take those two schools, the city has bonded 255 million dollars 
that we have put out in bonds. Now, over and above that, as we take a look at the Tobin, we're potentially 
going to have another $250 million dollars. One of the things that we really want to take a look at is

where did we stand even before we start the Tobin, have we done this at the expense of the future of the 
city. I think one of the things that the City Council can be incredibly proud of here is when we started the 
process with these two schools, one of the things we said is we needed to have a Debt Stabilization Fund 
that helped protect the taxpayers so when you're taking on this kind of increase, you can help absorb some 
of the increases. At the end of this fiscal year, will have $57 million set aside for future debt. If you look 
at our budget right now, about 55% of that is projected to be school debt. We can continue to keep on 
moving with the completion of the Tobin which is in our five year projections. The sixth year is obviously 
not here yet, but that will be the final year. In the meantime, we're also put in a position to discuss moving 
further down the line - What are the next steps and where are we going and that's, again, not an accident. 
That's a plan by really taking a look at how do you fund that Stabilization Fund and the City Council 
every year has allowed me for the last three years, take whatever we took from the Stabilization Fund and 
replace it with Free Cash. That is not an easy thing to do, but we've done it. I also want to say that I was 
part when this process began of talking about what could the city handle three schools probably without 
any additional assistance and Bob Healy, who knew numbers incredibly well, projected that we felt it was 
going to be about a $250 million dollar project to address three schools.  The biggest concern then was if 
the city would have commit $250 million dollars, what was that going to mean for the rest of the schools? 
Would they be completely out of getting any renovations? Also, just as important, what was it going to 
mean for the city? Could we address our concerns.  As we come to today, not only have we already spent 
in terms of bond the $250 million dollars, we are not taking on another $250 million dollars, and we've 
not missed a beat. That is an incredible accomplishment and omething everyone in this room should be 
incredibly proud of. I say that also saying that, as this has gone on the city is addressed many of its needs 
in terms of infrastructure - fire station, so we've been able to balance not at the expense of the city. We've 
also been able to address some additional school needs. In FYI 18, we addressed an additional almost $3 
million over and above what was in the bond schedule for the school. In FYI, 19, almost $7 million in 
additional capital needs to the school. In FYI, 20, we've got about $900,000 already out there for 
additional needs for the school. We recently went to the City Council to address the Cambridgeport 
School in terms of additional needs. If that comes up next year, we'll be able to address that. We have 
really said, How do you make this all work? How do you balance it all out? I think we've done that will 
continue to do that. One of the things that I talked to David about was in our five-year plan, we had 
$800,000 set aside for an additional school in terms of addressing some of its needs and in working 
closely with Jimmy and Claire and the Superintendent, we've changed that in the future to $1.8 million 
with just basic needs that we felt we have to address. So we're very proud of that. But again, that doesn't 
mean when things come up, we won't address them. And that's what you have free cash for. When the 
Graham and Parks roof came up, we got the proposal and said d let's strike. So we're also going to be 
open to take a look at other things. So, again, I think we've positioned ourselves very well and will be a 
discussion really that's going to come down when can we start the next really major project where we've 
just started the Tobin and what's that going to be.  Is it a fourth school? Or is it really taking a look at the 
other schools and saying what's the appropriate number, do we need a study to take a look at that? We are 
certainly in a financial position to take on whatever the Council and the School Committee feels is a 
priority. I think that's the good news tonight.  Even with all we've done, we've positioned ourselves very 
well for the future. That's something we all can be proud of. But it's not just been the capital side. It's how 
we address the operating budget. I have been City Manager, where I have submitted three school budgets 
since I have been City Manager to the City Council and I am proud that in those three budgets, I've 
recommended an operating school increase working with the Superintendent in the Mayor very closely of 
5.3%. That exceeds the five year average of 5.2. The seven year average of 4.8 and the 10 year average of 
4.2. Clearly we have made the education budget a priority under this administration as it's been in the 
past, but we've really put the additional funds in working closely with the Superintendent and City 
Council because, again, we have bottom line authority, but the Council still has to approve all of this. I've 
also been proud of the fact that when I started as City Manager, coming from a finance background, if 
you had said to me that it my three budgets, I would have added almost 250 positions on the school and 
city side, I would have laughed. But the reality is we need to address our needs. We've added almost 90

positions in that three year period on the city side. To address school needs, school growth, school new 
programming in the last three budgets that I've been involved in, we've added 147 new positions, 
something we all should be very, very proud of. In continuing that when we met with the Superintendent 
and Claire and Jimmy and I want to say another thing, which is very unusual that I said to the rating 
agencies today, we don't meet at the time at a budget and say thank you and goodbye. This truly is a 12-
month relationship. That's why it's successful. There are no surprises. We're in this together and we work 
together, and I can't thank my team enough and the Superintendent's team to really feel comfortable and 
confident that we are in this together, there's no surprises, there's no secrets. Together, we can get things 
done. think we've shown that. In the early process, I'm very proud to say that we have recommended a 
6.5% property tax allocation for 21 and an additional 1.4 potential Chapter 70 money. The way we 
handled Chapter 70 financing is a question, but we have always treated Chapter 70 as a regular revenue, 
and then adjusted at the year end, but due to the fact that we knew it was highlighted of an increase, we 
put that in the budget. That results in a 5.9% School budget, one of the largest budget increases we've had 
that I can go back and find. It's something I'm very proud of. The three year average is 5.3 so it far 
exceeds that. It's a budget based on all of the discussions that I had with the Superintendent that we feel 
addressed the concerns that the Superintendent had. We are here again as the bottom line authority. I can 
tell you knowing how my nine bosses feel, which is the Cambridge City Council, our commitment to 
education in this city is second to none. The school budget is the largest tax budget in the city by far. So 
it's also my responsibility to somewhat balance that out with how much we can really give without having 
the taxes go crazy but it is the largest budget.  The support we've given has been exceptional. It will 
continue to be exceptional. It's something I'm very proud of. I'm even more proud of the fact that I think 
the relationship we've had and that I've had with three Mayors that I've worked with in even for a short 
period of time, understanding the importance that the Mayor and the Manager have to work with the 
Superintendent to come up with the best possible budget for the school: the students, the School 
Committee and the City Council and I really believe in my long career with the city we have really made 
that a priority and I really want to thank Mayor Simmons Mayor McGovern, Mayor Siddiqui for all their 
support on the budgets. I've worked with them and Kenny Salim and we started roughly together and I 
think it's been an incredible team. I want to thank my team in his team for the ongoing relationship. I 
know we have more work to do, but I can tell all of you that this team gets it,  this team works together 
and this team does produce the best possible scenario for the students and the residents of the City of 
Cambridge. Thank you. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  15:38   
Thank you, Mr. City Manager. We will now move on to hearing from Vice Chair Bowman. You have the 
floor. 
 
Vice Chair Bowman  15:48   
Thank you Mayor Siddiqui and thank you to my colleagues and our partners at the city. We recognize that 
we don't take for granted that our budget on the city side is a significant part of the city budget. One thing 
that myself and my co-chair of the Budget Committee Member Fantini has been really committed to is 
really recognizing that money in and of itself does not solve a problem. Now let me be very clear, it's a 
great problem to have. Having money is a good problem. But that said, we recognize from a systematic 
perspective, when we look at the academic outcomes when it comes to our kids, that having lots of 
resources, to be honest and frank is not necessarily moving the needle when it comes to academic 
achievement for all of our kids. We are incredibly grateful for the resources that's been provided to us, 
particularly when it comes to our buildings. It's amazing that our young people are in net zero buildings, 
and have the privilege to be in beautiful spaces and learn. We also recognize as a body that we have a 
responsibility based on the allotted amount of resources that come to us that we have to be laser-focused 
as it relates to what are the levers that we need to invest in as a committee and as an administration to be 
able to make sure that we can take those resources and look at the community and have conversations and 
say, we are doing and making the investments necessary for every single child in our school system,

regardless of their race, regardless of their socio economic status, to be able to access all the resources 
that are here in our city. We don't even have to go outside of the city based on resources. That is really 
our charge. As a result, when it came to this year's budget, we decided to really take a step back and do a 
different approach. Of course, it's still centered on what our district wide plan is, but a lot of times when 
we would approach the budget process in the past, it would be asking the community what it wants, not 
really necessarily a dialogue between the body, the administration, the School Committee, around what 
are the structures in place that shape our budget. We wanted the average citizen to know that we have a 
tiered system when it comes to how we create the formula of how our schools are staffed. Is that the right 
approach? If people don't have the basic fundamental knowledge as it relates to how our budget is 
structured, then how can we create the systematic change to tackle some of the issues that we lay out in 
our district wide plan, which is equity and access, engaging learning experiences for our educators as well 
as our students, really thinking about the whole child, family and community partnerships and really 
being able to look at continuous progress to ensure that we are meeting the needs, the academic as well as 
social needs, social emotional needs of our children. We were very intentional about centering the process 
of the budget, along with the district wide plan, but also including the outcomes. In your presentation, you 
have some of our outcomes here. In our community meetings, we actually share what those numbers are, 
and we will definitely forward those to you so you can have a sense of where we are as it relates to our 
third grade literacy rates across the multiple demographics in our schools, eighth grade math, and I'll let 
you continue to read on from there.  We think is really important to bring in the outcomes aspect of our 
district wide plan in this conversation because the reality is there's a cohort of kids in our school system 
that are doing very well with our investments and there's a cohort of kids that are not. We have to be 
leaders as a body, as an administration, the Superintendent, the Mayor, all of us, in not hiding those 
numbers, but letting them be very public so that can shape our sense of urgency as it relates to tackling 
these issues in a way that will allow for our kids to be able to really grow and thrive and really be able to 
leverage all the resources that are available to us. I will stop there. The admin team will go into more 
depth as it relates to where we are with the budgetary process now. Thank you. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  20:43   
Superintendent Salim. 
 
Superintendent Salim  20:44   
Thank you, Mayor Siddiqui and thank you Vice Chair Bowman.  It is great to be here this evening. In the 
first part, I'll be sharing some some information slides and a couple of different pieces. In a couple 
minutes we will also be able to hear from the Building Equity Bridges team representatives to talk about 
some of that work, which I'll introduce in a moment. But what I want to start off with is an overview of 
our budget process and the equity framework as a prelude to that.  Starting off just at a high level, talking 
about where we are with the FY21 budget in terms of the commitment that the City Manager and the city 
have made to the Cambridge Public Schools. I just want to say how grateful I am and that our team is for 
the ongoing partnership from City Manager DePasquale, Mr. Jennings and Mr. Kale and Miss Semonoff 
as truly being, as the City Manager said, partners not just for this moment around the budget 
development, but over the course of the entire year, recognizing that resources in terms of the budget are 
one piece, but how we work together and how we collaborate and how we leverage the amazing resources 
that exist in our city are truly the opportunities that are unique to Cambridge, and that we believe are the 
opportunities for really achieving the gains that our students and families deserve. The highlights the City 
Manager spoke of, you'll see on the left side in terms of the overall budget allocation and increase of 
5.9%. The overall allocation for FY21 is $213.7 million dollars, an increase of $11.9 million. That 
revenue and that budget will allow us to accomplish three really important things: to meet our fixed costs 
increases so to meet all the needs related to all the existing staff and benefit increases, different contracts 
for related to transportation facilities, maintenance and student services. Generally, the inflation related 
costs that happen year over year.  Then really importantly, is something that Cambridge is privileged to 
do that is oftentimes not the case in most communities across Massachusetts, is to actually address some

of the other staffing needs in response to enrollment growth to student need related to our different 
programs across the district for English language learners, students with disabilities and other special 
populations. Finally, this really key piece around continuing to invest in our district plan and the related 
initiatives. When we entered the conversation with the city around our FY21 budget or FY20, or FY 19, 
in the time that I've been here in Cambridge, it's always about what does the school district need in order 
to be able to move this work around the district plan and move these key initiatives forward. So that is 
always the orientation. It's about what is necessary to accomplish these important goals. Through this 
process, this increase of $11.9 million is funded both from property taxes as well as Chapter 70 funding 
from the state. Folks on the City Council and School Committee certainly have seen a lot of the news 
coming out of the Statehouse with the Student Opportunity Act and some of the increases that have 
happened with Chapter 70 funding. I think it's important to note that while there is this $1.4 million 
increase projected right now based on the Governor's budget, that is not too dissimilar to the increases 
we've seen in previous years.  The priority that has that has been made with the Student Opportunity Act 
funding in the particularly first year is on gateway cities. Some of the communities that you'll see have 
some of those more significant increases are our neighbors that are comprised of those gateway cities 
across the Commonwealth. In terms of the timeline, we have been going through a process of budget 
analysis and planning, meeting with different department heads, meeting with our building leaders, as 
well as engaged in community meetings with educators and with the community at large. We're using all 
of that input and data in order to craft the proposed budget that I'll be presenting to the School Committee 
on March 12th. The School Committee will then have an opportunity to engage in discussion and 
deliberation before their adoption of the FY21 budget, which then of course, will go to the City Council 
for a Finance Committee hearing later this spring. I alluded to this a little bit earlier, we use a range of 
different information and data, student data and surveys. We implemented a couple of years ago, a series 
of school climate surveys that we use as part of our analysis.  School Committee roundtables and retreats 
that happen not just during this budget period, but over the course of the whole year in order to inform 
discussions related to the budget, projections of enrollment, expenditures and revenue, community input, 
and the principals and educators. On the right side, you see some of those different ways in which we also 
are using specific tools and the idea around the community budget meetings which were new for this year, 
where we decided to not have the the usual model of having folks come into the Dr. Attles Meeting Room 
to speak for three minutes to go through the formal process, and really more engage in a dialogue as the 
Vice Chair described, which I'll touch upon a little bit later in the presentation. As we think about the 
budget as well, though, we're also thinking about it as just the money piece when we think about our 
resources. We also think about the time that we have in-house staff use time. The equity driven district 
plan and the associated objectives and initiatives are what are driving how we think about resources. 
Welook at that as really helping us to make progress on the outcome measures that the Vice Chair 
mentioned in her remarks, the seven outcomes that we have developed as a way of measuring our 
progress of the district plan. Over the last couple of years, we've also centered the work on equity and 
racial equity and in the previous term, the School Committee adopted these two definitions around equity 
and racial equity, and recognizing that when we're thinking about our resources, we need to be thinking 
with this mindset around students who need more are provided more, and bringing that equity lens and 
racial equity lens in particular, and that achieving racial equity requires a proactive and continuous 
investment in communities of color through this work. As part of this equity and racial equity work, we 
also have the opportunity to partner with the Cambridge Education Association on a project that the 
Nellie Mae Education Foundation launched about 18 months ago which was a grant opportunity to really 
examine the root causes of inequity. We had an opportunity, along with five other communities in New 
England, to engage in this work. The Building Equity Bridges project, which we'll turn to in a moment 
was an effort to really engage families, young people, and educators in different ways. That is culminated 
in a set of nine barriers that you'll hear about in a moment as well as a set of recommended actions related 
to having an anti racism stance along this work. So building on these ideas around equity and racial 
equity, how can we be actively anti racist in our work to really confront the systemic barriers that exist, 
not just in Cambridge but across schooling as an institution and across this country. So with that, I'm

going to invite Khari Milner and Tessa Bridge up to the table. Khari is the co-director of the Agenda for 
Children and heads up learning partnerships for the Cambridge Public Schools. Tessa Bridge is the 
manager for the Building Equity Bridges project.  I will turn it over to Khari and Tessa. 
 
Khari Milner  29:53   
Good evening, everyone. Madam Mayor, City Manager, all the elected officials in the house good to see 
everyone.  It is an honor to be here to be able to share a bit about the Building Equity Bridges project and 
now what's become what we hope is a movement. As you heard the Superintendent share, the Building 
Equity Bridges project was launched almost two years ago and was first seeded by Nellie Mae Education 
Foundation which you'll also notice in this first slide is prominently featured our couple logos and, of 
course, we have CPS, we also have the CEA, which is the teacher or educator union. This was really a 
joint effort from the very beginning. When I first heard about this proposal, what really drew me to it was 
the fact that you had the union and the district at the table and we are the one district or community across 
the six that Nellie Mae funded that had the union at the table. For me, it really helped to set the stage so 
that we would not immediately start with finger pointing, which I've seen and we know happens 
sometimes as a distraction. It allowed us from the beginning to say we're both going to hold up a mirror in 
terms of both the district and the union, to see what is happening and what we're doing to contribute to the 
persistent inequities that we see across our district and community, our young people, our families, and 
our educators, and leaders, all of which are impacted. You'll also see above the Cambridge Equity logo, 
which was designed by a CRLS student in one of the course projects that we collaborated with Miss Max. 
You also see some murals and some of these slides and those were created live during some of the 
Building Equity Bridges events. 
 
Khari Milner  32:13   
In terms of what is Building Equity Bridges, the idea was really to bring together multiple stakeholders 
starting with the district and the union and to think differently and set up a comprehensive approach and a 
transparent process to look into the root causes of inequities  and particularly racial inequities that we see 
throughout our district. So if you consider what's on our district dashboard, you consider what are we 
tracking and what are we submitting to the state. What are we making priorities around? We can convert 
those ideas often into quantitative numbers and those numbers tell a story. Often it's a story that doesn't 
bring about a lot of smiles. When we think about the disparities, as Vice Chair Bowman mentioned, those 
students who are prospering versus those students who are really struggling according to some of the 
different metrics, and what we were seeking to do was to look at what was under those numbers. What is 
happening that's contributing to those numbers, what structures, what decisions, what actions, what 
barriers are persistently contributing to something that is really hard to crack, which is the so called gaps 
and these other magnified different pathways that our young people go through throughout our district 
and this is for generations as we know. 
 
Khari Milner  33:58   
In terms of the how, one of the ways that we really went about this work was to center ourselves with 
some core principles. You'll see on this slide that we, from the very beginning, put together a set of 
principles that allowed us to consistently focus on the elevation of the voices of young people, of 
educators and families, really trying to center those who are most impacted and harmed if you will, by the 
systems, by the institution, by the structures, by the decisions that are made, that are played out in the data 
and played out and the actual experiences. We looked through multiple layers and subgroups across our 
community, multiple school buildings, multiple parts of the city to try to find these voices and not just to 
ask them to be a part of this, we had to build the trust in order to do that. But also, to make sure we turn 
up the volume on their voices. I just mentioned the idea of proactively cultivating trust, another one of our 
principles. That was so essential. So many folks, and I look around this room, a lot of people have known 
you, and have known me for quite a long time, and the entire time that we've known each other we've 
been talking about a lot of these issues, especially if you're talking to me, you know, I'm likely to bring it

up. So as somebody who went through the schools here, who saw my two younger brothers go through 
the schools, someone who now has three children in the schools, my wife and I, we are consistently 
reminded by the young people that we see across our city, and the very different outcomes that they are 
living, and also the very different barriers that they have to navigate. The reason I bring this all up is 
because with the persistent disparities, we know that a lot of folks are frustrated. A lot of folks are tired of 
being asked, What do you think about the inequity? What do you think about the racism? What do you 
think about testing? What do you think about the number of black teachers that your kid has had? And 
they don't really want to talk about it. They've talked about it enough. And they also don't typically have a 
lot of trust, if you will, for the quote unquote, system. For somebody who sits in a position and works in a 
position that I do work both inside the district and outside across the community, I can really understand.  
I get a lot of different stories that helped me to have empathy and to also have lived some of this myself. 
We had to proactively cultivate trust just to have people speak and be a part of the different elements of 
Building Equity Bridges, or BEB for short. I'll just say briefly that we also really sought to share power 
and the idea that we needed folks to feel like their voices were not just elevated but empowered. And that 
we needed them to engage as partners. And this also include actual partners, such as community 
programs, city programs, many different folks who have different connections to the district. And not just 
to say the district needs to know this because the district has the power to change all this. That is not what 
our experience has been. And we want to make sure that was not what we were messaging. In terms of the 
idea of seeking out and centering the voices of those who have been most marginalized. Again, that's been 
a very consistent goal of ours. In terms of the who, you kind of see these hexagons down the bottom here 
hard to read, but they really represent a lot of the different voices and subgroups that we went out against 
centering those who are most marginalized within each of these groups. So, I've mentioned some young 
people, family members and caregivers, out of school time educators, community partners, alumni, 
administrators from within the district, and some who have retired as well. We did engage with other 
types of leaders, some of whom were in this room tonight. 
 
Khari Milner  38:46   
In terms of where and when, the first phase of this BEB project was really about trying to compile, gather, 
listen to the experiences and the voices of a lot of the folks I just mentioned, and started more so in the 
summer of 2018. And this first phase ran through the next school year through June 2019. In terms of the 
where some of this work was happening, we saw and we put together and convened a youth participatory 
action research project in which high school students worked on three issues. And the participatory action 
research model is really leveraging people who are most impacted by an issue as the researchers of that 
topic of that issue that most impacts them so as young people researching issues that are impacting 
themselves. We also had what's called the critical participatory action research or CPR that was primarily 
in school educators, mixed with some out of school educators. And they also had research topics that they 
investigated. These are teachers from across many different schools K through 12 in Cambridge, 
collaborating with some folks at the ED school, and others. And then we also had a large number of focus 
groups which we convened, and we had a facilitator. And we really confidentially took their stories and 
their ideas, and put together a qualitative report, which is something you can see on our website. We had 
sense making teams which took a ton of different streams of information and research and data, both 
quantitative and qualitative, across a number of themes, and these were cross stakeholder groups, which 
included educators, family members, community members, young people from the high school, as well. 
Over five, six months, they met monthly to dive in and to become experts in certain areas. More details on 
the website. As we wrapped up phase one, we had a synthesis retreat, where we took a weekend to take 
all the information coming in from everything I just mentioned, and had an organic and powerful process 
that landed in the nine barriers, which Tessa will talk about in a moment. And we had kind of a final 
event for this phase, which we invited everybody involved to come out, and to say whether or not they 
felt like we got this right, in terms of the barriers that were synthesized. Again, these were young people, 
these were educators, family members, school leaders, other community partners, and that was the first

event actually where we had one of the murals, which was created by a high school student and his his 
artist/ mentor. I going to pass it over to Tessa to hear some more about the barriers. 
 
Tessa Bridge  42:08   
Hi everyone.  Coming out of that first year of work, we, in partnership with many folks in our movement, 
named these nine barriers to equity. I'm not going to go deeply into all of them but I did want to call out a 
couple here in this space. And one thing you'll notice, as you look through this list is that they are barriers 
that live at all different levels of our institution. So some of them are really focused on the classroom or 
on the individual relationship between an educator and a teacher. Some of them are more systems of 
privilege of bias, or thinking about power and how that lives in all of the different levels of our 
institutions. So we really heard very directly from folks about how these barriers will live, both in the 
individual experience of a student walking through the hallway of their school, a parent going into parent 
teacher conferences and, the overall system's view of how these things live across our district. So the ones 
that I want to just name today because they're really relevant in the budget process are three and four. So 
that's youth are not centered and educators of color are not being centered, valued and supported. We 
heard both of these themes pretty overarchingly in many of our spaces. As we think about equity and anti 
racism and how that lives in our budget, and in our schools and in our professional development, and in 
our classrooms, and really everywhere in our spaces, three and four are incredibly important. How are we 
centering our young people, and how are we centering our educators of color? And then the other one, 
although all are relevant, that I'm going to specifically call out here is this idea of power and decision 
making and how that's distributed. Who has access to be in the room to make decisions? Who has access 
to influence decisions? And how does that influence the way that our system is serving some versus 
others. So those are just a couple. I encourage you to read more deeply about each of these. If you go to 
our website, you can find all of these barriers with some specific quotes that come directly from folks in 
our community, about how they experience these, it's a very powerful read. So I really encourage you all 
to do that. 
 
Tessa Bridge  44:36   
in addition to the barriers throughout that year of work, we were collecting a number of demands, we 
ended up with a list of over 150 demands that came directly from people in the community. So these were 
actions that folks knew needed to be taken to address the barriers that we were collectively naming so had 
this long list of demands that were all different grade sizes, all different perspectives, coming from a 
variety of stakeholders in the community. And really the idea in this graphic that we're trying to capture is 
that these anti racist actions are what's needed to blow up these barriers. We don't want the barriers to be 
in the way we want this to be an equitable system. And so we need to take some really clear anti racist 
action steps in order to disrupt the barriers and change the status quo, change the way that we are 
educating and being in our schools. 
 
Tessa Bridge  45:37   
In December we released these 12 recommended commitments that were grounded in the demands that 
had come from the movement. Again, that was a list of about 150 demands. When we finished in June 
over the summer, a group of youth, as part of the Mayor's Program, met and did some organizing work. 
We worked with an organization that does youth organizing to support them to hone in on the demands 
that really spoke most to them. We also gathered some information from folks in our movement about 
which demands they felt would most address the barriers as part of that celebration and member check. 
Based on the input from that, we colated the demands that we had down to this list of 12. So, again, I 
encourage you to read through all of these and there's a more detailed version of this on our website, but 
I'll just call out a couple. So number two, the immediate creation and ongoing investment in healing 
spaces and mental health supports for community members harmed by racism. This is one that lives really 
specifically in our buildings as well as at a systems level. We know that there is systematic harm being 
done to people in our community because of racism and the way that it manifests. Healing and care is a

religion and is an important part of that, and that sometimes manifests as mental health support, but also, 
as you know, directly addressing and healing from the pain of racism and oppression. And that's true for 
youth, for educators, for administrators, for families, caring for one another is a huge, huge piece of this 
work. Another one is number seven, a new district wide anti racism statement. So as Dr. Salim queued up 
in the beginning, this is building on the equity definitions that currently exist, really pushing onwards 
with that towards anti racism framework. The idea being that there is no neutral here. If we stand still, 
we're actually supporting a system that is harming people. And so we need to continuously be pushing 
ourselves to dismantle those systems of oppression as manifesting in those barriers in all of our choices in 
our policies, in our interpersonal interactions in every level of Our system we need to continue to be 
pushing for it to be anti racist. The idea is by having a clear statement or vision of an of an anti racist 
system, this is something that can live at every level and guide decision making across our schools. So it 
It could be something that lives in this room, something that lives in an instructional leadership team, 
something that lives in a teacher's classroom, something that really is alive in our schools and is a guiding 
post as we make decisions as we go about the business of educating our young people. And then, the 
other ones that I will mention are five and six, so elevating and supporting direct youth power, and the 
creation and ongoing investment in councils of youth, families and educators from traditionally 
marginalized group. This is really at the root of our Building Equity Bridges approach as Khari shared, so 
much of what we've done is to create spaces where folks can come together, share power, share their 
stories, build community and build trust and in that become more powerful in advocating for themselves 
and their families and their communities. So wanting to make sure that that becomes, in some ways, the 
work of our district, how do we create structures that allow for direct power for our young people, for 
direct power for our families, and for our educators, to be able to really advocate for changes that they 
know from their own lived experience that they need. So again, I really would encourage you to go to our 
website and read these in more detail. For the sake of time, those are the ones I'll touch on now. 
 
Khari Milner  49:37   
Thanks. I talked about phase one, and a lot of what you just heard about is informing phase two, in some 
ways, phase two, which is focused on advocacy. It's focused on organizing and it's focused on action, 
based on all the findings and all the learnings from phase one. To be clear, we know that a lot of folks in 
our community, including a lot of people I know personally and people in this room could have written 
some of these barriers without doing this project.  Some folks were very ready and did provide ideas 
about actions on how to dismantle, and how to disrupt some of the things we're seeing in the barriers. And 
again, we were being very intentional to build this foundation of information. Again, elevating voice of 
those we don't typically hear from such that we weren't jumping to conclusions and even I would say 
rushing to do some of the same things in the same ways that have not been effective. That's been also a 
big piece of this project, and what we hope continues to be the strength of this project. So just going 
ahead, Building Equity Bridges or BEB, it doesn't replace anything that the city has been doing. It doesn't 
in any way lessen previous efforts or current efforts, whether it be by young people, by educators, by 
parents, by other community leaders and organizers. We're trying to continue to elevate all of this work. 
And in many ways, particularly since it was initially funded by a grant, BEB is working itself out of its 
sort of visible existence, right? We want to integrate these ideals into our systems and into our 
departments and into our schools-everywhere we can. Thinking ahead, how my Cambridge leaders act on 
learnings from BEB, one thing if you want to learn more about the anti racism framework, you should 
definitely read Dr. Ibram X. Kendi's book, "How to be an Antiracist." As Tessa shared, it is really about 
not being neutral about having a mindset around every decision you make, and to consider what the ripple 
effects of that decision are, and whether they could potentially create status quo or whether they could 
move towards creating more equity around racial lines and decreasing the effects of racism, through 
policy, practice, and processes. Speaking of processes, one thing being discussed tonight is related to the 
budget. We want you to continue to consider the importance of transparency, the importance of 
participatory process, which again includes those who are most impacted. The idea of sharing power, 
which we've heard, this district is continuing to work on, and that we emphasize the need for both input

and feedback. These are not easier said than done. We know that the School Department in some ways, 
may be ahead of the curve when compared to other departments and Cambridge is sometimes ahead of 
the curve as compared to other cities. And yet, we still have a ton of work to do. And we have to stay 
focused and committed. So again, thank you for your time and we look forward to working with you in 
the future. 
 
Superintendent Salim  53:14   
Thank you, Khari and Tessa. So along with the the barriers that were surfaced and the important work of 
the Building Equity Bridges, we also examined the climate surveys that they spoke of, as well as other 
important outcome data to develop these priorities that we set for this current school year. The parties that 
both sort of live in the instructional core at number one in the center, that sort of triangle, represents 
what's happened in the classroom because if the work that we're doing is not ultimately affecting what's 
happening between teachers and the students and the presence of content, we're not going to ultimately 
have an impact on academic outcomes and other related outcomes for our students. So the idea around 
focusing on cultural responsive teaching is central to our work for this year, as well as fostering trust and 
relationships that support positive student centered culture. So thinking about the school level, then in that 
second shape in the circle blood, the light blue circle, we also want to think about sort of capacity 
accountability at all levels to address some of the systemic barriers to racial equity, and thinking at a 
systems level about how building on Khari's last point how we can make sure that our systems are 
transparent, inclusive, evidence based and equitable in our work. And so in other ways in which we have 
been able to build on this work and move forward are represented in some of these steps that we have 
built on with some of the work with youth and with other educators across the system, building on some 
of the microaggressions working group work that Dr. Turk, our Deputy Superintendent, led last year. We 
are finalizing improved Incident Response System and partnership with student government. The 
intersectionality Club, the Black Student Union have all had input into the development of ideas related to 
what that could look like, the anti racism and racial equity statements. This concept around what do we 
want to make sure that all staff across our system can demonstrate as competencies related to anti racism 
and racial equity. We're exploring different models around an Office of Equity, while we can learn from 
our colleagues in other school districts of what has worked and what have been barriers and challenges, 
and a curriculum review on how we're looking at our curriculum in CPS through an equity lens around 
representation, historical accuracy, and cultural responsiveness. We're continuing to work on some of 
these other areas around strengthening our affinity group structures to engage youth staff and families, 
from traditionally marginalized groups and our school based work around families and engaging in 
community based discussions with family and staff and our work around restorative practices and how we 
can actually those as we look at some of the data related to discipline and school climate. So from there, I 
want to shift and just share a little bit before turning it over to Mayor Siddiqui and conversations with the 
City Council and School Committee of some of the key takeaways from principals, educators and the 
community. And just to share a few highlights related to that. This came from work that actually began 
really during the last term with Vice Chair Bowman, chairing the Governance subcommittee and a real 
interest around that fourth priority around how can we make processes like the budget, less opaque and 
more transparent and inclusive. And so we've had budget presentations that have included more framing 
and context to try to put more clear information on our website, and graphics to make it more accessible. 
We have this new meeting format that I alluded to earlier of having community meetings for educators 
and staff and for families to engage in discussion in order to gather some of the input around the budget 
priorities. We posted all that feedback on our website. So we had some of the raw data and comments 
accessible to folks that weren't able to come to the citywide senior center or to the CRLS for those 
community meetings. And we have built in additional time in the schedule for School Committee to 
review adjustments from the proposed budget. So the time from March 12th to when the committee will 
be voting on the budget has been expanded as well. When we engage in these community meetings, we 
organize it around these questions so that it was focused on our outcomes, thinking about what resources 
would look like in order to improve academic outcomes for all students to foster positive student centered

school cultures, engaging students in learning and improving how we partner with families to support 
student success.  More specifically with our principals, looked at our work around mathematics at the 
upper school and elementary school, social emotional learning supports, the work around positive student 
centered school cultures, the level up work at CRLS, summer vacation programming, as well as our 
overall work and racial equity. And so if you were to double click on these community input and principal 
educators, we organize these in the next set of slides around our different objectives of equity and access, 
engaged learning, whole child, family community partnership and improvement. I'm not going to read 
through each of these, but just wanted to share these as a reference and to lift up a couple of them in the 
objective of equity and access, heard a lot around sort of this idea around how can we make sure that 
when we're thinking about summer programming, we're reducing as many of the barriers and obstacles as 
possible to families and students participating in some of that summer programming,  Including 
opportunities for full day transportation, lunch and fun, as part of that summer experience. A lot of 
comments around continuing to deepen our work around recruitment, retention and professional pathways 
for educators of color. While we've started really exciting work around pathways and around expanding 
the power professional to teacher pipeline, what are ways we might be able to deepen and expand that. 
Around the objective of engaging learning, we heard a lot in conversations around how can we better 
identify and identify earlier reading challenges that students may encounter? So thinking about our grade 
three literacy outcome, how can certain tools we use to identify early reading challenges and what kind of 
professional learning is necessary for educators to be able to meet those needs for students? One area that 
I spoke about briefly and a couple slides ago, this idea around how can we review curriculum, class 
celebrations for cultural responsiveness, historical accuracy and representation. 
 
Superintendent Salim  1:00:08   
On the on the next slide, we have objective three of the whole child, a lot of important discussion around 
school based capacity to address students mental and behavioral needs. This is certainly an area that has 
been a focus for the committee over the last several years around looking at the phenomenon that exists 
across our Commonwealth and really across our country of more students coming into JK and K with 
experiences of trauma and how we can best meet the needs of those, particularly our youngest learners. 
And then also this last one around that process and staff capacity to address student reports of racial 
incidents and other inappropriate behavior are other important areas that were raised by our  youth as well 
as community under family community partnership. A couple of years ago, we expanded our Family 
Liaison model from our elementary school liaison to the Upper School liaisons and some discussion 
around what it might look like to increase capacity of those liaisons in supporting our middle grade 
students.  
 
Superintendent Salim  1:01:27   
As it relates to the fourth bullet on the left, this idea really came from actually one of CPAR Research 
studies as well as many conversations across the community around how can we build understanding 
among families of privilege about ways to support a more equitable system and thinking about how 
privilege plays into voice and how that voice is incorporated into decision making. The last objective is 
implementation and continuous improvement and an area that continues to be an ongoing focus is this 
idea of what does it look like to continue to evaluate our systems? How do we think about what are we 
starting? What are we stopping? What are we scaling, to move closer to the outcomes that we desire in the 
system for our students? And then this last point, an area that we spent considerable time on last year 
exploring issues around time and collaboration time as well as student learning time? How can we think 
about strategic scheduling to look at how we are using time and staff more effective way to meet the 
needs, particularly of our most vulnerable youth. So those are just a few highlights. I know there's a lot of 
information here. I know I'm going through it quickly but just wanted to have an opportunity to lift up 
some of those examples to set the stage for discussion and comments. And with that, I'll turn it over to 
Mayor Siddiqui.

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:02:55   
Great. So I'm going to start with my City Council colleagues.  Specifically, I'll start with the Finance Co-
Chairs, Councillor Simmons and Councillor Carlone.   I will then go to the Vice Mayor. After that I will 
go alphabetically and hopefully Councillor McGovern will join by then.  Followed by Councillor Nolan, 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler and Councillor Zondervan.  I woulld like all of you to say a few comments 
and then state your questions. I suggested 2-3 minutes as I'm looking at the time. So Councillor Simmons, 
I'll start with you. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:03:34   
Thank you, Madam Chair, just a process question because you said the meeting will end at 7:30 and I'm 
really alright with that. At 7:30 I have a hard stop. I just don't know how we're going to be able to get 
through everything and I guess I'm looking to you to see if you'd be willing to perhaps have another 
opportunity for us to have this discussion because I don't think we're going to be able to get to everything. 
It is hard to have the give and take discussion with such a short amount of time. The presentations were 
very informative, but they were long. That being said, just briefly, and I don't know what to opine on the 
budget or the Building Equity Bridges, so I just chose the Building Equity Bridges part of it.  Let me 
introduce myself to you. I'm a grandparent, I've been a parenting grandparent, I've been a parent, and I'm 
a policy maker. So I have a real vested interest in the outcomes of education for my child or 
grandchildren, and for her cohort of children. And so, this is not my first time sitting and listening to our 
HR tea laced conversations around transparency, talking and taking us over terrain that we have already 
traversed. Let me share that with you. So in 1945 there was an organization of Civic Unity and they 
looked at issues of educational disparity. In 1945, Gordon Allport who was a member of that civic unity 
committee wrote a book on the bigot in our midst. It was written by Gordon Allport of Harvard 
University. Then in 1958, there was the landlady study that talked about discrimination-how landlady's 
would not rent to African Americans in particular, in certain neighborhoods. In 1960, The Concerned 
Black Parents came together on this very same issue that we are talking about now.  In 1980 the 
Concerned Black [    ] did a report that talked about why black students were not in higher academic 
standing.  In 1990 we had the Successful Black Male report. We had teachers ask us what does a 
successful black male look like? And then in 1990, there was another city wide discussion around race 
and class and Cambridge and we asked was a city wide discussion, engaged everyone and we asked at 
that time for both bodies of the city to put money into race equity. Fast forward-in 1990, remember Peggy 
Averide and the burning of a cross on her lawn? It was it did make a point and she did leave. In 2000 
there was the Native Born Black Report or somthing to that effect. Now it's 2018and we  have the Equity 
Access the expansion of the Equity Access Program, Becoming a Man very underfunded. And now we're 
here at Building Equity Bridges. What am I saying? My favorite quote, and you've heard it before, "We 
can if we want to educate every child whose education is important to us." So why can't we? So if I don't 
get all sort of juiced up about the Building Equity Bridges, it's not because I don't think it's a good 
initiative, I just think we're just doing it agai.  We're doing the same thing. I want to know what the 
outcomes are. If you identified the problem in this report, and I didn't read it as I just got it a couple of 
days ago. My question is what is it that you expect to achieve? When do you expect to achieve it? 
Because it's not about money, so I'm not going to ask about money although I don't think the City Council 
should fund it.  What are you going to tie it to? Are you going to tie it to classroom performance? Are we 
going to stand up and I said "we" because I'm buying into this, make the hard choices, that when we see 
education is not happening for all children in places, take the stand that it takes to do it. Because if we're 
not, then we need to just go home. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:08:24   
I've had the pleasure to be here since 1980. And again, now it's HRT wrap speech, talking about 
transparency and all these other kinds of things with no plan of action in sight. It starts in the 
policymaker, the policy maker which I which we are all so I'm taking responsibility here holding the 
Superintendent accountable for delivering and the Superintendent is supposed to hold department heads

and principals and administrators accountable. If that's not happening, then we might as well not waste 
our time. I had the pleasure and privilege to go to Harlem Children's Zone and Mr. Canada had this 
attitude. If you don't turn it around in a year, you need to do something else. You can plant petunias, raise 
puppies, whatever, but you can't teach children. So my question is, if this is not going to be laced in 
accountability and we are not saying that if a classroom is not performing, maybe you're a really good 
person, but maybe this is not the field for you. Or if you're a really good administrator, but maybe this is 
not a field for you. I just went over over 20 years how many students have left this school district saying 
the same thing that kids that just last year were saying, When are we going to get a fair chance? So with 
that, I will yield the floor. But my question that I don't think is going to be answered is if you're not 
willing to make people accountable make the hard choices grapple with the idea of power and privilege 
and bias, then let's not waste our time. I yield the floor. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:10:07   
Thank you, Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:10:09   
Point of Information Madam Chair. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:10:11   
Councillor Zondervan.   
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:10:12   
Thank you, through you to my colleague, What do you mean when you say HRT? 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:10:19   
It's basically a way of speaking. It comes out of the valley girl model. Most of these conversations here 
have been laced with that. I spend a lot of time talking to African Americans and African American 
parents.  In particular, we talk about wanting people to stop making presentations iusing that vernacular. 
It's insulting. It's insulting to us. It's insulting to a lot of us. And so I just want us to be more mindful 
about using it because it's really becoming systematic about how we make presentations. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:10:58   
I'm going to just repeat the question that I heard which was tying the Building Equity Bridges work to 
outcomes. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:11:08   
I'm not interested in the Building Equity Bridges.  It is just a new label for the same old thing. What I'm 
asking is At what standard are we going to raise up? What what's the goal? How do we know when we 
get there? And what are we going to do if we're not reaching it? You know, let's think-my granddaughter 
is going to be a first grader. Are we going to be in the same place when she walks across the stage? We 
need to have children's voices and we need more transparency and people have to get rid of their power. 
And we have to deal with anti bias. I'm not trying to be disrespectful, I'm just downright out of patience.  
Patience with having the same conversations that we've been having since 1945. So if we're not willing to 
take hard steps. In other words, if you put benchmarks in place and say for purposes of conversation, the 
benchmark is Classroom A. And we say Classroom A, this is where your kids are. And if we don't see 
Classroom a move in a year or two, then maybe we need to make some very difficult choices around who 
is in Classroom A. If Classroom A is doing really well, are we going to reward Classroom A with 
additional tools? What what are we going to do if we don't see some results. In last year's budget, we saw 
that the achievement numbers went up. But the gap did not close appreciably. It's those kind of issues. 
What are you going to do after you've funded programs to make that change to close that gap and it 
doesn't happen. So what I love about Cambridge is we're willing to try new things right? So before we

know what works well or doesn't work, we've already moved to something else. So the question is, how 
are we going to measure success? How long are we going to wait to get it? And what are we going to do 
if we do not get it? The buck stops with us. And in this case, a buck stops with the Superintendent.  I like 
him and he is a nice gentleman, but if he is not doing the work, then we have to evaluate that as well. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:13:29   
Thank you for sharing your opinion Councillor Simmons, we will move on to Councillor Carlone 
followed by the Vice Mayor. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  1:13:36   
Thank you, Madam Mayor. Obviously, this is a very complex and much too long of an issue that hasn't 
been resolved, but actually, as my fellow Councillor just said, the good news is we're the decision makers.  
The leaders are at the front of the table and at the other side, but we are the decision makers. So if we are 
serious we can we can do wonderful things. I  thought the presentation was excellent. I thought it was 
right on. The one thing I said to Khari and Tessa is that it seems to me it's got to start very early with kids 
building their confidence, teaching them what's right and what's wrong about relating to people. I think as 
a city we we don't do a very good job with that. That's something that we've talked about a lot at City 
Council of getting an expanded Pre K program. In my businesses as an architect and urban designer, we 
would do wonderful designs, wonderful strategies, some in Cambridge and they didn't happen and they 
didn't happen because the hardest thing is implementation, understanding the strategy even though you 
get 100% approval, people love it. It's following through. This is a small group of people here that could 
insist, building on what Councillor Simmons said, that it happens. I see nothing wrong with reviving 
ideas, expanding on ideas over the years, and trying again.  If you don't try again, nothing will happen. 
You have to know what you're aiming for. So I salute the effort. I would bet all of us are 100% behind it. 
The key is evaluating it. We in the city do not evaluate many things. That is the key. I'm very glad to have 
been here and I thank you for the invitation and the work that's been done tonight. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:16:05   
Thank you Councillor Carlone. We'll hear from the Vice Mayor and then go to Councillor McGovern 
followed by Councillor Nolan. Vice Mayor. 
 
Member Weinstein  1:16:14   
Thank you, Madam Mayor. I just want to echo and respect my colleague in her frustration. I feel it. I 
appreciate the history and understanding how many times we have been at this point and at a precipice 
when we could make a difference and we haven't. I am frustrated also. Member Bowman mentioned in 
her presentation earlier that we would see numbers and they were being honest about numbers and about 
outcomes. They weren't in this presentation. I'm disappointed about that. I think we can't have a real 
conversation, about equity, about outcomes about accountability without numbers and facts and data. I 
would really like to see the School Department put together some numbers of where we were, where we 
are right now, and to speak to those outcomes, goals and accountability. I think the community has asked 
us all to present a transformative budget for the School Department. Transformative in how its presented, 
how it's written, whose voices are were centered and asked, and how and what is being funded. The 
Building Equity Bridges, while it's not a new idea, while bringing people together and a coalition and a 
cohort to talk about what needs to be done isn't a new idea. I do feel that we are in a moment right now 
where we need to act. Thankfully we have had the last 18 months of proactively cultivating that trust with 
the community, with people and families and youth who we wring our hands out at these meetings and 
say we just can't get them to the table, we just don't know how to reach them. This group has proactively 
cultivated trust with families that are typically hard to reach and brought them to the table to talk about 
the barriers to their children's success. In this city, we do a lot of reporting. We bring together task forces 
and red ribbon commissions. We put together a study and lots of times those go on the shelf. If you're 
doing one about Central Square, and you just spent the last 18 months putting that together and it goes on

a shelf, well, that stinks. When you do it for your kids, and your family, and their outcomes and their 
academic achievements and success, it's personal. We need to treat it that way. I'm glad that we're having 
this conversation now because having it in May is way too late. That's when we had it last time. I feel like 
frustrations and emotions were really running high but we were at a point where we just couldn't. It was a 
train that just kept going. I think having this conversation now and trying to figure out between now and 
when we have to approve the budget, and when the School Committee has to approve the budget, who are 
we bringing to the table and listening to and really thinking about who, who is going to help make these 
decisions about what this transformative budget looks like? What it funds, because it isn't always about 
money. You're absolutely right. It's about political will. It's about knowing what we're going for, what 
those outcomes are, those goals and what the accountability factors are at the end of the day. My question 
is I attended a community meeting on the budget. I want to know how we are engaging those who we 
have engaged over the last 18 years,  months from now, until when the budget is finally presented. How 
are we engaging them? Are we having one more community meeting and we hope that they come? Are 
we having additional meetings with that cohort of people who have come every time? So my question is, 
what is happening between now and when the budget is presented to center those voices that have put in 
the work and would like to see a transformative budget. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:20:26   
Thank you, Vice Mayor. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:20:29   
Councillor McGovern. 
 
Mayor Marc McGovern  1:20:33   
Thank you, Madam Mayor. Thank you for putting this together. One of the things that I spoke about 
seems like just yesterday in this room was what one of the things that I hope to see in the budget is a 
much more intentional, targeted sort of approach to helping students that we know are not performing as 
well as as we would like. I think the number was 14, maybe it was 16, third graders who performed in the 
lowest percentile on the MCAS. You all know my feelings about MCAS. I have very mixed feelings 
about it, but it is a measure. We're not Los Angeles, we're not New York, we're not Chicago. Those are 14 
kids that we know. Right? We know their names, we know their families, we know their dogs. What are 
we doing? We talk a lot about a lot of things and I often say that the hardest thing to say to a parent or 
caregiver is, in five years, we're going to make so much progress. Your son or daughter doesn't have those 
five years to lose, right. I think the Building Equity Bridges work is fantastic. I heard Councillor 
Simmons and I think she's correct.  We have taken a bite at this apple a number of times but there is no 
line item that we're going to put in the budget that's going to eradicate institutional racism. That's just not 
how it works. This is going to be an ongoing conversation, we're going to have to continue to make 
progress. It's not something we're going to solve in a budget but there are targeted things that we can do 
that can really help those kids who we know need more support. I don't care if it's every one of those. I'm 
not the educational expert. Maybe this isn't the right way to go. But I don't know if it's every one of those 
kids gets a mentor, I don't know if it's every one of those kids gets a tutor. I don't know what it is. We 
know who these kids are. We're small enough and we're resourced enough that we could be targeting 
resources more directly to those students than I think we often do. That's something I hope to see. It is 
important to have more conversation about partnerships between the city and schools. I've often said that 
we could have the greatest, buildings in the world, we could have the greatest teachers in the world. If you 
still have kids that are going home to no food or no lights, or who don't have high quality early childhood 
education, or don't have a high quality after school program, then the great teachers and the great 
buildings are only going to be one piece of that. Where are we connecting? What are the city levers that 
we could be pulling on our side and the Council side that's going to support what's going on in the schools 
and in the school district when the students aren't in school. We need more of a conversation of what is 
the holistic picture of this for young people in our city, both on the city side and the school side. Lastly,

the Vice Mayor mentioned political will. I think I've done 10 School Committee budgets directly, and I 
know how this goes, and budget will come out. There's a lot more participation from the community on 
the school side than the city side, people actually show up to the School Committee budget meetings. 
What happens is that mostly groups of people who look a lot more like me than not like me, show up at 
meetings and say, wait a minute, you're cutting that one position from my school? No, no, no, don't do it. 
Don't do it. They put pressure on School Committee members individually and as a committee, and then 
we lose sight of what that vision is, and we back off and we give folks what they want, and it's only 
certain groups of people that have the power and the influence to do that. I encourage you on the School 
Committee to be courageous, and to be strong.If this work around equity is really what's going to center 
us and that means that we're going to have to make adjustments in other places or we're going to have to 
put more money into helping those students who aren't excelling already, then resist the pressure and do 
that. Inevitably what happens is we back off of what our overall values are because we get political 
pressure to do that. The political pressure isn't coming most of the most of the time from the families of 
the kids who really need us to step up for them. Please be strong in that and and I look forward to more 
conversation. Thank you, Madam Chair. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:25:48   
Thank you, Councillor McGovern Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  1:25:57   
It's feeling kind of like home and kind of like a totally new room here. I'm very aware of that. The fact 
that is that this is a new side of the table for me, and I really appreciate all the work that's been done to 
move this forward. I don't think my comments will surprise anyone who has worked with me over the last 
while. I share the views of everyone. I just encourage all of us to remember that at the heart of it, higher 
expectations and goals are what will get us somewhere. It has to be married to a very specific action plan 
we can have all the words we want. The work that has gone into setting the table which is how the 
Building Equity Bridges, which there's been many, many work over my years here and also before that 
decades, it sounds like as Councillor Simmons; history showed us that if we keep that focus and that the 
growth mindset truly has to mean every single student can learn it's a well proven, highly researched, 
unbelievably well documented educational mantra, that growth mindset literally moves the needle on 
achievement. That is at the heart also. I think of anti racism work because in order to have a growth 
mindset, you literally have to believe every single student,  no matter how they look, how they present, or 
what their background is, can really learn. What I encourage us to do is make sure that even though we've 
encouraged more people in the room, there's nothing like a broad based survey to ensure that truly all 
families are heard. You cannot get that no matter how much you outreach into a focus group. It's not the 
same as having a very broad survey of families and students across the board. I also want to encourage all 
of us to take the words of Councillor Carlone and other too, we don't often use our own evaluations. Well 
have some programs that work really well. We need to be building on those. I would make a plea for 
really doubling down on two elements. One is to make sure that the outcome measures have to be 
dramatically changed. We should not have in public that we expect one fifth the number of African 
American students to succeed compared to white students. If we don't believe ourselves that we can't get 
100% of proficiency, we really shouldn't be doing this work. I understand that. I haven't seen the full 
report. But throughout this document, there's a lot of mention of summer programs I really want to hear. 
So what is the plan? If that summer program that MIT led jointly with the district didn't have the results 
that we wanted, then let's build on it to understand why.  I keep coming back to if you actually think about 
the number of students we're talking about to get every single current kindergartener to 100% proficiency 
by third grade, that's three years. It's only a few hundred students. We are not New York, we're not LA, 
we're not even Boston. A few hundred students with an intensive high quality summer program over three 
summers. I am 1,000% sure that our educators with a carefully crafted program can do that. We should do 
it and we must do it. That will go a long way to addressing the inequities that we see later. We know 
there's a reason that practically every district in the state has third grade literacy as a as a goal that they're

working towards. In math we still have schools where ten eighth graders in one school go into geometry 
and successfully complete algebra and another one it's 50 or 60 kids. This is seven years after we 
restructured. Some of us in this room, me crying on the floor took a vote to restructure our school saying 
that will be fixed. It is unconscionable that we just don't talk openly about how it is that that continues to 
happen and more importantly, identify why and then say that will never happen again. We will do 
whatever it takes. I believe highly in targeted high quality summer programs can address that. We can't 
have more reports like that. This is saying, yes, let's have the urgency, but also we can get there. We do 
know there are some issues, let's have a much more disruptive budget, and yet built on research, built on 
data, built on what we know. Our community is really small. We can do this and I will do whatever I can 
from this side of the table to encourage a reallocation of dollars. I personally don't think we need more 
dollars. This is an incredibly generous budget. I do think we have to reallocate and redirect the dollars that 
we have, and have that accountability, front and center and infused into every single evaluation of every 
educator, of every principal, of every administrator in the district to make sure it's tied very closely and I 
believe Councillor Simmons said with Geoffrey Canada that a year is enough to show dramatic progress. 
We know that it can be so I look forward to that. I encourage all of you sitting in those seats to encourage 
us or push us and push our community and push everyone in this district to set the bar really high and 
we'll get there. But we got to set that bar high, it is way too low for all students. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:31:22   
Thank you Councillor Nolan.  
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  1:31:28   
On the School Committeee website there is a dashboard that explicitly lays out what the goals are for all 
of the the outcome measures with specific data year to year.  I personally think they need to be ramped up 
and change it which I had talked about when I was here. You know that when you meet a three year goal 
in one year you should change your goal. If any of you who want it, it is on the website. The dashboard is 
available with the goals that were set by the School Committee 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:31:53   
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  1:31:56   
Thank you for all the work that went into presentations today. My perspective on this is that  I graduated 
high school less than 10 years ago in June 2010. This isn't that far away from me.  I think any high school 
student could address the issues in the district and that there's a lot of talk that ends up happening in City 
Council and School Committee meetings  that doesn't filter back into the classroom debate issues that 
everyone can see. To echo Councillor Simmons points, it's easy to talk about being anti racist, it's harder 
to address the big structural changes that we know are perpetuating racism in our district, and economic 
inequality. One of the main ways that we're going to do that is through the budget. I think an analogy that 
I think of a lot on the City Council is that when we're talking about affordable housing is not how strong 
the City Council statement on affordable housing is, it is how much are we putting into the budget? What 
are we including on the zoning. I hope we have a strong statement around affordable housing, but that's 
not going to be the main way I'm judging if the Council is doing or not doing enough work. I echo Vice 
Mayor Mallon's point that I would have liked to see more metrics on the presentation. What are the 
achievement gaps between white students and students of color at different grade levels? How are we 
addressing that in the budget? How many educators of color do we have? How many are we retaining? 
Where do we want to get to? How are we addressing that in the budget? What's the gap? Who's going to 
college or technical school between white students and students of color? How are we addressing that in 
the budget? I think the question I have is around universal Pre K and how we're thinking of that in the 
budge. It wasn't mentioned in the presentation. I think it's one of the strongest things we can do to address 
anti racism because we know that there's a big correlation between white families and families of color in

terms of economic resources, and that if you have resources, you can get your your child into a Pre k 
program and if you're not you're really reliant on the city. I think it's something that the Council and 
School Committee have talked about for a long time. How do we get to universal Pre K. We still think 
there's a chicken or an egg in terms of spatial issues. I know there was a roundtable shortly before I 
started on the City Council but we're still a ways off in terms of how do we get to Pre K, how do we get 
the space? How do we get the resources for it? I think one of the strongest things we can do to address 
racism is having a concrete plan there. I would like to address that in the budget. Thank you. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:34:21   
Thank you, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:34:25   
Councillor Toomey. Would you like to go last? Okay, Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  1:34:44   
Thank you, Madam Mayor. First of all, I want to affirm the comments from my colleagues. I pretty much 
agree with all of them. I have two children who went through the public school system here, and one of 
them is doing really great and was very successful in the system. One was not. We had to, unfortunately, 
take him out of the school because it was not able to provide him with what he needs. We were fortunate 
that we could, as a family, provide him with the education that he needed. But what keeps me up at night 
is all of his friends who do not have those resources, and who do not have the education that they need to 
be successful and the support that they need to be successful. So I share the frustration. I'm particularly 
intrigued by the comments about political will because the only political tool that we have at the Council 
level at the end of the day is our vote on the budget. Councillor Kelley and I were the only two 
councillors who voted against the budget last year. Councillor Simmons voted against the School budget, 
but she did not vote against the entire budget and I did and Councillor Kelley did, because we want it to 
be clear that the budget was not acceptable to us in terms of equity. I'm really encouraged by the change 
in the conversation here today and the great work that's going on in Building Equity Bridges, and really 
want to commend Khari and Tessa for their work and for their presentation. I think it's really important 
and I understand the frustration that we've been talking about this for more than half a century longer than 
I've been alive. I don't believe we've talked about it this clearly and honestly before. To hear, essentially, 
the statement that our school system and our entire system is racist is encouraging to me because once we 
name that, once we begin to grapple with that reality, we have a chance of making it better. If we're 
dancing around it, and we're not naming it, then that's when we get into trouble. I'm encouraged to see 
that the school system will be coming out with an anti racism statement. One of my many questions is, 
when will that happen and what's the process for drafting that statement? In terms of equity, not just in 
our school system, but in our in our city. One of the issues that we've been talking about for quite some 
time now is municipal broadband and access to the internet, which is a phenomenal resource that allows a 
lot of people to bypass some of the inequities that previously prevented them from access to information 
and access to resources. Ufortunately, the city has so far refused to provide universal high speed internet 
access to everyone. We invented the internet in the United States of America. We have some of the worst 
internet access in the world today, just less than 20 years later. So I think that is an important issue that 
we need to address when we talk about equity, not just for students, but in general. Another question I 
have is the role School Councils and whether we have functioning School Councils for all of our schools, 
and how they have been included in this process. I completely agree with my colleagues that I want to see 
numbers. I know that the achievement gap is visible on our dashboard. I've seen it, but I want to see it in 
these presentations. I want to see what our new goals are. Are we going to simply perpetuate the 
achievement gap? That's not acceptable. If that's what comes before us in May, I will vote against the 
budget again.

Some of the numbers that were shown to us are not clear. The budget increase is great, and it is quite 
large, but without knowing what the enrollment numbers are, we can't really tell. Is this increase simply 
matching the enrollment, is it going beyond enrollment? At the high level, it masks the details as 
Councillor McGovern stated. Without knowing where specific funds are going, we don't know if this 
increase is going to impact our equity concerns or not. So we want to see those numbers. Again, if the 
process is that we don't get to see that until May, I think we will not have the outcomes that we're looking 
for and hopefully more of my colleagues will be voting against the budget if that is how it's presented to 
us because that's not acceptable. My last question is around climate change. I mentioned this last year as 
well. The future is not looking good and we are not educating our students on that issue and we're not 
preparing them for the challenges that they're facing because of climate change and our inaction on that 
issue. We have seen in the last year, student activists, including Greta Tunberg, most famously, really 
speak out on this issue and really bring attention to it. It really impacts the younger generations in a very 
different way than it impacts some of us who are a bit older. So I need to see  in our budget for me to vote 
in favor of it, how we are addressing that issue. It's not just about teaching our students math and reading. 
It's about teaching them what the world is like that they are facing, and what opportunities exist for them 
to participate in meaningful change as we adapt to climate change, and as we start to take real action on it. 
So I would like to see more information on how that is being addressed in the budget. Thank you. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:42:09   
Thank you, Councillor Toomey. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  1:42:16   
Thank you, Madam Mayor. I apologize for my unexpected delay in getting here this evening. This will be 
my 35th year voting on a School budget. Mr. Fantini has probably exceeded me for a couple of years.  I'm 
very heartened to hear one of my colleagues saying that we have to address and get the data in 
accountability. It's probably a personnel matter, but at some point, I hope that the Superintendent can 
share with us that personnel changes have been made because of poor performance. I will not be inclined 
to vote for any more additional funding. We are spending, spending spending. We just can't keep 
throwing money at the issue. It's time to think out of the box and I think of one example and I correct me 
if I'm wrong. I recently heard that in one of the elementary schools that retired teachers were tutoring 
students in first and second grade that were having difficulty reading math on a one on one basis, but that 
program was discontinued.  That is no longer being provided to those students. These are the type of 
things that I think we should be looking at expanding, not curtailing or cutting. It's the one on one 
attention. We know who the children are. Why those resources are not doubled or tripled to assist those 
students.  Some of the kids in the system are going to succeed no matter what. They they are on a 
trajectory to be very successful and that is tremendous. At the same time, we have to recognize that there 
are some families and some students that aren't as fortunate and how we direct more resources to those 
students is what has to take place thinking out of the box. I haven't been as involved with the schools as I 
once was when I was on the School Committee many years ago but as Councillor Simmons said, we have 
been talking about this forever.  The City Manager has been very generous. I think it's almost a $12 
million increase in School budget this year. What results are we going to see with that increase.  I 
certainly voted against the School budget in the past due to different issues. I still have very major 
concerns about our vocational program that I think is sorely lacking.  There are some students that are not 
going to go to college, and they need the vocational training. I don't think that there is enough focus on 
that area and it is very, very unfortunate. So it's a new School Committee and I'm looking forward to this 
great excitement and new City Council members but this is nothing new.  This is my 35th year voting on 
a School budget and waiting to see how that's going to pan out. The Mayor is a recent graduate of the 
school and she's a perfect example. Mayor Siddiqui should be the model as to what every student should 
be able to accomplish in our school system.  She's a prime example of a what can happen with the right 
resources and the right direction. To me, that is what it's all about. There are many kids that are not 
getting that same opportunity as the Mayor has been given. It's frustrating for a lot of people. There's no

question about that. I I know there are union issues, but the kids come as far as I'm concerned. The 
Nativity Prep School in Roxbury students come from the most disadvantaged families, and they're all 
graduating at the top and going off to college. Why is that happening in those communities, and not here? 
That has always puzzled me. Something drastic has to take place. Money is not the issue. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:47:17   
Thank you Councillor Toomey. We started a little bit late so what I'm going to do now is briefly hear 
from my School Committee members if they'd like to comment on anything that's been said briefly. I'm 
going to toss it back to the Superintendent. Taking Councillor Simmons' recommendation, there will be a 
follow up to this conversation. We've all noted questions and we will do everything to answer those 
questions.  I will go to Vice Chair Bowman first.   
 
Vice Chair Bowman  1:47:57   
With all due respect, Mayor, I don't think it's what wise to have the School Committee give brief 
comments, because this is a roundtable and we're supposed to be in conversation with our colleagues and 
our administration. I do recognize that the time is short right now. But if there's a possibility to extend the 
meeting, I think that's important because, quite frankly, I don't really like the tenor of this conversation. 
The City Council, while I appreciate your frustration, I have the same frustration, a lot of frustration as it 
relates to changing the opportunity and equity gaps within our school district. But I believe that it needs to 
be a conversation around a partnership. A partnership doesn't look like the City Council coming in here, 
and having the type of conversation that we're having, and then the School Committee don't get to be back 
in conversation with them. So I think that's a bit problematic. If we can t extend the meeting by 15 or 20 
minutes, I'll be mindful of my minutes. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:48:54   
So Vice Chair, I think the goal of this meeting for me, is that it is important to hear from the City Council 
about the themes that are coming up and the questions that are coming up. , I think the tenor is complex, 
but I do think assuming good intentions we're here for a reason. I think the goal is to share that input and 
then to have further conversations and have a conversation. But you know, I think that the goal was, since 
most of us have seen this information, to hear from my colleagues, so that's why I did the structure that I 
did. You've asked the meeting to be extended 15 minutes. I'm happy to do that if people are comfortable 
with that. So on the meeting will be extended by 15 minutes and then hear from members starting from 
from the Vice Chair and then I'll probably go alphabetically if that works. I'll go to Member Fantini after 
as Budget Co-Chair. 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons  1:49:59   
Madam Chair, I do respect my colleague, the Vice Chair, but I do have to leave. I do apologize in 
advance. I want to say very briefly, I agree with you having served on the School Committee. I look 
forward to having this conversation again. Maybe we lead with the School Committee, and the City 
Council sit there and listen and have the opportunity to have a real exchange. Again, I do apologize to my 
colleagues, I do have a hard stop at 7:30. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:50:21   
Thank you Councillor. Vice Chair.   
 
Vice Chair Bowman  1:50:24   
Yes, I'll be mindful of my comments and my time. I do want to just acknowledge the concern and the 
angst that all of my colleagues have expressed. As I said earlier, I feel it too. It is one of the things that 
has driven a different approach to our budget process. I recognize that these issues are complex, but I 
want to just address a couple of things as it relates to some of the things my colleagues said. They said 
that voting the budget up or down is one of the few things that they can do to influence the budget. I just

want to fundamentally reject that. You have levers on your side, you have Community Schools. How are 
you leveraging those institutions to be in conversation with the school district? I wonder where my 
colleagues were when we had a whole conversation about extending the day. We know that there are 
certain cohorts of kids within our school district that need that time but there was a disconnect as it relates 
to that conversation when it came to the district and where City Councilors came in or out of that. Since 
we weren't able to move that forward, then how do you leverage the fact that we do have an infrastructure 
in place-community schools- to ensure that a certain percentage of the programming that's offered has an 
academic component. That's innovation, that's partnership. I think the way in which we solve these 
problems is not necessarily coming to the School Committee and saying the things that you know, X, Y 
and Z, I think that's a part of the conversation. Innovation happens when we recognize the resources that 
we have and we leverage them in a way that's going to benefit all of our kids when we know that there are 
systems and externalities that block us from being able to implement certain programming that we think 
would move the needle. I would also push on my colleagues right now in real time, we're having a whole 
conversation about the Tobin building. You want to talk about equity, you want to talk about access. 
Right now we are talking about decreasing the number of Pre K slots and programs that would be there, 
because people have a value proposition of open space. 
 
Vice Chair Bowman  1:52:35   
So we talk about wanting to put forth universal Pre K in place, but we have these opportunities right 
before us. What will be your vote on that? What will be your decision? So I think that having a 
conversation that is real, as relates to both of the opportunities that we have, whether that's on the School 
Committee side, and the City side to be able to move the needle on educational issues is something that 
we all need to look in the mirror at because your ability to influence academic achievement is not 
necessarily just caught up in whether or not you vote a budget up or down. I just think is really important 
for all of us to know that. I think it's important for the public to know that. It is not a one way 
conversation, it is a two way conversation about how we leverage resources and data. I'm right there with 
you. I fundamentally believe that that should have been a part of our conversation tonight, and we will 
make sure for the next conversation that is in front of you, instead of directing you to a website so I take 
full agency and ownership of that, but I just believe we have to have this conversation differently if we're 
all committed to really being able to meet some of these major disparities in our in our school district. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:53:51   
Member Fantini. 
 
Unknown Speaker  1:53:53   
Thank you Madam Mayor. I want to you know, and thank the City Council.  This is being done early 
enough. I really want to just hear what the City Councilors had to say, and thank you for your honesty and 
your directness. I  think that's a goodplace to start. For me, the achievement gap is a very persistent gap. 
It's persistent in Massachusetts, it is persistent throughout the whole country.  I think when you actually 
get the data, you will see that we have made progress in the many of these areas so I think it's good to 
have the data. The data is good after to come together again and say, do we want to implement some 
accelerated methods to close the achievement gap? I think we can have those conversations. You have 
every right to ask that we close this achievement gap. I think that is a good focus. The only thing I would 
in terms of something I want the City to think about is that the King Open Afterschool Day Proram which 
is only in one school is a great model.  The teachers in that program actually spend an hour and a half or 
so inside the classes of the King Open School, collaborating with teachers. That seems to be a model that 
is very effective and strategic in doing the work that we need to do as a partnership. I would ask the City 
Council to think about ways of expanding that on the City end to to some of our other schools. That 
would be something that would be worthwhile to consider. I haven't examined it fully myself, but I think 
it's a good place to start. So maybe we can have that conversation as well. Thank you, Madam Mayor.

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  1:55:33   
Thank you, Member Fantini. Member Green, would you like to say anything? Okay. Member  Kanner? 
 
Member Kanner  1:55:46   
I would like to thank the City Council for coming here in this discussion and in this context.  I did feel it 
was acceptable and made sense that coming here you would point out the flaws in this system and what 
the current system is doing wrong and I accept that. But this is something that we're going to work 
together on. This is something that we all have power to change in our own different ways. Speaking 
about specific things to change. About the mental health and trauma supports at the school, recently I was 
talking to my friends, I was just talking to a lot of students and I was kind of baffled at how little I knew 
and how little my friends and my peers knew about really just what's available to us in terms of mental 
health services. Then I went and I talked to the mental health services, I talked to the people on the Teen 
Health Center, and I reached out to a social worker in the learning community haven't heard back yet. I 
reached out to them and I found out there's a lot of real red tape around actually getting mental health 
help. You need to really to have like any real professional help you need to get your parents involved. 
You need to get written consent and you need to go through this whole process where everyone really 
gets involved and gets all into what the specific students problems are. I know that's something a lot of 
students feel really uncomfortable about. So I think a big part of that is first making sure students know 
what's available to them. We're going to try and work on that. Also making sure that we can make this 
process as accessible to students as possible. Mental health and trauma services affect all students and are 
something that is really beneficial for everyone in the community. Then just about increasing educational 
outcomes for all students, of course, that starts at the youngest, with universal Pre K. That's been 
discussed a lot tonight. There's definitely a lot of different ways this can happen. I will confess, I don't 
know too much about the different ways that universal Pre K has tried to be implemented in the past or 
the ways it is worked or it is not working. But it's definitely something that would be extremely beneficial 
to the community. And then also going through middle school, it is really our middle school communities 
that need to be engaged and connected and not apathetic to our students. That really means it doesn't it 
can be outside of the classroom, it can be an after school programs, it can be with tutoring, one on one 
help with students is extremely beneficial, just making sure they feel connected with their teachers and 
with their educational support. So then in high school, we've recently started tracking, we have that like 
base level of class, and really just making sure that students feel engaged in that there's good project 
based engagement learning in those classes. When there are classes with high levels of students leaving 
with high levels of like absenteeism in that class, it's as much of the teachers fault as the students. When 
we're looking at those classes, if we see a class with high levels of absenteeism, and we see a teacher that 
may not be connecting with our students, we need to do something there. We can't just look at it and say, 
Oh, well, we'll put it in a performance report. And we'll look and see if it happens over a few years. If it's 
going on, if there's a class that has a high pattern of absenteeism, we need to do something and change 
that. I was actually really surprised to see something about increasing dual enrollment. It's a really great 
idea because dual enrollment taking classes at Harvard is an amazing resource that is available to students 
at CRLS. AIt is unknown to a lot of students. It kind of exists behind a wall. To break down that wall, you 
need to know what's behind the wall. We need to make sure students know that that's available to them 
that they can take classes at Harvard and at the Extension School for free. Also, creating a pipeline to 
those kind of classes where if they pursue a certain courseload if they pursue like a certain set of classes, 
then they will be able to take Dual Enrollment classes that would also be very beneficial. It is really an 
amazing resource. It would really promote studentship to just let people know what is available to them 
and accessible if they choose to try and get to that. Thank you for now.

I really appreciate your comments Member Kanner. I have a few reflections and then three questions and 
first, like like others, I want to just appreciate the City Council and City Manager and Budget Director 
and Assistant City Manager for coming up for this really critical conversation. As you know, our budget 
is a statement of our values and it's a moral document. And so this is critical. And speaking to a couple of 
the barriers that Khari and Tessa laid out and the Building Equity Bridges, particularly barrier six the 
power and decision making and it isn't equitably distributed and barriers three and four around youth and 
educators of color not being centered in the budget process. I'm very interested in how the budget process 
itself can continue to evolve. Like I think we've made some initial first steps thanks to the Co-Chairs, 
Vice Vice Chair Bowman and Member Fantini for the community forums, but then now that we've had 
that initial input, I'm really eager to see who is consulted in taking these broad ideas and translating them 
into plans. So what that means in some ways. If we look at the actions that are in progress, like I'm really 
excited to see the incident response is underway. That staff training, so the mandatory stuff training. 
Whose participating and what happens to support the implementation. We know training alone is not 
enough, right? So what comes after that? Who's doing the coaching? Who's providing us that peer 
feedback? Is it supervisors feedback? What does that look like in this office of equity in particular? I will 
just flag because I share the frustration about not having numbers yet. That we need more than a chief 
equity officer, right? We need a team and the Office of Equity. So if we're talking about a handful of 
people, what does it look like? Who's crafting that? What those roles are? How are all of the stakeholders 
who've been part of BEB who the CEA, the administrators, the school, you know, principals, families 
want to make sure that we're not rushing these solutions, like we know we have some great ideas but be 
really thoughtful about it, so that we're not in the same place in a few years. So I'm one question is, which 
which of these stakeholders are part of developing Office of Equity following up to mandatory training, 
and then related to the not rushing it like on the one hand, I've have this shared sense of urgency around 
we have these young people in front of us now we have them for 13 years. And that's it right. We don't 
have a chance to make it right after that. But we also have to do it thoughtfully. In terms of the budget 
process, a question for the City Manager, and for the Chief Financial Officer, as well as the 
Superintendent is, how can we set aside the needed resources to then have an Office of Equity come 
school year 2021, but not spell out by March 8, or whatever it is March 12, precisely what those positions 
are, so that we have the time to be thoughtful in community about what does this office look like? What is 
the process going to look like? So I guess what I'm asking is how do we balance securing the resources, 
and then continuing to get input and feedback and not just looking at what others might not very much 
appreciate that you said you're looking at what other districts do for us offices of equity, but what in this 
particular context is going to work with Cambridge, Cambridge public schools history, the continent, the 
local context. Similarly, for universal Pre K, I think many of us have said, this is probably the best thing 
we can do to close gaps. How can we make sure that we set those resources aside, turn to Ms. McDonald 
and Ms. Semonoff who have been championing this work, and I'm so grateful for everything they've done 
and then make sure that as they are getting ready to say, here's what we think works, folks, we have those 
resources ready to go. So that's so my questions are really about, about process and the follow up, right. 
So we've had these initial really good input sessions. How do we have, including for us, a less formal 
conversation, so maybe Mayor Siddiqui, something to put in terms of planning this follow up 
conversation is, is there a way to do it in a less formal way where we each take a turn, maybe we're in 
small groups, maybe we even turned to the folks who have facilitated non traditional meetings to think 
about what are the strategies for deeper engagement rather than one person talking at a time and not 
getting to respond to others. I will leave it there for now. I really appreciate this opportunity and that 
everyone is so passionate and committed.

Thank you, Mayor. And thank you to the city for being here. And thank you for the City Council for 
being here and for all the public as well. So first, I just want to acknowledge the tension that was here in 
the room and and and I appreciate it, because it's real. That tension that you feel at the City Council, you 
only have one goal on the vote.  As Vice Chairman said there's a lot of other ways that we could 
collaborating. I can see both sides of you having that there's one chance to voice your attention versus 
more the longer term conversation that we should be having as far as how we collaborate. I took notes, a 
lot of notes about all the things you brought up. I hope that when we present a budget, we can point out in 
the budget, how we're addressing those concerns that you brought up. Thank you for bringing this up. 
And I just have two questions for the city. City Manager, thank you very much for your presentation and 
on the numbers. So I just got a question. You've talked about all the increases that the city has done for 
the school budget, which we greatly appreciate. As some of the people have said, maybe we need to focus 
more about not so much the increases but just how we're spending the money. Can you give us a taste of 
how the percentage in city budget increases compared to the increases in other areas in the city budget? 
The second has to do with the state. It was interesting to see that for this year. The budgeting includes an 
increase in state aid. I know that in the past the budget always assumes that state aid stays flat and when 
the state is higher than that, that's just extra money that's in the budget that sort of gets relocated, etc. In 
this case, if we were assuming an increase in state aid, what would happen if the state didn't get to that 
increase? Would the city be willing to match any shortfall? 
 
Louis DePasquale, City Manager  2:07:18   
I'll be happy to try to answer them. Let's start with state aid. State aid is a very confusing formula in terms 
how the city treats the school because Cambridge, probably unlike any other city, takes the additional 
assistance, which is state aid goes to the cityies not to the school and gives a share of it to the school, it's 
been that way forever. So rather than individually on an annual basis, adjusting the school items, it's 
adjusted after the budget, but the numbers are built into the taxes. So if it went up, we've absorbed it one 
way if it goes down, we would absorb it the other way. This is very confusing, but I want to make this 
very clear.  School has never been punished since we've put this formula in place where state aid was 
increased at the expense of the School Department. I want to assure people of that.  It is a confusing 
formula. Also, when state aid has gone down, the city has never gone back again and looked at it the other 
way as well. It's just a formula that works on the state aid. However, due to some of the concerns that 
were addressed this year, for us, it's a neutral way of financing. So we put it in because there was some 
confusion around it. But in terms of state aid, the school always gets their share of specific state aid and 
gets over and above that, on the city side, and we usually use that balance as a balancing act till the 
following year comes out to make it happen. So if there was an issue with state aid that's on us. We've 
already recommended the number we certainly would not go back for a recision. But that's one of the 
reasons why the formula we put in place was more protective in the sense that it waits till the numbers of 
final. What happens with the state often is by the time the process starts and the time to process says 
you've had four different numbers. So rather than us trying to pick one in the middle of that process, 
we've said, take the previous year and then adjust it the following year. I understand that that can be 
confusing. That's why we moved the money up front. In terms of the overall budget, and we have all the 
numbers, I think as the city budget has grown some years the city's budget has grown faster, some years 
the school has grown faster. But I think what we didn't talk about tonight is there's a lot of city expenses 
that also help to go support the school. I've never looked at this as an us versus them.  We have all those 
numbers but to me, the school is a city department. They're part of us. We've addressed the needs by 
trying to work with the Superintendent. I've gone through a lot of school budgets, as Budget Director, 
Finance Director and City Manager, and we've never really said that I can remember, you can do this 
because this is what the city is doing. We've said your a department like every department, tell us what 
you need but you are the largest tax supported department and I will try to balance that. So I would say 
safely that I believe from a City Manager's point of view, the school has been treated incredibly faily will 
continue to be treated failry.  The City Council has made it clear that the school and the education of this 
system is incredibly important. If the City Manager did not recognize that and didn't work closely with

the Superintendent and the Mayor, there would have been a lot more budget issues that we would have 
heard of in 35 years that I've been involved in. In 35 years, I think we had one year where there was some 
disagreement between the school and the city that quickly got worked out. It really has been a team 
approach. There are different things that are involved. As population goes up in the school, that's another 
factor in determining the budget. As we need different resources in different areas, that's another factor. 
Should we take the debt service that we're putting to all these schools and say, well, because the school's 
doing that you impact the operating budget? Well, that would be crazy. So these are little things that as a 
city, we avoid where other cities can't. One of the reasons for that is fortunately, we are the strongest 
financially sound city in the Commonwealth, maybe in the United States, to be very honest. that gives us 
opportunities to say, no, we're not doing these, we need to take a look at what the needs are,  address 
when the population is moving up, address when they're looking for key incentives and make sure that 
budget is fair. We will continue to do that. It really is a team effort. If you look at the numbers and  
putting it all together, they're relatively close in terms of the growth, some years it's on the city side, some 
years it's on the schoo. Again, we've never tried to look at it that way. It's been more of what are the 
needs. As you balance those needs, it is a driving factor because in the tax part, it's a such a large numbe 
that obviouslyl, if the taxes went way up, it would have tremendous impact on all tax bills. One thing that 
I will continue to say that I think is important. I believe no city in the Commonwealth provides the 
services we do. I can tell you no city in the Commonwealth spends $500 million dollars on three schools. 
We've been able to do this without one issue around people complaining about taxes. We've been able to 
manage our taxes. When taxes go crazy, if they ever do, then it will change the story of how we do things. 
It's why are you doing that? Why are you not doing this? This isn't right. The ability to do all we can do 
yet let the residents not feel like it's coming out of their pocket in tremendously high number is really one 
of the key successes in making this work so that we don't have Well, if the city's up 3%, the schools got to 
be up 3% or We don't have children in school so why is that going up that much? or We don't use that city 
service so why is that going up? So how we look at that is strictly on an individual basis. As needs come 
up, we support them.  
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  2:13:20   
I think you have given a good overview. Mr. Rojas, what I would recommend is that you have a one on 
one discussion with the City Manager. Member Green followed by Member Wilson and Member 
Weinstein and then we will close. 
 
Member Green  2:13:44   
There are a lot of thoughts going in my mind right now. So it was hard for me to synthesize everything at 
once. But there are two things I actually wanted to touch on. hearing what member Kanner was talking 
about. Member Bowman said this earlier about how there's so many resources in this district. We might 
not need more money but to more evaluate the  resources we have. And I think what Hirsch was saying 
about the mental health resources at the high school and dual enrollment with Harvard, and BAM, and 
other programs like that. There's so many things. A lot of students don't know about them. My experience 
with dual enrollment, it's been predominantly male students, predominantly white students who are taking 
advantage of that. In regards to mental health, I think very few students know about the resources at the 
high school about the social workers. I didn't know about it. I found it very difficult when I was myself 
looking for mental health resources in the city. And so I think that for students who don't have family 
support, who are encouraging them to look for it, it would be even harder. Another point - as we were 
looking through this presentation, I think like half a dozen times, it talked about youth voices being 
centered and then going off the other recommendations like reviewing curriculum. I think a great way to 
center youth voices would be right there. I think that the city could spend tons of money reviewing the 
total curriculum. But I think if you asked a handful of students, what areas of your curriculum do you 
think could use more representation? I think you'd get amazing answers right from the students in our 
district. I don't think you need a whole team to pour money into looking for that when you have students 
who could give you those answers right away. For student groups, so we were talking about creation and

ongoing investment in youth councils from predominantly marginalized communities, I think that the 
existing groups in our communities aren't really feeling the support or investment at all. Before we create 
new groups, I think we should evaluate how you're supporting the current ones and how they are feeling 
at this moment in time. Furthermore, there was another point on the BEB about looking at discipline 
procedures and I think that's another thing where students have repeatedly shown their opinions on it. If 
you If you want to center youth more in this process, then you could engage with them or support them on 
the issues that they're tackling in regards to discipline, and particularly the detention policy at the high 
school has been talked about a lot in student government and BSU as well. There are a lot of easy ways 
that are right within reach of this committee in regards to centering youth voices.  I don't really think 
that's something that you can't achieve. I think that if you're dedicated to addressing a lot of these things, 
then that's a pretty important part. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  2:16:32   
Thank you Member Green. You've already spoken Member Kanner so I'm going to go to Member 
Weinstein and then Member Wilson. 
 
Member Weinstein  2:16:43   
Thank you. I will start very briefly by again thanking the City Manager and his team, Khari Milner and 
Tessa Bridge and everybody who's been involved with Building Equity Bridges. I've appreciated having 
multiple opportunities to see presentations. It just gets better every time, and I able to focus in on different 
aspects each time, and to all the City Councillors for being here engaging in this so deeply. What I really 
hope is that this is part of a continued move in the further direction of coordinating efforts with with the 
city, with this School Committee and members and City Councillors in particular. In general, I think it's 
been touched on by a number of people, so that we're really taking care of our children, birth through post 
grad. At every step of the way, there's roles for the School Department and for the city. I don't think we'll 
really be as successful as we can be without really coordinating that so that we really are focused on the 
same goals and making sure that nobody falls through the cracks. There's this model what's been been 
called success plans for all and I think as a Councillor McGovern and Councillor Nolan and others have 
mentioned, we're all aware we are a small enough city to be able to really truly know every every child 
and nobody, nobody should fall through the cracks. It may be that at school we're identifying a need, like 
food, that the school actually in that case can help meet. That also needs to be met met by another city 
service or maybe there's an after school piece or anyway, that kind of coordination I don't think or that 
kind of meeting that need I don't think can happen without that coordination. That's what i what i want to 
see us do so that every child in this city has their needs met. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  2:18:45   
Thank you, Member Wilson. 
 
Member Wilson  2:18:47   
Thank you, Madam Chair. And thank you to the City Manager and your team as well as the City 
Councillors for being here and to my colleagues for sharing. I really appreciated all the feedback that you 
all had given and as well as, again, just really thinking about how can we continue to have robust 
conversations, which I don't think that this was but more like how do we actually have that and have 
healthy conversations as we are trying to push the city forward in a great way and to becoming more of an 
anti racist district, not just on a School Committee level, but as a city as a whole. I appreciate that and 
look forward to those opportunities. Just a couple of comments that I have. I took down a lot of notes as a 
kid who grew up in this city had my whole K to 12 be in Cambridge. I really appreciate it. Councillor 
Simmons sentiments around the history and kind of repeating a lot of this and we being here several times 
over and over. I agree and I personally have experienced, and so it's really important for me to make sure 
that we are thinking intentionally about how we are moving our city forward, how we are addressing the 
needs of our kids. I have been explicitly direct with saying we need to make sure that there are plans in

place for any young person who was failing. Third grade is not literate by third grade. We need to make 
sure that there are intentional factors being put in for those young people to support them. When we think 
about especially in our last year, which has been an ongoing issue, but in our last year has been even more 
relevant is around the the challenges around equity and the race, the racism that our young people have 
been experiencing in our schools, and really looking for the work of the BEB, and how do we move 
forward and how do we support it? I think the Office of Equity is a great place for us to be and really 
thinking about, again, being intentional of what does that look like? How do we lay out the framework so 
we're not just trying to drop a little nugget out there to say, let's give this a try without really fully having 
a plan. I want us to be really clear on what our plans are looking like in order to really make change in the 
city. I really feel like I can go on and on the mental health as a social worker thinking about our young 
people, I am in this building every single day. I don't want to get emotional but it's a serious thing. When 
we're thinking about mental health and trauma and what our young people are experiencing day in and 
day out. If you don't walk this hall, please, you cannot really speak to what our young people need in 
order to be successful in this city. When we are failing, when we are graduating our young people, and 
then they come back to the city a year later, two years later, and they are nowhere. It's shameful and it's 
our fault. I will say it's our fault. We really need to do more and we need to be intentional from junior 
kindergarten how we are setting our kids up for success. Looking at the individual success plans, and how 
we're going to really implement that and be successful with that implementation. So again, I think I can 
go on but I really just want to stop there. It's been a long night. We have a lot of work to do my friends, 
and we really need to roll up our sleeves and do it, everyone. Again, I just want to touch on that- together, 
we are better. We need to stop operating in our own silos because that's not how we're going to move this 
city forward in a cohesive and more productive way. We have to work as a community. So thank you. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  2:22:33   
Thank you remember Wilson, I'll speak after the Superintendent and then we'll wrap up. 
 
Superintendent Salim  2:22:45   
Thank you Mayor Siddiqu. I appreciate the conversation and the challenge of this format and and the 
limitations of having a dialogue and certainly there were certain choices that we had to make in terms of 
information that was shared. Certainly here the strong interest in grounding the conversations in outcomes 
data. I will say that one of the things I  am proud of is the fact that we are trying to be much more open 
and public around what our challenges are. That can be part of our dialogue. And so not just the data 
dashboard online. We have an annual outcomes report, which we'll share with with Councillors that the 
committee members are familiar with, and that we do want to have data and evidence be part of the 
conversation. That is where the work of the Building Equity Bridges team has also engaged in with with 
the sense of making teams of looking at some of those data. We certainly can share some of that in 
advance of what that next convening might be. The urgency that everyone has shared around the table is 
one that I know that all the School Committee Members hold and that administration and leadership and 
our district hold and that how do we make sure that we're identifying what are those priorities that we're 
investing in that we think are going to really produce the outcomes that we want because to do everything 
all at once, is means that we're not doing everything effectively well, and that the idea around having a 
district plan and the idea around identifying what the levers are is to really look at where we're going 
deep. Because whatever level of the organization, whether you're talking about a classroom teacher, a 
professional school base administrator, a central administrator, if we're talking about 25 different things 
that we're not really appreciably changing the experiences for our students and our families and that is in 
many ways what the work is to identify clearly what is our big bets? What is how are we looking at 
changing these outcomes? And what are the steps along the way? We we get some of these measures only 
on an annual basis so what are the other ways that we're also measuring progress over the course of the 
year. So definitely want to just share that both our urgency and also making sure that we are in dialogue 
around what we are identifying as those outcomes for our students in CPS. We shared a number of 
questions at different altitudes and so we will also be spending time and looking at ways of both in the

follow up discussion but also if there are other ways of also sharing more information in advance that we 
can do that as well for free things that can be done in that mode. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui  2:26:03   
Thank you, Superintendent. I want to thank everyone for coming today. I had viewed the minutes from 
the last few roundtables and one thing that came up was, for me, I didn't want this conversation from the 
City Council to happen in May. I think it's important that the School Committee or administration, hear 
from you, and also then engage with the School Committee, and I think all of us have a better idea. This is 
the first step. It's February 12. We're working backwards. I'm committed to having those conversations, 
getting those questions answered, and having a back and forth dialogue. We are two bodies, but it is one 
goal and that is the students here. I'd like to thank the BEB team for coming as well. I think reflecting on 
this work that was funded by a grant that we apply for and got and now we have an opportunity to think 
about these barriers and what we do. I think it is important that  we think about how are we supposed to 
fund this, this mandate, if this is something we are interested in, or some some things that are part of the 
commitments that we're already doing. So I'm open to those conversations and seeing how we elevate 
some of this work, because I haven't gone through it and read it and and seeing how, what's come out of 
it, I think it is, it's different. And it is a different time. And I think we are motivated in a different way as 
well. And so, and I hear those frustrations too. So I want to acknowledge that and it's  a very complex 
issue we're dealing with and more personally, I failed the MCAS.  I didn't pass them cast in 10th grade. I 
failed the math math completely. I remember that moment. I failed and my life could have gone this way- 
it went this way. And there's a lot of reasons for that. And to Councillor Toomey's point, there are barriers 
that are getting in the way of low income students of color every day. We have to every day work hard 
and figure that out. o I'm committed to that. I know the School Committee is committed that the City 
Council is committed that so this partnership has to continue. This is the first  meeting and I look forward 
to convening more and having ongoing partnerships. Next time I'll provide lunch, maybe have a lunch 
meeting, and have a have a conversation then but we will work diligently on setting up these meetings 
and getting the information that you requested and go from there. So thank you for coming. On a motion 
from Councillor McGovern to adjourn.  Goodnight.
