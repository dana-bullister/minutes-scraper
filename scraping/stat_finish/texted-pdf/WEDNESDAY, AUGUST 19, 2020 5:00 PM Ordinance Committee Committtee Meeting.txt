The Ordinance Committee will meet to reconvene a public hearing on a petition to add an 
Affordable Housing Ordinance to the City’s Zoning Ordinances 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  called the meeting to order and explained that this is a reconvened public 
hearing on a petition to add an affordable housing ordinance to the city's zoning ordinances.  
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager of Community Development, described the various documents 
prepared by the Community Development department in preparation for this meeting. She explained that 
the Planning Board held  public hearing on this zoning petition on August 4, there were eight members 
present and they voted seven to one to recommend adoption of the petition as filed. The written report 
from that meeting will be submitted to the city council at a future date. The majority of board members 
expressed their view that the zoning would be an important step, both in addressing the challenge of 
affordable housing in this city and in advancing social equity goals. They agreed with the need for the 
approach to be city wide and on the significance of the “as of right” permitting processes. Some board 
members had questions about specific numbers on height and so forth, but they felt comfortable with the 
mechanism for review and evaluation that is included in the petition.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Patricia Nolan, Iram Farooq stated that the Planning Board did 
not recommend any amendments.   
 
In response to a question from Councillor Patricia Nolan about changing the facade requirement from 150 
feet to 250 feet and bike parking requirements, Iram Farooq explained that that was a changed proposed 
by the petitioner after speaking with affordable housing builders and advocates about the challenges 
related to creating these projects.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern stated that the change was made in part to create more flexibility in projects. 
It's not to say that that there won't be times when there can be courtyards or breakups under the 250 feet, 
but to require it, builders felt would hamstring them.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  stated that studies have shown that a small percentage of affordable housing 
below grade parking is actually rented. He stated that problem with the city-wide overlay is that it does 
not relate to low density districts any differently than to high density districts. Councillor Carlone stated 
that he shared Councillor Nolan's concern about the façade requirements.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development , explained that unlike with motor vehicle parking, 
the bicycle parking requirements are not waived under the Affordable Housing overlay. There are some 
modifications in the proposal that try to allow some flexibility in how the requirements are met. There are 
some cases where if a very small amount of bicycle parking is required, it can be waived.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about a statement in the submitted 
materials stating that the savings from using city owned land will be offset by other costs; Iram Farooq 
explained that the cost differential, if the site is actually being used, which it is in most cases, then that 
adds to site acquisition costs. 
 
In response to a question by Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about the average land acquisition cost 
by neighborhood, Iram Farooq explained that the averages were created with the help of data from the 
Assessing Department.  She states that the Assessing Department felt pretty strongly that analysis should 
not go too far back in terms of number of years because the prices in Cambridge change so rapidly. 
 
Christopher Cotter, Housing Director, explained that the chart shows that costs for site acquisition are out 
of reach for a feasible project. The takeaway is that if the city wants to have feasible development 
opportunities for affordable housing builders across the city, the city needs to look at a way that to help 
them understand what is feasible and to give them the advantage. The underlying idea of the overlay is 
that if they can build denser projects, they can then spread those land costs over more units to a point 
where projects are financially feasible. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Quinton Zondervan about the relationship between parking and 
the cost of an Affordable Housing project; Iram Farooq explained that existing parking that is currently on 
the surface would need to be accommodated, below grade, if deemed to be necessary.  The revenue 
generated by public parking, at current pricing, would not offset the cost of underground construction. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did want to build on city owned parking garages. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Patricia Nolan about why the average land acquisition costs did 
not factor in the cost of the building, Christopher Cotter explained that whether there is a building on the 
site or not, the analysis is based on the price per buildable unit under the zoning to determine if the site is 
feasible opportunity. 
 
Iram Farooq added that an existing building may not need to be removed but there would be significant 
renovations costs. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Dennis Carlone, Jeffrey Roberts explained that within 35 feet 
of the rear property line, the building would need to step down from a maximum of six stories to a 
maximum of four stories. If the building were fully within the taller height districts, then the building 
could be six stories. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone asked that  next time the city show the existing zoning condition for the 
district a pretty.

Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, stated that there is not a general rule about the step 
down in the city, there are some transition requirements in certain zoning districts.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  stated that in a low-density zone, there could be facades that have windows in 
them that could have wall 10 and a half feet away.  He felt that there should be a limit on the size of 
outdoor storage structures that could be in the back yard. He expressed concern about the lack of 
implementation language for design guidelines in the proposed ordinance. 
 
Iram Farooq explained that all of these projects work with the Affordable Housing Trust from as a 
financing entity. There is also accountability for each of these projects through the housing staff who 
work with developers from design through construction.  She also explained that AHO is not removing 
any teeth that the design review for affordable housing buildings currently.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that it is odd that city guidelines for retail glass is 70 percent but under 
the proposed ordinance the guideline goes from 70 percent to 30 percent.  
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon moved to amend the petition with language that is attached to the minutes as 
a communication. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey stated that he supported the proposed amendment based on the positive 
impact that is will have on East Cambridge in terms of having commercial development on the first floor 
and residential development on the higher floors. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan stated that, if passed that, the Overlay will bring more people to the 
neighborhoods and those people will be interested in these ground floor retail establishments.  She stated 
that she would support a larger percentage of ground floor retail. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan, Vice Mayor Mallon explained that 50 percent was the 
number that the council came to last term in agreement with the affordable housing builders and 
advocates.  She was not opposed to increasing the percentage. 
 
Councillor Zondervan expressed concern that the 50 percent first-floor retail space requirement is not 
clearly defined. 
 
Councillor McGovern  stated that he supported the amendment.  He stated that there have been several 
discussion with stakeholders to get to 50 percent.  He stated that he could not support increasing the 
percentage. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that may be the city could provide additional fund to help developers 
provide ground floor retail 
 
Mayor Siddiqui stated that she was generally favorable of Vice Mayo Mallon’s amendment.  She did not 
believe that the percentage needed to be higher than 50 percent. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  stated that the City could provide funding, but it should not be in the zoning. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  stated that he supports the proposed amendment as presented. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon  stated that the city could provide additional funds in a concurrent process.  She 
stated that many Affordable Housing developers have built retail space in prior projects, so they are 
familiar with this construction.  She wanted to vote on the amendment as presented.

In response to a question from Councillor Dennis Carlone,  Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and 
Development, explained that frontage typically refers to the frontage along the entire lot.  
 
In response to questions from Councillor Carlone and Vice Mayor Mallon, Jeffrey Roberts, Director of 
Zoning and Development explained that the intent of the languages was to provide for retail on a site that 
had retail or has or has contained retail at any point within the past two years. If the space were simply 
vacant, because six months ago, business moved out, and there might have been another business moving 
in, that would count under this provision. But if a space were completely vacant for two years preceding 
the development that would not necessarily be counted.  
 
He further explained that where there is maybe one space that's taken in a building that has a row of retail 
establishments, then the provision would still apply. If there is some retail existing on the site, then this 
provision would still apply. It would not be one vacancy that would cause it not to apply. Two years tends 
to be the standard time period for what is known as abandonment.  
 
Councillor Carlone moved to 
suspend the rules to extend 
meeting to 7:30 PM

In response to a question from Councillor Toomey, Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, 
explained that under current zoning, for any development, there would not be a requirement to build new 
retail or replace retail in that district, under the Affordable Housing overlay, if the building permit were 
sought within two years of the discontinuation of the previous retail use, then this requirement would kick 
in and there would have to be some retail or other non-residential active space provided. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon  moved to amend  her proposed amendment by replacing it with the following 
language: 
 
(e) Ground Stories shall be designed to accommodate at least one space, with a total frontage equaling at 
least fifty percent (50%) of the existing retail frontage, for an active non-residential use, which may 
include retail or consumer establishments as well as social service facilities supporting the mission of the 
owner of the AHO Project, on sites that are located in a Business base zoning district, and where the 
project site contains or has contained a retail and or consumer service use at any point within the past two 
years prior to application for a building permit for an AHO Project. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that the council should be very precise and say that it's 50% of the existing 
retail frontage of the site. 
 
Councillor McGovern  that the proposed amendment to amend is clear.

Councillor Nolan moved two amendments to the petition with language that is attached to the minutes as 
a communication.  With regard to the amendment to section 11.207.3, she explained that right now there 
is a possibility that up to twenty percent of units could be for households making more than eighty 
percent of the area median income. He amendment would reserve some of those units for people making

between eighty and one hundred of the area median income.  The amendment would also allow 
individuals who do not meet those requirements to fill units are empty, were there is no waitlist. 
 
Christopher Cotter explained that funding middle-income units is a challenge and the demand for those 
units is also challenging. Low- and moderate-income applicants vastly outnumber the middle-income 
applicants for the units that are available.  Typical funding sources that affordable housing builders to 
access for the low- and moderate-income housing, are not available on an ongoing basis to fund middle 
income housing. That could prevent creating housing through the overlay in a situation where the 
developer is up against a required 20% ratio.  He is concerned about the challenge of financing middle-
income units.  
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he understood the financial predicament of middle-income households 
but that this zoning overlay was not the place to address this issue.  He stated that he would not support 
this amendment. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  stated that he could not support the proposed amendment from 
Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that  appreciated that intent but could not support the proposed amendment. 
 
Councillor Nolan’s motion to 
amend section 11.207.3 failed by

With regard to the amendment to section 11.207.11(b), Councillor Nolan explained that the amendment 
adds specific measurable targets to the ordinance. The goals of the Overlay are several but the main two 
are to increase the number of affordable units and to have greater geographic just dispersity around the 
city. The amendment set a goal of 15 to 20 units more than what was estimated by Community 
Development.  She stated that the review should be conducted every four years. 
 
Councillor McGovern  stated that he agreed with having some goals, but he did not want to  set this up for 
failure if the goals are not met. He wanted Councillor Nolan to clarify the number of units expected in her 
proposed goals. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon  stated that it felt unusual to have these goals in a zoning documents.  She felt the 
language in the proposed amendment should be codified in some other document. 
 
Iram Farooq stated that having a numerical target for production in zoning is a really challenging. She 
explained that the city cannot predict market conditions in the future, so it is hard to put hard numbers on

the amount of new buildings in the zoning ordinance.  She stated these numbers could be put in the 
Housing Trust’s goals or the city council goals. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler moved to amend Councillor Nolan's proposed amendment to section 
11.207.11(b) to read as follows: 
(b)  Four-Year Progress Review. Four (4) years after ordination, CDD shall provide to the City Council, 
Planning Board and the Affordable Housing Trust, for its review, a report that assesses the effectiveness 
of the Affordable Housing Overlay in increasing the number of affordable housing units in the city, unless 
funding increases or decreases, and recognizing that progress toward affordable housing goals are 
also influenced by other factors such as economic conditions and state and federal policy changes, 
this number shall include a non-binding goal of at least 15-20 units per year built on average 
distributing affordable housing across City neighborhoods with at least 20% of units built under this 
ordinance in areas of the city with the lowest percent of current affordable units, and serving the housing 
needs of residents. The report shall also assess the effectiveness of the Advisory Design Consultation 
Procedure in gathering meaningful input from community members and the Planning Board and shaping 
AHO Projects to be consistent with the stated Design Objectives. The report shall evaluate the success of 
the Affordable Housing Overlay in balancing the goal of increasing affordable housing with other City 
planning considerations such as urban form, neighborhood character, environment, and mobility. The 
report shall discuss citywide outcomes as well as site-specific outcomes. 
 
Councillor Carlone agreed that these goals would be better placed in the City Council goals. 
 
Councillor Zondervan agreed that the goals should be included in the zoning document.  He stated that he 
was not in favor of the amendment. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, 
stated that he was not aware of zoning that specified a numerical goal for units created.

ordinance. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler withdrew his amendment to the amendment.
