Sitting Members:  Mary T. Flynn, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven 

                  A. Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, 

                  Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza and 

                  Nikolas Bowie.                   

          MARY FLYNN:  This meeting is being held remotely, 

due to statewide emergency orders limiting the size of 

public gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance 

with Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 

2020, temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

September 22, 2020.  

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online 

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within 

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceedings.

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

          I will start by asking Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you Mary, this is Jeff 

Roberts from Community Development.  Just ask if Planning 

Board members are present, and if the meeting is audible. 

Starting with Louis Bacci, are you present and is the 

meeting audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'm present and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  H Theodore Cohen, 

are you present and is the meeting audible to you?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm present and it's audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Ted.  Steven Cohen, are 

you present, is the meeting audible to you?         

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Present, and audible.

audible to me.       

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Corinne.  And Catherine 

Preston Connolly, the Chair, has indicated she would be 

absent for this meeting.  Just give a little pause -- if 

she's present, please and can so.  Okay.  And so she is 

absent. 

          And Mary Flynn, you're present, obviously.  Can 

you just confirm that the meeting is audible to you?       

          MARY FLYNN:  It is audible.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay, thank you.  So that is eight 

Planning Board members; I called two Associate Members in 

attendance.  

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you Jeff. The first item 

is an Update from the Community Development Department.  

Please also introduce the staff present at the meeting, and 

Jeff I believe, you're handling this.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  Yes, comes back 

to me, Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development.  

And with me from my staff running the slides as always is 

Swaathi Joseph.  And also on my team Daniel Messplay, Sarah 

Scott, and Liza Paden is also present. 

          We also have in Community Development from our 

Urban Design Team we have Erik Thorkildsen -- I'm just 

looking for the names to make sure -- we also have the 

Deputy Director of Community Development and the Chief 

Planner, Khalil Mogassabi, and Iram Farooq, the Assistant 

City Manager for Community Development is also present.   

          I believe I have everyone from the City Staff. 

          So just to shift to some updates, looking ahead at 

the Planning Board's calendar, tonight we have one public 

hearing on a zoning petition that we'll be getting to

shortly and two items of General Business that will come up 

a little bit later, having to do with special permits that 

have been granted previously. 

          Next week, September 22, our current schedule is a 

public hearing on a zoning petition by Francis Donovan and 

others.  It relates to housing in the Residents A-1 and A-2 

Districts.  

          And we also have as an item of General Business a 

Design Review for a building at Cambridge Crossing, which I 

still call NorthPoint.   

          This is a Planned Unit Development with multiple 

building sites, and each building has to come to the 

Planning Board for Design Review.  This is a site known as 

Parcel U.  This will be the first time that the Planning 

Board has looked at this particular parcel, so that will be 

a Design Review process for that.   

          We currently don't have anything scheduled on 

September 29.   

          We do have on October 6 scheduled a first public 

hearing for the Cambridgeside Planned Unit Development 

application and Planned Unit Development application. 

          And we have a public hearing scheduled on October

20 for 325 Binney Street, which is a development on what was 

known as the Metropolitan Pipe Site.  

          We don't currently have anything scheduled on -- 

we don't have anything confirmed for October 13 or 27, but I 

would suggest keeping those dates open, because I expect 

that we'll have more things to schedule in the month of 

October. 

          And we don't have a meeting -- we will not have a 

meeting on November 3, because that is the election. 

          So that is the update.  Just shifting to a couple 

other updates, last night at the Council, the Council acted 

to pass the Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning Petition to a 

second reading.   

          So in two weeks or possibly three weeks, because I 

think that's when the next Council meeting would be -- the 

Council could take a final vote to ordain that, and that was 

a zoning petition that the Planning Board made a positive 

recommendation on. 

          Several other things happened at the Council last 

night, it was a very long meeting and I won't go through all 

of it, but I thought that might be of interest.   

          I will end the updates there so that we can get on 

with the business of the evening.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  If there are any 

questions from Board members, would you please say your name 

9

          Okay.  Hearing none, I will move on to the agenda 

and ask your question?     

          [Pause]  

item number 1.

Sitting Members:  Mary T. Flynn, Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven 

                  A. Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, 

                  Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza and 

                  Nikolas Bowie.             

          MARY FLYNN:  The next item on the agenda is a 

public hearing on a zoning petition by BMR-THIRD LLC, a 

subsidiary of BioMed Realty, LP, to create a new overlay 

Zoning District entitled, "Planned Unit Development at Canal 

District Kendall," with regulations contained in a new 

section 13.200. 

before us. 

          CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hi.  And I will do that.  Again,

thanks.  Jeff Roberts from Community Development.   

          So this is a petition that's new to the Planning 

Board, but it was originally referred by the City Council to 

the Planning Board and Ordinance Committee back in March, 

and it was referred again in June.   

          And in fact it was referred again last night at 

the City Council meeting, because of just some timing issues 

with scheduling the Ordinance Committee hearing for this 

case. 

          But this is it's first time at the Planning Board, 

and I don't know at this point when the Ordinance Committee 

hearing will be, but I will update the Planning Board on 

that when it's scheduled. 

          The Planning Board's action with zoning petitions 

is to make an advisory recommendation to the City Council 

following the public hearing, and CDD staff provided a memo 

that contains some background information on the area of the 

zoning petition, and the substance of the petition, with 

references to some of the past Planning work that's been 

done for this area. 

          So when we get to that point later in the hearing, 

we're happy to discuss or answer any questions about that

information we provided. 

          So that's all for me.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  Tonight's presenter 

is Salvatore Zino from BioMed realty.  You will have up to 

30 minutes for your presentation, though we hope you can be 

as concise as possible.  Please introduce your project team 

and begin your presentation.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yes, certainly.  Thank you very 

much and thank you everyone for being here tonight.  I know 

that hosting Zoom meetings and virtual meetings is 

challenging, so we appreciate it.   

          We are here with a few people -- Kishore from CBT, 

Chris Matthews from MBBA, Andrea -- who's from our office, 

who will also speak; Sean Manning from DHB; and also, Ken 

Greenberg, our Master Planner. 

          So just want to get started.  Again, I just want 

to thank everybody.  I mean, I can't tell you how excited I 

am to be here tonight.  We submitted a proposal initially, 

as Jeff mentioned, in early March right before the world 

shut down.   

          We presented our proposal for the site to the 

community in late February, so we spent a lot of time

refining our plans, focusing very much on the design of the 

project and the operational model more specifically since 

then, so we've made the most of the time.  But, again, I'm 

really excited to be here tonight. 

          So if we just flip to the agenda slide, please?  

The next one? 

          So tonight we're going to briefly explain the 

history of the site -- summarize what's been about two 

years' worth of community input that led us to this 

proposal.   

          It all started with the Mayor's Arts Task Force.  

Then we'll explain the highlights of our project and some of 

the benefits that it's going to bring to the city and to 

Third Street.   

          To begin, I wanted to turn over the presentation 

to Ken Greenberg.  Ken is an architect and well recognized 

authority on Urban Planning.  He was actually responsible 

for the original Master Plan for this site, which 

established what it is today that is in our little portion 

of Kendall. 

          So Ken, I'm going to turn it over to you.  Nam 

          KEN GREENBERG:  Thanks very much.  So 20 years

ago, I worked on a Master Plan for this area that began as 

transformation into the dynamic Canal District in Kendall 

Square has that has attracted people from around the world.  

          That Master Plan is a testament to the role that 

Planning and Zoning can play in transforming not just the 

neighborhood, but an entire city, and Cambridge is much the 

better for it. 

          The Master Plan -- the original Master Plan that 

you see in the lower right -- provided for six blocks of 

mixed-use development anchored by two signature public 

spaces, what is now to your square and the public space at 

the end of the Broad Canal. 

          Today, in addition to hosting cutting-edge 

technology in life science firms, the Kendall Square Canal 

District is home to many public amenities that improve the 

quality of life for those living and working in the area -- 

a newly redesigned square of public arts, sculptures and 

more.   

          BioMed currently sponsors the popular canoe and 

kayak rental dock, as well as a series of farmers' markets, 

and in peak you see the site we're here to discuss tonight  

-- 585 Third Street.

          Next, please. 

          For those of you who aren't already familiar with 

the area, 585 Third Street is among the last remaining 

undeveloped parcels in Kendall Square.  To orient everyone, 

here is the project site highlighted in pink and the context 

of Kendall Square, East Cambridge. 

          The western edge of the gas transfer site -- the 

smaller, big rectangle, which we'll address in a moment -- 

fronts a major pedestrian and traffic Third Street, while 

the other three sides of the parcel run along minor street 

Atheneum and Kendall, that see little or no foot traffic 

today outside the employees, who work in the nearby offices.   

          The development of this remaining site offers a 

special opportunity to complete the plan, complete the 

original plan; build on what has been accomplished so far, 

and add new life and activity to the Canal District. 

          Sal, back to you.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Ken, thank you.  So the site we 

were looking at -- this is our site, this is Parcel C and 

the GTS, the Gas Transfer Station, which is what we called 

it for the last five years; it's that stretch of Third 

Street, it's been inactive for decades.  It's actually in

22

the GTS and Parcel C it's really the only piece of Kendall 

that has not benefitted from the changes over the decades. 

          When we submitted our original petition, it 

contemplated two different scenarios; one that would include 

the GTS and one that would not include the GTS.   

          Since we submitted that original petition, we've 

been able to secure the second of two option agreements that 

will give us a path to relocate the GTS.  One allows us to 

acquire the GTS site itself, and the other one secures the 

relocation site, which is off of Third Street and far away 

from any residences. 

          Because the GTS and the facility there, the 

equipment is at the end of its useful life, this represents 

a once in a lifetime opportunity to really move this.  In a 

way, it was like the stars have aligned.  The site, Parcel 

C, became available.   

          Eversource has been willing and able to speak with 

us about relocating the facility, and then the owners of the 

relocation site vicinity have also been very great to 

coordinate with and to help us to secure that relocation 

site. 

          So for all of those reasons, our proposal tonight

is going to reflect the assumption that the project spans 

Parcel C and the GTS site. 

          So at this point, I'm going to turn over the 

presentation to Andrea, who is going to walk you through the 

community outreach process.  Andrea?  It's all yours.   

          ANDREA WINDHAUSEN:  Great, thank you.  If you 

don't mind just going one more slide?  Perfect, thank you.  

          So, in order to ensure we are developing this.        

          THE REPORTER:  Could you state your name and 

address, please?   

          ANDREA WINDHAUSEN:  Oop?  Andrea Windhausen, 

Community Manager, BioMed.  So in order to ensure we are 

developing this site in the best possible way, we knew we 

had to operate an ambitious public input program that would 

guide us as to how the community sees this area come to 

life. 

          Over the course of three large public meetings, 

hundreds of individual conversations, and more than 170 

completed surveys, many of which came from art popups on 

sites such as CultureHouse, they have spent years collecting 

the thoughts, ideas, opinions of residents, civic groups, 

abutters and the arts community. 

          We continue to have these conversations today.  

The Cambridge community was and is a critical part of this 

17

feedback process.   

Next slide, please? 

emerged. 

          Next slide?   

          There were a tremendous variety of ideas and 

opinions that came up, but some common themes definitely 

          By and large, everyone wanted space for performing 

arts with high-quality productions of varying scales --   

community arts were local organizations feel empowered to 

rehearse, innovate and create; and a public gathering space, 

both indoor and outdoor free spaces to meet, study, chat and 

explore. 

          Next slide?   

          We used what we heard through this community 

feedback process to develop numerous operating principles.  

The responses included everything from a need to tier 

pricing schemes to ways to engage local youth through 

apprenticeships to ways to activate the space to its fullest 

throughout the season.   

          I would now like to introduce Kishore Varanasi of

CBT Architects, who led the design for our proposal and 

Chris Matthews of Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, who 

planned the landscaping design for both the interior and 

exterior aspects of what you're about to see. 

          All you, Kishore. 

          KISHORE VARANASI:  Thanks, Andrea.  Good evening, 

Kishore Varanasi, CBT.  We are delighted to be here and 

share your vision for this project, which is a pretty unique 

blend of arts, culture, life sciences and work, and public 

gathering space -- perhaps very rare to see that kind of a 

combination in any building, particularly around here. 

          We are pretty excited about that, and also most 

importantly one that is inviting, welcoming and publicly 

accessible to all. 

          What you're looking at on the screen is an 

isometric of the Canal District that Ken described, very 

much founded on a robust public indiscernible from Toomey 

Square all the way to Broad Canal Way and the Broad Canal 

Crack Ranch.  And you see the pink GTS Parcel C as the site. 

          Next? 

          As we began to think about the site, it became 

very evident to us it's less about a building above, but we

have to build this from ground up, bottom up.  So the 

foundation was to really create an extraordinary ground 

print experience.   

          The graphic in front of you is showing Third 

Street on the top left; Kendall Street and watermark in the 

foreground, and Genzyme building on the right-hand side, and 

Atheneum on the top. 

          So what you're looking at is a completely porous, 

open, inside-outside public space on the ground floor that 

is very unique.   

          Within the curb lines of this particular block -- 

not the actual property line, but within the curb line, we 

are talking about creating one acre of public space both 

inside and the outside, which is quite extraordinary. 

          Just to compare that with the Henry Termeer 

Square, which is about three-quarters of an acre. 

          So the idea is to really allow people to enter the 

building and pass through the ground floor from Third Street 

where some of the retail community arts and the lobby for 

the building would occur; traverse along the building along 

the south, where we are expanding the sidewalk 

significantly, along Kendall Street, where there would be an 

20

inside-outside opportunity -- and culminate on the south 

side of this, on the east side of the project, where we have 

a 10,000-square-feet indoor winter garden, which also 

expands again into a robust outdoor public plaza in the open 

space. 

Matthews?  

          Next?  Chris, if you don't mind going back.  Mr. 

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:   Yeah, thanks, Kishore.  So when 

we were looking at the landscape of this one acre.        

          THE REPORTER:  Could you just introduce yourself 

for the record?       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah, Chris Matthews with Michael 

Van Valkenburgh Associates, Landscape Architects.  When we 

were looking at the one acre of public space, both indoors 

and outdoors, as Kishore's described, we wanted to make a 

landscape that really felt like there was no barrier between 

the inside and outside.   

          We've planted these robust groves of trees around 

the site, which on a hot day will cool the air; on a windy 

day will mitigate the wind, and throughout the seasons will 

register the passing of the different times of year. 

          The real exciting opportunity we have here as

landscape architects is with the interior winter garden.   

          And, you know, that will have summer and winter 

programming, and I think it'll be very much used as what we 

call a one-cut.  If you're walking from Third Street through 

this block, you'll actually be able to walk through the 

building, stop for a coffee, stop for a rest, and certainly 

warm up, as you go through the site. 

          Next slide, please?   

          So central to all of this thinking was the 

programming of the ground floor, both indoors and outdoors.  

          So we have I think great support here to build 

upon the excellent programming that BioMed's now been doing 

for close to the 20 years both in Termeer Square with the 

ice rink with the canoes down on Broad Canal and in a way, 

this is where it all comes together; the performing arts, 

the landscape ideas, and then this idea of the winter 

garden. 

          Community arts will also be visible down here on 

the ground floor, and we're really hoping that this will 

become like the generator for our next phase in the 

programming of these city blocks.   

          KISHORE VARANASI:  So just go back one, if you 

22

don't mind.   

          Just to point out the parking and the service on 

this plan, as you see, is all being handled interior to the 

block from Atheneum Street, leaving Third Street free. 

          And also, given that the site is surrounded by 

four streets, a lot of the access drop-offs could happen out 

of Kendall and Atheneum, and leaving Third Street again to 

be the complete street that the city is trying to create. 

          Next? 

          One of the biggest benefits of this is obviously 

the completion of the Third Street with the removal of the 

Gas Transfer Station. 

          Next?   

          This is a view looking for Binney Street back 

towards Kendall T station.  The site is on the left-hand 

side.  Next?  So the idea is to really create a very 

welcoming, transparent ground floor consistent with the K2 

guidelines with active engagement on the ground floor.   

          You are seeing a two-story expression on the 

ground level, and also, a step back at 85 feet -- again, 

creating a landscape terrace, which we'll talk a bit more 

about.  There are in fact more step backs as you go up --

really again, comparing the street wall consistent with some 

23

of the K2 guidelines.   

          Next?   

          As you turn to the other side, though, the 

building opens up visually because of some of the open 

spaces, such as the [47:41 same indiscernible proper name] 

in the foreground.  Also, as you're coming from Longfellow 

Bridge from Boston, you can experience the building in a 

different way. 

          So the approach -- the architecture for this is 

very much to create a civic icon for Kendall Square; not be 

constrained by traditional lab dimensions or lab prototypes 

that you typically see, which tend to be very boxy and 

irregular, but taking a very kind of a linear form, with a 

series of terraces in the curvilinear form obviously with 

the exterior fenestration detail would appear very 

differently from different angles. 

          But most importantly, giving the civic performing 

arts a pretty grand presence at the bottom of this building.  

The three-story prism that you see -- the orange sort of a 

curtain we see in the background of this, really making it 

very welcoming and very identifiable; not simply a big

24

building within which you tuck in and disappear, but really 

make this a great civic entry to the project. 

          Next? 

          So that would be very evident here.  This is the 

existing view, where the site has been laying inaccessible 

for a number of years at the corner of Kendall and Kendall.  

Genzyme would be on the right-hand side; Third Street on the 

left further down. 

          So the transformation is that three-story space, 

as we talked about, about 50 feet.  This is an image that 

might be showing an evening time where the performance might 

be occurring; the blend of the inside and the outside; the 

winter garden, that is pretty expansive -- again, three-

story expression, within which the theater is suspended. 

          We are very much trying to achieve a level of 

transparency in the theater at times when it is possible.  

At other times, of course, the blackout curtains will allow 

for the performances to occur so that this can very much be 

a dialogue of inside and the outside as well. 

          And a fully operable set of doors will allow you 

to -- at good times, actually let the space breathe in and

out. 

          Next?         

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Yeah, so this is the summer view 

from inside the winter garden.  You can see on the left-hand 

side the façade of the building pivots open to make a 

seamless space between inside and outside.   

          And then, under the main performance space we have 

the sunken garden in this image -- there's a small band 

playing -- informal places to sit, terrace down to that 

sunken garden. 

          And if you go to the next slide, please. 

          In the winter, when the façade is closed up, we'll 

have the ability to show films in the evening again in the 

sunken garden -- again, with people sitting on those 

informal terraced benches. 

          And then the tropical and subtropical plants that 

we would use in an atrium like this will provide a -- you 

know, much needed splash of color on a cold February day.  

And of course, we can still take advantage of the great 

programming that BioMed does year-round.   

          In this case, we're showing food trucks outside in 

the snow, and then a cozy place to drink your hot chocolate

inside. 

          And all of this I think provides a very nice 

threshold to the performance spaces upstairs. 

          Next?       

          KISHORE VARANASI:  So while we have that 10,000- 

square-feet open space winter garden down below, as you move 

up, you're looking at the performance arts theater, which 

occupies the second and third levels.   

          What you're seeing is a 300-seat theater that 

could be operated in many different ways, from performances 

that are very simple and straightforward to more 

sophisticated performances. 

          But the idea of this transparency and 

relationship, again, are for the outside. 

          Along with this overall square footage for this 

program is about 30,000 square feet on the second and third 

levels.  You have a series of ancillary spaces that will 

support the theater, such as the rehearsal rooms and other 

ancillary facilities, which also would be doubling the 

program as community arts facilities as well. 

          Next? 

          I think the magic of this is in the section, as 

27

22

you may expect, that the life sciences office work up above, 

performing arts center and this great, public space under.  

All of this requires tremendous coordination, whether it's 

structural, acoustical, code, or building services.  It is a 

complex hybrid.   

          There are good premiums involved here, but we are 

delighted to really seamlessly integrate these in a way that 

this becomes a great experience. 

          On the left-hand side is Third Street.  As you can 

see, you can traverse through the public space on the ground 

floor, and end up in the public garden -- second and third 

levels of the theater and the gathering community spaces. 

          And what's more important too is to really bring 

the nature and the landscape up to multiple levels.  So you 

see a series of step backs and terraces that are created -- 

about six of them -- throughout the building, particularly 

post-COVID, people are looking for a lot more open spaces in 

the buildings to have access to nature and fresh air. 

          So we contemplated this even prior to that to have 

that access, and even have good -- you know, some of the 

spaces adjacent to it be potentially opening their windows 

and not be always in the condition environment.

22

          So all in all, I think this is a very interesting 

way of approaching the hybrid.  We're also looking at very 

interesting ways to think about the neighbors and the hybrid 

landscapes at various terraces throughout the building.   

          Next?   

          So a lot of this what you're seeing is a building 

design, and obviously what's at hand is really the zoning 

petition that is describing a building that is 250 feet 

tall, which with the angle that is shown here generally 

consistent with some of the new buildings that are being 

built in Kendall.  A lot of the heights are indicated here. 

          Clearly the buildings immediately next to it 

towards East Cambridge are scaled down towards Binney 

Street.  The box of the building is what is in the zoning 

angle.   

          Of course, you know, if you're doing a typical 

life science building, you would try to fulfill their box 

and occupy it.  Given all the ambitions that we talked 

about, we really tried to carve a building that is really 

unique and special.   

          Next?   

          Where the building's curvilinear form again 

29

creates narrower façades towards Third Street as well as 

towards Kendall Street on the back side, so it can present a 

very slender scale towards Third Street, but also those 

short facades on the most exposed sites of -- 

environmentally from the east and west to the sun will lead 

to a lower energy gain. 

          Again, the curvilinear façade puts the building 

away from the neighbors -- in this case Watermark and the 

lab building next door -- to allow for a greater light and 

sun penetration and opening up of the views as well. 

          And all in all, these are all the passive 

sustainability measures that automatically make this 

building a Better Scale building, but also the multiple 

terraces are offering more than one step back from an Urban 

Design perspective, but also that access to nature at 

multiple levels at this project.  

          Next?   

          And that is resulting in a building that is 

passively sustainable.  But as we think about some other 

system, there's not going to be a gas connection.  This 

building is going to rely on steam, and that is resulting in 

a pretty good reduction in carbon overall, as compared to 

30

some of the benchmark buildings in particular in Boston and 

Cambridge, which we we're very proud of. 

          Next?   

          And I will turn it back to Sal or Sean.  Thanks.         

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yeah, if we just could flip to 

the next slide, please?  So we're going to turn this over to 

Sean Manning from VHB.  Sean?     

          SEAN MANNING:  Good evening, everybody.  Sean 

Manning with VHB.  So just few things to share with you.  

Obviously, we're at the zoning review level, and if this 

proposal were to move forward, you know, one of the 

important things we're going to have to do is a TIS and get 

that TIS certified by TP&T, where of course we would get 

into really granular detail about traffic impacts and site 

access and circulation and offsite improves and all those 

great things that are important with any project in 

Cambridge. 

          But we did want to do enough to give folks a 

flavor as to what we think the transportation issues are.  

We've done quite a few studies internally; we've had 

conversations with TP&T.  And I just have a couple of things 

to share with you.

22

          On the traffic side, we really want to understand 

the trip generating value of the zoning proposal and how 

that would fit in with long-term planning studies that the 

city of Cambridge have done, and in particular as it relates 

to traffic impacts -- and again, at a very, very high level 

looked at the that and can comfortably say we fit in with 

those planning studies quite well.   

          We look at a couple of key intersections, we've 

gotten guidance from TP&T and could certainly share that 

granular detail if folks are interested in seeing it. 

          The other piece, which is hugely important is 

parking.  This proposal looks to use existing parking that's 

been built already in Kendall Square.  There is no new 

parking as part of this proposal.   

          We've done quite a bit of analysis to understand 

if the zoning proposal can work in the allocated parking 

that -- again -- is commensurate with long-term planning 

principles for the city of Cambridge -- you know, something 

under a space per thousand square feet for the office/lab 

space that would be in the building. 

          And again, we believe it can comfortably work with 

the space that's here.  But, you know, obviously interested

to hear and answer any questions that the Board might have.  

Thank you.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Thank you, Sean.  We're just 

going to flip to the next slide again, please.   

          And so, the operation model -- this is something I 

touched on at the beginning.  We've spent a lot of time 

working through the operational model, understanding exactly 

what it takes to make this space work, because -- you know, 

in the end all of the commitments and all the talk is really 

not worth much unless it works. 

          So we have gone to a point -- there are a lot of 

details to work out, but we have gotten to a point where we 

feel comfortable making some additional commitments with 

respect to the operational model. 

          So, more specifically, we would plan to have a 

professional management team behind the operation of this 

facility, which would be structured as a non-profit.  We 

would rely on the management team to organize the 

performances, to keep the lights on, to keep the space 

working. 

          We would ensure that the space is accessible, and 

what we mean by that is we want to be able to -- both in

terms of the physical nature of the space, but in terms of 

the programming as well.   

          We want to be able to accommodate a broad range of 

artists and groups, from salvage organizations to emerging 

artists -- you know, to someone even looking for their first 

opportunity -- their first gig, their first performance to 

get out in front of the public. 

          We've spent a lot of time speaking to a lot of 

artists in Cambridge, and I think it's really important to 

be able to create a space that has the ability to foster the 

next generation of Cambridge-based talent. 

          Activation -- this is another thing that -- you 

know, we're not thinking of the space just on the building 

level, but we think there are a lot of opportunities to 

really enliven obviously the ground floor of the space, but 

also the space outside of the building -- the outdoors, the 

existing open space, as well as the new space, that Kishore 

has pointed out. 

          And then last, I touched on it a little bit, but 

sustainability, it's -- you know, we've spent -- have an 

Excel sheet that's really long and that has a ton of numbers 

in it.

          But really what it says is that this is what the 

space needs to make it functional -- the type of investment 

that you need to make it functional and sustainable really 

entails -- you know, the right mix of financing and 

programming to ensure that the facility thrives for decades. 

          In the time that I've spent learning about what it 

takes to make a space like this work I've realized that it 

can be difficult.  It's challenging, but with what we have 

here today we have the ability to achieve that. 

          So I'm just going to flip to the next slide, 

please. 

          So on this one, I just wanted to give everyone a 

little bit of insight as to how the team has thought about 

diversity equity and inclusion on this project.   

          It's not only in the operational model and the 

flexibility that we want to create there, the foundation to 

achieve diversity equity inclusion in the project, but it 

goes beyond that.  It's actually how we approach the entire 

project. 

          First, it's been important to us to hear from a 

diverse range of voices in the input process.  As a result, 

we've made particular efforts to reach out to artists of 

35

color to get their feedback planning for 585 Third, and 

their voices have had an impact on our proposal here 

tonight. 

          Secondly, once we're up and running, you know, 

it's our responsibility to hire qualified candidates to 

operate this space that are representative of a diverse 

background.  The Director and the staff for the Performing 

Arts Center, for example, will make decisions about 

performers' acts, audiences, and really influence whether or 

not this space achieves those goals, and the diversity goals 

that we have. 

          In order for that to happen, we know that that 

needs to be representative -- that they need to be 

representative of the people that are running this facility. 

          And third, we've touched on this a little bit 

already, but I just think it's important to be, you know, 

very explicit that we want this space to represent all of 

Cambridge.  It's not just about Kendall Square, we will 

actively seek to accommodate a very diverse range of 

performers here.   

          I think it's really one of the parts that makes 

this so exciting.  I want to ultimately look at a program

one day and see something in there for everyone, and for 

everyone to feel welcome at the space. 

          We want to get people to Kendall that don't 

ordinarily look at Kendall as a destination.  And that's our 

last point here.  We want to make it clear that everyone is 

welcome.  We want to provide opportunities for people to see 

things that they enjoy. 

please?  

          So with that, we can just flip to the next slide, 

          And just offer -- just a brief overview of the 

zoning petition.  In order to make all this possible, in 

order to deliver the relocation of the GTS and the Arts and 

Culture component -- the public component, the open space 

and the other items that we've mentioned here tonight, we're 

requesting a rezoning for the site to enable a maximum 

zoning height of 250 feet, a commercial density of 550,000 

square feet, and then uses that would obviously include the 

arts and culture component of the public space as well as 

the laboratory and office space above. 

          And then just flip to the next slide once more, 

please? 

          And so, this is just a little bit of a recap of

the commitment letter that we submitted with our zoning 

petition.  Again, you know, we've promised a lot here 

tonight, so wanted to recap how we're going to make that all 

happen -- specify what those commitments are. 

          So we have a path to enable the relocation of the 

GTS facility, which has taken a while.  We had the second 

option.  And so, beyond that, if we're assuming that the GTS 

is part of this proposal -- the GTS relocation on that site 

is part of the proposal -- we would offer 30,000 square feet 

of this Arts and Culture space, and that's the space that 

you saw that Kishore mentioned on the second and third 

floor, as it's the 250- to 300-seat-theater as well as all 

the surrounding accessory spaces, as well as the 15,000 

square feet of ground-floor public space.   

          You see some of those images -- some of the 

renderings that Matt -- excuse me, Chris and Kishore shared.  

And there's really a lot of opportunities in there for a 

wide range of arts-focused uses, from the exhibit space to 

small-scale performances. 

          On the operational side, we committed to a 

diversity inclusion outreach program for the public spaces 

as well as the theater spaces -- operational support, and

that is represented with the financial commitment that will 

be determined and funded by BioMed as part of the goal of 

having the space be sustainable for the long term. 

          Finally, to get things started -- you know, we 

would offer a half a million dollar commitment to bring an 

Executive Director on board early to help us craft the space 

and, you know, give us the expertise that I personally don't 

have when it comes to these things. 

          Just flip to the next slide, please. 

          And so, this view we mentioned the open space.  As 

Chris mentioned earlier, we've been -- sorry, one more.  One 

more slide forward?  Thank you. 

          As Chris mentioned earlier, you know, we've run 

the canoe and kayak operations -- the rental operation, and 

the ice rink for years.  We thought it would be helpful just 

to allow more people to go walking and to encourage more 

people to come to Kendall and kind of broaden that outreach 

to offer some free tickets for the canoe and kayaking and 

the ice skating. 

          We've been doing that for a lot of years, but this 

is just really -- you know, committing to and enhancing that 

effort.  The winter market Chris mentioned -- you saw it in

some of those images -- we did that for the first time last 

year, it was well received, and we'd love to do it, 

potentially indoors in the future. 

          We do this all with no new parking, commit to LEED 

goals, no gas connection, and obviously that big setback 

that was shown in the massing along Third Street. 

          So please move to the next slide, and it wraps up 

the presentation for this evening.   

          I hope that we're right on time, we practiced a 

lot on this one.  But with that, I look forward to 

discussion and any questions, and thank you for listening 

tonight.  I appreciate that.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, thank you so much for that very 

interesting presentation.  It certainly is an ambitious 

project, and I'm sure the Board will have many, many 

thoughts and comments on it.  

          Normally, we do go to questions, but over the -- 

since we've been doing meetings on Zoom, we've kind of 

switched that a bit, and we now instead of going to Board 

questions, we're going to go to public comment, because this 

is a public hearing.   

          So any members of the public who wish to speak

should now click the button that says, "Raise hand" at the 

bottom of your screen.  If you're calling in by phone, you 

can raise your hand by pressing *9.   

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had received 

written communications from [all names phonetic] Maury F. 

Aaronson, Jane Hershey, Erin Johnson, Nancy Donahue, Ellen 

Fitzgerald, Larry Smith, Liz Pollack, Barshard San, Andrew

Kirland, Becky Norris, Debra Andrews, Dan Iona-Marshall, 

Victoria Lin-Awkward, Peter DiMuro, Joseph Burroughs, Jason 

Alvez from the East Cambridge Business Association, 

Kirbitzio Gentilly and Charles Marcot.   

          Written communications received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will be entered into the record.  And if I 

mispronounced anybody's name, I apologize for that.   

          So let's see.  Okay.  So if people wish to speak, 

they should hit, "Raise hand" now.  And I am going to turn 

it over to Jeff.  At the moment, I'm not seeing any hands.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  There are quite a few hands up on 

the Attendee side.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, I see it.   

41

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I can see them on my end.        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, I can now too, thank you.  Okay.  

So Jeff, I will turn it over to you, then.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  I'll start reading 

names.  So I'm going to read the name as it appears.  You 

should certainly give your own name and your address before 

you speak, and if we don't hear anything, I will say that we 

can't hear you.  If you want to confirm, I can confirm that 

we can hear you. 

          I'm going to read a couple of -- read off a couple 

of names, and kind of go in that way, so people know to get 

ready.  So the first speaker is Cynthia Ann Webb.  Start 

please by giving your name and address.   

          CYNTHIA WEBB:  Good evening, everyone.  Can you 

hear me??     

proceed.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, we can hear you.  You can 

          CYNTHIA WEB BROWSER:  Excellent.  My name is C.A.

located at 510 Kendall Street.  I am also a resident in 

Wellington-Harrington at 80 Tremont Street.

two young children, who attend Cambridge public schools. 

          On behalf of the Kendall Square Association, I'm 

writing -- I'm reaching out to you tonight to support the 

rezoning required for BioMed's redevelopment at 585 Third 

Street.   

          BioMed has been our landlord and neighbor for some 

time, and I've watched closely as they've conducted 

extensive research introductions into the art community, and 

as they’ve really actively and creatively demonstrated 

themselves to be champions of the arts and culture in 

Kendall Square. 

          We believe this project would meet the demand that 

they frankly have helped spur for creative, publicly 

accessible spaces, while supporting the local economy. 

          585 Third Street -- again, just right outside our 

front door -- is underutilized, and it's quite unsightly.  

It's been an object of speculation for everyone I've held a 

meeting with over the three years I've worked for the KSA.  

Anyone who walks past the parcel can't help but wonder why a 

gravel surrounded by a chain-link fence exists in an 

otherwise thriving innovation district. 

          BioMed's proposed project would beautify and

activate this space and increase foot traffic generally, but 

especially outside of the work we would finally knit 

together this critical part of Third Street leading into 

East Cambridge, providing really exciting ground-level 

business and access to the arts. 

          As Cambridge's historical and creative 

establishments continue to close, it's vital for the health 

and happiness of our community that new spaces be 

established, not only to replace those that have been lost, 

but to cultivate and steward the growth of our cities' 

cultural institutions.   

          BioMed has shown through a wealth of programming 

delivered in the Canal District that there is a need to 

supplement the success of Kendall's technology and life 

science industries with artistic endeavors in this area. 

          I want to just add that we ourselves at the KSA 

have conducted extensive outreach via hundreds of surveys, 

street intercepts, design thinking workshops of people who 

live and work in Kendall.  And it's reinforced the priority 

of augmenting publicly accessible spaces that actively 

signal welcome to the larger Kendall community.   

          This indoor/outdoor project would provide a haven

year-round for lovers of arts, culture and community.  We're 

excited about the thoughtful eco-friendly design, and I've 

seen firsthand BioMed engage in our Ecodistrict Committee 

over the last number of years in an earnest and productive 

way. 

          I just want to say that the emphasis of this 

project on placing diversity, equity and inclusion and 

publicly welcoming space further augments our feeling that 

this is the right project for this space.  I hope you'll see 

it that way too.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker I believe is 

Heather Hoffman by telephone, you can confirm that, and I 

forgot the next speaker is Peter DiMuro.  And if you're 

speaking, Heather, you're on mute.  Thanks. 

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hi, Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley 

Street.  I want to start by saying that I completely believe 

in the bonafide use of BioMed's desire to make this if not 

what the constellation center would have been, at least 

something that will bring some of the performing arts and 

other things that we wanted the constellation center to 

bring. 

          So any criticism I make should be seen in that

light. 

          I also want to draw the Board's attention to 

something that you may or may not know about.  There was a 

very, very acrimonious lawsuit like 20 years ago, over this 

entire development.  So it predates BioMed.  It pretty much 

predates my involvement, but there was a settlement 

agreement and what they're asking for just violates that 

settlement agreement. 

          So what that means is that we need to be sure that 

the people who signed that settlement agreement are happy 

with what's being proposed.  And I am on the Board of the 

two non-profits that signed that settlement agreement.   

          One of the things that occurred to me as I was 

listening to this presentation yet again is something that 

should have occurred to me long before.  This building needs 

to not be a lantern.  If we're going to have nature all 

around this, nature needs dark.  Just this, like -- just the 

way humans need dark, the rest of the animal kingdom, the 

plant kingdom all need some dark.  So this building needs to 

not be a lantern. 

          And one of the things that I am still having a 

huge problem with is the giant wall that is advancing 

46

towards our neighborhood from every direction except for the 

west.  And this is part of it.  It severely affects the 

livability of our neighborhood, it affects what we see from 

our homes, and it is -- it will continue to make Third 

Street just one big windstorm. 

          With respect to the public easement through the 

building, I have learned that easement needs to be 

enforceable, it needs to be a recorded document, and no 

playing around.   

          And finally, the arts needs to coordinate with the 

other arts venues that are going in in the surrounding area.  

And so, I know they're think about it, but the Board should 

also think about it and put it into your decision.  Thank 

you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Peter DiMuro, 

and he's followed by Maure Aronson. 

          PETER DIMURO:  Hello, this is Peter DiMuro.  Can 

you hear me?   

me your address.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.  Please give 

          PETER DIMURO:  Thank you so much.  Peter DiMuro.

of The Dance Complex at 536 Massachusetts Ave in Cambridge.  

I've sent written word along, so I won't take up the whole 

time to make our -- so we can make our evening a little 

shorter.   

          I just wanted to offer my -- you know, verbal 

testimony tonight to the thorough process by which the 

BioMed team has gone deeply into dialogue.   

          I've had more meetings with Sal and Andrea than I 

have with my own family in the last three years, and a 

really sense of dialogue of understanding what is happening 

here in Cambridge in the arts already, and not to be 

building a system that would be in competition to it, but 

would augment what is already happening here.   

          So that if we looked at the arts as an ecology, I 

feel BioMed has done an amazing job just in laying plans to 

create a theater space and a community space that speaks to 

     st

a 21  century artmaking that is beyond a -- you know, wall.  

It encroaches into our spaces, and it welcomes community 

versus becoming a fortress that keeps them out. 

          It also is an amazing -- when confronted, and I 

did several times ask about how do we make this accessible

for artists who are typically, you know, poor and presenting 

their work.   

          They're great in presenting their work, but 

they're poor in being able to mount their work, that there 

would be assistance in place by which to encourage support 

subsidies for non-profits, a system by which the management 

and the income streams would help support local artists 

especially, and especially those of us who have worked in 

Cambridge for decades and decades.   

          So I look forward to continue conversations in 

that way.  It takes a citizen artist organization and 

citizen artists to be in dialogue with this project and 

other projects like it, and we look forward to continuing 

that dialogue and being a part of the space in the future.  

Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Maure Aronson is next.  I apologize 

if I mispronounced that, and is followed by Marc Jacobson.  

So Maure Aronson, you can unmute yourself and begin 

speaking.   

Aronson.  Am I muted?   

          MAURE ARONSON:  Good evening.  This is Maure

you.   

          MAURE ANDERSON:  Thank you very much.  I am the 

Executive and Artistic Director of Global Arts Live, which 

is a not-for-profit performing arts presenter that presents 

music and dance performances in Cambridge, Boston and 

Somerville.  For 30 years, our offices have been located at 

720 Massachusetts Avenue in Central Square, Cambridge. 

          I also, Peter, would like to commend BioMed for 

the hard work that they have done in getting to understand 

and enter into dialogue with the artistic community of 

Cambridge.   

          This project is not only visionary in its 

architectural approach, it is also visionary in the approach 

that it makes the performing arts and culture central to the 

identity of the building.   

          The inside/outside approach will allow the 

building to become a cultural path for Kendall, Cambridge 

and I expect even people from Greater Boston will visit the 

center.   

          Not only will it provide an opportunity for 

artists to perform and earn an income year-round, it'll also 

be a destination point, and along with that an economic

driver for restaurants in the area.   

          The building will change the cultural landscape in 

Cambridge, and it has the wholehearted support of Global 

Arts Live.  There are very few theaters in Cambridge that 

presenters can use.  The 300-seat theater that is proposed 

is the most -- one of the most glaring size theaters that 

are needed in the city.   

          It will satisfy small to mid-sized arts groups and 

individual artists.  I certainly hope that we get to see 

this wonderful project come to fruition.  I have already 

submitted a letter in support, and my verbal testimony goes 

along with that.  Thank you very much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Marc Jacobson is next, 

followed by Elena Spencer. 

          MARC JACOBSON:  My name is Marc Jacobson.  I'm a 

General Manager at Charles River Recreation.  We operate the 

canoe and kayak operation in Kendall Square, and also the 

skating rink in Kendall Square. 

          I was very anxious to see the proposal.  I think 

it's sort of a missing link for both the summer and winter 

operations.  We've seen the transition where now people will 

come and either skate or paddle, and they'll eat.  But 

51

they're really missing that third thing of what else they 

would do.   

          And we have a lot of companies and community 

groups who will come, and you may go skating on a really 

cold day, or go paddling on a hot day, but they want to do 

something as a group afterwards, and shelter is an important 

part of that -- whether it's the heat of the summer or the 

cold and wind of the winter.   

          So having this open space that would be there in 

summer and winter that groups could use I think would be 

needed by companies and also just many community groups.   

we also have something like the -- in the winter we'll do 

free public skating show, and people will come there, 

they'll skate.  They'll see professional skaters do a show. 

          Then there's nothing for them to do afterwards.  

You can go back out on the ice.  I can see this building 

really building on something like that skating show to have 

other activities happening at the same time just across the 

street.  So there's a very nice link in that. 

          The other thing that's surprising is we have 

paddlers and skiers.  We'll do trips and non-profit groups 

will want to do a paddling show or something like that, and

I've had a lot of trouble finding space to kind of host a 

presentation like this in the Boston/Cambridge area. 

          And a lot of the presenters are kind of surprised 

they can travel all around the country, and there's usually 

some community room or area that's easy for them to do their 

presentation.   

          And in the larger cities, it's harder to do that.  

These are kind of the big paddling festivals that pay into 

the existing cinemas, but they're more kind of smaller 

scale, often sponsored by a local non-profit group. 

          And that's something that there's potential here 

that I think could really work nicely.  Kendall Square is 

accessible to so many people.  There's already a base of 

people that are there, but it's also really easy for people 

who are interested from the surrounding areas to come to 

Kendall Square to be able to see a presentation.  I think it 

really -- it really builds on the activities that are 

already happening.  Thanks.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Elena Spencer is next, 

followed by Charles Hinds.   

          ELENA SPENCER:  Hi.  My name is Elena Spencer, and

Cofounder and President of the Kendall Square Orchestra.  So 

it's Tuesday.   

          Normally on a Tuesday we'd be rehearsing before 

the pandemic, and we are an orchestra that consists of 

community members and science and technology professionals 

that come together for music to support causes in our 

community and really connect in a way that's unique, versus 

just commuting in and out every day. 

          We find that Kendall's a really vibrant community, 

and having this artistic connection is something that we 

have -- our members really depend on to help with connecting 

to each other professionally, personally with the broader 

community.  You know, music is a way to bring everyone 

together.   

          When we heard about the potential for the rezoning 

of this area, we were really excited, and we have really 

enjoyed getting to know the team at BioMed Realty.  We're 

really impressed with the way that they want to build a way 

for the community, both professional, local residents and 

the arts to come together in this really beautiful space. 

          I think that what I'm really impressed with too is 

that they're really building that community before there's a

building -- you know, engaging with the artists, seeing what 

could work for everyone.   

          As Peter mentioned earlier, it's really augmenting 

what is already there in the Kendall Square area, Central 

Square area and beyond in Cambridge.                   And I 

think that this would be -- you know, the space that that 

needs to thrive.  As non-profit organizers, you know, we 

don't -- it's very difficult and expensive sometimes to find 

the space to do our craft. 

          So -- and I think it also will be really good for 

all parts of the local economy in terms of just keeping 

people in Cambridge after work, allowing them to connect 

with the broader community, bring more diverse people in to 

see the work that everyone's doing, whether it's artistic or 

other kinds of events. 

          So kudos to the team at BioMed Realty.  We 

wholeheartedly support this, and are really happy to speak 

today on that topic.  Thank you. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Charles Hinds is next, 

followed by Jeff Martin.   

          CHARLES HIND:  Hi, my name is Charles Hinds.  I'm 

the current President of the East Cambridge Planning Team.

I live at 207.5 Charles Street in East Cambridge.  I'm here 

on behalf of the Planning Team.  We sent the letter in late, 

and I'd like to read it into the record.   

          On September 9, 20 representatives of BioMed 

Realty presented a vision in a proposed project for 585 

Third Street to the East Cambridge Planning Team.  It I 

called zoning and public benefits.   

          The proposal shows that Biomed has listened to the 

community input, and has created a well thought-out design, 

based on what they heard.   

          The community is looking forward to working with 

BioMed and shaping the final concrete plans as they move 

forward.  There's a couple of things that -- a couple of 

comments were made I just wanted to mention.  One was the 

wind down there, but that comes down further down the line 

if that could be mitigated. 

          Another thing was potential endowment to keep the 

arts space sustainable.  And just to mention that the East 

Cambridge Planning Team was also part of the settlement for 

the lawsuit that Heather Hoffman had mentioned.  So one of 

the things I think should happen before this gets approved 

is get together with the parties -- there's like 14 parties

to this suit -- and discuss these plans and how to move 

forward with it. 

          Okay, thank you very much.  I am done.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Jeff Martin is next, 

followed by Dan Marshall.  Jeff Martin, you can unmute 

yourself and begin with giving your name and address.    

          [Pause] 

          If you're hearing us, Jeff Martin, you're still 

muted, so you can unmute yourself.  If you're on by phone, 

you unmute yourself by pressing *6.     

          [Pause]  

          Are you -- Jeff Martin, are you there now? I can 

see that you're unmuted, but I still can't hear you.     

          [Pause]  

          I think I'm going to come back to Jeff Martin, and 

maybe you can figure out if there's an issue with your 

microphone, and if you've registered for the meeting, 

there's also an alternative to call in by phone.  You should 

see that in the e-mail. 

          So I will go next to Dan Marshall.  And after will 

be Michael Monestime.     

          DAN MARSHALL:  Hi, Dan Marshall here from

Brookline and Cambridge Community Center for the Arts.  I'm 

the President and Executive Artistic Director.   

          We've had the great fortune to be sponsored by 

BioMed Realty at 500 Kendall Street -- Canal District 

Kendall, ever since January 13 rent free and utilities free, 

alongside CultureHouse for a while and before there were 

other organizations and individuals.   

          So speaking today, I already sent in a letter in 

April -- a letter of full support that also draws upon my 

experience as a consultant in industrial redevelopment and   

mixed-use and a bit of an expert on redevelopment plans. 

          And I'm just blown away watching again the 

development of the presentation now after seeing it for the 

first time February 27 by the attention to detail; the 

vision, the passion that you can clearly hear father 

everybody on the team.   

          So I'd like to resoundedly again support it, 

attest to the fact that as landlords if this is an 

indication of who we're going to be working with when we are 

resident artists and arts organization, non-profits, at this 

visionary building, I can attest personally that our 

organization has been greatly aided by BioMed; that they not

only give us a rent-free and utilities-free facility, but 

along that all their dedicated staff from the community 

Manager, Andrea Windhausen to their security staff in the 

building, their maintenance -- everybody was always there, 

and they even gave us money as well. 

          So, you know, it's not often that people put 

action where their mouth is.  And so, we're very thankful 

for that.  That has allowed us to establish an arts center 

during that that places were closing, and in response to 

many closures like Green Street Studios. 

          The second part of it that I'd like to just 

highlight from the letter I already provided is that they're 

really well thought-out and discussed with the community.  

They're constantly in dialogue.   

          I have no doubt that when it comes to fruition and 

until then, they'll keep supporting the arts, and that it's 

always going to be an ever-evolving, organic piece. 

          I don't know of any other location in the Greater 

Boston area where there's such a well thought-out in and out 

vision that integrates the landscape together with the arts 

and together with technology.  I'm really, really excited 

about that, as I am about the Foundry Project in Cambridge.

          I think Cambridge is really rising up to where it 

needs to be, and I don't see any reason that we should not 

go forward.  If there's any issues, I'm sure BioMed will 

work together with the community to work them out.  So thank 

you very much for hearing me today, and good luck with this 

plan.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Next, I'm going to go 

to Michael Monestime, and I'll go back to Jeff Martin again 

afterwards.  If there's anybody else who hasn't spoken yet 

and wishes to speak, please now press the, "Raise Hand" 

button on Zoom, or if you're connecting by phone, press *9.  

I'll go to Michael Monestime now.     

          MICHAEL MONASTINE:  Good evening.  Michael 

Monestime, resident of 4 George Street in North Cambridge.  

I'm also the Executive Director of the Central Square 

Business Important District, and the manager of the Central 

Square Cultural District, the only cultural district in 

Cambridge.   

          I'm calling to speak in favor of the Canal 

District Zoning Petitions, and ambitious and beautiful 

project.  As a member of the Mayor's Arts Task Force, I had 

a chance to meet with one of the petitioners -- Sal Zino,

who engaged with us over nine months of conversations 

regarding the status of the arts and culture in Cambridge. 

          I believe She also is a good listener, and has 

absorbed many of the conversations that have been taking 

place and has taken them into consideration with this 

project. 

          My organization, the Central Square BID, is 

responsible for the newly-built amphitheater, Starlight 

Square, which was erected on Municipal Lot #5 in Central 

Square.  While Starlight has centered many arts 

organizations and given hope in this difficult time, the 

reality is that it's temporary in nature and just not 

enough.  There are not enough days in the week or hours in 

the day to meet the demand. 

          With all of the closures, displacement is a one-

way street.  Arts organizations are looking for a home, and 

this proposed 30,000-square-feet arts venue, which will be a 

flexible space for music, dance, theater, lectures, 

workshops and meetings, would be a great addition to the 

city of Cambridge. 

          Space of that size allows for great activation and 

programming.  The right operator, Director in partnership

with BioMed will engage Cambridge residents and arts 

organizations to make home in this new space.  And this will 

be a true community benefit for all. 

          Kendall, for all that it does offer, does not have 

anything like this.  Plenty of buildings have the height, 

but none of them offer the opportunities that this PUD does.  

I'm happy to see that the highest and best use here is 

inclusive of the arts in a meaningful way.  Thank you for 

your time and consideration.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  And the next speaker, 

and the last speaker is a telephone participant -- the last 

number is 952.  You can unmute yourself by pressing *6 and 

you can begin speaking by giving your name and address.    

          [Pause]  

          Again, for the speaker, I can hear that you're on 

mute, or I can see that you're unmuted, but I can't hear you 

speaking.  We can't hear you over the phone, so you may need 

to change a setting or try something.    

          JEFF MARTIN:  Oh. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We can hear you now.       

          JEFF MARTIN:  Here we go.  Okay, I a part of.

Street.  I'm President of Local 328 of the united 

Brotherhood of Carpenters in Cambridge.   

          We at the Carpenters have been working partners 

with BioMed projects in Cambridge for years.  We provide 

through BioMed Projects well-paying jobs and benefits with 

diversity with our workforce, which includes Cambridge 

residents. 

          This BioMed Parcel C 585 Third Street build is 

creating more of a neighborhood with public use on the first 

three floors.  This is not just another biopharma tech 

building in Kendall Square.   

          We at the Carpenters in Cambridge are in full 

support of this project going forward, and I want to thank 

you very much, and thank you again for putting up with my 

technical ability.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and I'm glad you were 

able to connect.  So I'll consider this the last call for 

anyone who hasn't spoken yet, and would like to speak on 

this case -- the Biomed Canal District Zoning Petition.  

Please press, "Raise hand" with the picture of the hand on 

it, or press *9 if you'd like to speak.  I'll give it a few 

more seconds.

I'll turn it back over to the Chair.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you so much, Jeff, and 

thank you to everyone who called in this evening.  We're now 

going to move from public comment to Board questions and 

discussion.   

          If this hearing is continued to a future date, and 

additional information is received, there will be an 

opportunity for public comment on the additional materials.  

Additional written comments may also be submitted. 

          We received a memo from the Community Development 

Department Staff, who were available for questions, as well 

as obviously the petitioner's staff.  So do Board members 

have any questions at this time?  If so, can you just raise 

your hand on the screen?    

          Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  First question I have is 

whether there are any renderings of what a building might 

look like if the -- if they're unable to relocate the gas 

facility?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Go ahead.

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Sure.  Hi, this is Sal Zino from 

BioMed.  I wasn't sure if I -- that was for me or if that 

was for the Staff.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I think it is for you, Mr. Zino.   

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Sure.  Yeah, so the simple answer 

is no, we have not included any renderings of the building 

that would be just on Parcel C.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Ted, did you have any 

additional?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  There is a reference -- 

I'm looking for it right now, I'm sorry -- a reference.  If 

you do not have the 75 feet of frontage on Third, there's a 

reference to an appropriate pedestrian corridor between the 

existing or planned open space, and open space to the west 

of Third Street.  What does that refer to?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  You know, we -- so I think part 

of this I should just explain.  You know, this petition was 

drafted and submitted in early March and drafted before 

that.  At the time, as I mentioned earlier, we didn't have 

the second option agreement in place that would allow us to 

really pave the path for the relocation of the gas transfer 

station. 

65

          So we were, you know, we were trying our best to 

really outline a few different scenarios.  I think probably 

could have made those scenarios a bit more clear, but the 

idea was that if we -- you know, if we were unable to 

facilitate the relocation of the GTS, perhaps there would be 

an opportunity to at least consolidate that footprint of the 

facility on the existing site. 

          Because, you know, the first option that we had 

was with Eversource to acquire the site in exchange for 

relocating the GTS.  We've had that one for quite some time 

now.  But the second option was the one that we were just 

recently able to secure, and that was for the relocation 

          So I hope that explains it a bit more clearly.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mary, can I follow up with 

site. 

that?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, please do.  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So then I guess the question 

is, should all of the references to this alternative not -- 

where you don't have the GTS site relocated -- be stripped 

from the zoning petition, which would then make a much 

simpler and cleaner petition, and would be just I think much

easier all around for everyone?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:   Yeah, I mean, I appreciate that.  

I think, you know, there are a number of discretionary 

permits that will be required to ultimately facilitate the 

relocation of the GTS.  So I think for the time being, I'd 

respectfully asked that we have the ability to maintain that 

flexibility.   

          And I'd also -- Mark and Jeff who were also on the 

call, I would also, you know, welcome your comments on this 

one as well, or if you just agree, that's easy.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mary, I have one other 

question.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Go ahead.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So reference has been made to 

settlement agreement.       

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I assume you're familiar with 

it?  And I'm just wondering -- you know, reference was made 

that this violates that.  What steps have you taken, or do 

you intend to take to resolve that problem in the event the 

zoning were authorized?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Absolutely.  You know what?  I'm 

67

intimately familiar with that agreement.  I've been at 

BioMed for 12 years, and actually one of my first 

responsibilities was to really create an abstract of that 

agreement and ensure that we were 100 percent in compliance.  

We've always taken that very seriously.   

          It's -- it is actually -- you know, it's obviously 

a private agreement between some of the community 

organizations and a BioMed entity.   

          We are -- we've had discussions regarding that.   

We will continue to have discussions regarding that.  I 

think to some extent, you know, we kind of need to have some 

input from the city on the proposed zoning to understand how 

best to approach it.   

          But it's out there.  We've shared it, and 

completely prepared to respect it.  Trust that we'll resolve 

it.  You know, we've had a longstanding relationship with 

the ECPT and Chuck and Heather and everyone else over there.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Ted, did you have any 

others?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No, I'm all set right now.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Okay.  Lou Bacci, 

you have your hand up?

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, thanks Mary.  Could you 

explain the scenario one and two, just kind of confused?  

Two gets an extra 20 feet of height and another -- that's 

100,000 square feet of floor space difference, but only 

15,000 of it goes to the preference space.   

          The whole -- one second, I'm turning the page 

here.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Sure.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The whole allowed 

development proposed from the Staff memo, I wish someone 

would go through it and tell us exactly what's going to 

happen in each scenario, and it doesn't look like the first 

scenario will become to fruition.  I'd like it clarified.  

There's too much there.       

          MARY FLYNN:  So we really haven't heard that much 

about the thing tonight, other than, you know, very broad 

parameters.  And it is somewhat complicated.  So why don't 

we ask CDD if they can just focus on some of the highlights 

in their memo, which I think raised some good concerns and 

issues to consider, as we think about their proposal.  So 

Jeff, can I turn it over to you?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Certainly.  Thank you to the Vice

Chair.  And, you know, we did provide an overview with some 

material on this petition.  It starts with just a little bit 

of the history of the area and the history of the planning 

of the area -- the zoning for the site, the PUD-3 zoning was 

established actually some time, you know, in the past back 

in the late '70s, when the city started to establish -- you 

know, PUD zoning for areas like Kendall Square that were 

being redeveloped. 

          There was a rezoning in 2001.  It was based on the 

ECAP zoning.  It changed some of the dimensional standards, 

but before that change, it didn't change that much of the 

zoning.  But before that change took place, a permit was 

granted for this development.   

          So this area that’s been referred to -- it's 

referred to now as the Canal District, it's had several 

names over the years -- was permitted under the PUD-3 zoning 

which, you know, like a lot of the PUD zoning of that time 

and sort of unlike the current proposal, it was sort of more 

general in nature and it wasn't specifically -- you know, 

tailored to a specific site. 

          You know, we provided some background about the 

Kendall Square study and various studies that have been done 

70

in this area.   

          In terms of -- and maybe this is, you know, partly 

sort of a loose question in terms of understanding the 

zoning proposal and how -- really what the change is from 

what current zoning says, the -- in some ways there's 

similarities between this and the Cambridgeside PUD proposal 

that the Board looked at last year, where it's taking not 

the entire zoning district, but just the portion of the 

district that is part of the permitted PUD and, as noted, it 

adds on the gas transfer station site.   

          So it's just a little bit -- kind of, it's 

basically a zoning proposal that's kind of constrained to a 

specific development of plan.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And it takes the existing 

development sort of as a given, so the development that's 

out there now is kind of fixed in place under the zoning 

proposal, but then it permits an additional either 450,000 

square feet or 550,000 square feet of lab office development 

plus the arts center -- whatever the different versions of 

the arts use, that are proposed. 

          So it takes the form of a lot of the zoning

proposals that have been looked at the recently where it's 

really intended just to allow an incremental increase in 

development over what's currently permitted and built. 

          There are some things that we've pointed out about 

the zoning that we thought were a little sort of interesting 

to look at.   

          One was in terms of open space.  The zoning 

proposal keeps the same zoning requirements, so the minimum 

zoning requirement in this district is 15 percent publicly 

beneficial open space.  What's currently in the development 

plan exceeds that amount.   

          And, you know, 15 percent compared to what's been 

included in the zoning for some other parts of the city that 

have been, you know, rezoned for development have -- you 

know, there's been sort of an increase in the open space 

requirements.   

          So we had some questions about what the intention 

would be, also given that this site, as it's kind of 

portrayed here on the screen would in itself contain a 

significant amount of open space.  So we had some questions 

about that.   

          We had some questions about the height.  The

height limit would be either 230 feet or 250 feet under the 

proposal.  250 feet is the maximum height limit recommended 

in the Kendall Square study for, you know, areas like the 

MIT development and the Volpe development and the kind of 

Cambridge Redevelopment Authority area.   

          All of those set a maximum of 250 feet for 

nonresidential use, but they allow additional height for 

residential use, and there are -- some of those development 

plans will have residential that exceeds 250 feet. 

          But in general, 250 feet is kind of the maximum in 

this part of the city.  There was a provision that we 

thought maybe needed a little bit more attention about 

calculating the height differently, based on or being able 

to permit additional height if mechanical equipment is 

internalized within the building. 

          That's something that we would maybe want to look 

at more closely, because just in general we tend to prefer 

to have the same -- even if the height limits are different, 

we like to have the same standards in place for how we 

calculate height. 

          And it could result in some unexpected 

consequences if we change just the methodology, we use to 

73

calculate height just for this area. 

          There -- one of the things that we noted about 

this zoning petition is it takes some of the plan 

requirements, the kind of Master Plan level requirements 

that we have implemented in areas like over at the Volpe 

site to this development.  It's worth considering whether we 

think that would be necessary, since it's really meant to 

enable just development on one site.   

          So some of the plan -- the larger kind of plan 

requirements that are included in the zoning might deserve a 

little bit of rethinking. 

          There is some language having to do with 

consistency, which was an issue for the Planning Board in 

the past in terms of the -- how to deal with conflicts 

between that might arise between this zoning and other 

zoning.   

          Generally in PUD zoning we don't talk about 

conflicting language, because PUD is an Overlay zoning.  It 

allows the Planning Board to make modifications to the 

underlying -- to approve modifications of the underlying 

zoning within certainly limitations. 

          So usually when it comes to conflicts, we like to 

74

make sure we have a way to sort that out during the Planning 

Board permitting process, and not to presume -- you know, 

how any kind of conflict would be resolved. 

          And I think just the overall -- I would say if 

there's one kind of broad comment we talk a little bit about 

specific elements that are I called in the Kendall Square 

plan.  Because that really is the guiding plan that we look 

to for this part of the city, the plan that was done in 

2013.   

          This proposal incorporates many of the aspects of 

the Kendall Square plan that are recommended, including 

around sustainability.  There are some things that we think 

maybe are deserving of some more attention, such as 

activation on Third Street, which is something we think is 

an important element of the Kendall Square plan that should 

be reflected in the zoning. 

          In terms of parking, you know, we think that it's 

a move in the right direction looking at this as a 

development that would not create additional parking.  At 

the same time, the Kendall Square plan recommends maximum 

parking ratios, and we would want to look at what parking is 

actually being provided compared to what development is

being proposed to make sure that those ratios are in line 

with the plan recommendations in order to make sure we're 

mitigating transportation impacts to the extent possible, 

and as Sean mentioned in the presentation, it will be 

subject to TIS review. 

          We think there is some -- we pointed out some 

small things in the language that should be clarified in 

order to make sure it's clear that the TIS would be required 

under Article 19. 

          And there are some things that are -- you know, 

not specifically included in this proposal that are part of 

the broader Kendall Square plan, such as -- you know, in 

particular housing, which is for multisite development often 

there's a mix of housing and commercial.   

          This is proposed as one building.  There are 

recommendations for innovation space in the Kendall Square 

plan, and recommendations for contributions towards open 

space transit and workforce readiness. 

          The thing that this proposal does include, which 

isn't contemplated in the Kendall Square plan is the arts 

and cultural center.  So that's sort of an alternative 

approach to addressing a -- kind of a broader community need 

76

through this proposal. 

          And I would just say if there's sort of one 

overall thing that we noted needed to be, you know, 

addressed a little bit more clearly in the zoning, it's that 

-- you know, PUD zoning really should identify what the 

guiding kind of plan is that creates kind of a basis for the 

Planning Board to evaluate a development proposal. 

          And so, we thought there should be some more 

explicit mention of the planning -- the relevant planning 

studies in Kendall Square, and how they would guide the 

Planning Board's ultimate review of a development proposal 

if the zoning were adopted.   

          So that's a really fairly quick overview of what 

we commented on.  I'm happy to answer any follow up 

questions.  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Jeff, and I guess it's you 

or the proponent.  And you touched on a few of the other 

questions that I had.  But the difference -- the 100 -- it's 

a 100,000-square-feet swing here from scenario one to 

scenario two, and only a 15,000-square-foot swing in the 

performance space.  We need some explanation; I'm not sure 

how that works.

          MARY FLYNN:  I think, Mr. Zino, that might be 

something that you would -- we would like you to address, 

please?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yes, sure, sure.  Again, this is 

Sal Zino from BioMed.  I think, you know, one of the 

difficulties that we had to confront with the smaller 

footprint was really that ground-floor area obviously was 

severely restricted.   

          And I think those ratios too, the 15 versus 30 and 

then the additional 100,000 are both really reflective of 

one, the fact that the ground-floor space and the footprint 

of this height is much smaller, but number two also 

reflective of the cost to relocate the GTS, which is 

significant. 

          So I don't know if that, you know, answers the 

question adequately, but I'm glad to go on a little bit 

further, let me know what you think.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.: You clarified it slightly.  

So because we have nothing to look at on scenario one, are 

we to assume that you don't believe you will do that 

project?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  That's correct.  Yeah.  I think

-- like I said, you know, when we -- at the time that we 

drafted this, we didn't have the second option agreement in 

place when we submitted it, we didn't have the second option 

agreement in place.  We actually only secured that in June.  

          So that makes -- you know, we said that it -- you 

know, what we have now is really a path.  We've paved the 

path to relocate the GTS with those two agreements.  So 

yeah, you know, we're confident that we can get it done.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'm glad.  It's a much 

better project with it.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Absolute.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  One other thing.  No TIS, 

but a transportation assessment -- can someone -- I don't 

know if we have anybody from Traffic and Parking.  It 

doesn't seem that this is allowed in our rules.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  I can sort of take that.  I'm not 

necessarily speaking on behalf of Traffic and Parking, but 

they were part of our review process and provided input, and 

we did have a discussion, including Traffic and Parking and 

our Transportation Planning staff and CDD with the BioMed 

team about this. 

          So from our perspective, yes a transportation --

I'm sorry, development proposal should include a 

transportation impact study, just like any other large 

project review.  And I think that maybe needs to be -- would 

need to be clarified in the zoning. 

          One of the things that we discussed with the -- 

you know, with the petitioners is that at the zoning stage, 

while we don't think it's necessarily appropriate or wise to 

try to undertake a full TIS while, you know, working on the 

zoning, there could be some higher level analysis. 

          And I think Sean sort of referred to this in his 

presentation -- looking at just what the overall difference 

in trip generation would be looking at the permit and 

proposed zoning, and then trying to evaluate that in the 

context of larger kind of planning principles.   

          It might be a helpful exercise at the zoning 

stage. But at the special permit stage, that's where -- you 

know, Traffic and Parking would -- you know, create along 

with the applicant -- would create a scope for a traffic 

impact study; would, you know, talk about, you know, when 

and how traffic counts would need to be done, and how it 

would be analyzed.  Traffic and Parking would review that 

study in detail and would have to certify that it's been

done in an appropriate way.   

          That would all happen before it comes to the 

Planning Board for review.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, Lou did you have any other 

follow-up questions, or additional questions?    

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  For right now, that's all.  

I just wanted to make sure that transportation and parking 

would accept an assessment instead of a TIS?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thanks.  Okay, let's see.  

Corinne, you have your hand up.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  I have two 

questions for the petitioner, and three questions for staff 

through you, Madam Chair.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Sure.  Go right ahead.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So for the petitioner, let's 

imagine that the PUD zoning petition was approved by the 

City Council.  I'd like to know what your expected annual 

rental receipts from the two scenarios would be.   

          I've done the quick math myself, based on current 

estimated prices of $70 to $100 per square feet (sic), but I 

want to check that against your numbers.  

          So my quick calculations show that you could 

81

12

13

22

reasonably expect between $25.5 million dollars in rent 

receipt per year up to $46.5 million dollars in rent 

receipts per year, completely excluding the arts center and 

any revenue from that.  Are those what your numbers are 

looking like?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  ^Yeah, I thought those are.  Yes.  

And those are fair estimates of what the rents are in 

Kendall for lab space nowadays.   

          As far as the rents from the arts and culture 

component, the 30,000 square feet of theater space and 

ground-floor public space, there would be no rents 

associated with that space. 

          And that would actually require not only -- I 

think the operational model is something that’s really -- 

it's difficult to speak to the details of it, because it is 

such a detailed process and there is so much information. 

          But this is about more than just delivering the 

physical space, which we think would be pretty incredible 

equipped with the latest and greatest technology.  But it's 

about providing the ongoing operational subsidies required 

to keep the space flexible, required to keep it sustainable.  

          So that's -- you know, when you look at the 

82

revenues from one side, the ongoing revenues on the lab 

side, there are also those ongoing expenses from the rent to 

the operational subsidies that are required to keep the arts 

and culture space as we've represented in our proposal.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you. My next question is 

about something you spent a lot of time on in your 

presentation.  So racial justice is extremely important to 

me, and like the rest of the country and the world, 

Cambridge has systemic and institutional racism that result 

in systemic inequalities and unfair outcomes. 

          And even worse, like San Francisco, Cambridge is 

an extremely gentrified city, and rather than it getting 

better here, our racial justice outcomes are getting worse. 

          So I appreciated the time and attention you've 

paid in your presentation to a diversity, equality and 

inclusion process, especially by starting with diverse 

places in the design.   

          But I wanted to know more about whether your 

organization has the appropriate experience to be able to 

realize those principles.  I'd specifically like to know 

what previous successes you can point to.  I'm taking a 

quick look at your website.  I see that 53 percent of your

21

22

entire staff is female, 31 percent are nonwhite.   

          When I look at leadership roles, the leadership 

team on the website is 90 percent white.  You appear to have 

less than 25 percent women as top executives, zero African-

American or black executives on the leadership team; 

notably, zero African-American or black women. 

          So again, the presentation was quite thorough on 

the planning for equitable and diverse art center, but I 

want to know again what previous successes you can point to 

as experiences to be able to launch those organizational 

principles successfully.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Sure, sure.  I think, you know, 

I'd start out pointing out that, you know, the way we look 

at this is -- again, not to keep going back to the 

operational model, but what we're recreating here is a 

foundation for these principles to really be founded on.   

          And a lot of that relates to the operational 

model, to ensuring that the spaces can accommodate a diverse 

range of ours that is not a complete type of space.  We're 

not producing a type of space that will only be appealing to 

more established organizations or only affordable to more 

established organizations.

          So, you know, when we think about how this space 

actually functions, I think one of the key points here to 

drawing people to Kendall that haven't normally felt 

comfortable in Kendall is creating an opportunity for them 

to really take over the space, for them to own a space. 

          And the model that we have, the finances that 

we've arranged for the site will allow that -- will allow a 

large group, a diverse group, one that's not typically 

comfortable in Kendall to come in, to take over this space 

and to feel welcome -- not just the token, you know, small 

event with a few people, but an entire space; a 250-300 seat 

performance venues; all of the assigned spaces to come in 

and feel welcome, to present as they wish what they want, 

however, they want -- to invite whoever they want. 

          I think for me personally, that's how I focus on 

really fulfilling the commitment in diversity, equity 

inclusion is creating this strong foundation to ensure that 

it's something we can actually provide. 

          Some of the numbers that you touched on; those are 

accurate.  We do have beyond that a pretty significant team 

that's helped us to create this proposal that you're looking 

at here tonight.

          We spent a lot of time, as Andrea mentioned -- a 

lot of time reaching out to a very diverse cross-section of 

the Cambridge population from performers and beyond to help 

us inform this proposal.   

          So, you know, this is the beginning of it.  This 

is a, you know, a proposal for a rezoning.  We have a lot of 

work to do, but we are committed.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I appreciate that.  I am going 

to push back a little, though, on the question --    

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Sure.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  -- because my question is 

actually what successes you already have that you can point 

to.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Sure.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  BioMed is a huge part of 

Kendall Square.   

          SALVATORE ZINO:  It is.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And I would say that right now 

Kendall Square doesn't feel welcoming to everyone.  So I'm 

wondering if you have some previous successes we can speak 

to.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yeah.  So I think, you know, one

of the things that we've done with the activation efforts 

that we have -- that have taken place since we first 

started, the way we've looked at it with the -- the sort of 

formation of this proposal, and the way that we've selected 

or solicited community feedback is to conduct some 

activations in Kendall that have a more diverse range of 

performers than one would typically see. 

          It was interesting to see, though.  You know, 

we've had them in there.  We've had artists of color perform 

and, in some cases, -- in many cases -- the turnout was 

exceptional.   

          And I think, so -- you know, we've done it on a 

small scale, and I think it's -- you know, a test case that 

makes us realize that it is viable, and that it can be 

possible on a larger scale.  We have more work to do on that 

front.  I think we're off to a good start. 

          We've also had CultureHouse, which was interesting 

-- an interesting experiment that we conducted for about a 

six-month period in Kendall.  It was unfortunately cut short 

with COVID, but creating a space that's really free, 

accessible to the public; one that doesn't have a security 

desk or a security presence looming over you really drew 

87

people to Kendall.   

          And, you know, it's reflected in some of the 

surveys that we collected that if you make people feel 

comfortable and you give them a place where they feel 

comfortable, they'll come to Kendall.   

          So it's a small piece, but we've learned a lot 

from that experience.  And, you know, again, we'd like to 

scale that up here.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you so much.  And Madam 

Chair, I have three questions for staff.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, okay.  Go ahead, Corinne.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So these questions are in very 

basic language, and I'm not doing this to -- I'm doing this 

because I'm truly, truly confused.   

          So for the public and for me, I'm new to this PUD, 

but I'm very confused and my first question is, is it 

correct that Alexandria was supposed to build an 85,000- 

square-feet art center, they didn't, and then they just sold 

this land?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  That's not correct.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.

owned by a group called, "The Constellation Center." It was 

part of the originally permitted PUD.  And what it was 

permitted for was the construction of an 85,000 square-foot 

performing arts center.   

          This predated even my time somewhat at the city.  

It was originally conceived a -- really a large-scale kind 

of regional performing arts center.  And maybe Ken Greenberg 

could speak more to the history of it. 

          But that was -- that was the owner of the site.  

It was an entity, a non-profit entity called, "The 

Constellation Center' and they sold the site several years 

ago, and it was purchased by BioMed Realty.  And that is the 

remaining piece of this PUD that was not constructed.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And so, again, a 

very basic question:  Is it correct that -- so it was not 

required to be an arts center?   

          What I'm trying to figure out is if it was 

supposed to be an arts center before, why was someone able 

to purchase it without being required to build an 85,000- 

square-feet arts center?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  To try to explain it as best I 

can, although it does seem there's some sort of nuance to

it, which may make it seem a little complicated.   

          So, you know, there are different levels of 

permitting, of development sort of permitting.  There's the 

zoning, and what we're talking about today, which sets just 

the basic rules for what can and can't be built on a 

particular piece of land.  The current zoning doesn't have 

any provision requiring a performing arts center or any 

other kind of arts use.  It allows a range of residential 

and nonresidential land uses in the district. 

          Back in -- what was it, 1999 there was a special 

permit granted by the Planning Board for a -- a development 

plan, a PUD, that included a range of different uses -- 

office, residential and this retail at the ground-floor in 

various sites, and this site, which would be the performing 

arts center.   

          So what -- so that was a Planning Board permit, 

and so, if the -- so doing something different, and that 

what it basically means; that a -- you know, somebody who 

wanted to do a -- wanted to build that, they would have to 

go through a design process and then would have to -- and 

then could get a building permit to build it, without having 

to go back through the special permit process.

22

          And this is all just in very sort of general 

terms. 

          So that can be changed by an amendment to the PUD 

special permit, which could be granted by the Planning 

Board.  An amendment could create -- or propose an 

alternative development plan, but that would still have to 

be within the overall limitations of the current zoning.   

          And so, I think the reason why this is coming 

forward as a zoning proposal is that this particular 

proposal in terms of the height and maybe some other, you 

know, dimensional aspects, would not conform to the current 

zoning, so it requires this zoning amendment. 

          So this is kind of like un -- you know, it's -- 

the process is kind of starting from the general and kind of 

narrowing it down to what's permitted, and this is kind of 

like unwinding it a little bit so that it can then be 

brought back to a permissible development plan.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And I know it might 

sound like I keep asking the same question.  I did read the 

memo, and I have been listening, I'm just trying to 

understand kind of what is allowed and what we're being 

asked to consider.

          So is this correct, then:  That it would be 

allowed to build 85,000 square feet of mixed-use development 

as is, without an arts center, but to increase to 390 -- I'm 

sorry, 380,000 square feet or 465,000 square feet, that 

that's where we're kind of doing the give and take there?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Right.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  So not building the performing 

arts center would require some action by the Planning Board 

to amend the development plan.   

          You know, we haven't seen or discussed sort of an 

alternative development plan under the current zoning, so 

we're not really sure what that would look like.  It would 

have to come, you know, to the Planning Board and the 

Planning Board would have to review it, and we would have to 

review it. 

          But that's what could be done under current 

zoning, compared to what is being proposed now.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.  So under current zoning, 

the owner has total ability to build 85,000 square feet of 

kind of anything that appropriately fits in that zoning.  

Got it, thank you.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yeah, by special permit, yep.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Excuse me, if I can comment?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, go ahead, Hugh.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  All BioMed can do now under the 

current PUD permit is build an arts center.  So they took a 

big risk to buy this piece of land and in the hopes that 

they could come up with an alternative proposal that would 

work.  And what's on the table now is the alternative 

proposal, in zoning terms.   

          But if the zoning doesn't pass, they're stuck with 

either not developing anything or building an arts center, 

neither of which is an outcome I'm sure -- they wouldn't 

want either of those outcomes.  So --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I would just add, "or seeking an 

amendment to the --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- to the PUD special permit and to 

build something else.  That would be the alternative.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, yeah.  I think you're 

clarifying that amendment to the permit was very helpful, 

Jeff.  Because it seemed to me that was the easiest way to 

go, except I didn't realize there was the limitation on the

height and the square footage.  Because it is complicated. 

           So I -- you know, what I'm -- I think everybody's 

looking for is the most direct way to achieve the objectives 

that are stated for the site, and having, you know, some 

level of assurance that what's being shown is really what's 

going to be allowed for in the zoning and that, you know, it 

doesn't have so much flexibility that we somehow lose 

control. 

          Okay, Corinne, did you have any others?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  This is just a question to kind 

of put a pin in, because I don't want to take up the 

petitioner's time with this, but Jeff, this just kind of 

highlights for me something that confuses me about when 

people come before us and say they're going to do this or 

that for the community, understanding really clearly when 

it's required and when it's not. 

          Because if I would have sat on this Board, you 

know, 20 years ago when this happened, might have felt like 

I was promised an arts center, and I never got an arts 

center for the community and how was, you know, $1.3 million 

-- almost $1.4 million square feet built out without giving 

the thing that was promised to the community.

          So that maybe is a question I can ask you offline, 

but it's one this kind of recurs for me at these meetings.  

And again, I know that's not the petitioner's fault, so I 

don't want to take their time with that.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Thanks, Corinne.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Madam Chair, could I follow up 

on --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted, yes.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- the discussion?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, please.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So Jeff, I just want to be 

clear.  So is the language in the proposed zoning about the 

relationship to PUD-3 and the fact that it relates to 

undeveloped rights and outstanding obligations which would 

be deemed extinguished if they got a PUD special permit 

under the zoning:  Is that going directly to the fact they 

want to get out of having to build an 85,000-square-foot 

performing arts center?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I mean, I don't know that I can ns 

that question with regard to the intent of the language.  

They -- you know, we have noted, and the Board has noted in 

the past that that type of language about conflict and, you 

95

22

know, existing rights and distinguishing of rights and, you 

know, those -- that kind of language is not really typical 

for PUD zoning. 

          I think the way I would frame it is just more 

simply, which is that the arts --, the 85,000 square-foot 

performing arts center that's currently permitted for this 

site is permitted as part of the Planning Board's PUD 

special permit.  And changing that would mean getting an 

amendment from the Planning Board -- you know, to that 

special permit.   

          I'm not -- you know, we haven fully discussed or 

analyzed what an alternative plan would be under the current 

zoning, so I can't really say for sure what it would be, but 

it would require amending the special permit. 

          And this zoning proposes a change to the PUD 

zoning, which would procedurally work the same way as the 

current zoning.  It would only authorize development subject 

to a Planning Board special permit.   

          So it would change the zoning, and then it would 

enable the owner of the site to seek a new special permit 

for an amendment -- probably some combination of a new 

special permit and amendment to the original special permit 

96

that would enable what they're showing here.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I guess I'm very unclear from 

that language that's proposed as to what would be covered 

and what wouldn't be covered.   

          And I would really ask that the City Solicitor is 

asked to take a close look at that and the impact it has on 

the existing special permits, and whether this -- you know, 

by, you know, the language itself would wipe out that 

obligation, or whether it would still be required for the 

Planning Board to amend the existing special permit.  

Because the language reads to me that it's extinguishing all 

outstanding obligations.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  We can certainly do that.  And 

again, as we've pointed out, that's something that we would 

definitely do that, because it's not language that we 

typically include in PUD zoning.  PUD zoning is usually 

predicated on the idea that everything that's authorized in 

the zoning ultimately has to come to the Planning Board for 

approval of the development.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yeah, Jeff, would you mind -- 

this is Sal again; would you mind if I added a few comments 

there?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Not at all.       

          MARY FLYNN:  That's fine, yes.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Thank you.  So -- yeah, so we've 

-- you know, we've talked about what the site is zoned for 

currently.  And 85,000 square feet just applies to Parcel C, 

not the GTS site.   

          Parcel C was the only piece of our site that was 

actually part of the original PUD.  So the GTS piece is 

above and beyond Parcel C.  But, as everyone noted, Parcel C 

was in fact or is in fact zoned for 85,000 square feet at 

the performing arts use.   

          And the way we've always approached this is that 

while the performing arts piece wasn't a condition of the 

original approvals -- there were a lot of benefits that came 

with the original approvals.   

          Those included the open spaces, canoe and kayak 

rental, the ice skating rink to name a few -- we knew from 

day one, we knew from the day that we acquired this site 

that there was very strong expectation in the community that 

this arts and culture space be delivered.   

          What we're proposing today is a bit different than 

some of the plans that the previous owner had for the site.

When I think about what he had proposed, it was more of a 

grand opera hall I guess, that would specialize in the very 

specific use.   

          What we're proposing is dramatically different, 

and I think something that -- you know, that we've heard 

over the last two years is really a need and is what the 

community wants.  Like I said, you know, the original 

proposal was one that was already -- was put out there, you 

know, close to 20 years ago now.   

          So the needs and wants of the community have 

changed.  But that's always how we've looked at this is that 

we knew from day one there was a strong expectation that 

this is something that we would have to deliver at some 

level if we were to move forward with presenting any 

proposal for rezoning on these combined sites.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you for that additional 

information and clarification.  Ted, did you have -- are you 

okay at the moment, or did you want to do a follow up? 

Because if -- I don't see any other question.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I guess I'd ask the developer 

if it's -- you know, they envision that if this were adopted 

and it got a special permit under this zoning, that it wipes

out the other obligation without any further option of the 

Planning Board?     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  So I think that's more of a legal 

matter.  I think just for the sake of clarity, that’s how we 

phrased it.  You know, like I said, the 85,000-square-foot 

space wasn't as much an obligation as it was, you know, an 

option.  Obviously, it was the only option for the site.  

But the way we phrased it in the petition is just for the 

sake of clarity.  That was the only reason.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I was a lawyer, and I don't 

think it's clear to me.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Sure.  Then we, I think, should 

work on it.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Which is why I'd like the City 

Solicitor to --    

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Sure.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- render an opinion on it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Not -- since I 

didn’t see any other Planning Board members' hands raised -- 

oh, Lou is that -- are you asking another question, or is 

that from --

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'm afraid so.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Go ahead.  Okay.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  It seems like this has gone 

even further than I thought, looking at more of the numbers.  

So now instead of an 85,000-square-feet-performance space, 

we get a 30,000-square-foot-performance space, and we have 

to give up 465,000 square feet of building for it.  

Itinerary needs some clarification here, just the ticker is 

getting long on this.     

          SALVATORE ZINO:  Yeah.  And that is the proposal.  

I think the thing to keep in mind is the type of space that 

was proposed I think versus what we're proposing today.   

          And I would have envisioned the 85,000 square-foot 

venue -- I mean this was the history of the site was 

actually -- the intent was to create a facility that 

specialized in baroque opera. 

          That would not have appealed to a diverse range of 

people.  It would more than likely not have been affordable 

at any level.  What we're proposing today is dramatically 

different.   

          And so, you know, I think there are a lot of 

requirements that come on the side when you have to think

about the finances of how to operate a space like this that 

are substantially different.   

          It requires a lot more to keep it operational -- 

to keep the doors open, to keep it accessible, than what 

might have been the case with the 85,000-square-foot-venue. 

          It was -- I think that was one of the reasons why 

this site sat as it did for 15 plus years.  You know, the 

vision was just really not viable. 

          This is -- you know, today us kind of fast 

forwarding after looking at this gravel lot personally for 

12 years.  This is a proposal that is viable.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  I think I'd like to move 

now to discussion.  And I think that could potentially also 

give some additional opportunity for questions if some 

should pop up during that.   

          But our -- you know, our options tonight are to 

make a recommendation on the zoning to the City Council 

either in favor or opposition.  We could also make comments, 

or we could continue the discussion to another hearing.   

          So I'm just going to go through the Board members 

by one, and if people could just give me your thoughts on 

what you think the status of the proposal is and how we

should proceed. 

          And Ted, why don't we start with you, since you 

had raised some of the legal issues, et cetera.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  Well actually, I like 

the proposal quite a bit.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And I know we're not passing on 

a particular building at the moment, but I think the 

renderings are very attractive.  I think I have -- well, 

other than cleaning up some of the language and making it 

very clear of what is intended, I don't really have a 

problem with the proposal.  I think that staff did an 

excellent job in their memo of identifying the issues.   

          I certainly think that if it were to go forward, 

City Council should be very clear on what is the 

relationship between any permit that might be granted under 

this, and the former permit with regard to the 85,000-square 

feet performance center.   

          I will say that the first Planning Board matter 

hearing that I was at when I was first appointed to the 

Board, there was reference to this opera center that was 

promised to be built there, and, you know, I just sort of --

what in the world are they talking about?"  

          And, you know, I think it's correct that they're 

never going to build an opera center there.  This looks, you 

know, quite lovely to me. 

          I also think that the issue about the added 

height, if they were to put mechanicals inside the building 

is very problematic also.   

          Because as it's worded now, you could put 

mechanicals in one or more floors, add that to the height, 

and then still add some additional mechanicals on the roof, 

and you would be way, way above the 250 for height.   

          I think if City Council were to go forward with 

that concept of not including any space that was taken up by 

mechanicals inside the building, they would still have to 

put some sort of absolute height limit on the building.  And 

I agree with Staff indicating that this is a significant 

change from anything else that’s been done in the city. 

          Other than some Boards issues here and there, I'd 

be prepared to recommend it to the City Council, provided 

they were very clear on exactly what it includes, and what 

might be allowed under it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And just a question for you:

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I would certainly 

recommend getting out of the either/or --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- and just going forward with 

the combined site, you know?      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  We really don't know what the 

alternative is, other than it's a large built -- somewhat 

smaller, but still very large building, and a much smaller 

performance center and very unclear how it all would relate 

to Third Street.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Hugh, what are your 

thoughts on the zoning?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I want to say that I'm actually 

calling in for a performing arts venue.  You may be able to 

hear an orchestra rehearsing in the background -- there are 

15 musicians in my garden, socially distanced, so I measured 

six feet between the chairs and myself -- that is having 

rehearsal because they were unable to find a place to have a 

rehearsal.

          So I think there's a piece that hasn't come out in 

a discussion, which is the -- this is Jeff's memo -- about 

the K2 study and the recommendations of the Key study.  This 

was about eight or ten years ago.  

          And the Community Development Department drafted 

up a rezoning petition that covered part of this site as 

well as Volpe, as well as MIT, as well as the CRA site. 

          And the Planning Board recommended at that time 

that the proposal be split up, and the zoning be considered 

directly with the landowners, because they were single 

landowners in each of those areas. 

          And the result was plans that we recommended the 

Council adopted for MIT, for Volpe, for the CRA, and that 

involved a bunch of -- range of uses, and involved an 

overall density of between 4 and 5 FAR. 

          So I tend to look at this proposal in the context 

of the broader area.  And it turns out what's being proposed 

here would result in a development that has an FAR a little 

bit above 4.  So it's consistent, and it's sort of on the 

low end of the other developments that abut this site that 

we've approved. 

          And I think I was worried that, you know, we're 

106

building this very large building, and that they were going 

to build something that would be totally sort of out of 

equity with the rest of what we've done.  It turns out 

that's not the case.   

          The height is similar, the overall density is a 

little less, and the open space is, you know, already 

fabulous open space -- I mean, just unbelievable what's been 

done here.  And this is my point to you.   

          I thank Ken Greenberg for his participation in 

this project for 20 years, because this is a tremendous part 

of the city.  It's got a hole that's got to be filled, 

that's what we're talking about tonight, but his efforts to 

come up with a vision for how you would replan, you know, 

six blocks of the city to make it part of the city and make 

it even special and respond, it's just amazing. 

          And then he did it again at NorthPoint.  So 

thanks, Ken. 

          I think the most important part of the Community 

Development memo is pointing out that we need more specific 

criteria for the approval of the special permit that we 

would be giving under this, and it's basically just 

referencing the planning studies and principles that apply 

107

to this area that should be taken into consideration and 

evaluated in a permit; that the zoning should call those 

out; just a list of the -- it's a standard thing.   

          I'm in full support of requiring a full 

transportation TIS, because I think that's what a project of 

this scale owes the city, even if they're not going to be 

building any more parking. 

          So you can see that this passes muster with me.  

I'm sorry, I would have loved a) a big constellation center.  

There were actually four halls in addition to the baroque 

opera house, which I admit I would have not have gone to at 

all frequently.  But, you know, it was a pipe dream that 

somebody threw millions of dollars away thinking about 

making plans and things, but it never was feasible. 

          You know, David Klein didn't know that 20 years 

ago, but that's the way it played out.   

          And I think the way BioMed has said, "If you're 

going to have a performance of arts center, what's the right 

one to have here?  And they've talked to the community at 

great length, and as you notice, most of the people who 

spoke at our hearing tonight are people who are in 

preference arts.

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And they're all saying, "Yeah, they 

got it right."  I guess one other point I would make is 

apparently the 30,000 feet or 20- or 15,000 feet doesn't 

count the ground floor common area space.  Well, of course, 

an opera house would have a big, ground-floor lobby and 

common space.  So it's not exactly an apples and apples 

thing. 

          And I think maybe one way to resolve the option of 

strategy is to say that a performing arts space under option 

one should be proportional to the space in option two.  Now, 

that'll give even more of an incentive to sell, so make sure 

it's option two that they carried forward. 

          But it in a sense protects the community.  Maybe 

it's not exactly proportional because I'm thinking, like, 

there's a couple of floors of public and arts space under 

the lab.   

          That's -- if it's a small building, there still 

should be a couple of floors of public and arts space, you 

know?  That makes sense to me.  That's a suggestion, if it 

cannot be implemented, and I think the way to address Lou's 

question of proportionality.

          So I'm in full support of this.  I think there's 

some work that needs to be done, and other members have 

brought that up.  The Staff memo brought that up.   

          I'm afraid we can't act on this tonight, but I 

really think it's a terrific proposal that gives the city 

something it needs to fill in a hole and to give the 

technology industry in Kendall Square another half a million 

square feet.  And we're running out of land. 

          So, you know, if you can get another half a 

million square feet of tech space in Kendall Square, the 

world will be a better place for it, a smarter place.  Those 

are my comments.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you very much.  Steven Cohen, 

what's -- let's hear from you next.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Okay, generally speaking I agree 

with Hugh's comments.  However, unless I'm mistaken, here we 

are reacting to a specific plan, but before us is not a 

specific plan.  Before us right now is a zoning change.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  And we should just be focusing 

on the zoning change.   

          And in fact, the applicant is not required -- in

the past that zoning change -- to go forward with the 

precise plans that we're looking at tonight.  I have no 

reason to believe that they won't -- all I'm saying is that 

our decision tonight should be based primarily on the 

zoning, without assuming, you know, that the applicant will 

build precisely what is being presenting tonight. 

          So having said that, I have no problem with the 

zoning, and if increased zoning height and density will make 

it possible to achieve other amenities in this location, I'm 

in support of that. 

          I want to make sure, however, that the ultimate 

zoning provisions give us the right and the power and the 

flexibility to assure that the amenities that are being 

offered in return for this increased density will in fact be  

one which is developed in -- you know, with this Board, so 

that we can be sure that the final plans and the final 

amenities will in fact be great; will be really a 

contribution to the community in the way that’s being 

presented tonight. 

          But as -- again, what's presented tonight is just, 

you know, general language.  It isn't the specific proposal.  

And I just want to make sure that at the end of the day, you

know, that we do get amenities of the same sort of feel and 

quality that we're seeing in the renderings and in the 

presentations. 

          But having said that, I certainly have no 

objection to what's being proposed.  And if in fact at the 

end of the day we get amenities of the sort that’s being 

presented here, then this is a great plan.   

          So, again, my focus is to make sure that the 

planning and the zoning provisions are such that we as a 

Board will have the power to assure that we get the -- not 

necessarily these precise amenities, but amenities of, you 

know, comparable quality.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.  Okay.  Thank you.  Tom, what 

are your thoughts?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  My thoughts are this:  I agree 

Ted, we should go for the combined site only.  And I 

understand that application process got caught up in a 

process, right?  So let's clean that up. 

          The details of the deal I have to leave up to the 

electeds.  I'm not horse trading this, but what was 

presented tonight seems appealing to me in diagram -- this 

program, and I believe that the addition of 500,000 square

feet of life science or tech in Kendall Square is a good 

thing, and can you hurry up and help us find a vaccine?  So 

-- and that's what's going on over there right now.   

          So it's not only us, but as Hugh referenced, it's 

to help the world, right?  So I think it's a good thing.  

They desperately need the space to both inspiration from 

Corinne's comments. 

          And to Steve's comments just now that we're not 

looking at a particular proposal, when the proposal comes 

back, I'm going to want to get into some discussion about 

what it's like to be in this public space, which is in 

effect a lobby, right -- for a building and what does that 

feel like -- and my son's classmates from Rindge and Latin, 

do they feel welcome to stroll into that public amenity, is 

it truly public, and how public is it?  

          And I look forward to that kind of discussion, but 

I also want to raise the expectation that that would be the 

bar that you would be held to here.   

          There will be an entrance to the tower to the 

workers and an entrance to the theater, and how do they 

relate to one another?  Ms. Hoffman's comments about light 

streaming out of the building are well-taken.  I also -- and

          I forget exactly who raised this good point, you 

know, activation I believe came out of the Staff memo -- 

actually activation of Third Street.  I'm not sure that this 

proposal, which gestures to what some might consider the 

rear of the site actually is oriented in the right way. 

          So maybe ken or my colleague from CBT can get into 

that when we potentially review the proposal as a whole. 

          So the -- just kind of I am in favor of supporting 

a recommendation to the City Council, but I think there's an 

awful lot of questions about how this things works in its 

proposed public face that will mean that contrary to what 

Steve and I hold as a discipline, we may need to get to the 

inside workings of the building, usually stop our comments 

at thresholds to the outside. So that's where I am on it, 

Madam Chair.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Lou?  Give us your 

updated thinking, based on -- tonight?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I think the proposal has a 

lot of merit.  I think the proportions, as you would say, 

are a little off.   

          I would also like the language in it cleaned up so 

we know what we're getting.  We're basically making repairs

to a PUD that failed because this was allowed and no one 

ever thought that they would build this build, the 85-foot, 

the 85,000-square-foot performance space.   

          So we would hate to make a mistake here a second 

time.  The -- I guess basically take all the ambiguity out 

of the language, and I think we're on our way.  Like I said, 

I think it's a very -- has a lot of promise, but we need to 

know what we're getting.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.  Okay.  So are you in favor, 

then of narrowing it down to the single option, or would you 

prefer something like Hugh's proposal, where we would make 

the space more proportional?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Well, I think it does need 

to be a little more proportional than it is.  Nothing says 

they couldn't put a smaller building on Third Street on the 

gas company and then build a larger building to the rear.  

Things need to be a little more clear in this proposal.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  We came here with two 

proposal that -- it only looks like we really need to deal 

with one, but I'm not sure.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you.  Okay.  So let's

see.  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  So I am opposed to 

this petition as it is.  I think the building that was 

presented is architecturally beautiful.   

          I like the organizational principles of the 

proposed arts center, and I agree that we need more art 

spaces in the city.  However, as several of my colleagues 

mentioned, today our job is not to look at the building.   

          So just considering the zoning petition, I feel my 

job is to look at overall is it better for the community to 

have an empty gravel lot, an 85,000-square-foot mixed-use 

development, or a 380,000-square-foot plus mixed-use 

development. 

          And honestly, for me the smaller development, or 

even the empty lot is my preference.  Construction is not 

painless, it creates traffic, it creates nuisance, it 

creates blocked streets, noise, et cetera.  We have 

neighbors who live around there and these projects are not 

without cost; they actually cause a lot of difficulty for 

people who live there.   

          I would feel differently about that cost on the 

community if this were housing, and this could be housing.

22

I would feel differently if it was 100 percent housing plus 

an arts center.   

          Part of the reason that artists and art spaces are 

so desperately needed in Cambridge is because of costs of 

the rental spaces, and those costs are influenced by 

development and gentrification that has pushed arts out. 

          So on balance, this zoning change doesn't benefit 

the community in my opinion.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right, thank you.  Niko?  Would 

you like to weigh in on this?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sure.  Though in general I really 

appreciate Corinne's questions and comments.  I'm definitely 

aligned with the perspective that she's raising.   

          As far as the proposal is concerned, I definitely 

like what I saw in the presentation.  I think it looks like, 

you know, a nice space to spend time.  But I definitely am 

concerned about the equity aspect of everything.   

          You know, I think it really bothers me that so 

much of this single parcel zoning, or the PUD that the city 

is engaged in involves these tradeoffs and then I see the 

tradeoff turning into a subsequent tradeoff.   

          It seems like that's a potentially never-ending

cycle of constantly compromising things that were promised 

to the city, even if, you know, from the perspective of 2020 

it may not be same thing that people wanted in 1999. 

          So all in all, I'm pretty ambivalent about it.  

So, like, would I like to see this as opposed to the current 

vacant lot?  Yeah.  Would I like to see housing there 

instead?  Yeah, definitely.  Am I confident that rejecting 

this will result in more housing there?  No.   

          And so, I guess is just -- I'm left feeling pretty 

ambivalent about the whole thing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you for your comments.  

Thanks to everyone.  So it seems to me that there is a good 

amount of support on the Board for the proposal as it's 

presented tonight. 

          But there were many concerns about the specifics 

of the zoning and the methods through which we ensure that 

the outcomes are what we are hoping -- we are all 

collectively hoping, based on what was presented tonight. 

          So as I look at the options for what we have to 

do, it seems as though, you know, we're generally in favor 

of moving forward, but I'm not sure that we're in favor of 

adopting the zoning.

21

22

          It seems to me as though we want to more generally 

give comments that are in favor of the project that raise 

our concerns with the zoning and explore different options 

like, you know, cleaning up to language, maybe only having 

the second option or looking at the proportionality -- 

exploring those things, and then also exploring all of the 

various issues that are raised by the CDD. 

          How are people -- well, Jeff, let me ask you, do 

you feel that that would be enough to send to the City 

Council, or would it make more sense or perhaps for CDD to 

work with the proponent on clearer language that we could 

then maybe send to the City Council as an alternative?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, I would maybe answer that 

question this way:  It sounds like based on the Board's 

comments, there is -- universally, it seems like there's a 

comment there's more work to be done on the zoning language 

and it's a lot of improvements to be made. 

          You know, it could be approached in a couple of 

ways.  It could be -- you know, the staff could -- you know, 

the Board could submit comments with the recommendation and 

staff could, you know, work on language amendments with -- 

you know, working with the city's Law Department and make

suggestions that could be submitted to the Council.   

          You know, we could also -- you know, give -- we 

can also continue to work with the Planning Board, if the 

Planning Board wanted to continue to sort of weigh in and 

discuss with both the petitioner and the staff, you know, 

what changes might be possible.   

          You know, certainly some changes would be a matter 

of improving the language -- you know, other changes such 

as, you know, making it only one kind of development option 

involving the GTS site versus two different options. 

          That would be something that I think the 

petitioner would need to kind of, you know, proactively 

indicate that that's something that they would -- you know, 

that that would still be, you know, supported as almost like 

a friendly amendment to their petition. 

          So I think really the key question is does the 

Planning Board want to see this again?  You know, does the 

Planning Board want to talk about it some more and think 

about these issues a little bit more, or would the Planning 

Board members be comfortable kind of wrapping your 

discussion up here and leaving the rest to Staff, you know, 

and then to work on if -- you know, and then the petitioners

and the City Council and Staff would continue these 

discussions in that setting?         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So I guess in my opinion, for 

me to be comfortable with this going forward, with both 

alternatives in there, I would want to see more info on 

option 1.   

anyway. 

          So going right back to Ted's first question of, 

you know, are there renderings for option 1, et cetera?  I 

think we would need to see that.  I would want to see that 

          I don't know how the other Board members feel.  It 

sounded like people wanted a lot of the cleanup to happen 

and, you know, the positives and the negatives to be 

highlighted, but I didn't get a strong sense from other 

Board members that they needed to see this again 

necessarily.   

          So is there anyone who -- let's do it this way, 

I'll just take a general yes/no:  Is there anybody on the 

Board who feels like, okay, if we just send a report that 

highlights our general support with a couple of exceptions, 

and it highlights all of that language, are we comfortable 

just sending that and then letting CDD work it out, or do

          So I guess the first question is, do you feel like 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis Bacci, I'd like to see 

you want to see this again? 

we need to see this again?   

it again.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Anybody else?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh.  I feel the quality of the 

Staff report is so high that I would rather turn it over to 

a working committee of a Law Department the proponent, 

Community Development and possibly after the Ordinance 

Committee hearing there might be involvement there to iron 

these things out. 

          I'm not quite sure, though, that that addresses 

some of the points that Corinne has brought up --   

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- and that Niko has supported.  

And I frankly don't know how to address that.  So that might 

be a reason not to turn it over yet.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.  Anyone else have thoughts 

either way?  So Jeff, the question from you, just with the 

refiling yesterday at City Council, were you able to get an 

answer to the question as to whether that was going to

require another hearing?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, I was hoping I wouldn't get 

pinned down on this one.  So I think there's a -- we're in a 

funny kind of position with this zoning petition, because we 

scheduled the hearing and then it was -- you know, it was 

refiled again just last night.   

          And whether or not -- whether or not this hearing 

and recommendation would sort of count as it were for -- you 

know, based on last night's referral is unclear to me.  I 

would need to seek an answer to that. 

          I think it could be -- yeah, I don't have a good 

answer to that question.  But, you know, the safest I would 

think just for my own sort of nonlegal opinion, the safest 

approach is -- you know, would be to have another hearing.  

          It could be -- I mean if the Board wanted to 

communicate a recommendation, they could still do that, and 

then we could schedule another hearing as a -- just kind of 

as an exercise in, you know, conducting the hearing, and the 

Board could decide if they wanted to make the same 

recommendation. 

          But I think it would be wise to at least make sure 

the procedural steps are fulfilled in the normal way, to

have a hearing based on the refile petition.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So if that is going to be the 

case anyway, then it's -- I guess one option would be to do 

what Hugh is suggesting, which is to have the working group 

of CDD, the Law Department and -- I forget who -- I'm sorry, 

Hugh, who was the third person?  CDD, Law, and the proponent 

-- sorry -- the proponent.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Proponent, and presumably the 

ordinance if the Chair is -- they usually get involved in 

those kinds of things.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  So what I'm thinking is rather 

than -- I mean maybe if we -- I'm just trying to think maybe 

there's a way that we don't -- we work with the group to 

draft something, or Jeff and team draft something based on 

what we've talked about tonight that could be the basis of a 

recommendation. 

          So again, so going through the pros and cons, 

getting the legal questions answered, and then either at a 

subsequent meeting we could just review that and decide 

whether we want to send it to the Ordinance Committee at 

this point or whether we want to just hold off until there 

is a subsequent hearing?  So I'd like to put on my legal hat

here --  

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- even though I'm one of the few 

Planning members who's not a lawyer. It seems to me if we 

have just held a hearing on a petition that has been 

withdrawn, then making an informal recommendation on it is 

premature.  But that doesn't mean we can't make progress, it 

just means --        

          MARY FLYNN:  Right, right.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- when it comes back to us, and it 

gets referred again to us, we'd be in better shape.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, that's kind of what I'm 

thinking, yeah, that some of the points that have been 

raised in the Community Development memo could be worked on 

with the Legal Department and the proponent, and see what 

progress we make there, and then, you know, we can use that, 

then as a basis for making a recommendation.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I would just note a couple of 

things; that the petition, as I understand it, hasn't been 

withdrawn, it was simply sort of refiled, because there was 

an issue with the timing of scheduling the Ordinance 

Committee hearing.  So that -- I just wanted to make sure 

125

22

that the record was clear on that. 

          But just as a second -- on that second note, it 

would not be unusual and we've certainly done it in the past 

in scenarios like this for the staff to work on kind of 

drafting a recommendation, which might include some language 

suggestions that we would work on with the Law Department 

and then bring -- and then send that back to the Planning 

Board, and so, the Planning Board could then kind of look at 

it as a -- you know, as a yes or no action to transmit that 

to the Council. 

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  I think that's what I'm 

looking for.  You summarized it much more succinctly and 

intelligently than I did.  Are other Board members in 

agreement with taking that course of action?          

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  This is Tom, I agree.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  This is Ted.  I mean, I think 

following Jeff's course of action, I would suggest we 

continue this hearing.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yep.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- to a later date and have -- 

if we're going to have another hearing that could be the 

same day, if we need to actually take up this particular

hearing again, or if it gets superseded.   

          But I think, you know, it would be terrific, 

because we've had a tremendous conversation about this, and 

I think at a subsequent meeting we could also address some 

of the issues that Corinne and Niko have raised --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- about from a planning 

perspective, are there other uses for this land?  You know, 

we obviously can make some comments about that.  I mean, 

we're not the owners of the land, and we can't -- you know, 

insist upon them using it in a certain way, but it may be 

from a -- we are the Planning Board; from a planning 

perspective maybe it makes more sense to have housing there, 

maybe it makes no sense to have housing there; maybe what we 

really need is more lab space.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Or an 85,000-square-foot 

baroque opera center.  I can't imagine that having a gravel 

pit there was the best use of the land.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  You know, if it became a park, 

that might be wonderful too, but what is feasible I think is 

127

something we can discuss.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.  I think too certainly that 

supporting the arts community in a way that they find useful 

to them is a wonderful thing to do.  And whether you could 

combine that with housing and make it work financially I 

don't know, but it does seem to be worth exploring.   

          So then, could I have a motion to continue this 

hearing with the understanding that there will be ongoing 

work by Department staff and the proponent and the Law 

Department on issues that have been discussed this evening 

as well as concerns that have been raised in the Community 

Development Department memo and that, you know, will be 

continued to a later date to be determined.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louis Bacci, so moved.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Is there a second?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom Sieniewicz, second.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Oh, yeah, roll call.  Lou 

Bacci? 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Lou Bacci?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Mary Flynn?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.      

      

          [All vote YES]       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So that concludes the 

discussion on this project for this evening.  My thanks to 

everyone who participated, both from the Development team as 

well as the community was -- it's a very exciting 

opportunity and one that we want to make sure that we get 

right for both -- well for really all of the parties 

concerned.  So thank you.

time is it?  9:15. So 9:30 let's reconvene, and we will 

address the Mass Ave project.  Okay?

    Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza  

MARY FLYNN:  All right, it's 9:30 so I'm just 

checking to see.  It looks like we've gotten enough members 

of the Planning Board present.  Okay.  So we can begin 

again.  Okay, so the second item on tonight's agenda is a 

Design Update on a previously granted special permit case PB 

241.   

It's a development at 1991-2013 Massachusetts 

Avenue.  CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us, and I believe that Erik Thorkildsen is going to 

do that for us.  Eric, are you --

ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.  

Let's see, where are my notes?  Here we go.  I can be very, 

very short.  Let's see.

          The special permit was granted in 2011, and it's 

currently in construction.  During continuing review by 

Staff, the permitee showed some changes to the landscape 

design, and the purpose of this update is for staff to get 

input from the Planning Board before determining whether or 

not these changes are in substantial conformance with the 

originally approved plans. 

          And I think with that, we can leave it to the 

permittee to explain the reasons for the changes, proposed 

changes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Thank you, Eric.  Okay, 

so representing the permittee is Sarah Forrester from St. 

James' Church.  If you would please introduce yourself and 

anyone else on your team who will be speaking, and explain 

the Design Update.  Thank you.       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Thank you very much.  Can you 

hear me?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Oh, good.  Okay.  So I am Sarah 

Forrester from St. James' Episcopal Church, 1991 Mass 

Avenue.  So thank you very much for your time and attention.  

And also, Phil Terzis from Acorn Development is on hand and

I say Phil, if you want to pitch in at any time feel free. 

          So I'm here to ask if it's possible for us to 

modify the layout of the trees in the children's playground, 

which is a portion of the plan?  So the site in question is 

St. James' and you can see that it's located on the corner 

of Mass Ave and Grove Street -- there's the church, it's 

sort of at an angle on the corner.   

          And this is a plan of what we used to have at the 

old parish hall and the old garden next to it, and then the 

carwash, and then the fire station on the other corner, and 

then along Grove Street and Orchard Street is residential. 

          And on the right side, you can see the site plan 

for the new construction -- the church there at the corner -

- and this is a project that St. James went into partnership 

with Oak Tree Development, and now Acorn is building it for 

us.  And I think you may all know that there was 10 years of 

legal issues, but finally we're -- you know, the end is in 

sight. 

          And what St. James will be gaining from this is on 

the ground level will be new parish hall facilities and a 

reconfigured garden in the middle, which is the largeish 

green space, yes, where the hand is going.

          And then if the hand can move up to the upper left 

corner, that strip down the side -- no, not -- yes, there -- 

that is the children's playground.  That’s the area in 

question.   

          So if you go to the next slide, please?   

          This is a planting plan that shows -- and drainage 

plan that shows where all the major trees and shrubs and 

things are going in, and you can see the strip that we're 

talking about, the children's playground again, the upper 

left corner.  There are two -- there's a large tree and then 

two not as large trees that are on abutters' property. 

          And then out of respect for their desire to be 

buffered, the design shows two groves of two lines of trees.  

And then in that same area, there is actually a drainage 

system; there's a catch basin and drainage lines, which are 

lined up exactly with the innermost row of trees. 

          So could we go to the next slide, please?   

          So this is a little sketch -- a little study that 

shows the limitations that are being put onto the use of our 

garden by the two lines of trees.   

          So if you were to measure six foot from the tree  

-- the innermost row of trees out and drew a line, and then 

133

11

12

13

14

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

if you were to measure from the face of the building, you 

would end up with -- if you were thinking that would be -- 

you know, a safety zone, we effectively end up with a three-

foot strip, which is very limiting in terms of installing 

any kind of play structure. 

          So if you could go to the next slide, please?  

Okay, so this is what I'm hoping we can do, which is to take 

the innermost row of trees and reconfigure them at the far 

end and sort of create a rectangular space that would have a 

very different feel to it from the other space in that it 

would be confined and quiet, and it would be more of a 

passive use area.  We could put benches and a sculpture or 

something in there. 

          And then the left-hand area would be for more 

active play, and where we could have a lot more flexibility 

to install play equipment. 

          And the reason why this is so important is because 

we -- I think you know it's been 10 years of maintaining who 

we are, but basically losing ground from a church that -- 

while it had very shabby facilities, we had many outreach 

programs that community benefitted from. 

          And when we lost our parish hall, we just couldn't 

134

maintain them.  And I'm just going to read off some of them 

to you, so that you can appreciate what we've lost, and then 

I will explain to you why it's so important that we be able 

to have a playground, because it will help bring us back to 

where we were. 

          So in addition to a Sunday school in our old 

parish hall, we also had a parent-run preschool program in 

the mornings and using the same classroom space as the 

Sunday schools.   

          And then in the afternoon we had a Hebrew after 

school program.  We ran a food pantry, we had a thrift shop, 

we had a counseling center, we housed on the rise women's 

daytime shelter, we had Alcoholics Anonymous.  We hosted a 

Harvard-run summer retreat for homeless people.   

          We provided meals out of our kitchen for -- a 

women's meal on Tuesdays, we had bread and jam on Sundays, 

and also, we were the base for an outdoor church, which 

provides communion and -- you know, a kind word to people on 

the street. 

          So now, we've lost all of that, and we're looking 

forward to moving back in, hopefully at the end of this 

year, and we will be using our facilities for our church

school, our Sunday school, but we also -- in order to make 

ends meet, we have to be able to rent out some of our space.  

And the most compatible space for us, and the one that's 

most mission appropriate, is a nursery school or a 

preschool. 

          So for us to be able to attract somebody like 

this, we have to be able to have some outdoor play space 

with play structures in it. 

          In addition, we have also -- we do have an 

agreement that some of the abutters be allowed access to our 

playground.  That was part of the agreement that we had.  In 

the past, there were neighbors that had enjoyed our previous 

playground, or the old one that we had, and they were 

insistent that that privilege also be made available to 

current neighbors.   

          So that is what we -- you know, are willing to do.  

But if we can't put a play structure in there, there's not 

much going on.   

          So I'm here to ask if it would be possible for you 

to give us this permission to reconfigure the trees.   

          In addition, I forgot to mention, there is a 

drainage line.  You can see on this drawing there's a pink

circle in the quiet space; that's a catch basin.  So -- and 

then running all the way along, there is a drainage line 

there.  So I -- you know, I think that's -- that poses a 

major issue -- practical issue as well.   

          Phil, do you have anything to say? 

          PHIL TERZIS:  I do, I just wanted to mention that 

along the property line, that dashed line at the top of the 

page, there is proposed to be an eight-foot-high cedar fence 

between the play yard and the neighbors, and that's always 

been part of the project.  And that would remain.   

          So the movement of trees around on our side of the 

eight-foot high fence might be less visible than it might 

appear on these drawings for the neighbors.  That's one 

point. 

          And the other point was that we have a settlement 

agreement with some of the abutters and others, which 

stipulated that the landscape of the garden be structured in 

a certain way and maintain the plan as approved by the 

Planning Board.   

          But the settlement agreement specifically excludes 

the play yard and the private gardens on the sort of north 

and east side of the site.

          So this area is not subject to our settlement 

agreement, just in case anyone was concerned about that.       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Thank you, Phil.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Well, thank you for that 

presentation.  So this is not a public hearing, but the 

Board can take comments at our discretion.  So I would like 

to see if there are any members of the public who are 

interested in commenting?  And then I can tell the Board how 

many.  Let's see.   

          So it looks like there are two folks -- at least 

two that are willing, are interested in commenting on.  So 

is the Board open to hearing that?  If anybody objects to 

say yes.  Otherwise, I'll go forward.     

          [Pause]  

          Okay.  Hearing no objections, let me just -- any 

members of the public who wish to speak should now click the 

button that says, "Raise hand."  If you're calling in by 

phone, you can raise your hand by pressing *9.  As of 5:00 

p.m. yesterday, the Board had received a written 

communication from [all names phonetic] Gavin and Janet 

Malenfant.  Written communications received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will be entered into the record.

          Okay.  I will now ask Staff to unmute the speakers 

one at a time.  Speakers should begin by saying your name 

and address, and staff will confirm that we can hear you.  

After that, you will have up to three minutes to speak 

before I ask you to wrap up. 

          So I will turn it over to Jeff.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The first speaker, I 

believe, is Heather Hoffman by telephone.  You can confirm 

that by unmuting yourself and giving your name and address.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  During the previous lengthy discussion of my 

neighborhood, there was a lengthy online discussion of this 

particular project among neighbors of this project.  And 

periodically I took a look, and I have been asked to read 

the remarks of one of the people who commented.   

          So you are not hearing my voice, you are hearing 

Young Kim's voice.  Young Kim lives on Forest Street, I 

don't know what number.  And I will just read you his e-

mail. 

          Sarah Forrester in her letter to the Planning 

Board stated, "Being able to relocate some trees will open 

up our usable play area so that we can install play

equipment.   

          Our ability to generate income from renting out 

some of our space is critical to the church's ability to 

make ends meet.  Renting to a school of some kind is very 

compatible with our mission, and having an appealing outdoor 

play area is an essential component to that.   

          In addition, a Passive Use area in the corner will 

be a valuable asset to our church community, and to other 

user groups that we may engage with in the future."  

          The following are Young Kim's comment on that. 

          "I have no objection to relocating the trees, so 

long as the same number of trees are maintained, and the 

abutters who fought so hard to make the plan fit better in 

their neighborhood agree to the change.   

          "However, what I object strenuously too is to St. 

James' sole purpose of the change seems to be for the 

church's own benefit, with no consideration for the 

betterment of the neighborhood.  After all, they took away 

the Knight's Garden.  They could at least have negotiated 

with the city so the public could use the play area.  Thank 

you."   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is

listed as Janet and Gavin Malenfant.  You can unmute 

yourself and give your name and address.   

          JANET MALENFANT:  Hello.  This is Janet Malenfant, 

and I'm joined by my husband, Gavin.  I life at 15 Blake 

Street, and we are direct abutters to the area in 

discussion.   

          This redesigned proposal goes pretty much directly 

against everything we were promised in public meetings and 

one on one discussions with Oak Tree and landscape designer 

Rick Dumont, and the permitted plans approved by the 

Planning Board. 

          The double row of Ginkgoes were offered to provide 

a visual and light buffering canopy from the Sunday school 

classroom, kitchen, four-story building and roof decks.  

They would also provide cooling shade; something that was 

lost when our two 40- to 50-foot maple trees had to be 

removed.   

          Several days ago, we received a letter from Sarah 

Forrester stating that she believes that this requested 

change will be a benefit to Gavin and I. This makes no 

sense.  To remove half of a green canopy and replace it with 

a large playground structure is not in our benefit.  It

creates a new density just 17 feet from our house with less 

buffer. 

          We ask the Planning Board to please consider our 

good faith position throughout this incredibly long process, 

and deny this proposal to relocate any of the Ginkgoes along 

our property line.  Keeping the trees will not preclude the 

church from having all of their many programs that they 

offer to the community.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Then the last speaker 

is Ruth Riles.  You can unmute yourself and give your name 

and address, please.     

          RUTH RILES:  This is Ruth Riles, and I think 

because I'm President of Porter Square Neighbors 

Association, but I'm actually speaking for myself in truth, 

I was about to say -- and I said in a communication I tried 

to get in one time but didn't make it -- that as long as the 

abutters were in agreement, I thought the rearrangement of 

the redesign was totally acceptable, because I didn't see 

that it made any real difference.   

          It didn't change the number of trees by and large, 

and it made the playground work from a traditional playscape 

kind of area.

          And I guess I could say to Janet and Gavin that 

maybe the sound of children playing there is a plus not a 

minus.  I don't know how to counter in any way, shape or 

form they are the direct abutters. 

          And if they feel aggrieved by not having that 

extra layer of trees, and they feel like that was an 

agreement that was made with them, I don't know what to say 

about that.   

          I just know that this has been a long and 

difficult process for everybody - the neighborhood, the 

church, and there are a lot of people in the neighborhood 

who have a lot of ill feeling about the church and they're 

unlikely to give them an inch.   

          I think some of the rest of us would like to see 

this program proceed, get built, that the church thrive, 

that the preschool thrives, that the different missions the 

church performed come back. 

          I'm not saying that any of the neighbors should be 

in any way aggrieved by any of that, but we'd just like to 

see a happy ending to this. 

          So I'm hoping it can be negotiated.  I'm hoping it 

can be ironed out tonight, so that the playground can work

for the church and not be an affront to the Malefants or any 

of the other abutters.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and another hand has 

been raised -- Michael Brandon.  You can give your name and 

address.  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Now you can unmute 

yourself and give your name and address.  Michael Brandon?     

          MICHAEL BRANDON:  Thank you, Jeff.  I'm Michael 

Brandon, 27 Seven Pines Avenue.  I'm part of the North 

Cambridge Stabilization Committee, and our group has been 

monitoring this project for at least a decade.   

          The special permit was in 2011, and then -- 

probably a couple of years before that.  It's been very 

controversial.  There have been three lawsuits that were 

ultimately resolved and settled.                   

          As Phil Terzis mentioned, there was a settlement 

agreement that I think maybe the question would be is 

whether the Association of Cambridge Neighborhoods, which 

signed onto the agreement as an enforcer, has seen these 

plans and agrees that what's being proposed here conforms 

with their landscaping agreement.   

          And I was going to raise concerns about the nature 

of the graphics that are before you, and maybe having

printed versions that are clearer.   

          But it looked to me like the aerial photographs 

were way out of date; there are no ground photographs 

showing this area that is going to be landscaped in its 

current condition -- I think that would be helpful if the 

Board is going to entertain this. 

          However, also Sarah, who presented, made several 

references I thought to Grove Street.  And I don't know -- 

there's Orchard Street is nearby, Beach Street and Blake 

Street and Mass Ave I think, the Quadrant, is close to the 

property.  So maybe that could be clarified.   

          But having heard what I've heard, also for the 

newer members of the Board, who may not be familiar with the 

history of this, one major concern that the neighborhood had 

and led to much of the litigation was that the project 

destroyed what was known as the John Nolan's Knight's 

Garden.  And it was completely destroyed by this project, 

even though it was on the National Historic Registry, so was 

locally landmarked by the City Council. 

          So there's a lot of old hard feelings as a result 

of that.  So landscaping issues are very sensitive to the 

folks who have been involved in this all along.

          And John Nolan, as you may know, was a preeminent 

landscape architect in the earlier part of the previous 

century, and he was a colleague and a protégé of the 

Olmstead Brothers.  He was also the first Chairman of the 

Cambridge Planning Board and pretty much created the 

Cambridge Planning Board. 

          So he had actually done a planting sketch of this 

species for this church garden that's no longer there, and I 

believe the church has agreed to include some mention of him 

in historical placards when the project is completed.  So at 

least, you know, that will be a nod to him.  But he was 

really an impressive and important person, and how the 

Historical Commission allowed the destruction of that -- 

especially with all the ecological benefits and the trees 

that were removed -- hard to believe. 

          I see my time has expired, but --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Can you just wrap up, Mr. Brandon?     

          MICHAEL BRANDON:  Yes, I am.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          MICHAEL BRANDON:  Just given the objections of the 

abutters -- and maybe you can find out, were the other 

residential abutters on Blake Street notified about this?

But given that, I would hope that you would just say no, 

this will be a substantial change, and just deny the 

request. 

          Thank you very much, sorry for going over. And 

thank you for your comment.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, thank you.  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all the hands that were 

raised.  I'll just give one second in case anybody else 

wanted to speak and hasn't pushed the, "Raise Hand" button 

or pushed *9 on your phone. 

          I think that is everyone, so I'll turn it back 

over to you, the Chair.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  So we 

are now concluding the public comment portion of this 

meeting, and we're moving on to Board discussion.  So let's 

start first with any questions that Planning Board members 

have.  So if you can raise your hand on the screen if you 

have some?   

          Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  So I don't 

understand based on the two pictures we saw if there is tree 

loss or not?  So I have that question.  And then I would 

147

also like to know if there is not tree loss, if the caliper 

of the trees are the same.   

          So just thinking about -- you know, the tree 

canopy and how important that is, and wishing to really 

understand the impact of that on this.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Ms. Forrester, 

could you respond to that, please?       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Yes, I can.  We are replacing -- 

and in fact we're exceeding the tree caliper loss.  So 

there's been a gain in the number of trees.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Caliper.       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  And can I just say something 

about the double row of trees?  I mean, it's a lot of trees.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, you made that point earlier.  

So let's -- I really want to hear questions from the 

Planning Board at this point.  Let's see, Ted I think you 

had your hand up, yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  Well, one question that 

is related, but not maybe direct and maybe it's for Eric:  I 

see on the plans that it's proposed to move the magnolia 

trees that are on the front of the church on the corner of

Mass Ave and Blake -- and Beach, I'm sorry, which are about 

the only foliage on an enormous stretch of Mass Avenue.   

          And so, the question is why is there a proposal to 

move them?  As far as I can tell, they're mature magnolia 

trees that are quite beautiful all the time, but especially 

in the spring when they are being in bloom. 

          And then the second question is, you know, exactly 

what was your agreement with the abutters, and, you know, 

had you discussed these plans with them at all or not?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Ms. Forrester?       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  The architects and landscape 

architects, when they came up with the current planting 

plan, had the removal of the magnolias.  The idea of 

relocating them apparently came and went throughout the 

process, so I'm not quite sure where in the agreement that 

actually landed. 

          But I sort of like the idea -- I included in the 

design that I did those magnolias, because I was actually 

one of the people that was involved about 20 years ago in 

choosing them, and getting them planted. 

          I've since had discussions about the practicality 

of digging up those large trees.  It's going to be very 

149

difficult, because they are up close to the edge of the 

building, so they'd have to be manually dug, and, you know, 

moving a large tree like that without being able to be sure 

that you get a really good root ball is very chancy.   

          So sometimes the best bet is to just plant new 

trees, which is probably what we would do if we couldn't 

relocate these.  We'd plant new magnolias in our playground 

          Was that -- did I?  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, and then there was the question 

of whether you've had discussions with the abutters on the -

space.   

-      

          SARAH FORRESTER:  No, I didn't because I thought 

I'd go to you first to see what you had to say.  I was sort 

of hesitant to bring this up, because I didn't want to open 

up a can of worms, which it's been opened up again.   

          It's been such a -- you know, a sort of upsetting 

thing for everybody involved, and I -- you know, with 

everything else going on, I just -- you know, I didn't want 

to bring extra worry to people unnecessarily if I didn't 

have to. 

          I did get in touch with the Malefants and the --

their name escapes me, the other -- I did contact them and 

send them letters, because I was under the impression that -

- well, I just sort of thought that people wouldn't have a 

problem with this, they would like the idea.  So I haven't 

gone to everybody.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you for that.  Do any of 

the Board members have questions?  No, not at this point, 

okay.  I just have one, which is as you come up, as we look 

at the left side of this plan, which is the area where 

you're planning on having the place done --      

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- and the little garden up at the 

top, what happens when you go to the immediate right there?  

What's happening with the rest of it?       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  There's a fence.  There's a 

fence that runs from the edge of the -- the corner of the 

building straight back up.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And what is --      

          SARAH FORRESTER:  So it's a long, thin -- and 

there's a gate in there, so there's access for -- I suppose 

emergency access through from the back gardens out through 

our playground, and then out to the street.

          SARAH FORRESTER:  It won't be a major thoroughfare 

or anything.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And so, then as you go towards 

the right, what is the dimension of that space, and is there 

any area there where you could put play equipment?       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  No, no.  That's not us.  I think 

-- I'm not sure if I understand, but the space in the back 

of the building belongs to the condominium owners.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay, thank you.       

          SARAH FORRESTER:  So we've just got that long 

strip.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I see.  Okay.  Thank you for 

clarifying that, I appreciate it.  Okay.  Board members, do 

you have comments?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'll -- Madam Chair, it's a 

difficult situation we find ourselves in looking at this, 

and I know my heart goes out to both sides.  And so, I'm 

looking for the wisdom of Solomon here; how do we solve this 

and try to keep everybody happy. 

          And my only way of thinking this through was 

around the one thing that might be movable, which is the 

152

size and dimension of play equipment, right?   

          I'm not an expert in play equipment, except that I 

have three children who are now grown, who I guess were 

never happier than when they were just digging holes in the 

ground.  But they're peculiar and wonderful children. 

          So is there some way in which you could find play 

equipment that wouldn't require the larger area, that could 

work with underneath the canopy of the Ginkgoes, leave the 

Ginkgoes as promised, and has been relied on, you know, 

according to of course audits in the file by our good 

neighbors in terms of looking forward to the canopy and 

shape of it, and simply be -- search a little harder for 

play equipment that might fit within the space that you've 

got, as planned? 

          And that's I guess the only way I can see how to 

solve this.  There has apparently been promises made, and 

some neighbors that are now, you know, pretty directly 

irritated by the change.         

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Well, I, --      

          MARY FLYNN:  My --      

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Oh, sorry.

any other Board comments?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay, I live down the block 

from -- a couple blocks away, and I walk by this all the 

time.   

          And I've been a big proponent of this development 

from day one, and I understand the church and its needs and 

developer, but I think -- you know, it appears that there 

were promises made with the abutters, and that they have not 

been party to this discussion yet.   

          And I think that really is necessary that they be 

brought into the conversation and see if there is some 

compromise or some means of both sides getting what they 

want, or what they need. 

          I also, you know, would really suggest -- strongly 

suggest -- that the magnolias that are on Mass Ave and are 

quite beautiful not be moved; that there's no -- that, you 

know, the proponent has not given any rationale for why they 

would be moved, and that if new magnolias are needed in this 

other area, that they could be purchased and planted, and 

leaving the mature trees where they are.

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you Ted.  Anyone else on 

the Board?  Hugh, do you have any thoughts?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I do.  So as a point of background, 

I live -- my house is 30 feet away from an elementary 

school.  It's on -- I'm on the north side of the school, 

just as Blake Street is on the north side. 

          And I've lived there for 50 years, and there have 

been times when kids were permitted to be in the land behind 

the school.  And kids are pretty noisy.  And that four-story 

wall reflects the sound -- it almost seems like it magnifies 

it. 

          So it's a different situation.  Now, I've been 

searching my memory.  I don't find any recollection of this 

part of the site being a playground.  I think that's a brand 

new concept here.   

          And I think the plan itself is the promise -- that 

the promise is there will be a quiet, passive area behind 

these abutters' houses.  And now you're going to turn it 

into basically a commercial use -- a commercial day care 

center that's going to have kids out there every hour doing 

what kids do.   

          So it's not the same at all.  I would think we 

155

should just say no, but if you can work out a deal with the 

abutters -- I can't imagine there is a deal, you're totally 

changing the -- you're invading their space and their 

private enjoyment of their space with a completely different 

commercial use.  But if you can do that, that's okay. 

          The other thing is, apparently two of the trees 

that show on your planting and drainage plan, the light 

colored ones, don't exist anymore.   

          And it seems to me that if you're coming up with a 

new planting plan, you should take account of the fact that 

those trees aren't there anymore.  Really the old planting 

plan was built around the fact that those trees were in 

          I think you certainly shouldn't approve this as a 

change that's consistent with the approved, because it just 

place.   

isn't.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Lou, do you have 

any comments?  This was before our time on the Planning 

Board, so the others have much more background.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, more just reinforcing 

the others.  I agree the plan was in place.  I think they 

should stick by it.  I like Tom's idea of trying to fit some

equipment into that area if possible, and Ted's idea of 

leaving the magnolias alone, and if you need to, other 

magnolias purchase them and plant them.   

          It doesn't seem like there's a legitimate reason 

to take down the existing magnolias, and you have a plan 

that made the promise, so I think you have to stick by it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And then Corinne, did you want 

to add anything?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  I don't have 

anything to add.       

          MARY FLYNN:  So I would say I'm in agreement with 

my fellow Board members.  I think, you know, this was a -- 

from what I know, it was a very long and difficult process, 

and I know that -- you know, many people have struggled for 

many years to have this project come out in a way that is 

beneficial to the church, but also good for the neighbors, 

or livable for the neighbors. 

          And I think the planting plan, you know, it was a 

promise and there is an expectation that they are going to 

have some privacy and -- you know, I mean I don't live next 

to a school, as Hugh does, but I lived not too far from one, 

and the playgrounds can be pretty noisy.  So, I mean, I

realize they're small children, but sometimes they're 

noisier than the bigger kids. 

          So I don't have a problem with you try to work 

something out with the abutters, and if you can agree with a 

plan and you run that by Eric and see if that seems to meet 

the intent of what was promised -- if you can do that, you 

know, I'm supportive of that.  But otherwise, I think we 

have to stick with the plan as is. 

          So Jeff, do we need a motion on this, or do we 

just --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I mean I would just suggest --      

          MARY FLYNN:  -- take those comments?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- sorry, you got slow for a 

second.  I would just suggest a motion to include the Design 

Update with -- and you could include a comment that the 

plans as shown appear not to be in substantial conformance 

with the original plans, and that if any alternate plan is 

suggested, that it would -- it would need to be discussed 

with the abutters.   

          I think that -- I mean, it sounded like the 

comments.  And Planning Board members can add their own 

comments to that as well, but the motion would just be to 

158

kind of include the Design Update.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, okay.  So as Jeff said, would 

someone make a motion to include the Design Update, with the 

understanding that the Board is in agreement that the plan 

as originally presented should remain intact, unless there 

is further discussion with the abutters, and a plan that can 

be worked out with them.  And if so, then that could be 

brought back and entertained by Community Development staff.  

          Can I have a motion?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So move, Louis Bacci.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, is there a second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Ted Cohen, second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, roll call.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Lou Bacci? 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.

to the petitioner.  And I would encourage you to reach out

works for everybody.  Thank you.

Thorndike Street.  CDD staff will summarize why this is 

before us, and I believe Liza Paden is going to do that for 

us.   

courthouse.   

          LIZA PADEN:  Hello, this is Liza Paden from the 

Community Development Department, and we are in the process 

of reviewing the building permit application for the 

          And if you remember back in the beginning of the 

year there was a change to the parking lease and things like 

that, and then we were shut down for a while.   

          But we are back to reviewing the building permit, 

and expect to have it done soon.  They've been making great 

progress, and it's a lot of moving parts that we're dealing 

with, so.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And the -- I'm sorry, I don't 

have the letter in front of me, but --      

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Yep.       

          MARY FLYNN: I believe the request was for a year 

          SARAH FORRESTER:  Yes, they'd like to extend the 

deadline from September 28 of this year to September 28 of 

extension?       

2021.       

161

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So Mr. Rafferty, James 

Rafferty is representing the permittee and he is present.  

Do any of the Board members have questions about the 

extension?  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  The only question I have for 

Mr. Rafferty or for staff is under the terms of the 

Governor's emergency orders, didn't that extend the time for 

all existing permits and deadlines?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I believe there's an argument 

that could be made that that is indeed the case, but in an 

abundance of caution, we decided to request the extension, 

lest there ever be any determination that that particular 

order didn't cover this type of situation, which is slightly 

different than some of the scenarios outlined in the 

deadline.   

          So we know it's going to take a little time this 

evening to act on this, but candidly we felt the safer, more 

prudent course here was to request the extension, and if it 

was ever determined it was unnecessary, we would have only 

taken a few minutes of the Board's time.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thank you.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have a question.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Hugh.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I just would like the proponent 

to confirm that they have been working diligently over the 

last two years to put this extraordinarily complicated 

projects together and to get it to construction.  I think 

that's kind of the standard.  If they just don't do 

anything, then they lose their rights.  But if they proceed 

diligently to try to exercise them, I think that's the time 

you give an extension.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I agree completely.  The letter 

that we submitted contains a brief description of our 

diligent efforts.  I can assure you that they continue.  

There are two other people on this call, Rob Dickie and June 

Winn (phonetic) who have been working for years on this 

matter.   

          We were chuckling in the prior case as to who's 

been at it longer, the Episcopalians or the Leggat McCall 

team, and we think it's a tie. 

          But we are on the final stretch.  You may have 

noticed we got a BZA variance last week to allow for 

modifications to vertical clearances in the garage, because 

163

the garage is the former basement of the courthouse, and we 

had a couple issues with that. 

We are hopefully getting close to our final design 

approval, locations for our BMU and other such matters are 

being resolved. 

Ms. Paden has been exceptionally helpful with us 

as we go through all the conditions in the special permit.  

So we're hoping to have a building permit very soon, and 

then work will commence.

MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Any other questions 

from the Board?  No, okay.  So seeing none, is there a 

motion to grant the requested extension?

HUGH RUSSELL:  So move.

MARY FLYNN:  That was Hugh.  Is there a second?   

LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second.

MARY FLYNN:  Lou Bacci, second.  Roll call, 

please?   

JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Lou Bacci? 

LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?     

H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen is absent.

appreciate it.  Okay.  So that includes the business on the 

agenda.  Are there additional comments from staff?   

JEFF ROBERTS:  I don't have any at this time.

MARY FLYNN:  Anything else from the Planning Board 

before we adjourn?  Okay.  Hearing nothing, and given the 

late hour, I will say that the meeting is adjourned.  Thank 

you all very much for your time and patience.  The time is
