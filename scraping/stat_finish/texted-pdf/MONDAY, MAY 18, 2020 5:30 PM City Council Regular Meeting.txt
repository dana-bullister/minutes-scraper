To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $150,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund 
Human Service Programs Other Ordinary Maintenance account to support the continued 
operation of Food for Free services during the COVID-19 crisis. 
 
Funds will be used to support the operations of Food for Free for 15 weeks, beginning March 16, 
2020 and through June 30, 2020. This includes supporting Food for Free’s efforts to secure 
additional truck rental and cover additional staffing costs that were needed to effectively manage 
the large volunteer workforce that supports the home deliveries which began in March. As a 
result of these efforts, home deliveries grew to over 2,000 weekly deliveries to Cambridge 
residents.  
 
Food for Free is currently working with CEOC and the City to transition those households that 
have the ability to utilize the food pantries back to those pantries. They will be transitioning the 
remaining households to a more permanent home delivery system.   
 
This appropriation will cover a portion of Food For Free’s costs.   Food for Free has been 
effectively fundraising to cover the remaining costs.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I would like to request the appropriation of $1 million from the Community Benefits 
Stabilization Fund to the Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance for the 
purpose of entering into grant agreements or contracts with nonprofit organizations in order for 
them to provide services to our most vulnerable residents during the COVID-19 emergency and 
recovery. 
 
Pursuant to Chapter 2.127 of the Cambridge Municipal Code, the Community Benefits Advisory 
Committee (CBAC) is charged with soliciting and evaluating applications for the use of 
community benefits funds (Community Benefits Funds) from community-based organizations 
based on priorities established by the City Council. The City Council voted on a broad set of 
priorities when it adopted the 2017 Community Needs Assessment, which can be viewed at 
<https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/News/2-17/communityneedsassessmentreport>. The 
Needs Assessment is very comprehensive and continues to provide important, broad guidance 
which will be looked to by the CBAC in determining how Community Benefits Funds can best 
be used during the COVID-19 emergency and recovery.  
 
Our nonprofit community provides basic needs and other critical supports for low-income, 
under-resourced, and vulnerable families and individuals at risk. While there has been financial 
relief for nonprofits through government loan programs, City grant agreements, private 
foundations and individuals, additional resources are required to address the critical needs of our 
community through nonprofit organizations, which serve these communities and have deep 
relationships with many of the people most in need. The Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition (CNC) 
has surveyed the non-profit community and has heard from 57 community based non-profit 
organizations in Cambridge that Cambridge nonprofits are under increased financial stress as the 
pandemic continues. The use of Community Benefits Funds through grant agreements or 
contracts with nonprofit organizations will provide additional COVID-19 related assistance and 

 

Packet Pg. 36

critical supports to both the nonprofit organizations and to our most vulnerable families and 
individuals at risk that they serve.  
 
If this appropriation is approved, the City will convene a meeting of the CBAC, which will  then 
make recommendations to the City Manager for the allocation of Community Benefits Funds for 
the Award of Grant agreements or contracts with nonprofits to further assist vulnerable residents 
who have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
The City Council should be proud of the assistance the City has been able to provide to its 
residents and small businesses in need through the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund, the Cambridge 
Redevelopment Authority, federal Community Development Block Grant and CARES funding, 
and our Community Benefits Fund.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Section 12.22.010 
 
This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.  
 
Section 12.22.020 
 
This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the 
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected 
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City. 
 
Section 12.22.030 
 
A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or 
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle 
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in 
both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.” 
 
D. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that 
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City. 
 
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of 
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction 
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion, 
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine 
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a 
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific 
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist 
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or 
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible

Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along:

(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the

Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments;

Good evening,

Luis Mejias <lmejias@gmail.com>
Thursday, May 14, 2020 9:45 PM
City Manager
City Council; Clerk
Closing streets 

It’s incredibly frustrating that there has been little to no action on the part of the City to close streets or reduce vehicle 
lanes to widen sidewalks so that we can safely walk down the street while maintaining proper distances from others.  
We also need to implement (enforced) bus lanes and give more space to restaurants and retail.

Countless cities around the world are moving aggressively to prepare their cities for reopening, yet Cambridge seems 
stuck in some sort of time warp, having done nothing since the Council recommended the Manager act on this.

I’ve been on many walks where I have to venture into traffic lanes to avoid oncoming pedestrians. I’m passed by runners 
who cannot stay 6’ away without putting themselves and me in danger. How is this putting our health first and 
foremost?

We also should be immediately striping bus lanes to allow MBTA buses to move through as efficiently as possible so that 
they can operate more frequently. This is imperative to promote less crowding on our bus routes. We also need more 
sidewalk space at bus stops so people waiting have space to spread out.

As restaurants and retail shops prepare to open, they will be required to limit occupancy. How is a small shop or 
restaurant supposed to survive if they can only have a 20-40% of the tables full at any one time? They need room to 
expand seating outdoors, and our sidewalks are woefully inadequate to support them.

Now is the time for Cambridge to reduce travel lanes and prepare our business districts by limiting on street parking and 
traffic so that more space can be given to people. If we don’t do it now, it will be too late when the gridlock returns.

I urge the City Manager to consider closing Mass Ave through Central Sq, Harvard Sq, Porter Sq, and Cambridge Street 
from Inman Sq into E Cambridge, to all vehicles except buses and emergency vehicles —  Cars will find their way around, 
but we shouldn’t be going out of our way to convenience those who want to get through our city as quickly as possible.  
Give the street space to restaurants, bars and stores so our local businesses can reopen successfully. 

Further, consider closing a network of local streets so people have more space to walk, run and bike without fear of 
speeding cars. Let our kids have free reign this summer.

Finally - close Memorial Drive for good. Connect our city with its waterfront for its entire length from Arlington to 
Kendall and Lechmere. If someone wants to drive 50 mph, let them use limited access Storrow.  The paths on Memorial 
Drive are WAY too narrow to support the number of people who use it. Why force them onto sidewalks that at times are 
no more than 4-5’ wide? Why are we prioritizing cars zooming through? We could have a world-class riverfront linear 
park and a bike highway, so that when people return to their offices in Kendall Square, maybe more will bike instead of 
drive their cars as fast as possible from Belmont and Arlington through our city.  There’s no reason we need a 4-lane 
highway on our waterfront.

I urge you to act now. Waiting until June or July will be too late.

Opposition to Memorial Drive Closure

Dear State and Municipal Officials,

 There has been much chatter and now a formal petition in support of closure of the entire Memorial Drive, 
purportedly to make the pandemic more tolerable by affording open space for cyclists, skate boarders, runners, 
and pedestrians etc. Ironically, though I am fourth generation East Cambridge, this is the first time I learned 
that there is a municipal golf course for use by the residents. Also, recently I learned that the golf course is now 
open for pedestrians and other activities. Cambridge has some surprising open spaces that can be easily 
accessed but somehow have been overlooked during the pandemic. Some promoters of closure are residents of 
North Point but remarkably they are silent about that wide open space, beautifully landscaped along the river, 
with easy access right into Boston. We also have Lechmere Canal, just a stroll from Boston's Esplanade with 
ample open space right there. To be sure, our own Water Department is surrounded by some of the loveliest 
open space in the city. Of course, Fresh Pond is certainly an impressive open space as well. 

  The impact of closure of Memorial Drive on East Cambridge would be substantial and dangerous. We have 

most of the designated truck routes that are approved for hazardous material as provided in the City's website:

• Main Street, Galileo Galilei Way, Binney Street, First Street, & Land Boulevard
•
JFK Street between Harvard Square and North Harvard Street in Brighton
• Broadway east of Galileo Galilei Way & Vassar Street north of Rt. 2A (Mass. Ave.) 

To help 
protect your 
privacy, 
Microsoft 
Office 
prevented 
automatic  
download of 
this picture 
from the 

In ternet.https://www.cambridgema.gov/traffic/sustainabletransportation/Trucks/truckrestrictedstreetslist.aspx  

In the event of an accident emergency vehicles would be closed off in and out of Boston.

  To be sure, our Kendall Square has the highest density Level 3 Lab space in the country if not the world. In 
the event of any accident, Memorial Drive would be the most direct access route for emergency vehicles to and 
from the Boston hospitals.

  On a personal note, I use the Boston hospitals and have done so all my life. Many residents use the Boston 
hospitals since access to Boston has always been much easier and quicker than any trip on any day to Mt. 
Auburn. The Boston hospitals are unparalleled and people should not be closed off from their choice of 
medical treatment because of the agenda of a few taking advantage of these catastrophic times. I realize the 
ultimate decision may rest with DCR, so I respectfully remind Commissioner Jim Montgomery that DCR has 
ordered and approved closure of vehicle lanes on O'Brien Highway, the only other possible route to the Boston 
hospitals. First, DCR removed vehicle lanes so that bike lanes could be added on both sides of the 
highway. Now, DCR has ordered further closure of lanes to provide dedicated bus lanes on both sides of the 
highway. To be sure, that roadway will be a nightmare as now planned and could never serve as the alternate 
route for access to the Boston hospitals for patients or emergency vehicles.

Tanveer Karim <tanveerakarim@gmail.com>
Monday, May 18, 2020 10:54 AM
City Council
Clerk
Regarding POR 2020 # 113

Dear Cambridge City Council, 
 
I am a resident of Cambridge and in this most recent council election, municipal broadband was a key issue for me to 
decide whom to vote for. I am glad to see that Councillors Nolan, Simmons, Zondervan and Vice Mayor Mallon have 
sponsored the Policy Order 2020 # 113, which asks the City Manager to provide an update on the next meeting. I want 
to say a few things on this matter: 
 
1. I want to thank councillors who have sponsored this policy and I hope that other councillors will also strongly consider 
sponsoring this policy today (May 18th, 2020) during the meeting. 
 
2. With COVID‐19 affecting businesses, schools and everyone's lives and forcing us to do our jobs from home, it has 
become even more crucial to provide feasible and affordable internet that all of us can afford to pay for, rather than be 
stuck with Xfinity monopoly, which is costing us a non‐negligible amount of money. This is especially true for households 
that are larger and have no option but to purchase a higher tier plan. While it is true that Xfinity is offering 2 months of 
"free" internet via Internet Essentials, the speed is only 25 Mbps and even by Xfinity's own commercial website's claims, 
that kind of speed is not adequate enough beyond basic emailing. This situation has made it even more clear that 
Internet should be seen as basic utility such as electricity to survive in 21st century and be competitive and relevant. A 
failure to provide adequate internet, especially in these times, only contributes to the systemic inequality that has been 
persisting for so long. In light of this, I also urge you to provide temporary internet assistance relief to residents of 
Cambridge until the city if back to full operational mode. 
 
3. The current budget proposed by the City Manager does not include any mention of providing affordable internet or 
municipal broadband. His inaction over the years towards having a transparent study on this matter shows that it is not 
something he is interested in considering. I urge all of you to hold him accountable and strongly consider making this a 
key issue for the next City Manager hiring process so that this process does not further get stalled.  
 
Thank you for reading this rather long email but I hope that you resonate with the sentiments and observations that I 
have shared here and take appropriate actions necessary so that those who are already hemorrhaging money due to the 
Xfinity monopoly do not have their situation further exacerbated by the inaction of the City government.  
 
Tanveer Karim, 
5 Cutler Ave, 
Cambridge MA 02138

Support for PO #7: Request for a comprehensive, equitable plan for reopening the city 

Dear Mayor, Councillors, and Manager,

I am writing in support of PO #7: Request for a comprehensive, equitable plan for reopening the city.

I hope that Cambridge will quickly issue a written plan that indicates where it will follow and where it will  differ from 
the state plan. I especially would like our plan to reflect or city’s greater density and our demographics, which include 
more low income people and people of color, who have been more deeply impacted by the pandemic.

I would also find it helpful if the manager provided a brief written report each week to the council on pandemic 
response, so that the public could ask questions or comment on the report during public comment time.  As it stands, 
any public comment is delayed by a week, which makes it less timely and relevant.

Sincerely,
Lee Farris

Support for PO #9: Proposed amendments to Chapter 2.108, which governs emergency 
preparedness

Dear Mayor, Councilors, and Manager,

I am writing in support of PO #9: Proposed amendments to Chapter 2.108, which governs emergency preparedness.

I would like our city to be better prepared for future health emergencies.  I think it makes sense to amend the city's 
Ordinance to address shelter and housing, testing, and data reporting during a pandemic.

I expect that significant discussion of these amendments may be needed, so I think it is good to begin that discussion 
now.

Sincerely,
Lee Farris

Upgrade Cambridge

Is there a reason this is taking so long?  Am I missing something that the Upgrade Cambridge group is not telling me?

What concerns me is not so much my cable bill but the internet equity issue.  I have a niece who teaches 4th graders in 
Las Vegas and her note as the lockdown started out there was bittersweet.  She was actually enjoying the challenge of 
teaching online and it seems that her kids were enjoying it too.  (She is a very good teacher.)  However, only 23 of her 27 
kids had internet at home.  She was heartbroken for the 4 who, by now, have missed nearly a half-year of school.  We 
don’t have to let this happen in Cambridge.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the Arts community, with the 
Massachusetts Cultural Council reporting that more than $264 million in revenue has 
been lost and 15,000 jobs have been affected; and 
 
As the Arts are a crucial driving force in our economy, ensuring our Arts community is 
well-supported and able to reemerge in a meaningful way in the coming months will 
help our local economy recover from the effects of COVID-19; and 
 
The Arts also play a unique and invaluable role in Cambridge, bringing our community 
together, enriching the lives of our residents, and helping us cope and relieve stress 
during difficult times, especially during the past several weeks of isolation; and 
 
For these reasons, it is imperative that the City actively works to uplift the Arts 
community; and 
 
A Small Business Advisory Committee was recently created to develop reopening 
recommendations, offer guidance to small businesses on relief programs available, and 
play a key role in fostering communication between small businesses and City staff; 
and 
 
Our local Arts community could greatly benefit from having a similar, dedicated 
advisory group focused on their specific needs of financial stabilization and security, 
and a gradual reopening of Arts facilities; and 
 
As Governor Baker recently released a phased reopening plan for the Massachusetts 
economy, now is the time to create such a group to ensure our Arts community is 
prepared for reopening; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to appoint and convene an Arts 
Recovery Advisory Committee, to include representation from the Cambridge Arts 
Council, the Economic Development Division of the Community Development 
Department, local arts organizations, local individual artists from different artistic 
disciplines, and other relevant parties, to provide insight on how the City can best 
support the Arts in the coming months; and be it further

ORDERED:

WHEREAS: 

Internet access is indispensable in the 21st century, and while Cambridge is seen as a 
technology and innovation hub, the City suffers from a lack of internet provider 
competition, and has unusually low speeds and service and a persistent digital divide; 
and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

WHEREAS: 

The COVID-19 Pandemic has forced all city buildings to close, including the library, 
senior center, and youth centers, taking away computer and internet access from those 
who lack it in their own homes; and 

WHEREAS:  With between 40 and 50% of low-income residents lacking broadband access, what 
was already a significant disparity has now been amplified; and 

WHEREAS: 

The Council has passed four orders requesting the City Manager allocate funds for a 
comprehensive feasibility study of municipal broadband, including voting on 
February 24, 2020 requesting the City Manager produce a request for proposal by 
April 1, 2020, for a municipal broadband feasibility study, and 

WHEREAS: 

The City has worked with the school department to provide temporary internet access 
to all students, in light of instruction being online; now therefore be it 

WHEREAS: 

On November 5, 2018 the City Manager put forward an appropriation of $150,000 
from Free Cash to support a 12-month digital equity research initiative and 
announced the creation of a new Digital Equity Advisory Board, but no formal 
updates have been provided since; and 

ORDERED:

WHEREAS: 

The long-term effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic are unknown and we need to 
prepare for unsafe conditions lasting into the fall and beyond; and  

WHEREAS: 

The Wisconsin elections on April 7th, 2020 showed the danger, stress, and 
complications of voting in-person during a pandemic; and  

WHEREAS: 

Even if municipal buildings are open to the public in the fall, it will most likely still be 
dangerous for vulnerable populations hit hardest by this crisis to perform any non-
essential activity; and  

WHEREAS: 

No person should have to put their health and safety in danger to exercise their right to 
vote; and 

WHEREAS:  Mayor Siddiqui is a signatory to a letter from 22 mayors across the Commonwealth to 
the Massachusetts legislative leadership asking for urgency in passing a Vote by Mail 
program; and 

WHEREAS 

Efforts in the Massachusetts Legislature include HD.5075, An Act Ensuring Safe and 
Participatory 2020 State Elections in Response to COVID-19, which is 
complementary to S.2612 and is endorsed by over 100 organizations; and

The city's emergency order allows workers in indoor workplaces other than retail 
environments and people inside multi-unit buildings larger than 2 and 3- families to 
not wear a mask if six feet away from others; and 
 
That advice is counter to scientific evidence; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager is requested to amend the Cambridge emergency advisory on 
face coverings/masks to require face coverings be worn inside common areas of multi-
unit buildings with the exception of 2-and 3- family buildings and in all workplaces 
where more than one person is present at all times.

WHEREAS: 

Governor Baker recently announced a four-step plan to reopen Massachusetts, with 
execution beginning as soon as May 18, 2020; and 

WHEREAS: 

Governor Baker’s Reopening Advisory Board does not include any front line 
workers or labor leaders, and there is significant concern that reopening too quickly 
could lead to a resurgence of infections, with severe impacts on the working class 
and communities of color that are already facing disproportionate impact; and 

WHEREAS: 

Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack reported that while travel across the state 
remains 70-80% lower than baseline levels in January, daily vehicle miles traveled 
has increased by 50% compared to the final week of April, and we should anticipate 
that people will start to move around more as the weather improves and more 
businesses start to reopen, leading to the potential for new outbreaks and subsequent 
impacts; and 

WHEREAS: 

The city’s response to the pandemic so far has been reactive, responding as best as 
possible to pressing needs as they have emerged, and very little planning has been 
presented to the City Council for how to avoid anticipated impacts as we begin to 
reopen; and 

WHEREAS: 

Testing, tracing, and treatment are critical to preventing new outbreaks that could 
lead to another devastating shutdown, and we have only just begun to provide testing 
to Cambridge residents in East Cambridge, with plans announced for the Port and 
Cambridge Housing Authority buildings, with no clear plans in place for contact 
tracing beyond what the state is doing, or quarantine of individuals who test positive, 
going forward; and 

WHEREAS: 

Basic needs including shelter, food, and cash will continue to be a problem for many 
Cambridge residents, and current efforts may not be sufficient to address future 
needs; now therefore be it

who tests positive  
●

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to include specific strategies for

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that the weather is getting warmer and 
trees are leafing out around the city; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Many of the existing street and park trees will struggle without regular watering, 
including any new trees planted within the last few years; and 
 
The Spring planting program was understandably suspended due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, but it is important that gator bags are distributed as soon as possible; and 
 
Gator bags make it easier for residents to assist with trees that need additional water in 
order to stay alive during dry weather; and 
 
It is important that we protect our investment in recently planted street trees and 
maximize the opportunity for residents to help; and 
 
Residents could request a gator bag through SeeClickFix; and 
 
The City Council recognizes the critical importance of maintaining our declining tree 
canopy; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DPW to begin 
distributing gator bags, including at minimum making them available on demand as 
soon as possible so that residents who are willing, able, and interested in doing so can 
begin to assist with watering street trees; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter by the next 
regular meeting.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The municipal code includes Chapter 2.108 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, which 
calls for, among other things, a staffed emergency management department; and 
 
Chapter 2.108, was originally written in preparation for wartime and lacks specifics 
around pandemics, like the current COVID-19 pandemic we are experiencing; and 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caught us completely unprepared, leading to 
disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable; and 
 
As of mid-May 2020, Cambridge is experiencing a 21% death rate among nursing 
home residents who test positive, an infection rate among African American people 
that is 3 times that of White people in the city, and significant infection rates among 
the city’s unhoused community; and 
 
The pandemic has also led to economic devastation, including record unemployment, 
and the consequences of a resurgence, second wave, or future pandemic of similar or 
worse proportion would be unbearable without better preparation; and 
 
Climate change and habitat destruction will lead to increased risk of future pandemic 
disease emergence, which without sufficient preparedness and response could well lead 
to even worse outcomes than the current pandemic; and 
 
It has long been the City Council’s goal to provide affordable housing to all residents, 
yet unhoused residents were left without safe space to shelter during the pandemic; 
now therefore be it 
 

Packet Pg. 148

ORDERED: 

5.9

That Chapter 2.108 be amended by inserting a new section 2.108.140 to read as 
follows: 
 
2.108.140 - Shelter During a Pandemic 
 
In the event of an infectious disease pandemic or other similar emergency, and in 
response to a stay at home order, advisory or guidance, upon the declaration of a public 
health emergency, the City Manager shall direct the Head of the Emergency 
Management Agency or other city official in charge to establish safe shelter for all who 
need it, including but not limited to: individuals experiencing homelessness, elderly 
and other vulnerable populations, workers and city staff, and other residents who 
cannot safely isolate in their homes. 
 
2.108.140.10 - Procurement of Hotels and Dormitories 
 
In the event that section 2.108.140 is invoked, the City Manager shall procure, acquire, 
commandeer or construct such hotel, dormitory or emergency shelter space as 
necessary to provide shelter for all who require it, including any resident who is 
unhoused, or who is unable to safely isolate in their current home or place of shelter. 
 
2.108.140.20 Universal Housing 
 
To reduce the need for emergency shelter during a pandemic or other emergency, and 
avoid the associated risks to health and safety, the City Manager shall ensure that at all 
times there is sufficient housing available in the city for all Cambridge residents. To 
implement this provision the City Manager shall put forth regulations that identify who 
are eligible to receive subsidized housing, and any other regulations necessary to 
ensure that those who are eligible are provided with safe and adequate housing at all 
times. 
 
2.108.140.30 - Universal Testing 
 
In the event that section 2.108.140 is invoked, the City Manager shall procure, acquire, 
commandeer or otherwise cause sufficient testing for disease prevalence to take place, 
provided such testing is available, so as to ensure the health and safety of all residents. 
 
2.108.140.40 - Data Reporting 
 
In the event that section 2.108.140 is invoked, the City Manager shall ensure that 
timely and comprehensive data is reported on disease prevalence, mortality, 
hospitalization and demographics, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, 
age and other factors that may indicate disparate impacts, and shall direct all agencies 
to minimize such disparate impacts through equitable allocation of resources.

The School Committee held a Special Meeting last Thursday, May 7th <https://reflect-cambridge.cablecast.tv/vod/8095-CPSD050820-

the School Committee and administration and heard Public Comment about distance learning and the 
FY21 budget, in the context of COVID-19 recovery planning. I’m thankful to everyone that tuned in and 
signed up to provide their testimonies. Community engagement and feedback is so crucial to this planning 
process.  
 
At last Thursday’s meeting, Superintendent Salim gave a presentation 
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1untbtbT1EoZe_jK9NRmNzZ0sMvVRNQ3_oKVN2AAbo8k/e

which highlighted the exceptional work of some of our CPS educators. I shared my gratitude for our 
educators that presented and reiterated that the call of the meeting was to focus on what is not working. 
Despite all of the great work that is happening in some classrooms, by no stretch of the imagination are 
these efforts happening across the board, as we heard in public comment. We must use the community 
feedback we hear, in conjunction with concrete data, to prepare both strategically and financially to 
address the many gaps this summer, next fall, and beyond. 
 
For this past Tuesday, I asked that Superintendent Salim’s presentation 
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XgKXFf-RxcxBt0uLAU1wtRUZdchcH3zJqBcznXxZefw/edit> 
allow the School Committee to look at measurable data and actions as well as provide more information 
about summer programming. You will see in the slides that preliminary projections show significant costs 
for health and safety measures (materials and supplies, transportation) as well as for teaching and learning 
supports. I also wanted to ensure that the School Committee would have an opportunity to weigh in on the
