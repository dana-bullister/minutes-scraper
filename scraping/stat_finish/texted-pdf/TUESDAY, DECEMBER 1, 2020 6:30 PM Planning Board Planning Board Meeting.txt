           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good evening, and 

welcome to the December 1, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board.  My name is Catherine Preston Connolly and I 

am the Chair.  

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

October 26, 2020.  

                    This meeting is being video and audio 

recorded, and is being streamed live on the City of 

Cambridge online meeting portal and on cable television 

4

Channel 22, within Cambridge.  There will also be a 

transcript of the proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking, and all votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

          I'll start by asking the Staff to take Board 

member attendance and verify that all Board members are 

meetings.

today is Pardis Saffari from our Economic Development 

Division.  She is a Senior Economic Development Officer. 

          So [-- and our Small Business liaison --] for 

today's agenda, we are actually delighted to bring you 

something that we have been working on for over a year -- 

actually more than that.   

          It's amendments to the Zoning Use Table, as well 

as some amendments to the Home Occupation section of the 

ordinance, to really try to bring the retail components of 

the ordinance in line with modern-day retail and to really 

help businesses be able to more easily start and go through 

the permitting process in a streamlined way. 

          In our opinion, this is really going to remove 

some of the barriers that businesses have been encountering 

over the years as people try to start up.  So we hope that 

that will be something that the Board finds to be also be 

positive changes. 

Committee as well. 

          This has gone through a lot of discussion at the 

City Council's Economic Development and University Relations 

          We also have in General Business items discussion 

of a comprehensive permit for the housing -- 100 percent

affordable housing development at 2072 Mass Ave, which is 

the -- it's Kabob restaurant across from Henderson carriage 

house. 

          Our next meeting will be December 8, and that will 

include 2 public hearings -- one on 600 Mass Ave, a special 

permit project, and the second is a zoning petition for the 

Alewife Quadrangle.  This is a refiled petition that the 

Board had heard previously, and it is now back in front of 

you next week. 

          December 15, the Board's agenda will include a 

continuing special permit hearing on 727 Mass Ave, and will 

also include an amendment for a special permit at 2 James 

Way. 

          December 22 -- thank you again for being willing 

to meet on Christmas week -- we will have two continued 

items for Cambridgeside.  These are both for Cambridgeside 

PUD, special permit.   

          And in terms of other items of interest of City 

Council, the zoning petitions that the Board is hearing and 

has heard recently will be at the Ordinance Committee.   

          So next week, December 9, the Ordinance Committee 

will hear the cannabis delivery changes that the Board

discussed last week. 

          On December 16 the following week, they will hear 

the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest Overlay Zoning. 

          And then on the seventeenth, the same -- the next 

day they will hear the retail uses and home occupation 

changes that the Board is hearing today. 

          Also next week on the ninth, the Council's 

Neighborhood Long-term Planning Committee is holding a 

hearing to hear from IQHQ, the relatively new owners of the 

Grace site -- the proximity to Jerry's Pond area in Alewife.  

          It's been an area of a lot of interest in North 

Cambridge and Alewife planning discussions.  So that should 

be potentially interesting, given that there's new 

ownership, and that will be the first time that the city 

will be hearing from them.   

          Just from last night's Council hearing, the one 

action that might be -- one of the actions that might be of 

interest is that the Council extended the temporary 

protections related to the Tree Protection Ordinance that 

are due to expire at the end of December.   

          They extended those to the end of February 2021, 

to give staff from DPW as well as the Council time to work 

10

on ordinance changes that would make some of those 

protections more permanent. 

          So those are the key items of interest, and I will 

turn it back to you, Madam Chair.  Thank you. Okay.   

                          * * * * *

Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, Steven A. 

                  Cohen, H Theodore Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom 

                  Sieniewicz, and Nikolas Bowie 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Then the next item on 

our agenda is a public hearing on a zoning petition.  As 

Iram mentioned, this is a zoning petition by the City 

Council to amend Articles 2,4,6,10,11,13,16,17,19 and 20 of 

the zoning ordinance of the City of Cambridge to create new 

land use definitions and amend regulations for Retail or 

Consumer Service Establishments, as well as a zoning 

petition by the City Council to amend Article 4 of the 

zoning ordinance of the City of Cambridge to modify 

regulations for home occupations permitted as accessory 

uses. 

before us.   

          CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is

in CDD and if I could -- usually we have CDD present and 

then there's another presenter, but I think it probably 

makes sense just to roll right into it for the purpose of 

this and to really move ahead. 

          And since Iram already covered a lot of back, I'll 

just mention the -- as always, the Planning Board's role is 

to make a recommendation on zoning petitions.  In this case, 

it's technically 2 zoning petitions that are really being 

presented as one, because there's a related subject matter. 

          And I'll just start off by introducing Paris 

Saffari, who's the Senior Manager in Economic Development 

for the city, and she will begin the presentation -- I'm 

going to share my screen and she will -- or at some point I 

will take over to explain the zoning, which of course is the 

most fun part of any presentation. 

          Pardis, do you want to there were?   

          PARDIS SAFFARI:  Yes.  Thanks, Jeff.  If you just 

want to go to the next slide?  So good evening, everyone.  

We're excited, as Iram mentioned -- we're excited to be here 

with you tonight.  So we just wanted to provide you with a 

quick overview on the history of this project.

          In 2015, CDD engaged with a planning consulting 

firm, Community Opportunity Group, to develop a commercial 

land use classification study that I called ways to update 

Retail classification in the zoning ordinance. 

          In 2017, as part of their strategy plan, our 

consultant at the time encouraged the city to incorporate 

those recommendations from the 2015 study, and in Envision 

Cambridge we -- a near action term item is to revise the 

commercial land use classification to allow for more 

flexible retail formats and uses. 

          And lastly, as Iram mentioned, early this year in 

July and September, CDD staff discussed these 

recommendations to the Council's Economic Development and 

University Relations Subcommittee.   

          Next slide?   

          So as part of this project, CDD staff reviewed BZA 

cases dealing with retail uses.  Between 2013 and 2019, over 

75 businesses appeared before the BZA requiring zoning 

relief for items such as parking, change of use, pet 

services, expansions of their business, outdoor retail, 

accessory retail uses, and live entertainment.   

          Most common BZA requests we noticed as part of the 

study was parking waivers, fast-order food permits, 

variances for non-defined or what we call hybrid uses, and 

current uses not clearly defined.  So for an example that 

13

would be fitness.   

          Next slide?   

          So here are just some of the samples of the 

businesses to go through the process.  So here are some in 

North Cambridge, as well as in the Port neighborhood. 

          The next slide you'll see also in Alewife, East 

Cambridge and Harvard Square.  And we provided you a range 

of samples, because this is a citywide issue -- this is not 

just one district issue that we noticed, there's seven 

problems.    

          Next slide?   

          So as I mentioned, before these four areas were 

the most common BZA requests.  But through the process of 

surveying some of the business owners who had to go through 

the BZA process, we also learned that there are costs -- 

timing costs that business owners have to deal with. 

          So of the businesses that responded to our survey, 

the average legal cost that they accrued to go through the 

special permit and variance process was about $3000.  And

the average opening was about three to six months.    

          Next slide? 

          So in addition to the BZA research, between 2018 

and 2019 CDD staff also conducted a business survey that 

went out to businesses and business associations to learn 

about some other issues that folks are dealing with.   

          And here we have listed a few of those common 

issues: That the Table of Uses is complicated to read, there 

are many footprints, there's too many categories and 

definitions are not up to date with current types of retail.   

          Food entrepreneurs in particular are facing 

difficulties -- for example, we don't have a definition for 

a commercial kitchen, and fast-ordered food can be 

complicated to understand and fit in. 

          Similar to the last slide, where we mentioned time 

and cost, business owners are having to carry their rent or 

their trying to resolve the zoning issues, and so that can 

be onerous to them.  And many businesses felt that zoning 

should allow for mixed uses in one space, so that a business 

could provide different revenue streams for their business.    

          Next slide?   

          So based on this research and feedback, we've come 

15

up with the following objectives for the retail zoning 

petition.  We went to consistently define all retail use 

types, add those use types that we've seen in the past that 

are not current listed in the zoning, regulate this hybrid 

or multiple use activity, plan for the future and unforeseen 

use types, and consider relaxing some of the requirements 

such as parking. 

          So lastly -- and this is at the end, I'll just 

mention that we also are -- will include home occupations as 

the second amendment to this.   

          So I'm going to just hand it over to Jeff to talk 

about more in depth about the Zoning Board.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, Pardis.  I was too eager to 

get into zoning.  So the beginning of this is really just to 

get you situated in how all this relates to zoning.  Most of 

you are sort of familiar with this.  I think the point -- 

sorry, I think the point here is that zoning doesn't 

regulate all aspects of retail.   

          Mainly it's concerned with what types of uses are 

allowed in what types of districts within the city.  There 

are some other things having to do with developmental 

standards.  We're going to talk about parking a little bit,

but mainly it boils down to defining what uses are suitable 

to a particular area. 

          Our zoning for retail now is pretty old.  I 

mentioned before it dates from the 1960s.  The future of 

retail seemed very different in the 1960s.  It used to be 

something that was thought of as being much more auto 

oriented.  Our conceptualization of retail now, we're sort 

of more -- sort of more of our contemporary planning terms; 

focuses on retail as part of a mixed-use environment. 

          And a lot of the recent planning that parties 

talked about is looking at what's the future of retail in 

general.   

          And, you know, when we started this effort, we 

were looking at -- you know, how were things like the 

Internet having an impact on business?  And how is that 

changing the kinds of services and the kinds of experiences 

that people want to have.   

          Honestly, over the past year, we've had a whole 

new set of issues that have come up, that have -- again, 

redefined the way we think about retail in the city.  And I 

think the lesson to be learned from all of this is that we 

need to have some zoning that's really flexible enough to 

17

deal with a changing environment that can sometimes change 

in very unexpected ways.   

          So just the overview of the petition, we put 

together this set of recommendations with input from the 

Economic Development Committee; a lot of assistance from the 

Law Department.   

          I'm going to try to move as quickly as possible 

through this.  Before I launch in, just to kind of step 

back, since the Planning Board kind of does tend to get into 

this zoning, and I want to point out a few things about the 

approach that we're taking. 

          There are a lot of different ways that we could 

consider approaching this kind of an effort.  There's sort 

of one extreme where we could have just said, "What are the 

minimal number of edits we need to make to the zoning 

ordinance in order to fix the immediate problems that we're 

dealing with?" That might fix those problems, but it also 

leads us with kind of a clunky system to work with. 

          On the other extreme, we could just kind of get 

rid of everything.  We could sort of tear it all down and 

try to rebuild something new from scratch.  That could 

result in a simpler and cleaner outcome altogether, but it's 

18

13

16

19

21

22

also much more difficult to keep track of what's changed, 

and that could lead to unexpected outcomes.   

          So the approach that we took is a little bit more 

of a rehab approach, where we kind of stripped down a lot of 

what we currently have in place, but kept most of the 

structure of it intact, which means there's a lot of edits 

to keep track of.   

          But we hope that after going through all those 

edits, we'll have an outcome that’s going to be much cleaner 

and a more improved piece of zoning. 

          So Part 1 is how retail uses are defined.  At a 

glance, this is what we currently have.  Some of these uses 

have definitions, some of them don't.  Many of them have 

footnotes that you have to kind of trace through the zoning 

ordinance to figure out exactly how they play out.  So 

there's kind of a lack of consistency that we're trying to 

deal with. 

          One important note that our broad goals, as 

mentioned, is we want to aim for consistency in our 

definitions, and then we can do a better job of putting 

systems in place for dealing with how to address combined 

uses and how to address uses that don't necessarily fit into

a specific category. 

          We started acknowledging that we don't really 

specify in the zoning ordinance what we mean by retail and 

consumer service establishments.  We have a category for it, 

but it's not defined.   

          It's important to do this if we want to regulate 

retail uses that might fall outside any of the specific use 

definitions that we have.  So we constructed a definition 

that tries to be somewhat expansive.  It covers stores, 

personal services, food service, entertainment and 

recreation. 

          And two kind of key things that we pointed out; it 

covers consumer services but not professional services.  So 

we often have to point out to people that banks -- you know, 

real estate offices, medical offices, that is all not 

considered retail under our zoning ordinance.  They fall 

under office use. 

          Also, we try to specify that a retail activity per 

our zoning is intended mainly to serve consumers directly 

and on site.  That kind of service can be supplemented by 

offsite services like delivery -- we had a whole 

conversation about that last week, or some kind of wholesale

types of businesses -- tut really the core part of a retail 

business is providing those services directly on site. 

          And then the other services that might be built 

around that are somewhat ancillary.   

          So for the rest of the use definitions, I'm not 

going to go over each one, just going to touch on some of 

the key substantive changes that we're proposing from the 

current zoning.  Zoning doesn't necessarily group them into 

categories, but we've done that just to try to make it a 

little bit easier to digest. 

          In stores, we've added definition for, "grocery 

store." Those aren't currently listed, although we do 

regulate them sometimes in different ways in the ordinance.  

          A convenient store we've made some tweaks to 

increasing the size from 2500 to 5000 square feet, just to 

be a little bit more consistent with what we'd have to see. 

          And then another continuing of what we call sort 

of retail with manufacturing or assembly involved, some of 

these are uses that Pardis pointed out in the first part of 

the presentation that are difficult to sort of classify.   

          We have renamed that, "draft retail and 

production" and we've proposed removing a requirement that 

21

at least 50 percent of goods are sold on premises.  That's a 

standard that many of these types of businesses have a very 

difficult time meeting.  It's also very difficult to enforce 

how much of a particular business's sales are happening on 

site. 

          So we're proposing to remove that as part of how 

we define that use, but they still would have to have retail 

sales on site -- again, to meet that definition of retail.   

          We even proposed a consolidation of a few 

different categories of use into one category, which we 

call, "personal services."  It encompasses all kinds of 

personal or household services that are now broken up into 

different categories.  It doesn't include automobile 

service, which is its own piece.   

          Food and beverage, we have a few different changes 

that are proposed.  One is just consolidating restaurants 

that serve alcohol and those that don't serve alcohol.  Our 

zoning doesn't really distinguish between the two, and 

licensing is really the mechanism that regulates who can 

serve alcohol and under what circumstances. 

          Fast-order food is something that Pardis raised, 

and it's something that a lot of people are familiar with.

There is a lot of confusion I think around just the cultural 

baggage that the term, "fast food" has collected over the 

years.   

          In this petition, one of the things that is 

suggested is adding the term, "quick service" to the title.  

And that's really meant to emphasize that the zoning 

distinction between a restaurant and what we consider fast-

order or quick service food is really the speed of service 

and the orientation towards carryout food, rather than sit-

down dining.   

          So the definition is amended to provide that 

distinction a bit more clearly.  It strips out some of the 

more specific and onerous items in the current definition of 

fast-order food.   

          For example, the current definition says if less 

than 80 percent of a business is dine-in versus takeout, 

then it qualifies as fast-order food.  So imagine any 

restaurant that has more than 20 percent of its business as 

takeout is now considered fast-order food.  We didn't think 

that really made a lot of sense.   

          And there was also some new definitions that are 

being proposed for uses that are becoming more common.  The

Planning Board has been seeing a lot of them -- things like 

food stands that are smaller than fast-order food 

establishment as a stand-alone thing.   

          Also food halls, which can accommodate many 

different kinds of food stands; and craft beverage 

establishments, which is the category that we've defined to 

include things like breweries that combine kind of a hybrid 

of service -- beverage service as well as industrial types 

of uses and manufacturing.   

          Entertainment:  There's just two kind of key 

changes proposed.  The first is to change the definition 

that currently encompasses any establishment where alcohol 

is served and dancing and entertainment is provided, and to 

make that a more kind of narrow, defined use of a dance hall 

or nightclub, which I think is what it originally sort of 

intended to include.   

          And then the second is adding a definition for 

fitness centers.  That something that has been an issue many 

times in the past that it's not defined anywhere in the 

zoning ordinance. 

          Arts and crafts studios, which are a part of 

retail use under our zoning ordinance have a fairly clear

definition currently.  They're permitted pretty broadly 

across the city, but performing arts studios are included, 

and so, the proposal is to create a definition for those. 

          And there are a few specialty types of retail that 

have kind of unique treatment under zoning.  We're not 

proposing that much be changed here except deleting what's 

called, "jobbing establishments" which is something I've 

never been entirely sure what it is, but it seems more 

likely to fit in kind of an office or industrial category 

than in retail. 

          Open air retail, one of the big issues is that it 

currently tends to mix both pedestrian-oriented types of 

business with ones that are more drive-in or auto oriented.   

          So the changes that are proposed would try to 

separate those two a bit more clearly.  We don't have a 

general category for outdoor retail sales, which is proposed 

to be added.   

          We have defined things like open-air agricultural 

product sales and lettering of gravestones.  We've provided 

-- or we've proposed a definition that would incorporate 

anything that is sort of customarily sales of goods that are 

done in an outdoor environment.

          And this petition also -- one of the main changes 

is to add a temporary outdoor retail use, which would 

include things like seasonal farmers' markets, performances 

that may happen kind of on a limited basis and in outdoor 

spaces and those types of things.   

          So now that we have definitions, we start to look 

at how these uses might be regulated.  And the first part of 

this has to do with some general rules around hybrid retail, 

or retail that is incorporated into some other larger use.  

Often there are issues that might arise when -- say a 

restaurant wants to start to include some entertainment on a 

limited basis.  That was one of the items that Pardis 

mentioned is a frequent issue.   

          That might not always be considered an incidental 

sort of accessory use, but there is a desire on the part of 

businesses and on the part of the Council to allow some of 

this kind of activity without having to go through an 

onerous review process. 

          So this petition proposes that sales, programming, 

food and beverage service, entertainment and recreation 

activities would be allowed to coexist as part of another 

allowed nonresidential use in the district if they take up

no more than 25 percent of the larger use into either space 

of time of hours of operation. 

          And those types of uses would not be treated 

separately from the larger use in terms of requirements for 

parking and signage.  So it wouldn't sort of modify those 

requirements. 

proposed. 

          So with those general kind of provisions in mind 

for hybrid retail, we look at where the principal retail 

uses are allowed, and what proposed -- what changes are 

          Once all the uses are defined, our Table of Use 

regulations says where they're allowed -- many of you are 

familiar with this, I won't go into it in detail, but I do 

like to note that in the, "no" category, often people will 

look at that as, "Oh, that means it needs a variance" and 

it's important to note that a variance isn't really an 

approval process, it's intended as exceptions to the rule.  

          So if there are places where we want to encourage 

different types of retail use, even if we're concerned about 

the impacts they might have, the variance process isn't 

necessarily a reliable way to encourage that kind of 

activity.

          So this is the zoning map; everyone's familiar 

with that.  We're not proposing to rezone any parts of the 

city, that's an important thing to note. The scope of this 

is really just looking at what's the range of use permitted 

in different types of districts. 

          And as I'm sure you're all aware, our red 

districts generally allow the most retail uses, it gets more 

limited as you go into the purples and blues and then the 

oranges and yellows, which are residential districts, 

generally don't allow retail. 

          It's helpful because this is complicated just to 

talk about the overall logic behind the proposed changes.  

The guiding principles start with first wanting to have a 

system where similar uses follow a similar pattern.   

          There may be reasons to regulate some specific 

uses differently in different contexts, but this is just 

sort of the good -- like, rational zoning principle that, 

you know, retail should be allowed in retail districts, and 

that's sort of how I know how to work. 

          Another principle to keep in mind is our broader 

city planning objectives.  And those are articulated through 

Envision Cambridge and other efforts -- the ones that Pardis 

28

mentioned.  There are areas of the city where we may want to 

encourage retail and there are many where we do encourage 

retail.  But in some cases, our zoning is very prohibitive.  

And so, if we want to encourage retail in certain areas, we 

have to consider whether or not it's allowed.   

          And then the final point is an acknowledgment that 

retail today is different from what it was in the 1960s.  

It's characterized not mostly by shops, but by a range of 

different services and recreation.   

          So if the goal is to encourage thriving retail 

areas in the future, then we need to permit a broader range 

of uses than just traditional retail stores. 

          [Pull up part of my notes.] So in light of those 

principles, we've put some effort into -- oh, I'm sorry -- 

in light of these principles, we've put together some maps 

of our zoning districts and looked at what uses are allowed 

there, and came up with some general findings.  Those 

findings are kind of laid out on the slide.   

          We know that some uses are treated more 

restrictively than other similar kinds of uses, particularly 

things like entertainment and theaters, fast-order food uses 

versus other kinds of food service uses.

22

          And we also found that there are some districts 

where our planning is trying to encourage more retail, but 

they tend to be more restrictive.  So our neighborhood 

business districts even growing office districts like 

Kendall Square and Alewife are fairly prohibitive when you 

look at whether or not they allow retail.     

          [Pause]  

          Sorry, another issue that's come up in a number of 

occasions is that residential districts don't allow retail.  

And so, and even though there are many uses in those retail 

districts that predate our zoning, and many of them are kind 

of well-loved and serve an important neighborhood function, 

whenever one of those uses turns over, any new retail uses 

needs to go through a variance process if it wants to remain 

retail use. 

          This isn't necessarily all bad -- doesn't always 

necessarily result in bad outcomes.  But as I mentioned, the 

implication is that each of these are special cases, and so, 

for a retail use in a residential district, the expectation 

is that over time they'll gradually phase out and be 

converted to conforming retail uses. 

          And the final point is just an acknowledgment that 

30

22

there's tradeoff to all of this.  Allowing more uses as-of-

right removes red tape, makes it easier for new businesses 

to be established.   

          But where the zoning is more restrictive or 

requires review, it can be harder for new businesses, but it 

allows residents and other businesses and other community 

members to have more say and control over the new businesses 

that get established and their potential impacts. 

          So now just getting into the proposal, the first 

thing it does is changes the rules to allow most retail uses 

in most retail districts.  Sometimes special permits are 

required, if there are particular impacts, but generally if 

it's a retail use, you can expect it to be allowed. 

          And the second is allowing most retail uses in 

office districts, if they're located on the ground story and 

are part of a mixed-use development with office or 

residential uses.  There are some limitations on that.  Some 

of the limitations can be waived by special permit, and in 

Office I districts, a special permit would also be required, 

because that's a lower intensity district. 

          And finally, in residential districts the proposal 

is to allow a narrow range of retail uses by special permit, 

31

22

only in residential districts in a preexisting 

nonconforming, nonresidential space.  So it's a very narrow 

carveout to say that there's a building there that has a 

retail use already, then you could get a new retail use in 

by special permit. 

          So this isn't exactly the table, and you don't 

really need to read all of it, but it just kind of 

highlights the approach of saying, "We're mostly yes for 

these retail districts in business and industry districts." 

The office districts it's somewhat more limited.  In some 

cases there are special permits required, and it's much more 

limited to those really narrow cases of existing spaces in 

residential districts. 

          And this is what it looks like for some of the 

additional uses.  And it gets a little bit more constrained 

as we get into those outdoor retail uses, which are more 

automobile-oriented. 

          So some maps.  And we provide this in advance.  So 

I'm going to go through this quickly, and we can go back to 

it; hopefully you've had a little bit of time to look at it. 

          We just picked a few uses to look at, we didn't 

look at all of them; that would be a little too intense.

22

But we wanted to highlight some areas where either some 

significant changes are being made or where there's just 

some -- we think some interesting sort of issues to look 

across. 

          So in food and beverage service, our -- this is 

what our current zoning looks like when it comes to 

restaurants.  And you can see where restaurants are 

clustered in the city, and you can see our zoning is fairly 

permissive when it comes to restaurant uses.   

          But then under current zoning, as you go to fast-

order food, you know, you still find these uses kind of 

throughout the city in the same kinds of places you find 

restaurants, but it's much more limited.  It requires a 

special permit everywhere in the city. 

          So under the proposal, fast-order food begins to 

look a little bit more like restaurants.  It is more allowed 

in our poorer commercial areas, where they tend to be 

clustered more and they tend to be found more.  They are 

still by special permit in some of the less intensive 

districts within the city.   

          And they're one of the uses that you can see 

they're kind of scattered throughout residential 

33

22

neighborhoods, where if you had an existing space you could 

by special permit apply to have a fast-order or quick 

service food establishment in those locations.   

          And then we introduced food stands and kiosks and 

food halls.  Again, that follows a similar pattern to 

restaurants and fast-order food. 

          And then craft beverage establishments are a 

little bit more restrictive because they have more of an 

industrial character to them.  So they're allowed more as-

of-right in our more industrial districts, but they require 

special permits in other kind of retail districts.   

          Entertainment:  Again, if you look at the current 

zoning, you see one kind of pattern of regulation for 

theaters, where it's allowed as-of-right in four districts, 

special permit in other districts.   

          Entertainment uses:  These are establishments 

where alcohol is provided and entertainment in the same 

establishment.  You can see it's very different, because 

it's -- while it's allowed as-of-right in many areas, 

there's lots of areas where it's not allowed at all, even by 

special permit.   

          And then commercial recreation under current 

34

22

zoning is it's kind of -- it's like neither of the other 

two.  It's allowed in more places, but it requires a special 

permit nearly everywhere.   

          So the proposal really tries to take these 

different kinds of entertainment and recreation uses and 

create a more regular pattern to how they're regulated -- 

again, focusing on allowing them as-of-right in four areas, 

special permit in areas where it's more sort of 

neighborhood-based retail, where there might need to be more 

review of the impacts. 

          And as I noted, we introduced fitness centers, 

which are allowed -- you find them sort of scattered more 

throughout the city.  They were allowed somewhat more 

permissively, and they're another use that could be allowed 

to occupy an existing retail space in a residential area. 

          And then just noting some of the newer things 

we've been talking about -- craft retail.  You can see where 

that -- that actually follows a pattern that’s not too 

different from the way that they're currently regulated, 

where they're kind of more broadly within the city, but 

special permit in some cases. 

          Oh, the one thing to note here is that the 

35

proposal allows them as-of-right in areas where they would 

ordinarily require a special permit if they're 2500 square 

feet or less.   

          So some of the examples that Pardis noted at the 

beginning of the presentation where small businesses have a 

very, very small kind of assembly or packaging operation.  

And in those cases the proposal is to make them allowed as-

of-right, not have to go through a complicated process. 

          Arts and craft studios:  Just wanted to point out 

where performing arts studios fall within that category.  

They're allowed pretty broadly throughout the city.   

          And then outdoor retail, this is what the proposed 

regulations are for open lot sales.  This is what it would 

look like for outdoor entertainment and recreation -- 

somewhat more limited in terms of requiring a special permit 

in most districts, except in some of the more heavily 

commercial areas of the city and temporary outdoor retail. 

          So just the wrapping up, do you want to break in 

for a second?     

          [Pause] 

          I'm sorry, I saw a hand raised. 

          So the last piece of this, which we're just kind

of wrapping up with, is a parking exemption.  So as Pardis 

noted, one of the more onerous pieces of our zoning right 

now is parking requirements for small businesses.   

          There are different requirements for different 

kinds of retail, and if you switch from one type of retail 

to another and it triggers a higher parking requirement, 

you're stuck in a funny position where you either have to 

somehow create new parking spaces or -- which often is not a 

desirable outcome -- or need to go to the BZA to get relief. 

          So the proposal is to expand a current exemption 

in zoning that applies only if you are required to have up 

to four spaces, and to expand that to apply to any new use 

in an existing building with up to 10,000 -- I'm sorry, any 

existing building.   

          So this is kind of mirroring the current zoning 

requirements we have in place in Central Square and Harvard 

Square, where if it's an existing building we don't need to 

create any new parking.  We think that this very simple 

change will do away with a really, really large number of 

cases of retail uses and small businesses having to go to 

the BZA. 

          And then you might note that we have some changes

to the schedule of parking and loading that were included.  

Those are really meant just to update consistency with the 

Use Table and not really to propose any substantive changes 

to parking requirements. 

          And then the final piece on the retail zoning is 

adding some considerations to the current General Special 

Permit Criteria to focus on the specific issues that we 

think are relevant to reviewing a right business.   

          And those would include looking at the delivery 

and loading operations, looking at what kind of 

environmental nuisance might occur that might affect other 

kinds of uses that are allowed in the district, looking at 

the design of the façade with and the visual character -- 

these are all things the Planning Board is used to looking 

at as part of its review. 

          And then the final piece, which actually is kind 

of inspired by a suggestion from the City Council was to 

make sure that there is a -- or to consider whether there's 

a stated need for a particular kind of use within an area -- 

either in our citywide planning, or within planning for that 

particular area. 

          So with that, I'm just going to turn it over to

Pardis to briefly summarize the very, very short change 

that's proposed to home occupations.   

          PARDIS SAFFARI:  Thanks, Jeff.  So yes, as Jeff 

said at the beginning this is kind of two petitions in one, 

and the second part is about home occupations.  If you want 

to go to the next slide? 

          So just as a reminder, home occupation is defined 

as an occupation customly (sic) carried out at home, used in 

a room or dwelling of the person's residency as an office, 

studio, workroom.  And there's no commodities sold on 

premise.    

          Next slide?  So our current zoning allows home 

occupation of an office of a physician, a dentist, 

attorneys, architect, engineer (sic), probably licensed 

massage therapist, provide that no more than three persons 

shall practice or be employed on premise at one time.   

          In the case of a massage therapist no more than 

one person shall practice or be employed on premise at one 

time. 

          We -- as Jeff mentioned -- there are very minor 

suggestions, amendments, but we want to include just general 

professional office to this.  We continue to keep licensed 

39

massage therapist as well.  We want to just -- this was 

allowed, but just make it very clear that artist home studio 

is included, and something new that we heard from Council, 

which is residential kitchen. 

          Requirements continue to remain the same.  The 

primary practitioner is a residential occupant of the 

dwelling unit.  No more than one person practicing or 

employed on the premise at one time, unless specified like 

professional office activities take place in the building, 

and there is no offensive noise, vibration, smell, smoke, 

heat, that are produced. 

          And obviously one of the main things it's 

accessory and incidental to the primary residential use.  So 

hopefully no offices taking over one residential unit at one 

time. 

          And then next slide?  We just wanted to talk 

briefly about what we are defining as -- or actually what 

the state defines as retail residential kitchen.  If this 

amendment goes forward, residents will be allowed to use 

their primary residence for Cottage Food operations, as 

defined under State Sanitary Code Chapter 10.   

          And Cottage Food Operation is defined as the 

40

person who produces food products such as jams, baked goods 

in the residential kitchen or their primary residence and 

can be sold only directly to consumers, which could include 

events such as farmer's markets, fairs and sales by NOW.]  

          And products must be prepackaged prior to sale 

with an ingredient label.  And, again, if staff have already 

started to discuss the new Cottage Food permit, should this 

get approved, so that we can help residents who are 

interested in using their kitchen for this new type of 

retail use.   

          And that is it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you both 

very much.  Let's see -- this is a public hearing, so I 

think next we're going to move to public comment.  Any 

members of the public who wish to speak should now click the 

icon at the bottom that says, "Raise hand."  If you're 

calling in by phone, you raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had not 

received any written communications on this petition.  But 

any written communications received after that time will be 

entered into the record.  I'll have Staff unmute speakers 

one at a time.  You should begin by saying your name and

address, and Staff will confirm that we can hear you. 

          After that, you have up to three minutes to speak 

before I ask you to wrap up.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I guess I'll get started with 

the list?  Or did you want to -- anything else?  I see one 

hand raised at this point, and that is Ruth Riles.  So you 

can unmute yourself and start with your name and address and 

make your comments.   

          RUTH RILES:  This is Ruth Riles of 115 Upland 

Road, and I just want to say congratulations for beginning 

                        th                 st

to bring us into the 20  century -- the 21  century I 

suppose it is, especially on the Cottage Food.  I got lots 

of questions; I'd like to look back over the presentation at 

my leisure but congratulations.  It's been a long time 

coming.  So thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  So with that, I don't 

see any more hands that are raised, but I can give a last 

call if there's anybody who is on and wants to speak about 

the retail or occupation zoning petition, please push the 

button that says, "Raise hand" now or push *9 if you're on 

your phone.

          I think that probably looks like it.  I'll turn it 

back over to the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you.  So then we will move from public comment to Board 

discussion.  If the hearing is continued to a future date 

and additional information is received, there will be an 

opportunity for public comment on the additional materials 

at that time.  And additional written comments can of course 

also be submitted. 

          We have received a memo from CDD Staff, who are 

available for questions.  And obviously, Jeff and Pardis 

just gave a very comprehensive presentation on the 

proposals.  But let's start with questions for Staff.  Do 

Board members have any questions?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I had some questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I'm hearing 

questions.  Okay.  Hugh, let's start with you.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'm sort of tempted to try to put 

all my points into sort of Jeopardy mode as a question, but 

I'm going to start with the ones that seem more clearly 

questions.   

          On page 39 there's a chart, and some of the things 

43

are filled in with, "Yes/SP" or -- and some other -- when is 

it yes or is it special permit, or is it in different zones?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, to answer that question, it's 

the latter.  So you can see there's a more fleshed out table 

in the petition materials themselves.  So if -- you know, 

there's -- you can see what's added -- if you go further on, 

you can see exactly what's changing from current zoning.   

          But the key changes that we wanted to highlight 

are that, you know, in our business districts, which are the 

-- you know, the ones that are kind of halfway over and kind 

of the middle section of this column and to a large extent 

the and industrial districts of the city, more retail uses 

are allowed either as-of-right or by special permit. 

          And where the special permits are required, you 

know, we highlighted some of this on the map.  So for 

example, you know, the craft beverage establishments which 

we pointed out in business districts -- those tend to 

require a special permit more often, because there are more 

-- you know, potential impacts in terms of the nature of the 

activity, loading, the -- any kind of -- you know, delivery 

activity that might be taking place at the site that would 

need to be reviewed and mitigated.

          So it's more complicated than in that one chart, 

but it's -- what I can say is that we did go through this 

very carefully -- you know, Pardis and myself and other 

staff and the Law Department, to really carefully consider 

for each zoning district, each of these categories of zoning 

district, and each of these new uses that have either been 

defined or redefined or tweaked, that we are very deliberate 

about what we -- you know, what we recommend in terms of 

whether it's allowed as-of-right by special permit or not 

allowed.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  My next question is -- and 

it's sort of -- my general thinking here is are there ways 

to make the ordinance even more permissive, where it doesn't 

seem to make a difference?   

          So I'm wondering why animal services are always a 

special permit, particularly if they're always in side 

buildings?  It's a good question.  I think we found -- and 

maybe Pardis can add to this -- animal services are in that 

category of more specialty retail uses that we talked about.  

They're not the kind of uses that you might see kind of 

going -- you know, kind of free moving -- you know, popping 

in or out of a particular district.

22

          We know that they're -- you know, historically 

they have required a special permit in most parts of the 

city -- really in all parts of the city where they're 

allowed.   

          And I think the reason is to consider impacts that 

it might have on abutters, if there are impacts of noise or 

impacts of other -- impacts of the operation that need to be 

looked at.  I think that was the idea.   

          Certainly, it could be considered to allow them 

as-of-right, but they're the kinds of cases where we think 

that there's a benefit to having some special permit review, 

and given the kind of frequency and number of these kinds of 

uses that there are within the city, we wouldn't expect it 

to be terribly onerous to have to impose that review.           

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.  Another question is, 

I'm curious why the arts uses are not one of the uses 

permitted in ground floor of office districts?   

          And I would observe that as I bike around the 

city, there's an awful lot of vacant retail space now.  And 

there's like a section of Mass Ave midway through Harvard 

and Central Square, there's a whole -- there are a bunch of 

office buildings that have retail spaces on the ground

floor, and they're probably going to be hard to fill those 

spaces.  And possibly some sort of arts uses might be 

innocuous, there might be another option.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I'm just taking that as a 

comment.  I think it is worth sort of thinking about you 

know before we undertook this effort, we would -- I would 

say that, you know, arts uses are one of the more permissive 

uses or one of the more kind of liberally allowed uses 

within the city, at least in terms of commercial uses. 

          But you're right, they still do require a special 

permit in many office and residential districts.  So that's 

something that we know that the Council has a strong 

interest in encouraging the arts uses, so that's something 

that the Council might consider, is whether it might fall 

into that category of either allowed ground-floor retail 

uses, or even just being generally an allowed use in office 

districts.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Sort of a related question about 

the office districts:  I was wondering why you didn't also 

allow the retail uses in the basement of such buildings?  

Because some buildings like that do have spaces in the 

basement.  Sometimes they're only used for storage, but it

seems like it would be -- there would be some buildings 

where it would be useful to not have to go and get a special 

permit for that.            

          Another thing that struck me as strange was that 

restaurants are special permit uses in PUD districts and it 

seems like that, you know, I mean the owner of the PUD 

district may not want restaurants in the Cambridge Crossing, 

they want to concentrate things.  But it just seems like it 

ought to be use that’s not a special permit use. 

          I'm thinking that regulating restaurants, making 

it difficult for startups, is one of the problems of the 

ordinance.  And so, if you don't need to spend three to six 

months and $3000 just to order -- open a coffee shop, it 

seems like that would be a benefit to people who are trying 

to get into the business and to have local people. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Just one point on the comment about 

restaurants.  So we didn't -- so this map shows the current 

zoning for restaurants.  We didn't sort of bother to show a 

proposed zoning, because it doesn't change that much.   

          But one thing that does change is these areas that 

are outlined in blue that currently -- that are office 

zoning but are within PUD districts, under the proposed

zoning, these would be allowed -- you know, as-of-right on 

the ground floor as, you know, as with --              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay, well good.  That's -- so that 

resolves that question.  I've been thinking a lot about the 

fast food.  When the ordinance was initially set up to keep 

McDonald's and Burger King out of our core commercial areas, 

because it was thought that that would change the character, 

and we really wanted to encourage local people. 

          Now, as I understand it, that's no longer the 

case.  You could have a -- you know, a McDonald's in Harvard 

Square because it's a district where you're not limited to 

fast food.   

          But I'm wondering what's the point of limiting 

fast food at all, and why don't we just say to restaurants, 

"You don't require extra permitting" - again, try to lower 

the barrier for people to start little restaurants, and not 

make it something that only bigger corporations can do?   

          So I've sort of migrated over out of the question 

mode, but that's really the end of my list.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Hugh.  I 

think one of the things we have certainly found recently is 

that there is a fair amount of question and comment that

goes hand in hand.  And I don't want to artificially 

segregate them.  So, you know, by all means let's ask Staff 

any questions we have, but if they're rhetorical or just 

comments, that's fine too. 

          Tom, I saw your hand next.  Why don't you jump up 

and share your thoughts with us?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Sure, thank you.  And I have some 

questions, perhaps uncharacteristically. But underlined in 

my notebook, "What's our issue with fast food?"  Hugh, I'm 

with you on that.   

          And I think there's an overlay also around the 

issue of fast food that I've recently gained awareness 

around, which is it's relationship -- who eats fast food, or 

who consumes fast food?  And I think there's an issue of 

class and race around the table, and so it's even more 

complicated than just the character.   

          So I wonder -- I also question why we regulated 

it.  And I think it's a vestige of a former fear, and that's 

a comment not a question. 

          But the question I actually had around home 

occupations was now that everybody works at home, and in 

fact I can see that now there's government workers working 

50

at home -- I don't know whether they're allowed to do that, 

because they may or may not be professionals, but whether 

we're ahead of the curve enough on home occupations and the 

home work, given that in the last 250 days that has been 

everybody's experience, and there's been a grand experiment 

in our city about what that's like to in fact have thousands 

of offices and home workers. 

          And I wonder about the regulation there.  What's 

in the public interest to kind of regulate that so much?  It 

seems like this is not only the future, it's the present 

that people have home occupation.  So it's just a question, 

Jeff, about whether we're far enough ahead in terms of our 

thinking around home occupation and regulating it.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Um--.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:   I know it took five years to get 

to this point, so.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's an interesting question to 

answer.  It's really one -- you know, it's one that we 

puzzle over a lot when -- you know, when particular cases 

come up of, you know, when -- you know, someone is doing 

something that maybe is unexpected, but doesn't -- it's 

maybe unexpected but not unreasonable.  And we sort of ask

the question of, "Does our zoning anticipate this?  And does 

our zoning say anything about whether or not this should be 

regulated?" 

          And sometimes the answer is simply, you know, it's 

a matter of interpretation, or it's a matter of common-law, 

of how -- you know, these kinds of things, kind of questions 

tend to be looked at.  I think you're right that it is 

helpful in the case of our zoning that we say explicitly, 

"If you have a home office and you're within these 

limitations, then it's allowed."             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So, you know, we don't get into 

questions of has somebody sort of crossed the line and 

turned their house into a -- you know, into a workspace for 

-- you know, and I think it's -- I think the idea behind 

home occupations is that there are things that you would 

customarily expect people to do at their own homes. 

          And that is distinct from somebody -- you know, 

living in a single-family home and saying, "You know what?  

My office is closed, but I can bring some employees in and 

put them in all a different room of the house and, you know, 

run a company from there," which people do even not during

pandemic times.   

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Right.  I mean, my experience -- 

my neighbors are -- you know, they're I guess high rent 

apartments, so there's three unrelated people working there 

and now there's three offices, because they're not going to 

their tech businesses or wherever they go.   

          So there's in effect an office building next to my 

house, right?  Because there's now nine people from three 

units, right?  employed at home somehow.   

          But the impact by the way -- the good news -- is 

it's not an issue at all, right?  You know, you don't even 

know that it's going on.  So there's an intensity of home 

office use that the ordinance doesn't seem to -- anyway, 

anticipate.  But anyway, it's an ongoing experiment.   

          That's really my only questions.  I'll have 

comments later.    

to go next?               

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Niko, you want 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sure.  Thanks.  Thank you for this 

presentation.  This is super interesting, and I'm glad that 

the city is pursuing it.  So I have a bunch of questions 

that I just, like, took notes on the text of the petition.  

53

So I'll just run through them in order that I have them.   

          So the first question is the definition of "Retail 

or Consumer Service Establishment." It starts with an 

establishment whose principal purpose is -- and then the 

list follows.  Is the term, "principal purpose" defined?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I don't believe it's defined, but I 

am -- you know, this is where I would, you know, note that 

we've consulted with the Law Department and I'm trying to 

find the appropriate language. 

          And I think that's terminology that's standard in 

zoning when we're talking about what the real kind of 

primary land use at a particular location, acknowledging 

that, you know, lots of -- you could, depending on how 

narrowly you slice it, you can imagine lots of different 

categories of activity actually happening in a particular 

place.  This is talking about what's the land use. 

          We can try to -- I don't have a great response to 

that, but if you have any sort of thoughts or comments for 

any kind of improvements to the language, we can talk about 

that with our Law Department, try to get some good guidance.         

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  So I guess I have two 

questions, based on what you just said.  The first is, so

all of the definitions that follow Retail or Consumer 

Service Establishment abandon the term, "principal purpose 

and use the term, "principal function" -- does that mean 

something different?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I don't think the intent is to be 

different between purpose and function.  Maybe that's 

something we can look at again to see if one term is the 

most appropriate one to use.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's not intended to have different 

meaning.  And not intended to have a substantially different 

meaning.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  Because on that front, 

then, there's also later for, like the definition of, "fast 

-order, quick service food" there's a new term of "primary 

function."  

          So there's currently principal purpose, principal 

function and primary function."  I gather that there should 

probably just be one term?  And I wonder if, "principal" 

should be defined in the ordinance, give that the purpose is 

to give people clarity.   

          Because given that previously the definition of a

"fast-order food establishment" involved, like, volume of 

sales or volume of -- or, like people who, like eat or out 

or a number of tables or whatever it was. 

          People might come into the -- like, the restaurant 

owners or business owners might view the zoning ordinance 

with their own industry-specific assumptions about what is a 

principal purpose or primary function or whatever the end 

term is.  And so, providing some clarity might be helpful.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I appreciate the comment.  I 

think it's helpful to have that kind of scrutiny over the 

language.   

          The one comment I would make -- and one of the 

challenges of doing this kind of work is -- finding the 

balance between clarity and not being overly rigid or, you 

know, too sort of arbitrarily specific that it wouldn't 

allow for a reasonable interpretation by the Inspectional 

Services Department, you know, consistent with zoning laws.  

          So striking that balance is challenging, but I do 

take the point about trying to -- you know, narrow down the 

terminology so that we're using, you know, the best terms 

and -- you know, that are both clear to readers, but also 

clearly enforceable from a legal perspective.

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  I think, "principal 

purpose" could work on its own, or "principal function" so 

long as it's consistent. 

          So next question, with the Retail or Consumer 

Service Establishment, it reads, "an establishment whose 

principal purpose is" and then there's a list.   

          And the list ends with, "and." I think the list 

should probably end with, "or" so that you're not defining a 

Retail or Consumer Service Establishment as something that 

does all of these things, but does one or those things at 

least.   

          My next question at least -- I'm confused by the 

definition of a, "bar."  So a bar is defined as a Retail or 

Consumer Service Establishment whose principal function is 

to serve alcoholic beverages, but which is not licensed to 

prepare or serve food."  Whereas a restaurant is defined as, 

"a place whose principal function is to serve prepared food 

and beverages, including alcoholic beverages served with 

meals."  

          So between those two definitions, there doesn't 

seem to be a definition for a place that I would think of as 

a bar, where its principal function is to serve beverages, 

57

but you can also get snacks or food, but you don't have to.  

So I don't know if the definition is intentionally 

restrictive, but as I read those two, "restaurants can only 

serve alcoholic beverages with food," and, "bars can't serve 

food," but one of them I think probably should have the 

option, right?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I think that if it's 

licensed for food and be beverage, it would be considered 

under this a restaurant.  We actually had some discussion 

early on of whether, you know, bars should be sort of 

subsumed into restaurant.   

          And after discussion -- and part of the reason for 

that is that from a licensing perspective it's fairly 

unheard of at this point, and possibly completely impossible 

to get a license to serve alcohol if the establishment isn't 

also serving food.   

          I think there are some bars -- kind of more, what 

you might think of as a more traditional bar that doesn't 

really have a food service license, but those are sort of 

grandfathered establishments that have been around for a 

long time. 

          We were advised that it makes sense to keep, "bar"

as definition.  And I think you're right, that it is meant 

to be just those very limited cases where it's an 

establishment that only serves beverages and not -- and 

doesn't provide food service.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay, so then -- like, if I went 

to Cambridge Common the restaurant, and I went to the bar 

within Cambridge Common and I ordered a beer, would that 

mean -- and Cambridge Common made most of its money from 

that, would that qualify -- like, that seems to take it out 

of the definition of a restaurant?   

          Do you see what I'm saying, or --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think it would -- I mean, my 

sense -- and we could look at that a little bit more 

closely.  My sense is that that would fall under the 

definition of, "restaurant" what you're describing, even if 

you can go in and just have an alcoholic beverage, if that's 

what you want.  But the establishment as a land use is one 

that serves both food and beverages.                    

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  I would just reconsider the 

language, given that over the past -- what did Tom say, 250 

days?  there's been a lot of legal language about serving 

food with alcohol.  Like, you know, I tried to order a drink 

59

from a place that also sold me chips and said that it would 

comply with the Governor's orders relating to what can be 

open during the pandemic. 

          So I think as I read this, if I were a restaurant 

owner, I would assume that alcoholic beverages need to be 

served with meals.  And so, I think "served with or without 

meals" would capture.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So yeah, okay.  Next question, so 

the definition of, "dance hall or nightclub" -- and I guess 

so there are many sorts of places that in which people go to 

dance or listen to live or recorded music in which the money 

is made through the sale of alcohol, as opposed to being 

charged a user membership fee.   

          So is this, like, is the distinction here "dance 

hall or nightclub" is defined as, "a place whose principal 

function is to provide live or recorded music and dancing, 

for which patrons are charged a user membership fee."  

          So if you have live or recorded music and dancing 

but you don't charge a user membership fee, does that, like, 

turn you into a restaurant or -- like, what is the thought 

behind the definition?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think the thought is that it's 

60

intended to be an establishment that exists for the purpose 

of providing -- you know, dancing and providing music.  It's 

not intended to be a restaurant that also has kind of one 

night a week of -- you know, salsa dancing.   

          Although it's -- we acknowledge this is a -- this 

is one of the areas where it can be difficult to determine 

sometimes.  We created the rules that I mentioned, we 

devised the rules that say, you know, if you have something 

that's one -- if you have two uses that are sort of 

combined, but one is less than 25 percent of the other, then 

it -- you know, then one kind of gets subsumed within the 

other. 

          But one of the other possibilities is you might 

have an establishment that is both a restaurant and a dance 

hall at the same time, or both a bar and a restaurant at the 

same time.  It would just need to be permitted.  It would 

need to be allowed.  You know, both of those uses would need 

to be allowed in the district in order for it to be able to 

get a permit.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  That --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  But I do -- but I do feel -- I'm 

sorry, I wanted to get back to your -- I got off your point 

61

a little bit.  You're right that there may be instances 

where a use is by all appearances a dance hall or nightclub, 

but based on this definition, there could be a concern about 

if the patrons aren't being directly charged a fee for 

entry, then -- you know, might it fall into some other 

category?   

          And I think that's an excellent point for us to 

look at more closely and see if we need to modify that 

definition to cover that kind of a use.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  Your answer is a good segue 

for another question I have about the 25 percent threshold.  

So as I read the, like, "principal purpose," 

 "principal function" whatever, like, intuitively to me 

that's like 50 percent.  Like, if most of what you're doing 

is restauranting, then that's -- you're a restaurant.  But 

if some of what you're doing is nightclubbing, then you're 

still a restaurant, because your principal function is being 

a restaurant.  

          And so, I'm not entirely -- I don't understand the 

relationship between the use of term, "principal function" 

or "principal purpose" whatever the primary language -- and 

the 25 percent threshold for sort of subsumed uses.   

62

          So in other words, as I read the ordinance as a 

small business owner, if the principal purpose is a 

restaurant, but I also have educational facilities in the 

restaurant too, why am I not a restaurant, because my 

principal function or purpose is restauranting?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's a -- it was a good point.  And 

I think it maybe gets to what I was -- circling around what 

I was saying; that maybe it's something that needs to be 

explored more in the language of the zoning -- whether it's 

in the definitions or in the use provisions about sort of 

what's allowed as a hybrid kind of use. 

          So it's I think -- it seems like the question you 

raised is if, you know, you have -- you know, a use that 

combines two of these functions, but one of them is -- you 

know, more than 25 percent of the area, or more than 25 

percent of the time, but maybe it's more like 45 percent 

then, you know, how does that get regulated?   

          And I believe the way that it typically gets 

regulated is that Inspectional Services will provide a 

permit for the establishment if both of the principal uses 

that are proposed are allowed uses in the district.   

          It's kind of like you're basically proposing two

uses at the same time.  I believe that's how it's treated, 

but it's maybe something that for the sake of clarity should 

be looked at a little bit more closely and maybe spelled out 

a little bit more in the ordinance.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  Because that's very 

counterintuitive, the idea that you could have two principal 

uses in an ordinance like this.  In that respect, I would 

recommend defining, "principal" as, like, more than 25 

percent or something that is not half?  Or thinking through 

how something that has a principal use might also have a 

subsidiary use that could change how it is treated by the 

zoning ordinance. 

          Because intuitively, how I read this is, like, I 

think of if you have a principal function, that's like your 

thing -- your main thing.  And if you have, like, two uses; 

you have a principal and a subsidiary, you don't have two 

principal uses.   

          Going down, I have the same question as Hugh with 

respect to restaurants and the different treatment between 

restaurants and fast-order or quick service food 

establishments.   

          So what is the thought process behind allowing 

64

fast-order food in residential areas by special permit, but 

not restaurants or bars by special permit?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Actually, do you want to -- I'm 

going to -- I've answered a lot of questions.  I might kick 

this one over to Pardis, because it is something that we had 

some conversation about.   

          PARDIS SAFFARI:  Sure.  I think so fast-order 

food, an example of quick service could be, like, a local 

coffee shop.  Whereas a restaurant or bar could be maybe a 

larger scale use that could maybe affect a residential 

neighborhood a little more. 

          We've heard from a lot of neighborhood groups that 

they would love to see more, like, local coffee shops and 

smaller scale service opportunities.  But I have to admit we 

haven't seen a lot of larger scale restaurant bar use, and 

just thinking about the hours of operation for a lot of 

those uses.  It's not -- it doesn't fit well into the 

primary residential use of those districts.   

          And so, that's why we recommended quick service 

fast-order food be allowed in residential neighborhoods, but 

not a restaurant bar.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So I guess I'm confused then.  So,

like, I live in Cambridgeport.  And I know that the 

Cambridgeport Neighborhood Association has been thinking 

about how to get more coffee shops and bars and things in 

what is like an enormous residential district.   

          And I guess I'm confused by if I'm a coffee shop 

owner -- I guess I don't understand the logic here, where 

the definition of, "restaurant" under the new ordinance is 

just serving food and beverages to be consumed on premises, 

using non disposable dishware, glassware, et cetera>?  

          Whereas the fast order food is something not 

defined as a restaurant, whose primary function is service 

on a short waiting time and packaged and presented in a 

manner that it can be readily eaten on or off the premises?   

          So first, is the understanding here that, like, if 

you qualify as a fast order or quick service food 

establishment, you are therefore not a restaurant?  Or can 

you be both a restaurant and a fast order quick service food 

establishment?  Like, if I'm serving people coffee and non-

disposable mugs and they drink it on the premises, what am 

I?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It -- yeah, that's -- this is all 

very -- this is all, this is a conversation that has a

really long history in Cambridge, I guess, I would say.  But 

I think the way you've described it is fairly accurate -- 

that at one point in time, the city through its zoning 

established a definition of fast order food establishment, 

which basically pulls away from restaurants the concept of 

an establishment that's primarily serving food in kind of a 

takeout fashion, I guess you would say.   

          It doesn't necessarily have to be takeout, there 

could be some seating inside.  But if it meets -- again, 

very -- in the current zoning, if it meets very, very 

specific criteria, it is not a restaurant, it's a fast order 

food establishment, and it's regulated under a different set 

of rules. 

          So the approach here is not necessarily to change 

that, although I think there's always discussion floating 

around of whether that distinction should be, you know, done 

away with altogether.  That's not what the petition 

currently proposes.  But it proposes to try to balance the 

definitions out a little bit more.   

          Because right now there's no definition for 

restaurant.  It's just a definition for fast order food.  

And the goal then is also to allow fast order food in some 

67

21

22

more places than it's current allowed, because currently 

it's very restrictive and requires a special permit every 

permit everywhere. 

          So that's the intent of this zoning.  But, you 

know, I think there may -- it sounds based on just the 

comments we've heard, there may be some -- you know, 

discussion or some interest in kind of moving a step beyond 

that and saying how, you know, how can we maybe reconsider 

the distinction between restaurant and fast order food, 

because it is a challenge -- it's a challenging distinction, 

it always has been.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah, I -- so I think that this 

needs to be revised, because it does not have the same 

defaults as the current zoning.  So under current zoning, 

when there's a very clear, if restrictive, definition of 

"fast order" food that you have to qualify in, that it makes 

sense why it would, like, break away from restaurants and be 

put in this new category. 

          But the way that this is written now, "fast order" 

is defined as -- not otherwise defined as a restaurant.  And 

so, the weight of the text requires you not to be a 

restaurant, as opposed to you do fit these other criteria.

22

In other words, I can imagine two different ways in which 

you distinguish restaurants and fast order food.  One is if 

you meet these definitions, you're fast order food, 

regardless of whether if you're a restaurant. 

          And the other is only if you are not a restaurant 

can you be a fast order food that also has these criteria.  

And that's how I read what's currently in the petition.   

          And so, I would think that a fast order food under 

the petition is something that you're not serving people 

mugs that's non disposable, and there is a short waiting 

time, et cetera.  As opposed to the principal function is 

the short waiting time.  So I think you could just get rid 

of the, "not otherwise defined as a restaurant" et cetera.   

          But that also I guess leads to a general comment, 

which is just a tremendous amount of work in the new 

definitions is being put on the term, "principal function."  

And so, I think "principal function" needs to be defined 

because it's doing all of the work here in terms of 

distinguishing what is what, and whether you're a restaurant 

or something else. 

          But regardless, I do -- I do -- I still have the 

same question as to -- I guess this is more of a comment, 

69

but I think that given that restaurants or fast order food 

establishments -- given that fast order food establishments 

if they're going to get set up in a residential area already 

have to go through the special permit process, and 

presumably the special permitting process could destination, 

like, what is the sort of coffee shop you want in your 

neighborhood, and what is the -- like, all-service 

restaurant that's going to overwhelm the neighborhood 

character?  Like, that seems like the reason why you have a 

special permit process. 

          And so, I guess I would just recommend that you 

allow restaurants in residential areas by special permit, 

just like with fast order food. 

          On (sic) the same vein, the definition of whether 

fast order food can be put into a residential area has this 

footnote, Footnote 59.  And the footnote requires among 

other things that the use proposed to occupy a space that 

was originally built for nonresidential use -- that has not 

contained a residential use at any point in the previous two 

years. 

          Why is -- why does that restriction exist?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The purpose of, you know, define

where you have -- you know, predominantly residential uses 

or you have commercial uses.  So I think the -- we're always 

working from the principal that in a residential district it 

-- you know, it's meant mainly to be exclusive to 

residential uses.   

          I think the goal is not to encourage a conversion 

of residential uses to nonresidential uses in residential 

districts.  That would be sort of a -- conceptually a 

different approach; there may be, you know, pros and cons to 

taking that approach, but it would be sort of different from 

what is being contemplated here, which is kind of more about 

preservation of retail than encouraging a conversion of 

residential to retail.              

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  And I guess, like, as a 

comment, I think I would recommend getting rid of that 

restriction and trusting the special permit process to stop 

developers from tearing down housing and putting in retail.  

          Because I think, you know, one of the themes of 

the past two or three years of petitions and applications 

and things that have come up before the Planning Board 

involve a lot of mixed-use, particularly around housing and, 

you know, the construction of new housing generates a need

for small retail like coffee shops.   

          And there's like a lot of places in Cambridge that 

have -- you know, are building a lot more housing, and very 

little retail to serve all of the new housing. 

          And so, I think, you know, if someone wants to 

propose building more housing on top of existing housing and 

ground-floor retail, I think that would be a good thing for 

our neighborhood, you know, at least in some cases.  And I 

would trust that the special permit process could 

distinguish when are those good cases, and when are the 

conversions from housing to non-housing.  That you would 

want to avoid.   

          And so, that just seems like given that there's 

already this discretion built in with the special permit 

process to begin with, trusting that the special permit 

process would prevent the disfavored use would be a better 

strategy than prohibiting the conversion of at least a 

ground floor of a building to retail. 

          My last question, with respect to the table of, 

like, what is permitted where, how does this relate to all 

of the special districts?  Are the special districts 

included in this proposal, or are all the special permit

districts, they just have their own unique definitions that 

this wouldn't apply to?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I'm sort of glad, but not 

that you asked that, because that's sort of been the bane of 

a lot of this effort, is that we have so many special 

districts with so many different ways of regulating uses.  I 

think in many cases, special districts are patterned on 

existing, you know, base -- kind of normal base zoning 

districts.   

          So a lot of our special districts say -- you know, 

this follows the same rules as a Business B districts or a 

Resident C district, except with these specific 

modifications.  And sometimes those modifications have to do 

with retail use.   

          So we've had to go through carefully and figure 

out if we change -- you know, if the Use Table has changed, 

you know, in this way, how does -- because this really talks 

about our were normal base zoning districts.   

          How does that track through to all our special 

districts?  And that's the -- in the maps that we've showed, 

we haven’t mapped every use, we showed, you know, how that 

works out.

          I think some things that are interesting just to 

illustrate some of that point, and I don't think we really 

realized this when we first went through it -- that we 

didn't, so you can see some sort of holes in here in major 

areas -- the Cambridgeport area and kind of near Kendall 

Square where we have extra special zoning districts that are 

not based on any other base districts, but they have 

completely their own set of rules; it's like their own mini 

zoning ordinance just for those zoning districts.   

          And, you know, we could sort of chalk it up to 

make it an oversight that certain uses are just left out of 

that of the list of allowed uses.  But we -- you know, as we 

get -- as we work through this with the City Council, there 

may be some discussion about some of those -- you know, 

missing gaps, where we need to get deeper into the zoning 

ordinance to try to correct those as they apply in special 

districts. 

          There's -- and another point I guess -- I don't 

want to go on too long on this, because it gets very 

esoteric very fast, but in some special districts, it says -

- it follows the rules of an office district, except it 

allows few additional retail uses.  And what we're proposing

to do now is to allow more retail uses in office districts.  

          So in some ways, what we're doing may supersede 

what the special -- what the zoning in those special 

districts was attempting to do when they were originally 

created.  It's a headache.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  It sounds like it.  That's 

all my questions, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted?  Let me 

turn it over to you.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  Well, thanks to Niko for 

going through it with such care.  So my comments mirror a 

lot of his and Tom's and Hugh's, and well let me start out 

with -- you know, the fast food, quick food rationale was 

always classist or elitist.  And, you know, it's really time 

to get rid of it.   

          You know, the city, Harvard Square, has not gone 

into -- you know, rack and ruin because there's a Dunkin 

Donuts or because there's a Chipotles, or because there's an 

Anne's Pizza.  And, you know, the fact that there are 

Starbucks there and all over the city -- it really, you 

know, made no sense when it was adopted, the idea that there 

was going to be litter all over the city because of these

facilities really made no sense. 

          So, you know, there's no sense in continuing it.  

It's time to get rid of it and just treat them like any 

other restaurant. 

          So following up on that, I agree that the 

restaurant bar, dance hall dichotomy really needs to be 

thought through more clearly.  But I think perhaps a quick 

fix is to just get rid of the reference, "served with meals" 

in restaurants, so that if a restaurant, you know, can sell 

food and beverages, it doesn't matter if you just go in and 

sit at the bar and have a glass of wine or have a drink, not 

have to order any food. 

          I am also unclear, are food trucks encompassed 

within the definitions of "food kiosks"?  It's clearly -- 

you know, they proliferate around the city.  Are we viewing 

them as somehow outside of zoning?  You know, if they're 

simply parked in the city street, does that count?  If they 

move into a parking lot, does it become a different type of 

use that, you know, can be or should be regulated?   

          I'm really unclear about that.  You know, cities 

like Portland, Oregon, you know, have huge areas devoted 

just to food trucks, where you can go from one to another to

another.  It's like a huge, outdoor food hall.  And I'm just 

curious of, you know, what the intent is here. 

          I'm curious about, you know, it's a very minor 

point, the map where it talks about the dance halls.  It 

seems to me there's one area -- I think the BB1 zone -- 

where dance halls are prohibited, or dance halls are not 

allowed, but theaters or commercial recreation as-of-right 

with limitations.   

          That's the only place I think on that map where 

that distinction exists.  Otherwise, you know, dance halls 

are either allowed as-of-right or allowed with limitations 

or not allowed.   

          I was just wondering what is so special about that 

district?  You know, it's sort of between Mass Ave and Green 

Street.  I don't quite understand that rationale.   

          Oh, yes.  Also, going back to the footnote 59 

about restaurants, I don't think -- you know it makes the 

special permit limited for five years unless the special 

permit specifies otherwise.  It seems to me it really does 

not take into account the reality of leasing space.  It's 

unlikely somebody's going to take just a five-year lease and 

then go through the difficulty of getting a special permit,

that most leases I think are probably for 10 or later, 

longer periods of time. 

          And it seems to me unclear what rationale there is 

for the BZA to grant some applicants longer than five years?  

It seems to me if you're going to make it somewhat 

discretionary, there has to be some rationale for it.  

Otherwise, I think just the limitation of five years does 

not make sense.   

          We want to promote retail and restaurants as much 

as possible and make their life easy as much as possible, I 

think, and that sone element that I think would make things 

very difficult for them.

          Switching back to home occupation, can we get the 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think we put it on a slide.  

Here, let me -- this is the current definition in zoning --  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right, right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- for home occupation.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And the proposed one, though, 

can you get that up or not?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Oh, you want to look at the changes

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- zoning text?  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  That's fine.  Great.  So 

leaving aside the strange times we're in now, and people 

working from home, it seems to me -- well, a couple things I 

don't understand.  One is, you know, office of 

physician/dentist/attorney/law architect landscape architect 

or another recognized profession, what in the world does 

that mean?   

          And who's going to decide whether something's a 

profession or not?  I would have thought a real estate 

broker would fit in there perfectly, but you've indicated 

that real estate brokers are office use and not retail or 

consumer services, so they're clearly in a different 

category. 

          And then also you go down to studio of an artist -

- performing arts person, graphic designer, photographer or 

similar creative professional -- again, I have no idea what 

that is.  I mean, they all seem to be artistic until you 

talk about graphic designer.   

          It seems to me we have lots of high-tech people 

who are doing work, you know, software or web design or

other things outside of their residences, and that was 

before COVID-19, and presumably will continue. And it seems 

to me they need to fit somewhere into a home occupation and 

not make them all illegal just because they're not currently 

defined. 

          You know, I think it's wonderful that, you know, 

the city has taken on this project of defining things and 

refining things.  I'm a little bit -- you know, dismayed 

that this has not come before us at an earlier point in time 

to get some of these comments.   

          I mean, it's a huge project.  It was daunting to 

even go through it and try to go back and forth to the 

original zoning ordinance and see what changes were made, 

and whether they should be made or not be made.  And to now, 

you know, be at the point well, are we going to make a 

recommendation tonight to the Ordinance Committee, which I 

think is meeting in two days, and then it's going to the 

City Council?   

          And it seemed to me this is ultimately a major 

concern of this Board that it's just being plunked down 

without an opportunity for really well thought-out input 

from us.  Anyway, those are my comments.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Ted.  Before 

I go to folks who've already -- go back to folks who've 

already had a chance to talk, Steve did you want to -- did 

you have questions or comments on this?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I don't have questions.  I do 

have comments.  I do have some general comments, and you 

sometimes reprimand me for getting my general comments 

prematurely.  So this --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  This would be an 

appropriate time to start with those comments.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Okay.  Well, I guess I have 

three general areas of comment.  And the first one I guess I 

want to throw in -- I guess some of my thoughts about the 

fast food.  You know, we've heard some of this implied, but 

I want to build on it.   

          And that is -- you know, our culture has changed 

dramatically, certainly over the last 30, 40 years but even 

over the last few years.  And, you know, the sharp 

distinction between a conventional restaurant and a so-

called fast food restaurant really does no longer reflect 

reality in the current culture. 

          You know, once upon a time, most people ate at

home and occasionally they went out for a meal.  Nowadays, 

it's very common for people to be either ordering in for 

food or running out and picking it up at a nearby 

restaurant, and where they pick up that food might be at a 

full service restaurant, or something less than a full 

service restaurant. 

          I think once upon a time the term, "fast food" 

kind of implied drive-ins also, and we clearly want to 

discourage drive-ins, but that's not really the issue that 

we're dealing with in Cambridge and in this culture any 

longer. 

          So I just think in recognition -- acknowledgment 

of the way our culture has evolved and changed over the 

years, it no longer makes any sense at all to make such a 

sharp distinction between a conventional full-service 

restaurant and a so-called fast food restaurant.   

          Because every restaurant has takeout.  Every 

restaurant has some degree of so-called fast food.  And if 

anything, we should encourage any -- and permit our retail 

to reflect the changes in our culture.  So that's my first 

point.     

          I guess my second point is in general about retail 

82

in the city.  First of all, we have to remember and 

acknowledge that even before the pandemic, we had a 

tremendous amount of retail vacancy in the city.  We 

acknowledged it, we wondered about what, if anything, we 

could do to address this problem.  We didn't really have 

much to do or to say on the subject.  And there were many 

vacancies.   

          Well, the pandemic -- with regard to retail -- as 

with regard to many aspects of our culture, has exacerbated 

many trends in our culture.   

          And when the pandemic is over, we're not going 

back to normal.  We will go back to some variation of 

normal, but it isn't going to be the same.  Which is to say 

that there will continue to be even more pressure on 

retailers, as they struggle and compete with the Internet. 

          And so, given that reality, and that challenge in 

retail in our city, and going on the assumption which I 

have, and I think we have, that in a dynamic, urban 

environment like Cambridge, we want there to be a lot of 

retail.  It contributes to the life and vitality and visual 

interest.  It contributes to the character and appeal of the 

city.

22

          Well, then, we have to acknowledge the changing 

technology, the changing culture, and do everything that we 

can to make it easy -- easy for retailers to open in the 

city.   

          Traditionally, it has not been easy for retailers 

in the city -- certainly in part, because the zoning and the 

permitting was confusing, time-consuming and expensive, and 

the outcomes uncertain to open a retailer in the city. 

          Now, that's not the only factor, because as I said 

it's the culture and the economy that's changing.  But the 

special challenges of opening retail in Cambridge just 

exacerbated that problem.   

          So where is this all going?  You know, we've heard 

a lot of these sort of detailed distinctions between one use 

category and another category, and whenever there is 

uncertainty and ambiguity in our laws, what that means as a 

practical matter is that applicants are going to have to go 

through extensive permitting processes and make arguments 

with uncertain outcomes, and will have to devote time and 

money to go through the process. 

          Well, some of this stuff is unavoidable, but I 

guess what I am advocating as a reflection of that reality 

84

is to make our zoning as simple as possible to avoid, you 

know, all sorts of fine distinctions between different uses 

to sort of anticipate what kind of challenges a retailer 

would have in getting approvals for uses, and just try to 

simplify the whole matter.   

          Because while we aren't concerned about what 

retail use would be here, and what retail use will be there 

-- and we can spend a lot of time sort of distinguishing all 

these fine differences, I think our biggest goal is to 

encourage retailers to locate in the city at a time when we 

are losing retailers left and right. 

          So, bottom line of that -- and my theme is to the 

greatest extent possible -- you know, simplify and clarify 

all of these retail use categories to the greatest extent 

possible.   

          I think we've done that to a significant extent 

here, but I think we can go further and -- you know, that 

distinction between a regular restaurant and a fast food 

that I already mentioned is just a good example of a 

situation where, you know, we could ideally eliminate some 

of these fine distinctions and just make it -- you know, 

simpler and easier for retailers to come in and open in the

city at a time when we need them, and it's been historically 

so difficult for them to come into the city. 

          And my final third point -- a brief one -- on the 

home occupation issue, and in a sense, I'll be making the 

same point, and that is to acknowledge the extent to which 

our culture has changed.  We talked about retail changing 

before, but now I'm talking about the way people work and 

where they work.   

          And again, this is something which we see 

tremendously during the coronavirus.  The crisis is going to 

end, but we're not going back to normal.  Again, it will be 

a new normal. And that normal I think is going to be a lot 

more people working from home, rather than going into their 

office downtown or wherever. 

          And for the most part, that's probably individuals 

working at home themselves on the Internet.  But I can 

readily imagine that it's not always going to be 

individuals; that frequently it might be more than one 

individual.  It may be several working together with their 

computers and their Internet connections at home. 

          And certainly my personal opinion is not only do I 

have to acknowledge that evolution of our culture, but I

don't see any problem or objection to it.  I'm sure if we 

work through this, we can imagine certain criteria that we 

can define that we would say, "No, that's a bit too far, 

that's a problem in a residential neighborhood."   

          But short of those few problem areas that we might 

be able to define, the notion of people -- not just one but 

several people working at home is where the culture has 

gone, where it's going.  I don't see it to be problematic, 

and I think that we should be even more flexible about 

acknowledging that and permitting that evolution of the 

business working culture. 

          So that's it for me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I see a couple 

of hand raises from Board members whom I'm assuming want to 

make further comments.  So I'll go to those next.  If there 

are additional folks who have something more to add from the 

Board, do feel free to hit that "Raise Hand" button. 

          Tom, I will circle back to you.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, I don't have very much more 

to add.  And it's, you know, an attempt to -- I'm a little 

bit with Ted, although I appreciate the rationalization and 

the update of the sections, and this is really good.

          It's a huge thing to hit us with in one evening 

when we have another case to go through I have questions 

about, as Jeff was alluding to.  Some areas don't have any 

retail allowed at all, and there's history behind that, and 

I would like to pick that all apart.   

          But it doesn't seem like this is the forum to do 

that block by block on the map, to try to understand it and 

give perspective and input.  So I applaud the effort, and 

it's long overdue.  And I hope to take the comments tonight 

to heart and bring them to the City Council.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Niko?          

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah, thanks, Ted, for reminding 

me about the home occupation ordinance.  I had questions 

about that too.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  My main question is similar to 

Ted's, which is just why are the four home occupations 

listed -- the four occupations listed?  Are they meant to be 

comprehensive in the sense that other occupations must be 

similar to those four in order to be permitted?  Or are they 

meant to be illustrative?  And in particular I'm curious 

about home day cares.

22

          So under the current ordinance, or under the 

proposed ordinance, would in-home day cares be permitted?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I guess just start with the last 

question, then try to work my way backwards.  I believe home 

child care is a -- is a specific item in zoning that has 

specific kind of use in zoning that has its own regulations.  

It could be that it's regulated under -- they were both 

provisions for child care in the Cambridge zoning ordinance, 

but also state law has some kind of superseding provisions 

around that.   

          And that, I guess, maybe leads to sort of the 

bigger answer to the question, that -- you know, this is the 

balancing act that this is sort of attempting to do.   

          In the case of home occupations, it's really -- 

and this is where, like, when I mentioned before -- you 

know, we could just make sort of targeted amendments to the 

current zoning to try to resolve things that we know are 

issues.  This is an example of really making more a more 

targeted change to the current zoning ordinance to resolve 

something we know is an issue. 

          But it's always ultimately a balance between -- 

you know, when it comes to accessory uses, there is a sort

of more common-law concept that says that the -- you know, 

the zoning enforcement officer in the city, you know, the 

commissioner of buildings or Inspectional Services, can 

exercise some discretion in determining what kind of use is 

an accessory or incidental use?   

          So in many cases, you know, somebody like myself 

at home working during the pandemic -- you know, if someone 

were to call that into question, that might be considered 

incidental, and not necessarily that I'm converting my home 

into a nonresidential use. 

          But at the same time, there are some areas that 

are more sort of ambiguous, or where the City Council at 

different points in time has decided that it was important 

to establish in the zoning ordinance some clear sort of 

rules.   

          And I think this is really intended to lay out 

some specific cases where it's clear -- it's made clear that 

these are considered accessory uses as home occupations. 

          At the same time, by putting that in the zoning 

ordinance, there can be an implication that what's not 

included that might then be considered not to be an allowed 

accessory use as a home occupation.  So it is attempting to

be comprehensive.   

          You know, if you look at the language -- the 

current language that's there talks about a wide range of 

professions, although I agree that another recognized 

profession, as Ted pointed out, is a term that sometimes 

requires some scrutiny, and often internally we have to talk 

about a little bit about what constitutes a profession 

versus something -- some other kind of occupation.   

          But the -- you know, it is -- in terms of 

professionals, it's meant to be fairly expansive.  Massage 

therapists are something that were clearly added with -- you 

know, particular purpose, to make sure that that is 

regulated in a way that the city wanted to regulate at the 

time. 

          And then this is proposing to add some uses that 

may be -- you know, artist studios, may be at one point 

might have been depending on the scenario might be treated 

as incidental accessory uses, just without having anything 

in the zoning ordinance.  But the feeling was it was 

important to make it really clear in the zoning ordinance 

that those are things that we would want to allow as home 

occupations.

          And the retail residential kitchens, as Pardis 

pointed out, there's a very specific item which it was -- 

you know, through some discussion it's been determined that 

our zoning ordinance as it's currently written doesn't 

permit for retail residential kitchens.  And so, there is a 

deliberate purpose to adding that. 

          If there are other uses that have been problematic 

in terms of people wanting to do something but finding that 

zoning regulations or zoning ordinance has been restrictive 

in a way that has been a challenge, then we would look at 

whether that would need to be added. 

          But, you know, these are the uses that are the 

ones that were identified as needing to be spelled out in 

the ordinance.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  So I guess specifically, I 

think in home day cares or child care should be specified as 

a permitted accessory use.  There are many communities that 

outreach ban it.  And I don't believe that Cambridge is one, 

but as I read this, it suggests to me that by including 

these specific provisions like salons for massage 

therapists, that it would exclude things that are not 

identified.

          And I think that that one is particularly -- I 

think in home health care is particularly important.  Or 

ensuring that child care is accessible to everyone, 

particularly given all of that burden on health care with 

respect to the pandemic -- that it's identified.  So I think 

that that specifically should be included.   

          But I think I also secondarily would recommend 

that these four uses be identified as illustrative of the 

broader point, as opposed to specifying the broader point.  

So, like, I think this whole section could be rewritten as, 

like, "Home occupations can be accessory uses, provided that 

the primary petitioner is -- " et cetera, et cetera.  

          And the following -- or, I guess rewritten, I'm 

not going to wordsmith right now, but rewritten so that it's 

clear that the definition of a home occupation is something 

that, you know, satisfies all of these four examples and 

others, and that the examples that are being identified are 

being identified for clarity's sake, and to be specific and 

to remove all ambiguity, as opposed to establishing the 

outer bounds of what counts as a home occupation that can be 

permitted for accessory uses. 

          And I think that that sort of change would not

only dispel some of the concerns that have been raised by 

the other Planning Board members about, like me or anyone 

else who's been working from home for the past severe 

months, but also other in-home uses that may not be quite 

captured by these specific definitions.   

          But regardless, I do think that in-home child care 

should be included as number 5.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any last 

comments from Planning Board members?  All right.  Then I -- 

what I -- to -- let me try to summarize what I'm hearing 

here, which is generally the Board sounds extremely 

supportive of the efforts that the Staff and City Council 

have made here to make retail and home occupations both 

easier to establish in Cambridge and make the rules for 

doing so much clearer. 

          And there are a lot of suggestions -- a lot of 

really good suggestions about ways to go further with that, 

or to approve the language as proposed right now that would 

-- such as improving definitions, choosing one defined term 

rather than using multiple defined terms, adding a couple 

other examples.   

          There are some things that we think need to be

done now, as this advances, and then there are I think 

things that the Board would advocate for, such as removing 

any distinction between fast food and other restaurants that 

may not be embodied in this petition, but we think would be 

kind of the next logical step if -- even if the City Council 

is not ready to take it today, we think it is the next 

logical step in advancing what we generally agree is a good 

direction for the zoning ordinance. 

          And I stop there, and see Board reactions to that 

kind of general summary of where we're at.     

          [Pause] 

          I'm going to take silence as agreement, unless 

people speak up.  So -- Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  No, no, I think you're doing well 

to summarize this discussion in a short paragraph.  No, so I 

think --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  -- we're agreeing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes, I agree with your summary 

that a lot of work has been done, and -- you know, it ought 

to proceed.  But I think we ought to be clear to the City

Council -- because, if we haven't really reviewed retail 

zoning since the'60s --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- I don't want to have the 

city wait another 50 years --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- before it takes up some of 

these issues.  So I think it is incumbent on us to, you 

know, tell the City Council now, you know, "we think there 

are issues that ought to be addressed.   

          And, you know, if you don't address them right 

now, okay.  But this should be on your agenda, and it should 

be on our agendas of something we should do in the very near 

future."  And, you know, at least look at it and see whether 

we think things should be changed --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- and present that to City 

Council, and then, you know, they'll make a decision yes or 

no.  But I don't think it's something that we ought to let 

just, you know, slip through the cracks and not be taken up 

until the next Envision Cambridge, you know --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- when we're all dead and gone 

and whatever.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No, it's a good 

clarification, Ted, that -- you know, we feel pretty 

strongly that, you know, even if they're not ready to take 

the step today, it should be taken with some urgency.   

          Steve?  Steve, you're muted.  Yep, still muted.   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:   Oh, there it goes.  Sorry!  I 

guess I would just like to emphasize once again at least 

from my perspective that I think that the retail uses and 

definitions not only can be clarified, but can be simplified 

--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- because, as I say, retail is 

really under pressure, and I think that the simpler way that 

we can make it be easier -- it will be for retailers to come 

into the city and, frankly, legalities aside; we want to 

encourage retailers to come into this city to the greatest 

extent that we can do so.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess I feel like under not a lot 

of pressure to come to make a decision in the next month or

two.  We're in the middle of an epidemic (sic); people are 

not opening retail businesses.  You know, if we can spend a 

few more months to get this to improve this in the ways that 

my colleagues and I have identified, I think we ought to do 

it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Because I think if we don't do it 

now, it's not going to happen.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So I mean I 

think what I'm hearing back from all of you is that -- while 

my summary may have been accurate in some respects it wasn't 

strong enough, it didn't go far enough. 

          We agree with the aims here, but the -- the 

proposal that's before us falls so short of achieving those 

aims, that we are hesitant to recommend it, for fear that it 

would be thought of as enough, and that we would lose any 

momentum towards actually achieving the goals that it's 

setting out to achieve.  Is that accurate?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes, well said.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Do we want to 

forward that sentiment to the Council, who is going to be 

meeting on this very soon, or do we want to just continue

the hearing and ask Staff to, you know, work with us and 

take all the very detailed comments everybody gave and I 

thought were really excellent suggestions, but come back to 

us with a proposal that takes that next step and goes -- you 

know, further towards achieving the kind of equitable, 

simple, straightforward retail and home occupation 

environment that we'd like Cambridge to be?                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  What is the consequence of 

continuing it?  Like, so if we continued the meeting, would 

the City Council still -- or the Ordinance Committee still 

hear it in two days?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I believe so.  Jeff, 

they still hear it in two days, even if we continue our 

hearing, isn't that correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The Ordinance Committee hearing is 

in two weeks, two days.  But -- so there is some time for 

that.  The way the process works, the Planning Board can 

submit a recommendation to the Council, and the Council 

either has to wait before taking action -- before taking 

final action.  The City Council has to either receive the 

Planning Board's recommendation or wait until 21 days after 

the hearing.

          So, you know, the City Council can always proceed 

as it wants to proceed, but often likes to get some comment 

from the Planning Board.  I think, you know, based on what 

I've heard, it's certainly not unusual for the Planning 

Board to take two rounds with a weighty petition.   

          So I don't think that would be seen as unusual at 

all.  I'll just -- since I've maybe got the floor for a 

second, I do want to react and reflect a little bit -- 

first, that, you know, we -- I think wistfully of the days 

when we used to have a zoning effort like this and we would 

bring it to the Planning Board for informal discussion, 

maybe three, four, five times before it gets submitted as a 

zoning petition. 

          This is something that we really have been working 

on for a long time.  It's been -- it really is a very 

difficult and complicated effort that the Council really 

wanted to -- you know, move more quickly on, and they've 

really, with the Economic Development Committee have really 

been in the driver's seat on this one.   

          And I appreciate that, because it has really 

motivated us to get a lot of work done that's really very 

difficult to do.

          I would make one sort of general comment, that 

there is really two types of changes that we can, you know, 

consider making when we make changes to the zoning 

ordinance.   

          There's, you know, specific changes -- you know, 

where we, you know, we're changing the height of, you know, 

something from -- you know, 45 feet to 55 feet, or we're 

changing, you know, fast order food to -- you know, from a 

special permit use to an allowed use in a particular 

district.  And those are the kinds of changes that we can 

always kind of go back and consider and they can be made 

fairly easily. 

          A lot of the changes that are being proposed here 

are sort of more systemic in nature.  You know, we're trying 

to make sure that every use has a definition which isn't 

currently the case.   

          We're trying to make sure that our Use Table is no 

longer kind of a scattered, kind of series of footnotes that 

are sometimes, you know, lead you down difficult rabbit 

holes, but have a little bit more -- you know, clear 

guidance. 

          You know, we're really trying to improve that at a

systemic level.  And, you know, my expectation is certainly 

that, you know, this is not going to be the end of the 

story.   

          There's definitely going to be more issues that 

come up, and there's going to be more real planning -- you 

know, based considerations around, you know, should we allow 

this type of use in this type of district. And, you know, 

that's going to be informed by a lot of our thinking. 

          And we've put a lot of that into this petition, 

based on the planning work we've done so far.  But I think 

at a higher level, we -- it's very hard to make the systemic 

changes and make the substance changes at the same time.  So 

sometimes we need to look at it as an iterative process.  

And I look forward to continuing to work with the Planning 

Board if you -- you know, hold this and wanted to come back 

with it.   

          I look forward to coming back and talking with you 

about it more.  If you want to submit a recommendation that 

says it needs to be rethought and brought back, you know, 

we'll bring it. 

          Either way, one way or another we're bringing this 

back to the Planning Board to talk about it more in the

future.  And I really appreciate all the comments that 

you've given, and as I agree with you that I wish, you know, 

we could have gotten those comments sooner.  But this is the 

process that we have.    

you want to comment?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Very good.  Ted, did 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  I have a technical 

question and I don't -- a legalistic question, and I 

certainly don't want to get into a battle with City Council.  

But my understanding of the law is that they cannot vote 

until after we've -- the Planning Board has issued a 

recommendation or 21 days have expired from our hearing.   

          So if we were to continue the hearing, is my 

interpretation correct, that they -- the City Council still 

cannot vote until 21 days after our continued hearing?    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That I would need to look into, 

whether the 21 days would elapse from this date or from 

whenever the hearing is continued to.  I will check that 

question.  I don't know the answer.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  I mean, I'm not trying 

to -- you know, put a -- you know, a boot on everything -- 

can't come up with the right phrase.  But, you know, I'm

just trying to figure out yes, I think we agree in principle 

that something needs to be done, but I'm concerned that if 

City Council moves very quickly, that our concerns will not 

get taken up until some very distant future.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We can -- and another point, not 

that that was necessarily directed to me, is that we always 

do -- and those of you who sort of watched the Ordinance 

Committee, who are -- you know -- frequent viewers of that, 

know that we always give the Ordinance Committee an update 

on what the Planning Board discussed at their meeting.   

          So we can certainly convey that the Planning Board 

has some, you know, significant questions that are still -- 

you know, ones the Board things the Board should be 

addressed or resolved more fully before an action's taken on 

this.  Even if the Board doesn't, you know, convey a written 

communication, we can -- you know, we can convey those 

comments.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, I -- Jeff, I 

think that would be my suggestion based on what I'm hearing 

from my fellow Board members here, is that we would like to 

take the time to, you know, submit suggestions and work with 

you to get something together that we could really fully

support and, you know, like I said it's not that the goals -

- everyone seems to agree that the goal here is good.  We 

just, frankly, are afraid that we get one shot at this every 

-- you know, couple of decades.  We want to get it right. 

          So it sounds like the Board would like to continue 

the hearing and see another version of this back before us, 

before making a recommendation.   

          But I do think it's important that our -- the 

purpose behind continuing it be communicated to City Council 

at the Ordinance Committee, so that they -- you know, at 

least understand why they're not getting any formal 

recommendation on this right now. 

          Does that make sense?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm not sure if that question was 

to me?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think it's to 

everyone.  Does that work for other Board members?  And 

Jeff, do you understand what I'm saying, so that it can be 

communicated?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think we can communicate that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  For sure.  And, you know, the

communicate that message.

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you.  So I do want to just 

take a moment to first acknowledge and sort of rue the fact 

that we weren’t before the Planning Board sooner in a more 

conceptual stage with this.  And I think to some degree 

that's on us.   

          To some degree it's just how incredibly busy the 

Planning Board's docket has been, and also how incredibly 

busy Staff had been in trying to get through all of the work 

that's related to all of the special permits and zoning 

petitions that have been before the Board and in Zoning and 

Development's realm particularly.   

          I did want to also note how much I appreciate this 

conversation, because it has been incredible to have had 

this kind of really detailed focus from Board members on the 

text.   

          Because, you know, from the staff perspective, I

think we are probably between CDD Staff and Law Department 

staff and ISD, we have been incredibly focused on this and 

it's very helpful to have that -- this level of detailed 

review from folks who have not been kind of immersed and 

embedded in this for months and months.   

          So that -- you know, the feedback has been very 

valuable, and there will be a number of things that we need 

to consult with both the Law Department and ISD, who has to 

implement this as well. 

          I did want to point out one thing.  I mean, I 

think it's absolutely -- it makes sense for us to come back 

for another hearing.  I do want to caution, though, that 

there is -- even though we are in the midst of the pandemic, 

there are businesses that are opening, wanting to open.   

          We work -- along with our Economic Development 

team and the City Manager's Office -- we work with a Small 

Business Advisory Committee, and this has been one of the -- 

you know, these kinds of changes have been one of the key 

priorities that they have laid out that they want us to 

address, that helps businesses both now and as we start to 

recover from the pandemic, which hopefully is just a few 

months away, not like 10 months away.

          So there's -- while it's not an urgent thing, it's 

that we absolutely don't need to have a decision right now, 

it would be good to keep announcing this.  So we will 

reschedule another discussion, and obviously we will also 

have, I'm sure, feedback from the Ordinance Committee. 

          One other thing I will say is that the kinds of 

conceptual comments that the Board has made in terms of 

really trying to facilitate it and simplify things I think 

is pretty consistent with what we've been hearing from 

Councillors as well.   

          So I think that there will be ultimately alignment 

amongst both bodies in terms of what they are attempting to 

achieve.  So we just look forward to continuing the 

discussion.  Thank you.     

that, Iram.  All right.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thank you for 

          Then based on that, I think I'm looking now for a 

motion to continue the hearing to a future date for further 

discussion.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steve, so moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Ted, second.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  On that motion, Ted Cohen?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  I would 

just want to echo the thanks to the staff.  This is 

obviously a very detailed and well-developed presentation, 

and we really do look forward to -- as fellow Board members 

have noted many times, it's rare that we actually get to 

engage in planning, and that was a particular delight to be

able to do with this conversation.   

          So thank you for all your work on it so far, and 

we look forward to working with you more.     

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Given that we do have 

another hearing, or another agenda item I should say before 

us next, I'm going to give the Board a break until -- let's 

say 9:10 to just stretch your legs, do what you need to do 

and then we'll come right back and get into our next agenda 

item.   

          But, given that we've all been -- you know, glued 

to our monitors for two and a half hours already, I want to 

give folks a quick break.  So we'll be back at 9:10.

construct a 49-unit affordable housing affordable housing 

development at 2072 Massachusetts Avenue with ground-floor 

commercial and residential amenity space. 

          Again, as usual we will start by having Staff 

summarize why it's before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Jeff Roberts from 

Community Development.  Just quickly again, the Board is 

familiar with comprehensive permits.   

          These types of permits are authorized by Chapter 

40B of Massachusetts General Laws, which provides a process 

for affordable housing development to seek relief from 

zoning and other local requirements. 

          So this is a case that will be heard by the Board 

of Zoning Appeal on December 10.  The Planning Board has -- 

can -- the Planning Board reviews this case and can send 

advisory comments to the BZA, and Staff from CDD, Traffic 

and Parking and Public Works met with the applicant to 

discuss the proposal and written materials have been 

provided to the Board.  That's it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  I believe we've heard from the applicant.  We have 

Sean, who --

[2:53:17 audio unclear]  -- by introducing yourself.  Anyone 

from your team who will be speaking -- and the time we're 

starting here, we would appreciate it if you would be as 

concise as possible.     

          SEAN HOPE:  Sure.  Good evening members of the 

Planning Board.  Thank you for having us today.  For the 

record, my name is Sean Hope, and I am -- along with 

codeveloper Jason Korb -- we are the developers of 2072 Mass 

Ave.   

          Tonight presenting will be Jason Forney from 

Bruner/Cott Architects; also Jason Korb from Capstone 

Communities will be making some comments as well.  We also 

do have on the call some of our consultants and 

professionals, if there are some questions the Board has 

that we can't answer. 

          Given the time, I will turn it over to Jason 

Forney to now walk through the plans.     

          JASON FORNEY:  Thank you Sean, and thank you 

members of the Planning Board.  Essentially, this project is 

about the transformation of an underutilized site on a well-

developed part of Mass Avenue from a one-story restaurant 

with an asphalt parking lot around it to a place that will 

become home for 49 families -- much needed affordable 

housing in Cambridge that we think responds to the site, and 

responds to the forward-thinking sustainability, urban 

design and planning objectives of the City of Cambridge.   

          Next, please?   

          I want to just quickly remind you or let you know 

that this is the same development, design and engineering 

team that's responsible for Frost Terrace -- 40 units of 

affordable housing just down the street at 1791 Mass Ave.    

          Next, please?   

          And I will try to be brief.  If I go too fast, we 

can always come back and cover things that you have more 

questions about. 

          At a high level, this is 100 percent affordable in 

perpetuity; 49 units, the majority of which are two and 

three bedrooms.  We are aiming for Passive House 

certification and have included lots of other sustainable 

features like green roof and solar photovoltaics. 

          Around the ground floor, we have provided active 

retail and amenity spaces for the residents.  This being a 

113

site very close to transit, we have three accessible parking 

spaces and two drop-off parking spaces for use of the 

residents -- 51 bicycle parking spaces in compliance with 

the city regulations, an upper level outdoor space for 

residents, which serves several purposes I'll show you 

shortly, and this is a nine-story building along Mass Avenue 

that steps down to a six-story building as it transitions 

into the residential neighborhood.                 

          Next, please?   

          And next? 

          So just a quick orientation.  I'm sure that you're 

all familiar with this site.  It is a quarter mile or so 

from Porter Square, half mile from Davis Square, and nearby 

to several large, open green spaces.  It's a slender site 

about 75 feet wide and 115 feet long, as you can see on the 

right.   

          Next?   

Formerly, before the restaurant was home to the Odd Fellows 

          Building, a four-story building that was 

unfortunately lost in a fire in 1968. 

          Next one? 

          So currently, as I described it, a one-story

restaurant; also a fairly blank party wall of 2050.  

Massachusetts Avenue, which is the Cambridge Housing 

Authority's Russell Apartments. 

          Next?   

          This gives you kind of a sense of the scale of 

this portion of Massachusetts Avenue, which includes the 

building I just talked about, another eight-story building 

further down.  And then on the right of the screen and on 

the next slide, the Henderson Carriage House, which has a 

façade that takes up almost a full block here.   

          It's a really nice façade -- sort of an industrial 

loft-style building, large windows, very rhythmic, very 

repetitive, and it's one of the pieces of context that we 

responded to in our design. 

          Next, we acknowledge that this site does abut a 

residential area, with single and multifamily homes, 

primarily two and three stories, which is reflected in this 

kind of height map on the screen now of the avenue, showing 

the various heights and sort of densities of buildings.  

There's certainly a wider strip along both sides of the 

avenue, and then the grain really changes and it moves back 

to residences on both sides.   

115

          So another way of looking at that from the air, 

and then the next slide kind of lets you into our basic 

concept here, which is this kind of light and airy, light-

colored volume anchoring the corner and lifted up above the 

street to allow for those active retail uses, bringing 

vibrancy to the street. 

          And then on both sides kind of transitioning to 

more neutral volumes that are -- that you'll see.  We'll use 

more residentially scaled materials, as they transition on 

one side to 2050 Mass Ave, and on the other side into the 

neighborhood. 

          Next slide, please? 

          You know, this is a summary of our kind of design 

goals here.  Obviously, high-quality apartment community 

with affordable housing responding to the site, activating 

get street and thinking about a building that favors people, 

pedestrians over vehicles using durable materials and 

traditional materials but in a modern way, that really talks 

about -- shows the evidence of things being put together and 

also relating to the human scale with smaller pieces, lots 

of shade and shadow, and integrating plantings into the 

street and the rooftops.

          Next slide?   

          Thinking deeply about sustainability and the 

components of sustainable design that really resonate with 

affordable housing.  So as I mentioned before, we're 

thinking about energy and carbon by pursuing Passive House.   

          We are favoring bicycles and pedestrians over 

motor vehicles.  We're thinking about resiliency, and then 

we're including a lot of things -- sort of the softer side 

of green design, healthy materials inside the building, 

daylight and views for these units, and then as I mentioned 

before, a really nice, green rooftop space.   

          I'd like to just give you a quick view of the 

building from different places around the site.  So this is 

coming from Arlington looking down Mass Avenue as the avenue 

starts to bend.  That corner is a pretty prom corner. 

          A closer look in the next slide shows the white 

volume on the corner transitioning over to the Russell 

Apartments, and then stepping down six stories, you can see 

the planted rooftop behind fully mature trees there.   

          Next slide?   

          I wanted to take a second to acknowledge that we 

have been working for months with planning staff -- also 

117

members of the community and sort of some large community 

meetings, as well as direct abutters and other groups.   

          And we have made some changes to the proposal that 

was submitted previously, and that we started with an eight-

story building.  That was eight stories all the way through, 

and there's a kind of moment where we collectively realized 

that the height really belonged on the avenue, and that more 

transition in the back would be a good thing.   

          And so, we kind of pushed down on the building 

back -- the back of the building by two stories going from 

eight to six, and then coming up on the front from eight to 

nine.   

          Looking from -- sort of from Porter headed north, 

getting an idea of kind of the repetition, the sort of order 

of that façade that's in conversation with the Henderson 

Carriage House.   

          And next? 

          We're looking now from Walden Street, moving 

towards the avenue.  And here you can see how the building 

steps down.  A variety of plantings in the back.  There's 

some large openings with trellises and vines next to the 

parking area.  There's a small, planted roof down there and

then there's a more heavily planted roof at the sixth story, 

which also helps to screen the upper portions of the 

building from this perspective.   

          And again, just wanted to share with you where we 

started, and where we are now from eight to six stories.   

          Looking more closely at the streetscapes, this is 

the Massachusetts Avenue street front.  In the middle is the 

residential entrance.  In the right is the retail space, and 

on the left is a relocated bus station or bus shelter, I 

should say.   

          And one of our ideas is to behind that have a 

surface for public or community art and members of the 

community have suggested that we work with the Leslie 

College of Art and Design or the Cambridge Arts Council to 

kind of curate that space, which we think would be great. 

          And this is looking at Walden Street.  I want to 

make it clear that this is not a perspective view, this is 

more of a rendered elevation, so that we can get a better 

understanding of the building -- or more of the building 

than just the actual streetscape. 

          Again, from left to right the retail space on the 

corner, the amenity space in the middle, and then the

vehicular entrance in the back with this kind of flared 

wall, one of the things below.  And the flared wall helps us 

provide a safer entrance from that garage. 

          And we'll talk for a second about materials.  The 

cube -- sort of cube on the corner, its primary materials 

would be metal cladding.  And we're thinking either a very 

light-colored zinc or an off-white or light grey panel.   

          But it's important to know that we're thinking of, 

we're planning for the panels to be arranged in a way that 

there are horizontal and vertical seams made up of pieces 

that relate better to the human scale and are in contrast to 

the large window openings that we have in the building.   

          And then as we move around to the two wings, we're 

proposing a more residential material, as with the base of 

six inch exposure clapboard, and then a combination of sort 

of a fish scale or diamond shingle to create a cornice at 

the top.  And then shake panels underneath some of the 

windows to kind of make those openings feel bigger. 

          And at the ground floor, we're using brick and we 

are talking about elongated brick, sort of a Norman shape, a 

brick and a half long, and some interesting detailing with 

sort of a lattice work at the vehicular entrance, and then a 

120

soldier course along the top that goes over some of the 

openings and helps makes a transition from the brick base to 

the clapboard top.   

          Sunshades happen on the back on the south side.  

This does a couple of things.  It helps animate that façade 

with more shade and shadow, but it also blocks out the sun 

and helps toward our energy goals with Passive House by 

blocking the south and west sun. 

          Very quickly, just kind of a map of where those 

materials are.  Again, the metal -- the cube is metal.  The 

base is brick.  We also have -- if you go to the next slide 

-- an idea of kind of responding to expressing a depth of 

wall by projecting out the window frames with a metal 

surround, and then also pairing each window with a wood-

grained panel that will provide some warmth to the façade. 

          We can go one more. 

          On sort of the rear piece -- again, a fish scale 

pattern at the top to create a cornice, a drop shingle panel 

and a lighter color underneath each window, and then a 

perforated sunshade around.  And we consider the green roofs 

and plantings.  Every bit of material has all of these 

others.

          So this is just a closer look at that assembly -- 

windows on the south and west sides. 

          I wanted to share with you quickly a couple of 

precedents.  These are buildings on the west coast in Oregon 

and San Francisco.  They are also affordable housing using 

similar materials of similar size and scale. 

          So we'll go one more, please?  The ground floor 

plan is really important for this project, and we've spent 

quite a bit of time making some what I think are responsive 

urban design moves.   

          So first of all, making a good place for the bus 

stop on Mass Avenue, locating the residential entrance on 

Massachusetts Avenue, we began by locating it on Walden, but 

came to learn quickly that Mass Avenue with a much better 

place for it if we're encouraging car-free living and people 

to be active on parts of that streetscape. 

          The retail also comes in from Mass Avenue, and 

then again vehicular entrance for the five parking spaces, 

and we've worked with Traffic and Parking Department to 

follow the guidelines for safety of vehicles for entering 

and exiting so that they can see a person in the middle of 

the sidewalk 20 feet away in both directions.

          Perhaps the most -- the biggest change, even 

though it seems small in this drawing, is that we've been 

working with the city so that the project can enable a 

widening of Walden Street.  Walden Street was formerly a 

two-lane road, and was at some point changed to a three-lane 

road, which resulted in undersized travel lanes.   

          And so, we're proposing to widen Walden Street by 

a couple of feet, which will make for three adequately 

sized, 10-foot travel lanes.   

          That also leaves us -- we're pushing the ground 

floor of the building back away from the property line, to 

make about a 7-foot-2 sidewalk, part of which is under the 

overhang of the floating cube, and will require an easement 

for part of this development to give back to the city for 

sidewalk traffic.   

          Okay. A section through that street…  the main 

take away here is really to give you a sense of what that 

feels like at the street level going from two tight, 8-foot-

4 lanes to three proper 10-foot lanes, and then the width of 

the sidewalk and the width of the overhang to see how they 

relate.  Again, the bottom of the overhang is a good 13 feet 

above the sidewalk to make good retail space on the ground

floor. 

mechanical equipment. 

          Basement is primarily for bike parking and 

          And then the typical floors above, three-bedroom 

units on the corners, two-bedroom units kind of in the 

middle, and then two one-beds looking out over the avenue, 

and the building stacks all the way up, so each floor is the 

same. 

          And until you get to the seventh floor, which is 

the next slide, and you see the Terrace and resident amenity 

space here.  And our design strategy is to build kind of a 

thick ring around the space that's heavily planted and not 

accessible for people, and then to have a well-protected 

outdoor space with perhaps a screen wall, and maybe even an 

overhead net or something to just make it very safe for the 

people who are up there. 

          Moving up to the roof proper, the mechanical 

equipment is all located at the center of the Hive Building.  

There's a small enclosed room up there.  The parapet of the 

white cube is about three and a half or four feet, so in all 

the renderings that you've seen the equipment was shown, and 

is pretty well screened.

          Elevations -- just, I won't say much about these, 

just to give you a chance to look at them.  This is the 

north.  You kind of get the idea of the slenderness of the 

siting of the building.  The next is from the west, showing 

the stepdown towards the neighborhood.   

          And the south -- again, showing the parking area 

below, a green planted roof, a couple -- five stories of 

residential and then the rooftop amenity space. 

          And then the last elevation is the east, which is 

partially obscured by the CHA building. 

          And the last thing I have for you here is a series 

of shadow studies.  The site -- the orientation, this is a 

part of the avenue where it bends to be more east-west than 

north-south.   

          And the result of that is most of the shadows from 

the site are being cast out onto Mass Avenue, and most of 

them, they're joining other shadows.  Our convention here is 

that the magenta color are the net new shadows.  So this is 

the winter at 9, 12 and 3. 

          Next page is the summer.   

          And the final is the equinox -- you know, 

beginning casting over to the west in the morning coming out

onto the avenue in the afternoon, joining the other shadows. 

          And so, I want to turn it back over to Sean to 

talk a little bit about some of the process and some changes 

that we've made along the way.   

          SEAN HOPE:  Thank you, Jason.  And actually, I'm 

going to turn it over to Jason Korb to finish us off before 

we go to [3:13:54 indiscernible]. Thank you.    

          JASON KORB:  Thanks. I'd like to talk about this 

for one minute, and then just talk about affordable housing 

in general for one minute.   

          So I think we've had quite a robust community 

process.  We've had two large community meetings, that we've 

advertised as best as we can.  We flyered the neighborhood 

for the first one, we've posted on various LISTSERVs -- 

everything we can do while also being safe during the 

pandemic I think we've done. 

          We've been available by e-mail, by private Zooms, 

by phone calls.  And I think even the opposition who I know 

people here that are well-intentioned will be speaking in 

opposition.   

          I think the one thing we can all agree on is that 

we've had quite a robust public process.  We've made

ourselves available at any time, practically, to answer 

questions and to listen to concerns and try to integrate the 

feedback that we're hearing, that we were hearing. 

          We also have a website, 2072massaveapts.com, where 

people are free to make any comments they'd like, and we've 

responded to all of those comments. 

          There's FAQs -- every time we update plans, we 

post them there, people can sign up for project updates.  

Any time the project updates get posted; they get an 

immediate e-mail on that. 

          So we've really and sincerely tried as best we can 

to reach out to the community, to listen to the community 

and do our best to incorporate their feedback.   

          And so, this is a list.  I'm not going to go 

through every so often of them, I think Jason touched on 

most of them.   

          I think the big ones are stepping down the 

building at the rear, where it faces -- where it hits on 

Walden Street; widening Walden Street, which -- you know, I 

think it's important to point out that the restaurant pre-

COVID actually generated -- and this is from the Traffic and 

Parking Department -- more cars than what our development

will actually be generating.  I believe that's in their 

letter.   

          But despite that, we're actually offering to 

improve Walden Street by basically giving a portion of our 

land to the public way in the form of an easement, which is 

the only opportunity that Walden Street will ever have to be 

widened.  There's no other land where it can be widened 

from.  And that's something that we think will be a huge 

benefit to the community overall, that far surpasses our 

project. 

          So I think those are some of the major, major 

changes.  Also moving the residential entrance to Mass Ave.  

We heard a lot of concerns about from people that we don't 

want cars parking -- you know, double parking on Walden 

Street; Ubers, Lyfts, Amazon package deliveries, things like 

that, and so, we did move the residential entrance over to 

Mass Ave as well. 

doing. 

          And then we have a series of TDM measures that I 

think are pretty consistent with what others have been 

          And then I just want to mention kind of the demand 

for affordable housing now.  And I think we all can agree

that the demand is pretty off the charts.  It was off the 

charts prior to COVID, and since COVID it's become 

incredibly more severe.   

          The Joint Center for Harvard Studies, the Joint 

Center for Housing Studies from Harvard just put out their 

State of the Nation's Housing report just recently, I think 

it was in the last week or two.  It talks about just how 

dire the situation is, and I don't want to go into all the 

stats, but roughly one in five renters earning less than 

$25,000 said that they were behind on rent.  I think that 

number is probably more. 

          So people are really struggling right now.  We are 

-- as Jason alluded to, we have Frost Terrace down the 

street.  It's starting its lease up process, and we just 

started taking applications.  We've sent out over 400 

applications.  We have an info session coming up on Thursday 

night, where -- this is not, it's not a mandatory info 

session, you can apply without joining the info session.  We 

have 159 people registered for that this Thursday night; we 

have 50 registered for Sunday. 

          The CHA has over 20,000 unique applications on 

their waitlists.  Over 7000 are Cambridge residents who are

veterans.  And the Finch, which is a project that you know, 

was just recently finished by HRI, they had 2261 applicants 

for 98 apartments.   

          So the situation is pretty dire right now.  It's 

been dire for a long time, and it's even worse.  And so, I 

think it's important to view this building in that context 

as well.  So just to let you know both sides.     

          Thank you for your time and for listening to us.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  

Steve, did you have a question I see you have your hand 

raised.   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah.  Are we starting with 

questions?  I guess it's just questions at this point, so I 

won't say anything about how much like the design.  But I do 

have a question about the parking.  There will be something 

on the order of probably 100 adults, I imagine, living in 

this building, and I'm wondering what are your assumptions? 

Are you assuming that none of these 100 adults are going to 

own a car?  Or are you assuming that they will be parking 

their cars in the neighborhood?   

          JASON KORB:  That's a great question.  By the way, 

if at any time my voice gets altered, my computer has been

acting really weirdly lately.  So I just want to put that 

out there. 

          So we estimate -- and by a "we" we mean we hired 

Vanasse & Associates, parking consultants, traffic engineers 

-- and they did a parking study that estimated that we'll 

have about 25 vehicles.  So we will absolutely generate 

vehicles.  There's no question about that.   

          They did do a parking study.  They surveyed the -- 

within a quarter of a mile of the site of all the streets, 

and they looked at -- I think it was 10:00 a.m.; this was on 

a typical Tuesday, so not, like, a holiday or anything like 

that. 

          It was like 10 a.m. and -- I'm making up these 

times a little bit -- it's like 10:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., all 

the way through 10 p.m., right?  So a 12-hour period.  In 

the inventory over 900 total spaces, and out of that at the 

peak time I believe there were 281.  So the peak usage time, 

where there were the fewest available spaces on the street, 

there were still 281 parking spaces available. 

          Now that being said, we have to acknowledge it's 

COVID, and we really don't know what COVID's done, right?  

Some people are saying people have left the city, and 

131

there's going to be a lot more parking here than, you know, 

there would be pre-COVID.  Their businesses aren't open, 

right?  And that's certainly a valid point.   

          Others say people are working from home and 

everybody's home all the time and their cars are on the 

street.  So I can definitely see it both ways.  We're not in 

any way trying to pull a fast one, though.  We were asked to 

put together this traffic study, parking study, and COVID 

wasn't ending any time soon and hopefully it's ending 

relatively soon.  But the theory was that any data is better 

than no data.   

          So I think, you know, that’s the data that we 

have.  Unfortunately, we haven't been able to find any pre-

COVID data.  So that is currently the data that we have.  

And we know that affordable housing tends to have fewer cars 

than ordinary housing, primarily because it's expensive to 

own a car in Massachusetts.  You know, the registration fees 

alone and insurance are -- especially insurance is pretty 

high. 

on.     

          So that's kind of the data that we're basing it

something for further discussion when we get to that part of 

the hearing.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  All right.  

So, as I previously noted, this actually is not a public 

hearing, but the Board may take public comment at our 

discretion.  Do Board members want to take public comment on 

this matter, or in any way change how we might ordinarily 

hear from the public on this?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  You know, this is Steve.  Again, 

it's late and on the one hand, you know, we wouldn't like to 

be spending hours, but on the other hand, not to give the 

public the opportunity to comment on this important subject 

just doesn't seem like the right thing for us and for the 

city to do.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, we could take 

public comment, but have a more limited -- given that our 

action tonight is just to make a recommendation to the BZA 

will have a public hearing on it, we could take public 

comment and have it be a more limited -- time limited than 

we would on something on which we were going to take action.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, that makes sense.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think we should try to limit 

comments to the urban design questions, and try to avoid 

lots of comments about traffic and -- because clearly that's 

a big issue for people because of the comments that have 

been sent to us.  But it's not really our expertise.   

          The Zoning Board's going to have to rely on the 

Traffic and Parking Department to give them an appreciation 

of what the facts are and how they should make their 

decision.  I think that might -- you could ask people to 

really talk about the bulk of the building, the 

architectural design, that would be more hopeful to what we 

have to do.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, did you want to 

make a comment on this process issue?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I certainly think we 

ought to take some public comment and yes, it can be 

limited.  I note that in several of the e-mails we've 

received from the public, there was a suggestion that one of 

two people could speak on behalf of a large number, or a 

large number of the members of the public.  And I wonder if 

that's been followed up at all, and whether we could hear

from a limited number of people, but give them more time to 

speak individually.  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I don't know that 

anyone has coordinated with staff on making such a request.  

But we could conceivably do so on the fly.   

          I'm going to suggest that rather than three 

minutes, that we go with the two-minute time limit, and do 

ask that members of the public try to focus their comments 

on the urban design matters, although we've certainly seen 

in written comments lots of things about the Traffic and 

Parking concerns.  And if folks want to use their time to 

talk about those, they're certainly allowed to. 

          But I do agree with Hugh that the most 

constructive expertise that we can offer the BZA as they 

make their decision tends to be around the urban design and 

public realm aspects of this. 

          Does that -- is the Board okay with proceeding 

like that?  I'm seeing general agreement.  All right.  Then, 

so any members of the public who do wish to speak should now 

click the button that says, "Raise hand."  Or if you're 

calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          We did receive many written comments.  I'm just

going to rattle off the names of folks who have sent us in 

comments already that we have had a chance to review.  These 

were all received before 5:00 p.m. yesterday.   

          We received communications from Fang and Le Shen, 

A.M. Kubilius, Dana Schaefer, Mary J. Stroud, Young Kim, 

Merry White, Susan Frankle and John Uzzolino, Aleida Inglis, 

Seymour Kellerman, Costanza Eggers, James Williamson, 

Margaret B. Rueter, Nathaniel Smith, Nancy E. Phillips, 

Annmarie Flynn, Larry Field and Cheryl Suchors, Mariette 

Murphy, Grace Nauman, Kay Hurley, and Stephen Bardige, Lisa 

Dreier, Jean Hermann, Ashley G. Pittman, and Cyrus Dochow, 

on behalf of the 5 Walden Street Condominium Association.  

So we have certainly received more communication since 5:00 

p.m. yesterday.  This will all be entered into the record.  

          All right.  So now I'll ask Staff to unmute 

speakers one at a time.  Again, begin by saying your name 

and address, Staff will confirm that we can hear you, and 

after that we would ask you to speak for up to two minutes 

before I ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  This is Jeff Roberts, 

Community Development.  I'll just work the unmuting and I 

apologize if I mispronounce anyone's name as it's displayed

on Zoom.  The first speaker -- and I'll give additional 

speakers -- the first speaker is Margaret Rueter, followed 

by Stacy Thompson. Margaret Rueter, you can start by giving 

your name and address. 

          MARGARET RUETER:  Okay.  My name is actually 

Margaret Rueter, and I live next door in the Russell 

Building, and I'm hoping to beg your indulgence, Madam Chair 

and Board members to be allowed a little more time, because 

I'm speaking tonight for the entirety of the Russell 

community, which is the direct abutter to this plan.   

          So I hope that you will allow that.  I -- rather 

than read from my prepared statement, I'm going to try and 

be more concise.   

          What I want to say to you is that this population 

feels very vulnerable to speak out to you tonight.  We're 

tenants of the Cambridge Housing Authority, and we are 

collectively pretty afraid we're going to lose the quality 

of life we have as seniors next door to this new proposed 

building.   

          The new community as planned is actually planning 

for three times the population of our own building, just 

feet from where we are.  The concern is the very small

footprint, the very, very large scale, and one that is 

literally feet from us.  And there are implications on the 

front, and there are different implications for our rear.  

          The one thing I really wanted to address before I 

mention a couple of our concerns is really to have people 

understand that this is an elderly community.  The woman 

across the hall from me is going to be turning 102 in a 

couple of more months.  Our needs as an elderly and disabled 

community are really quite distinct.   

          And as a group, we are all kind of slowing down.  

We have people here in this building who can't leave their 

apartments for health reasons.  Many, many of the residents 

here have daily health aides come in and out of the 

building.   

          And as most of us know, as people get elderly, one 

of the things they enjoy is quiet, routine.  I'm embarrassed 

to say I spend half my time in my pajamas, and I know that 

that is true --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ms. Rueter?     

          MARGARET RUETER:  Yep.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I just want to 

interrupt you.  I'm happy to let you have some more time, 

138

but it would be great if you could focus on what about this 

project specifically --    

          MARGARET RUETER:  Okay.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- you want us to 

address.     

          MARGARET RUETER:  Thank you.  I will jump to that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.     

          MARGARET RUETER:  I wanted to give the flavor of 

us as seniors to consider those things.  This new proposed 

building -- first of all, I have to say we residents -- 

every so often of us lived in affordable housing, and we 

understand ourselves the urgency in our city.  However, this 

building is going to engulf us.   

          On the rear side of the building are, rather than 

look out to open space, the rear anchor building is now 

going to sort of be perpendicular to face us.  Our windows 

are going to -- we're going to be able to see the windows 

from the end of our building.   

          We're very, very concerned about the noise.  It's 

just a very different elderly population.  We're shutting 

down, and of course the kind of population that'll be next 

door lives 24 hours a day, very much unlike us.  It can't

help but share the noise of the neighborhood with this 

change.   

open. 

          And even the lovely green rooftop that is being 

proposed is a worry to us.  It means kids and people are out 

there talking on floors above us, while we have our windows 

          So the building is going to cast shadow into our 

very small one and only outdoor space, which is just over 

the fence side of the rear building.  It's going to cast 

shadow.  We're going to have less sun.  We use that place to 

go outside, enjoy the sun and quiet, we garden out there.  

All of these things are real worries. 

          And one thing I just want to say to you is I've 

worked on canvassing the building.  We've had very little 

communication -- almost none -- from the Cambridge Housing 

Authority, some with the developer.   

          But this community, what is first expressed to me 

is, "My God, we've just moved back into this building.  Are 

we going to have to move out again, either parttime while 

the construction goes on or permanently?  Because our senior 

environment of quiet and not so much noise is going to 

change and not leave us with a living experience that’s

conducive to the age of this population?   

          And last of all, I want to say to the front of the 

building, the concern is the building -- you know, the 

building itself I have no comment on, really.  It has to do 

with the context.  And the context is everything for us next 

door.   

          There's a very short distance between the corner 

of Walden Street and the entrance to our building and the 

Senior Center next door.  And our population is out there 

walking, using the bus shelter.  We have people on mobile 

scooters going over to Star Market to get their groceries.  

We are out on the sidewalks, and this is a very large 

population to bring into this area. 

          And I'm going to try to be quick here.  One of the 

probably most major concerns for myself is the safety. And 

the -- you know, we seniors don't have quite the reaction 

time that we did when we were younger.  And one of the very 

unsafe things that is right now -- and I wish you all could 

come over and look at -- is that, as I said the distance 

between the light and our entrance is short.   

          And as drivers, when we come through the light, 

whichever way we're coming, whether Walden or Mass Ave, when 

141

the light changes, we are having to look for people behind 

us who are speeding up to get to the next light, we are 

trying to -- we are actually having I think less than 200 

feet to slow down, mark that we're turning right, look for 

bicyclists beside us, runners on the sidewalk, congestion in 

front of us, vehicles picking up and dropping off and trying 

to make this turn. 

          And I'm not kidding when I say every single car in 

our parking lot is dented.  This isn't a bunch of great 

drivers.  And the thought of more vehicles being in front of 

Mass Ave, which is inevitably going to happen for quick 

drop-offs, it's dangerous for us. 

          And I think what we really feel as neighbors, or 

as residents of affordable housing is that with what -- with 

one hand we giveth, and with one hand we taketh away.  And 

we feel that should things go forward as planned, that the 

city which prides itself so on how they care for our seniors 

is not listening to our voice of how we enjoy and what we 

need as a community. 

          Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.

Stacy Thompson, who's followed by Lisa Dreier.     

          STACY THOMPSON:  Yeah Hi.  Thank you so much for 

the time, and I'm going to work to be brief tonight.  I'm 

Stacy Thompson, the Executive Director of Livable Streets 

Alliance.   

          For those of you on the Board who don't know who 

we are, we are a Cambridge-based non-profit that focuses on 

the issues of transportation, green space and housing.   

          I am coming tonight to express our strong support 

for the proposed 100 percent affordable housing development.  

For context, we comment on development projects across the 

region of all shapes and sizes -- and I will speak candidly 

that in my career -- it is very rare to find this mix of 

entirely afford units that are right next to sustainable 

transit, that have done a tremendous amount of work to think 

about the transportation implications, and are also seeking 

really great green -- sort of green uses. 

          So I would just -- I would note from a design 

perspective that this is unique within the region, and while 

there may be tweaks, and I understand there are concerns, I 

think much of this design should be celebrated, particularly 

the focus on family housing.  I -- you know, when I see

affordable units on two or three, is of freak out in joy.  

That's a very big deal, it's very hard to find.  So, you 

know, I think that's important. 

          Obviously, the bike park space, widening of the 

sidewalks on Walden Street, I don't -- I can get into that.  

I'm happy to talk to anyone about those elements and why 

they're positive. 

          But, you know, one thing that I would point 

members of the public and members of the Board to is the 

Metropolitan Area of Planning Council's recent report 

called, "Perfect Fit."  They went into more than 200 

residential buildings across the region to look at their 

parking utilization, and found that even during peak periods 

three in 10 parking spaces were entirely empty.  We're 

massively overbuilding parking.   

          And what that means is that we often find 

communities that are really fighting saying, "We're scared 

about congestion, we're scared about parking on our streets, 

put more parking into the building." And what that does is 

every three parking spaces you build into a building you 

take an affordable unit away. 

          And so, what we would say tonight is really 

144

consider, we would say really prioritize the affordability, 

and that we as experts in our field think that the 

transportation work that they have done is appropriate, and 

support the approach that they are taking.  Thank you so 

much for the time.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Lisa Dreier, followed by Christopher Schmidt.   

          LISA DREIER:  Thank you.  Can you hear me?    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  And please give your name and 

address.   

          LISA DREIER:  Lisa Dreier on Cogswell Avenue.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.   

          LISA DREIER:  Chairperson Connolly and members of 

the Planning Board, thanks for the opportunity to comment.  

I'm a Cambridge native and a homeowner on Cogswell Avenue, 

which is one block away from the proposed building site.  

I'm one of two people speaking this evening on behalf of 

North Walden Neighbors, which is a 75 and growing residence 

in the immediate area who have concerns about this proposed 

project. 

          North Walden Neighbors strongly supports the 

expansion of affordable housing in our neighborhood.  Our

concerns are with the current proposed design.  We believe 

the current design is significantly oversized and overly 

dense for the local context.   

          The Mass Ave Corridor north of Porter Square is 

home to a highly diverse array of buildings, including 

historic landmarks and modern construction, modestly sized 

commercial and apartment buildings ranging from one to six 

stories, residential neighbors.  There's one eight-story 

building and one nine-story building north of the site.   

          The project developers feel that their design fits 

the context of the area based on those rare eight and nine-

story cases.  However, they have failed to take into context 

the context of the neighborhood that surrounds this 

building, including the historic Henderson Carriage 

Building, five stories; Russell Apartments, six stories; the 

historic retail shops on the north side, one story; as well 

as residential neighbors behind it. 

          There are numerous examples of affordable housing 

in the neighborhood which are more appropriately designed 

with less density, more green space, more lot size, and a 

higher quality of life for residents, including Frost 

Terrace, which is designed by this same team presenting to

you tonight. 

          We can do better in providing well-designed, 

affordable housing in our neighborhood.  We request that to 

the Planning Board recommend the completion of a project 

design review, including a full traffic study and a full 

context study to more appropriately evaluate and consider 

and improve this proposal. 

          Thank you very much for your time.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Christopher Schmidt, followed by Mitzi Fennel.    

          CHRISTOPHER SCHMIDT:  Thank you.  Christopher 

Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street.  I love this building.  My only 

complaint, as it always is is, you know, we're giving up 

opportunities to create more homes than we might otherwise 

buy, by some of the choices that we're making.   

          I appreciate the developers have stuck true to the 

idea of this being a 49-unit building.  I understand that 

there are, you know, many in the community who feel this is 

out of scale, out of size, out of whatever.  I just can't 

understand that.  Yes, it is true that it is taller than 

nearby buildings in parts of Cambridge.  It's a building on 

Mass Ave a couple of blocks from a T stop.  If we're not

going to build tall buildings here, I really don't think 

that we will be able to house the people in Cambridge who 

need affordable housing, and I really think that that's 

important. 

          I really appreciate the green roof that's being 

created.  I think that creating those types of spaces where 

we do have limited green space in the community is really 

important.  I think that they've done an excellent job at 

attempting to create a combination of retail and amenity 

spaces.   

          I think that overall, again, this is just a really 

compelling building across the board, so I really appreciate 

the work that's been done by the developers.  I appreciate 

the thought that always goes into these decisions by the 

Planning Board and by others, and I'm sure that you will 

apply your expertise in the way that is appropriate.   

          But as a community member, as someone who has been 

staring at that -- you know, former KFC and now Kabob space 

for years, and thinking that maybe this isn't the best use 

of land in this position, I really think that the developers 

have done a great job, and I appreciate the work that's gone 

into it.  Thanks.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Mitzi Fennell, followed by Matthew Goldstein.   

          MITZI FENNEL:  Hi, this is Mitzi Fennel.  I live 

at 37 Creighton Street.  Creighton Street is the next street 

closer to Porter Square from the proposed building.  And we 

are concerned about the impact that the building is going to 

have on parking.   

          I realize that it's not in the purview of this 

committee to consider parking as a standalone issue, but we 

are requesting that the city not waive fully the parking 

requirement; that it keep at least a half a space per unit.  

And that is the estimate that the developers are giving as 

how much -- how many cars will come into the neighborhood. 

          And the reason why this is relevant to this 

committee is that we believe that the building design can be 

modified to accommodate parking, and we're specifically 

asking or stating that we would support waiving the retail 

space requirement.  We do not need additional retail space 

in this area; we have more than sufficient retail.  However, 

parking is a real quality of life issue for us.   

          And I just wanted to give you the context of 

Creighton Street, which is going to be the first street that 

149

13

16

17

18

20

21

22

anyone who lives in that building is going to try parking 

on, because of just the way the configuration of the streets 

lay out. 

          And Creighton Street's just a dead-end street, and 

we've always had challenges parking.  We did our own parking 

space study that showed frequent instances of no spaces 

being available, and we have a history of not being able to 

find parking when coming home at the end of the day. We 

actually had different counts from the parking study that to 

the developers use.   

          So we realize that the city's ruling towards 

deprioritizing cars, but this really is a quality of life 

issue for us.  It is the major quality of life for many of 

our residents who are older, or families with young children 

to not be able to park on the block in which we live, or to 

have to travel around in circles looking for parking is 

going to be a major impact on the quality of life.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.   

          MITZI FENNEL:  And also, --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, I thought 

you were finished.   

          MITZI FENNEL:  No, that's okay.  I just said my

time's up so I will stop talking.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay, thank you.  I apologize.  The 

next speaker is Matthew Goldstein, followed by Norma Wassel.  

          MATT GOLDSTEIN:  Hi, I'm Matt Goldstein, 52 

Clarendon Avenue.  I've lived in North Cambridge for about 

20 years.  We rent an apartment off of Rindge, and we now 

have a house off of Mass Ave near the proposed development. 

          I'd like to state my strong support for the 

project.  It's a beautiful, site-appropriate development 

that would be a vibrant addition to the sometimes frankly 

dreary weekly along Mass Ave between Porter and the 

Arlington town line.   

          You know, it's a bicycle and bus corridor, very 

walkable of course where a T station -- and it seems like 

exactly the place we want to put density.  And even better 

that it's 100 percent affordable.   

          So we live right now directly across the street 

from the Daniel Burns Apartments, which is a 200 rental unit 

affordable housing complex for seniors that’s about a mile 

from this project.   

          We appreciate the density, which that building 

affords so many.  It affords so many the opportunity to be

able to stay in Cambridge -- senior residents, many of whom 

grew up around here who otherwise could not afford to live 

here. 

          We also note that most of the residents in the 

Burns Complex use the 77 to get around.  There's very little 

parking for the residents on site.  But nevertheless, our 

neighborhood has plenty of street parking and a normal 

amount of traffic.   

          So again, I just want to state our strong support 

for this project.  We're far more concerned about making 

good on our commitment to giving low-income families and 

opportunity to live in this city and attend our excellent 

schools.  So thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Norma Wasell, followed by Luis Mejias.   

          NORMA WASSEL:  Hi, my name is Norma Wassel.  I 

live at 175 Richdale Avenue, around the corner from Walden 

Street.  I don't own a car and I'm a biker and take the 77 

bus, so I'm on that corner a lot.  And I feel the design 

really improves the visibility, and the other plans actually 

I feel for someone who's a pedestrian makes it actually 

safer.

          I also recognize that there is some concern, 

particularly from the seniors next door, and I hope that 

there can be a reputable management company who is very 

familiar with housing in one building that mixes senior and 

families.   

          There are a number of prototypes to help address 

those issues around people's life-year spectrum.  And I have 

seen seniors benefit from that mixture of ages.  It actually 

has increased their quality of life. 

          But the issues that people raise is valid.  I 

really like the approach to sunlight; the environmental 

prototype is offers.   

          I'm also a social worker and there is a crisis for 

our families in Cambridge.  It's hidden and not as seen, but 

I just feel this design offers a lot of things that will 

support people, and really feel it will -- the design really 

speaks to what can be done to conserve energy, yet offer a 

pleasant place to live. 

          And I also would like to hear of the concerns 

people addressed, which I'm hearing how we might find 

answers from you as to how the concerns were being met by 

people.  But there's a process for that.  Thank you.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Luis Mejias -- I apologize for the pronunciation.  It's 

followed by Young Kim.   

          LUIS MEJIA:  Hi, good evening.  You did okay 

there.  My name is Luis Mejias, and I live in Wellington- 

Harrington, but my mother, who requires the use of a 

wheelchair, lives at 5 Temple Street, and she is a CHA 

resident. 

          I applaud this project.  This is exactly the type 

of project that should move through the approval process 

expeditiously.  The project is 100 percent affordable, near 

significant mass transit, and includes little parking.  So 

its impact on traffic will be minimal by discouraging car 

ownership. 

          Second, I want to stress that having very little 

onsite parking is actually a plus.  I'm very familiar with 5 

Temple, also near the Red Line, and often see few cars 

parked in the parking spaces on the ground floor.  I wish 

those spaces were homes for people, not imaginary cars.   

          I just want to say if you make it hard to park 

cars, people won't want cars.  Let's raise the price of 

residential permits if we're concerned about spaces on the

street, not make it easier and more convenient to have them, 

and then complain about traffic and parking. 

          I implore the Board and those reviewing this 

project to reject any attempt to reduce the size or scope of 

the project.  We need every single afford home we can get.  

49 homes are great.  It would be even better if it was 89.  

That being said, if the project is forced to be made 

smaller, that just means fewer homes for those most 

vulnerable, like my mother. 

          Fewer homes means the odds of those on waitlists 

winning the lotter - itself a travesty that you have to win 

a lottery to get a home -- are that much greater. 

          Every home that is lost due to downsizing is 

forever lost.  We won't get it back.  Here we have a project 

that can house 49 families.  Let's make sure 49 families get 

housed.   

          I do have a final point about the city continuing 

to encourage driving by widening roads -- here Walden 

Street.  We hear complaints about traffic, so why is the 

city encouraging people to drive by widening roads?  That's 

called induced demand.   

          Anyway, thank you for my comments.  Have a good

evening.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Young Kim, followed by Cyrus Dochow.  Young Kim, you can 

unmute yourself and begin with your name and address, 

please.     

          [Pause]  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Just a note, if you're speaking --  

          YOUNG KIM:  Yeah.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  There you go.   

          YOUNG KIM:  Yeah, good evening.  I'm sorry, I'm -- 

I got, okay. Young Kim, 17 Norris Street, a longtime 

resident of North Cambridge, half and half mile north of the 

proposed site.  Thank you for this opportunity to beg you to 

recommend to the Board of Zoning Appeals that a full project 

review be conducted, as the proposed living space of more 

than 57,000 square feet it's almost three times the 

threshold of such a view. 

          I want to thank Mr. Korb and Mr. Hope for engaging 

with the community earlier in the presentation of the plans.  

I had several candid and cordial e-mail conversations with 

Mr. Korb, and I truly appreciate and thank him for his 

commitment to affordable housing serving the most vulnerable

community. 

          But I firmly believe in affordable housing, but 

including that the building should be built in the context 

of the surrounding neighborhood.  I gave my observations to 

pandemic traffic on Mass Ave to Mr. Korb, and he responded 

with my comments [3:52:35 indiscernible] and to not provide 

data, and that if I had any data that I should give it to 

him. 

          We the community do not have the wherewithal to 

provide such a data; we made an observation.  However, you, 

the Board members, can and must base you recommendation to 

the BZA on your own observation that during the COVID-19 

conditions. 

          If you haven't been to the proposed site during 

rush hour, even during this COVID-19 low, I beg you to do 

so.  One day you can then easily imagine coming to visit 

your loved one living in Russell Apartments before going to 

your job on Route 128, technology belt, while you are 

driving.  I'm sure it will not be too hard for you to 

imagine the traffic you will have to fight and the 

difficulty in finding a parking space to get there. 

          And as you stand in front of the main entrance, 

157

I'm sure you will be alarmed for the safety of your loved 

ones, who depend on mobility assisted devices, as you 

observe the throngs of pedestrians washing by, bicyclists 

and cars whizzing by, bus and car ride services dropping off 

a couple of passengers, and groups of children waiting for 

their school bus in front of this building. 

          This is a terrifying scenario for many seniors and 

disabled living at the Russell Apartment space if this 

development is allowed to proceed.  I'm sure you will see 

the need for the full project review to study the impact of 

this overly dense development with far -– astonishing 6.7 on 

surroundings.   

          If I may --   

up, please? 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Kim, can you wrap 

          YOUNG KIM:  Yes.  There are several studies that 

you still don't have.  So just how are you going to building 

a garden with mature trees on a sixth floor?  You need a 

deep, deep soil foundation.  You will need -- there are 

mitigation plans that you need to figure out.   

          It's such a narrow and tight spot; where are you 

going to put all those construction vehicles during your

construction?  And how about the senior citizens who does 

not have air conditioner in their apartment who cannot -- 

who will not be able to open their windows during the 

construction?  We need to consider all those mitigating 

factors before you make any decision. 

          So I think the best solution is to get the -- have 

a -- recommend a full project review to the BZA.  Thank you 

so much for allowing me to continue on.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  You.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Cyrus Dochow, followed by James Soll.   

          CYRUS DOCOHW:  Thank you.  My name is Cyrus 

Dochow.  I live at 5 Walden Street.  It's immediately across 

Walden Street from the proposed development.  I speak to you 

on behalf of the 5 Walden Street Condo Association, 

conditionally supporting the proposed development.  Our 

property directly abuts the development site, as I said 

located immediately across the street. 

          And we strongly urge the Planning Board to 

recommend the development team reduce the height of the 

building along Walden from the proposed six stories by at 

least one and preferably two stories.  The six-story height

along Walden abruptly meets the surrounding, low-lying 

residential areas and public way and will negatively impact 

the Walden streetscape leading to and from Mass Ave. 

          We refer to the following to substance abuse this 

claim:  The existing buildings along Walden adjacent to the 

project site, 5 and 14 Walden are three and two stories, 

approximately 30- and 20-feet tall more or less.  The 

proposed height of the six-story portion along Walden is 

about 70 feet, so greater than double the height of the 

neighboring residential buildings. 

          In this sense, it relates much more -- the 

proposed building relates much more to the Mass Ave 

buildings like Russell Apartments and Henderson Carriage, 

which are both between 60 and 70 feet tall. 

          Another factor is that the width of the Walden 

public way is 40 feet, which is less than half of the width 

of Mass Ave, which is over 100 feet.  This will further 

contribute to the perception of excess height along Walden. 

          I note also that the CDD memo from November 25 

places due emphasis on the positive urban design aspect of 

the development on Mass Ave, but offers few details on how 

the building addresses the adjoining Walden context.

          We think that the objection to the proposed 

development can be remedied with modest changes to the 

project, or reduction along the Walden portion of one floor 

would result in two fewer units.   

          A reduction of two floors would result in four 

fewer units.  This reduction represents quantities that can 

be produced by smaller developments or by auditing existing 

housing slack.  We have two vacant affordable housing units 

in our building now. 

          The reduction in height will have a positive 

impact and permanent impact for many years and for all who 

visit and use Walden on a daily basis, including the future 

residents of the proposed development. 

          Proponents to the project suggest the design 

should satisfy the requirements of the Affordable Housing 

Overlay, resulting in a reduction of 14 units.  We disagree.  

A better building, more units and improved streetscape can 

resolve with a modest reduction in height to a portion of 

the current design. 

          We support the many positive aspects of the 

project -- in particular the major contribution to 

affordable housing stock, widening of Walden to accommodate

three lanes of traffic, the two-foot easement along Walden, 

sustainability goals, and the major contributions to Mass 

Ave, including the nine-story heights and the location of 

the residential interests. 

          We are grateful to the project team, and just in 

summary, our full support is conditioned on reducing the 

height along Walden.  We don't support the current six 

stories of the proposed design, but we strongly urge the 

Planning Board to make a recommendation consistent with this 

goal. 

          And it's -- this letter that I've been reading is 

signed by five of us in this building, and [3:59:01 

indiscernible proper name] who is also a trustee, Marie 

Stroud, K.U. Lin, Cam Neely, and Dennis Lee [all names 

phonetic] -- thank you very much.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

James Zall, followed by Eric Johnson.   

          JAMES ZALL:  I'm James Zall, 203 Pemberton Street.  

I'd just like to mention that a representative from A Better 

Cambridge was in the meeting earlier, much earlier.  She was 

unable to stay connected this long.   

          She has asked that I convey the fact that A Better

Cambridge is very supportive of this project, and asks that 

you refer to a letter of support that was sent in earlier. 

          On my own behalf, I would like to say that this 

seems to be a badly needed, well-planned, well-situated 

building that addresses a dire need for affordable housing 

in our city.  The developer has been very responsive to most 

issues raised by neighbors.  They've redesigned the 

building.  They're offering an easement to permit the 

widening of the traffic lanes on Walden. 

          And we're hearing tonight that some residents are 

ignoring the professionally conducted parking study that 

shows that this building will have little impact on parking 

in the area, and instead clinging to their concerns that the 

alleged lack of parking will affect their -- the neighbors' 

quality of life.  Certainly not having an affordable place 

to live is also an impediment to a good quality of life.   

          Capstone may be unable to ensure a large enough 

supply of parking to satisfy the present neighbors, but 

they're addressing a different problem, which is that 

shortage of affordable housing.   

          This shortage has been caused in part by the 

city's zoning restrictions, which have lagged behind the

city's policy on affordable housing.  I hope that this Board 

will take a step toward remedying that problem by giving a 

strong favorable recommendation for the zoning relief and 

the affordable housing that's being proposed today.  Thank 

you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Eric Johnson, followed by Ausra Kubilius.

your address.         

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  Please give your name and 

          ERIC JOHNSON:  My name is Eric Johnson.  My 

address is 24 Alberta Terrace, North Cambridge.  I would 

like to say that this is an excellent project, and I fully 

support it.  Its location is just right for the high density 

development that Cambridge needs to really address the 

housing shortage, and the affordable housing shortage. 

          And that I feel that the current height and mass 

of the building fits in very well with the -- you know, 

directly adjacent neighborhood, with the carriage building 

across the street and other taller apartment buildings 

within the same couple of blocks.

          I guess I'll save my traffic and parking comments 

for the BZA next week, but I think my one comment on the 

look of the building is the other similarly sized buildings 

along Mass Ave here are all red brick clad, and while I'm 

not suggesting that this new building should be red brick 

clad as well, I feel perhaps maybe a warmer color than the 

zinc metal cladding would help make it blend in with the 

Mass Ave streetscape.  That's all my comments.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Ausra Kubilius, followed by Susan Frankle.  And you can 

unmute yourself and --  

          AUSRA KUBILIUS:  Can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can.   

          AUSRA KUBILIUS:  Thank you.  I'm Ausra Kubilius.  

I live on Cogswell Ave, a block away from this project.  

I've been living here almost 30 years.  I'd like to start by 

saying that the person that I've listened to tonight that 

affected me the most is Margaret, the first speaker, who I 

guess was representing some 50 affordable housing residents, 

who are the closest abutters to this project. 

          And she didn't sound too much in favor of it, for 

to me very convincing reasons.  Those people are affordable

housing residents.  Their say should have a lot of weight. 

          I would request that this Board -- and I'm 

thankful that you're letting me speak -- request a project 

design review.   

          I personally don't find the traffic study that was 

done -- maybe it looked at the parking, but it didn't look 

at traffic impact -- people who will be walking and 

bicycling and driving cars on that corner.  I'm sure that 

you the Planning Board know that there's already been a 

bicycle death there, and actually the island has a sign 

dedicated as a memorial to that bicyclist.  I personally 

don't think that’s a safe corner.   

          I recognize the need for affordable housing.  For 

me, a great model is the 240 units in Walden Square, three 

blocks away -- not a high rise.  Thank you for your 

attention.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Susan Frankel, followed by Aleida Inglis.       

          SUSAN FRANKLE:  Hi, can you hear me?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.

Cambridge for more than 30 years.  I'm on a small walkway 

about 90 -- off of Walden, about 90 yards from the proposed 

development.  And while I appreciate being asked not to talk 

about traffic, I feel like that’s ignoring a big elephant in 

the room.  We're talking about a very large, very dense 

development, and if you don't talk about the environment 

that it's going into, I think that's ignoring something very 

important. 

          So I just want to talk a little bit about how a 

very large, very dense footprint at a congested and 

dangerous intersection affects everyone in the community; 

the neighbors who are there now, the seniors who come to the 

senior center -- what Margaret talked about, the residents 

in the affordable housing at Russell, and also the future 

residents of 2072. 

some of those issues. 

          So I think it's really important we talk about 

          Traffic on Walden has been untenable for a long 

time during commuting hours.  We have a small reprieve 

because of the pandemic, but once we get back to post pro 

and con conditions, we're going to go back to the gridlock 

and the dangerous conditions that we had.

          And I just want to talk about the fact that there 

were times of the day where people on Mead and Cogswell 

could not get out of the neighborhood, and it -- certainly 

and ambulance and a fire truck would not be able to get into 

our neighborhood.   

          So it's really important to know that. 

          Also the way that the cars would speed through 

Walden, Mass Ave intersection is really unsafe.  I think by 

widening, you're just going to have more of -- you know, 

give cars more ability to speed through that intersection.  

So I'm not sure if widening 100 percent improves this 

situation. 

          So now we're going to add a nine-story building 

that will span the entire lot.  There are no setbacks.  

There's no green space.  It doesn't fit within the context 

of the neighborhood.  It towers over the other buildings in 

the area, and quite frankly it's overdevelopment.  The floor 

area ratio is more than 300 percent higher, as compared to 

the other affordable housing developments in our area. 

          200 residents, their foot traffic, their bikes, 

their cars, their visitors, their drop-offs, their pickups, 

their deliveries, the cars trying to get across two lanes of

traffic on Walden to get into the parking spaces at the back 

of the building --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Frankle, can you wrap 

up your comments, please?       

          SUSAN FRANKLE:  Yes.  So all of this is very 

concerning to us in the neighborhood.  It should be 

concerning to the developers as well for the future 

residents of that complex.   

          So I respectfully ask the Planning Board to 

recommend a full project design review, which includes a 

traffic impact study that should be performed post pandemic 

when we return to the traffic conditions that we were 

experiencing prior to the pandemic.  Thank you very much for 

allowing me to speak.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Aleida Englis, followed by Michael Kennedy.  And Aleida 

Englis, you can unmute yourself, thanks.  And begin by 

giving your name and address, please.     

          [Pause]

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.   

          ALEIDA INGLIS:  Okay.  Hi, my name is Aleida 

Inglis.  And I'm a near neighbor of the project on Cogswell 

Avenue.  And I think the project is very beautiful in many 

ways.  There's many wonderful things about it, and I love 

the green initiatives.  But I'm concerned about it being 

very much out of scale with the setting, which is a pretty 

small plot on a pretty busy and often dangerous 

intersection.   

          And especially with the neighbors -- the 

neighborhood of, like, two-family and three-family houses; 

it's just the building really powers over it.  And it seems 

like I'm really concerned also about how many people are 

going to be packed into the building. 

          And so, I'm -- you know, I'm supportive of the 

project, but I believe that it should be scaled down to a 

size that's more in sync with the neighborhood.   

          And also, I'm concerned with the height.  When it 

goes up so high, I'm concerned of traffic -- I mean, not 

traffic -- fire safety for the inhabitants.  I'm thinking of 

the safety of the people that are living in there as well.

          And so, in any case, I would hope that you all 

would recommend reducing the size of the height of the 

project to make it pose fewer problems for the inhabitants, 

and also, for the neighborhood.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Michael Kennedy.  But first I'm going to say that this is 

last call for anyone that doesn't have their hand raised at 

this point and would like to speak.  Please raise your hand 

now, push *9 on your phone if you're attending by phone.  

Michael Kennedy, you can begin. 

          MICHAEL KENNEDY:  Can you hear me?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can hear you.   

          MICHAEL KENNEDY:  Okay.  I'm Michael Kennedy, a 

33-year-resident on Cogswell Avenue near Mass Ave.  I'm a 

public school teacher, a middle-incomer and I speak for 

myself and for our north Walden neighbors.  We want to thank 

the Planning Board for this opportunity to share my 

concerns. 

          To begin, I recall certain studies and philosophy.  

Remember Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau?  Their social contract 

theory?  Yep, that's the one -- the one where we realized 

that citizens have both rights and responsibilities.

Citizens enjoy those rights, as long as they meet their 

responsibilities.   

          And we all realize furthermore the importance of 

satisfying civically shared responsibilities.  This defines 

our character as a city and it leads to or not the smooth 

functioning of our society, our social fabric neighborhood 

by neighborhood. 

need.   

          Therefore, we abide our laws.  We use the blinker, 

we pay our taxes, and we try to help others when they are in 

          The members of the Planning Board are charged with 

the duty to uphold the city's ordinances.  The ordinances 

have already been decided upon as necessary in order to 

safeguard against haste and greed, among other threats to 

our and its integrity. 

          These ordinances are in place to ensure that 

nothing out of the ordinary -- that no extraordinary 

building gets built in such a way that it bring less, while 

promising it will bring more.  

          Yes, we refer to the proposed project at 2072 Mass 

Ave in order to break ground and constructed a nine-story 

building, the developers seek extraordinary relief from 17

city ordinances, admitting to the highly unusual nature of 

what they propose.  Furthermore, the developers plan to take 

advantage of state statute 40B in order to trump what our 

city has already deemed right and sound for us. 

          That developer seeks so much relief makes clear 

that they ask too much; that they overreach.  I am not, nor 

are north Walden neighbors against affordable housing.  But 

we are reticent in front of these exceptions they seek, and 

so should you be.   

          We do request that this Board not recommend the 

project to the BZA.  The project for many reasons regarding 

ordinances requires a thorough project design review, 

including traffic and safety --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Kennedy --        

          MICHAEL KENNEDY:  -- and careful consideration of 

how this building --

          MICHAEL KENNEDY:  -- yes, I will --

we plea to respect our concerns, which are valid, and to 

take up its responsibilities fully, sincerely, to ensure 

that whatever will grace our dicey corner of Mass Ave and 

Walden Street will have the required setbacks, the required 

green open spaces, and a scale and density commensurate with 

surrounding comparables.   

          As rendered in the slide presentation Young Kim 

has kindly --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Kennedy -- you 

are way over time at this point.

I thank you very much for your time.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.

Dennis Carlone, and will be followed by James Williamson.    

          DENNIS CARLONE:  Thank you, and I appreciate the 

opportunity to speak.  The neighbors reached out to me a few 

weeks ago, and asked me my opinion on the project.  They had 

heard that I had worked on -- with the developer, the 

architect and the neighbors at the other end of Porter 

Square.  So I'm going to take a little different bent on 

this.

          As you know very well, the city approved the 

Affordable Housing Overlay.  The Overlay, one of the reasons 

it was important was one could avoid this whole process that 

we're going through now, and the uncertainty that could come 

out of it.   

          The affordable housing Overlay for this district 

would say a max of 70 feet on Mass Avenue, with the larger, 

deeper transition and 45 feet in the back. 

          So that's approximately two-thirds of what's being 

proposed in number of units, in height.  And I felt very 

comfortable with those dimensions on Mass Avenue.  I was 

against some of the proposals where you could build 

anywhere.   

          The important thing is this neighborhood is not 

against the affordable housing.  This is a perfect site for 

that when the developers bought this site, I congratulated 

them.  Not in a million years did I think we'd be talking 

about a building that's over 100 feet tall. 

          Generally, and I don't know how they're doing this 

-- if you build affordable housing over six stories or 70 

feet, it's much greater cost per square feet.  So I don't 

know exactly how that is being done, given the limited

funds.  And this is all entirely public funded.   

          Public funds should benefit the building, but also 

it should be a building that fits into the context better 

than this building.  And to me that is what's wrong here.  

It's like a new world, and will set a precedent for every 

new affordable housing building.   

          I think that's dangerous.  Usually 40B -- and I've 

worked on a number of 40B projects -- is in a community 

where there's less than 10 percent affordable housing, as 

you know, or 15 percent -- not enough.   

          I'm the guy on the Council that's been pushing for 

more money for affordable housing, including a proposed 

transfer fee.  So I am for affordable housing.  I've done 

affordable housing, it's my background.  But I'm an urban 

designer and believe you work within your context. 

          70 feet and 45 feet would be bigger than the 

buildings next door.  But it is much more in the calling of 

what is demanded of us of being good neighbors and still 

meeting the needs.   

          There is another project that will come before you 

on New Street.  It's 130 units of affordable housing -- 

bigger site, six stories.  Think of all the new affordable

housing that's been built in the last 20 years; six stories 

and lower.  Thank you for the time.  I hope you'll take into 

consideration the context which we required in the zoning -- 

a context study and how you relate to it.  Thank you very 

much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

James Williamson, followed by Ausra Kubilius, who I think 

may have spoken before, unless it's somebody else with the 

same account.  James Williamson, you can unmute yourself and 

begin with your name and address, please.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  My name is James Williamson, 

1000 Jackson Place in North Cambridge.  I just want to point 

out that I am in a spot with pretty good Wi-Fi and not at 

home, and I've been bumped off repeatedly from the open 

meeting portal, which is the only place I can really hear.  

And then I have to switch to Zoom in order to be able to 

speak.  So this is not a great setup for public 

participation. 

          I do want to mention it seems like there are 

people who think that the only people who matter, or the 

perspective that matters, is the perspective of people who 

don't live anywhere near the building, including people who

live next door in the affordable housing next door…  that 

the people who live there are the people who don't matter, 

and it's people who live somewhere else who do matter. 

          I want to mention that Gwen Noyes was at a recent 

meeting of the Affordable Housing Trust who was the 

developer in the same neighborhood, actually -- mentioned at 

the meeting across the street is now going to be a great 

development opportunity, so watch out."   

          If this ends up being a nine-story building, 

there's going to be a nine-story building across the street.  

I thought that Dennis Carlone's comments were great.   

          The Staff Memo lists the zoning and the planning 

documents that have -- a lot of people put a lot of work in, 

which this proposal would completely ignore by a dramatic 

margin.  And I think that would be a big mistake, for 

reasons that other people have highlighted. 

          But I do want to -- and I think the Affordable 

Housing Overlay with all the work that went into that would 

probably be a very good guide here.  But I -- since I took 

some time, five stories in the back I think would be great.  

Don't underestimate the need of low-income people for cars, 

because they drive Uber and LYFT for all of you guys.

          And my last comment is -- now I have to play 

around with my iPads to bring up this sentence from the 

Staff report, "Due to its location at the bend in Mass Ave, 

the building will be a visual target for those entering 

Cambridge."  

          Why do we have to judge the appropriateness of 

height, which is out of context with the neighborhood, as 

people have pointed out, by whether it's a target for 

somebody entering Cambridge?  And this isn't even on the 

border of Cambridge. 

          And by the way, it's not just a couple of blocks 

from the Porter Square T, and it's not such an easy walk if 

you are elderly.  So let's not exaggerate the wonders of its 

alleged proximity to an important public transit mode.  

Thank you very much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Next speaker -- the 

next name on the list is Ausra Kubilius.  And I -- if you've 

already spoken before, we appreciate you not repeating.  But 

if it's --  

          AUSRA KUBILIUS:  I've spoken before, and I doubt 

there's another person with that name.  Thank you.

speaker and the last speaker is Michael Brandon.  You can 

unmute yourself and begin with your name and address, 

please.     

          MICHAEL BRANDON:  Hi, members of the Board.  This 

is Michael Brandon.  I live at 27 Seven Pines Avenue.  I'm 

the clerk for the North Cambridge Stabilization Committee, 

and unfortunately, we haven't been able to schedule a 

meeting with the developers since they finally seem to have 

finalized their proposal.  It's kind of been a moving 

target.  In fact, what was presented to you tonight for the 

nine-story version, if you look on your agenda it's still 

listing the eight stories. 

          So the Development Team has agreed to meet with 

our group this Friday night at 7:00, and in order to try to 

squeeze in a chance to give them some feedback before the 

BZA hearing on the tenth, I would just say from my own 

perspective, not speaking for our organization formally, 

that this -- the public process has been way too rushed.  

This is not an appropriate project to be rushed through 

under the comprehensive permit process.   

          And I would suggest to the Board that the local 

need in this case outweigh the regional need for affordable

housing.  Everybody agrees -- I was surprised at the level 

of support for affordable housing on this site, and I agree 

with it.  But this is -- as Councillor Carlone explained -- 

this is just, you know, not appropriate.   

          Also, if I were on your Board, I would be kind of 

insulted that they're basically asking you to throw out all 

the planning that's been done that you spent hours and hours 

on -- most recently the Affordable Housing Overlay that you 

input for; the North Mass Ave Overlay --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Brandon?   

          MICHAEL BRANDON:  Yeah?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Wrap up, please.   

          MICHAEL BRANDON:  Massachusetts Avenue Overlay 

District, this is all being thrown out window.  I hope -- 

final comment -- I would suggest at this point, that you 

recommend to the BZA that they deny the comprehensive permit 

at this time.   

          I think there's ample evidence just from tonight 

that this needs more study.  Let them go through, apply for 

an Article 19 Project Review with your input, and you can 

talk about the design of the façades and so forth.      

          But there needs to be a traffic study that's full 

181

scoped.  What's been done has not been adequate, and I guess 

that's what I hope you will do is at the very least 

recommend to the BZA that they not proceed until there's 

been at the very least a fully scoped project Article 19 

review. 

          Sorry to go for long.  I really do appreciate your 

allowing the public to weigh in on this, and I wish you good 

luck in your decision.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  I'll turn it back to 

the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So now 

we're moving from public comment to Board discussions.  

Board members, in the interest of efficiency at this time, 

I'm going to have folks consolidate any questions they have 

for the staff or the permittee, and any comments they want 

to make, and if we can -- people can have a chance to weigh 

in a second time if need be.  But you can kind of group all 

your thoughts together at once, that would be appreciated. 

          Let's see.  Ted, you have your hand up.  You want 

to kick us off?

          Oh, you're muted.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  My hand up was from a long time 

ago, not from this.  But fine.  Well, I do live in the 

neighborhood, and I've walked by this site probably every 

day for almost 40 years.  I've driven on Walden Street.   

          There's no question that Walden and Mass Ave is a 

difficult intersection.  It's been made difficult in part by 

the fact that it was a Kentucky Fried Chicken for oh so many 

years, and it is another restaurant with curb cuts, both on 

Mass Ave and on Walden Street.   

          But, you know, this is Mass Ave.  And wherever 

there is housing, it -- you know, you're going to have more 

people.   

          It's no surprise that I like tall buildings.  And 

so, actually, I'm perfectly content with the building.  I 

think it -- you know, there are two other buildings not that 

far away that are approximately the same size.  I think it 

adds quite a bit to Mass Ave.   

          You know, I -- Councillor Carlone talks about it's 

going into a new direction, a new era, and I think that's 

true.  I think we have to have affordable housing.  I think 

we have to have housing for everyone.  You know, the 49-50

units most of which are two and three-family units I think 

are a tremendous benefit to this neighborhood and to the 

city at large.   

          You know, I like the way it looks.  And so, I'm 

curious what my colleagues have to say about the design.  

I'm interested in that.  I don't see the density being any 

problem for the current or future residents who live along 

Mass Ave, who live in the vicinity.  It is different from 

the one, two and three-family houses that are in the 

neighborhood, but it is Mass Ave.  It's time we really made 

that the major thoroughfare and a major source of housing in 

the city. 

          And one last thing about traffic:  There is a city 

of Cambridge parking spot parking lot right behind this 

parcel that separates this parcel from the next property -- 

say it has about 10 or 12 parking spots in it, I don't know 

the exact number.  That's really all I have to say about it.  

I think subject to the design issues that my colleagues 

might raise, I personally would be prepared to move forward 

and recommend it to the BZA.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Steve?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Thanks.  Look, I think it's a

well-designed project.  It's politically and socially and 

morally needed in the city.  And so, in many respects, it's 

laudable and I support it.  And subject to one fundamental 

issue and concern that I have, which I alluded to earlier, 

and that is parking.   

          The whole premise for permitting a project of this 

magnitude to proceed without parking is that in a location 

such as this near mass transit, that there won't be a need 

for parking.  And some people have suggested that low-income 

people don't have or need cars, but that's simply a fantasy, 

that's not the case at all.  Low-income people like 

everybody else needs and has cars.   

          So the question is, in reality, as a practical 

matter, does the proximity of mass transit here really 

obviate the desire and need for cars for the future 

residents of this building?  You know, I would say that I'm 

a bit skeptical.  I'm in any event concerned.   

          Again, you know, the whole premise of not 

providing parking here is that there won't be demand, and if 

there are a bunch of cars here, they're going to have a 

detrimental impact on the neighboring streets and 

neighborhood.

22

          And so, I guess I would suggest -- and I would 

even suggest as a condition of our approval, or of our 

recommendation, that the leases for the tenants in this 

building provide that the tenants do not have a car, and 

there are other places in the city and affordable housing 

that do provide for parking, but this one in this location, 

in this particular design and site, cannot provide parking.  

And therefore, it should provide only for low-income 

tenants, you know, who don't need parking, who don't have a 

car. 

          So again, I would suggest that the leases provide 

that there be no -- that the tenants do not have a car, do 

not need parking, and I would further suggest that the city 

Parking Department do not provide parking permits for those 

who have an address in this building. 

          This isn't a penalty to the people who are going 

to be living here, it's simply a practical and moral 

acknowledgment that this excellent building was designed 

specifically for people who don't have and need cars.   

          And so, I'm suggesting that we take those two 

additional steps to assure that in fact, the tenants of this 

building are in fact the tenants that the building was 

186

designed for; i.e., folks who don't own and need a car. 

          Other than that issue, which I think is a really 

important and fundamental issue in this location, I think 

it's a great building.  I understand some of the concerns 

about the design, but really fundamentally I think it's a 

good design, and I think it will contribute to the 

neighborhood. 

          And parking issues aside, I don't think it will 

create any issues.  People have expressed concern about 

traffic, but without cars and parking among the tenants, 

there will be no impact on traffic.  So I have that one 

issue of serious concern. I think that issue can be 

addressed in a reasonable way, and in all other respects, I 

think it's an excellent design and proposal.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh?  Do you 

want to weigh in on this one?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Boy, I really don't know what to 

think.  It's a handsome building, and affordable housing is 

a high priority for the city.  The Affordable Housing 

Overlay basically said, "push the envelope for all afford 

projects.  It's a way of making them happy."   

          Now, if we follow the actual letter of the 

187

12

22

Affordable Housing Overlay, we're not actually pushing the 

height envelope, it's similar to the Henderson Carriage 

building across the street.  It's not much higher than a 

six-story section of the Russell Apartments.   

          So in a sense, this building is in the spirit of 

AHO by saying, "Okay, we're going to push it because if it's 

nicely designed and it's not very big, it won't be -- it 

won't stand out."  And of course there are -- you know, a 

few blocks in each direction buildings that have similar 

height.   

          Clearly, there's concern about the density.  I 

don't quite understand that myself.  If there are -- you 

know, 150 or 200 people living in this building, it's a very 

small fraction of the people who are passing by on the 

street, and, you know, it might be 50 or 60 more pedestrian 

trips on the sidewalk in the peak hours.  That's like one 

person a minute.   

          Now, when I was out there today, yeah, there was 

only one person a minute going by at 11:00 in the morning, 

but clearly if there was a lot of people who were living in 

the building, it wouldn't change the uncongested sidewalks 

at 11:00 a.m.

          So as I say, I'm torn.  Because I think this 

building responds in the spirit of the Affordable Housing 

Overlay, but it would be -- I think in my sense more 

attractive if it followed the actual letter of VHO, but I 

doubt if it could be built. 

          So if you want it, I think you have to go for it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you.  I guess I do know 

what to think about this.  And it actually comes prompted by 

Dennis's description and siting of the Affordable Housing 

Overlay that we should be proud of this -- a community 

that's been ordained.   

          But we also have the mechanism of 40B in front of 

us, and by the way that's adopted and that's accepted by the 

City Council.  It's a friendly 40Be in this community; we're 

not mandated by state law to accept them because we exceeded 

the threshold of 10 percent in this community.   

          So -- but that's still in place, it's still a 

mechanism that's available to affordable housing developers 

and advocates.  And this development group has chosen to 

avail themselves of that approach.  

          So the rules under 40B means we get to examine the

project and make a judgment about whether the need for 

housing in this community outweighs planning concerns.  And 

that's where it gets difficult, because reasonable people 

can disagree about what's an appropriate planning response 

at this particular site.   

          And then we've had really a great, articulate and 

very thoughtful input from many people in the community 

around this site.  I happen to feel two things.  One, I feel 

the need for affordable housing in this community to be even 

more acute now after our summer.  It is a question of social 

justice, and I think we're now all much more aware of that 

than we ever were.   

          And there's not a whole lot of things that we can 

do immediately about this as a community.  But one of the 

things we can do is from time to time build some affordable 

housing and try to begin to address some of the injustices 

that we see around us. 

          So there's an overwhelming need for this now, and 

our community is a leader in it.  And I think despite our 

well-founded and good arguments around planning, they don't 

outstrip the need to do this right now.   

          I'd say, lastly, the building is beautiful.  And

they’ve got a really skilled design team here -- skilled 

architects.  We've seen their work done for Lesley 

University.  So you're in good hands. 

          And also, I appreciate how forthright the team is 

in terms of saying, not beating around the bush and saying, 

"This is the fact.  We're providing this number of parking 

spaces, and this is what we think is reasonable to do to 

reach the goals of trying to house people who are 

desperately seeking a home." 

          So I would very strongly endorse a proposal to the 

Zoning Board that this is something that would be welcome in 

our community and meets the threshold that they have to find 

around balancing planning concerns with the need for 

affordable housing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  I 

note that Joe Barr and Adam Shulman from Traffic and Parking 

are here, and we certainly heard a lot about those concerns 

tonight.  Joe, are you available to give us a quick couple 

of thoughts on what Traffic and Parking is thinking?   

          We obviously received your memo, which was very 

supportive of the project, but some ideas and additional 

thoughts have been brought up tonight, so if you could 

191

comment on that, that would be great.     

          JOE BARR:  Sure.  And I'll try to be as brief as 

possible, but if folks have questions, I'm happy to answer 

those. 

          I guess, like you said, you have our memo which 

summarizes most of our thoughts.  I guess maybe two or three 

things that I would say in addition to that -- one, you 

know, in terms of both parking demand and trip --  

          [Pause]  

          [Pause]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, he froze.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Joe's experiencing 

his own traffic issues, apparently.  All right.  While we're 

-- hopefully he will be back and can speak to us.  Because I 

am curious, frankly, as to what the thinking -- the current 

thinking is on this.  I -- Joe, are you back?     

          JOE BARR:  Yeah.  My Zoom just, you know, died and 

then came back.  So can you hear me?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.     

          JOE BARR:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We can hear you now.     

          JOE BARR:  So I'll try to be even more brief after

that experience.  So -- I turned off my video and hoped that 

that will avoid any future problems.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          JOE BARR:  So in terms of traffic demand, or 

traffic impacts and parking demand, I think -- like I was 

saying, or at least when I thought I cut out -- you know, 

that we don't expect that there will be no car ownership 

amongst residents of affordable housing.  

          We sort of do have -- you know, empirical evidence 

that it's lower than non-affordable housing.  So there is 

reasonable to believe that I lower parking demand, not zero 

parking demand. 

          And so, I think to Steve's sort of point, we're 

not able to limit who can receive a resident parking permit 

in the city.  While there are certain central -- actually 

constitutional issues with that, in terms of what the 

agreement is between a private property owner and their 

tenants, that's not a matter for us to be concerned about 

directly, but I would imagine there's issues in that respect 

as well.   

          Again, that's not my area of expertise, but I do 

know that we cannot limit who can receive the resident

permit from our end. 

of how we move forward. 

          So that's one thing to be aware of just in terms 

          In terms of just the general parking and travel 

demand, as we stated in the memo, I think we do not see this 

-- even if this were sort of a regular--quote, unquote-- 

"non affordable housing development, we would not expect a 

development this size to have significant traffic impacts, 

and particularly -- and like I said, we do see lower demand 

from affordable housing, it would sort of even further 

mitigate that.   

          And the developer has been very -- you know, 

forthcoming and willing to work with us on a variety of 

things to try to reduce the impact of their project, and 

even just eliminating the curb cut on Mass Ave is a 

significant safety benefit, and they've all worked even 

beyond what we had asked for in some cases in terms of, you 

know, sight lines if their driveway exits off of Walden 

Street. 

          So I know there's concerns about this, but I 

think, you know, they've been very willing to work with us, 

you know, very collaboratively to mitigate those impacts. 

194

          And then finally, I'd just say, you know, there 

was a question about the widening of Walden Street and 

normally yes, we're not pro widening streets.   

          And it is a strange request coming from the city 

of Cambridge, but I think I think in this case, as alluded 

to I think by one of the presenters in the beginning, you 

know, Walden Street really isn't actually wide enough for 

three lanes, even though we somehow managed to squeeze them 

in.   

          And so, we do see safety and operational benefits 

from, you know, getting to the bare minimum of what we would 

normally consider to be the bare minimum width of 10 feet.  

And we would expect to be particularly approaching a 

signalized intersection that there would be -- you know, 

there's a T so everyone has to turn anyway -- there will be 

significant speeding issues.  They would, you know, get 

worse as a result of this.  It's not like we're proposing to 

widen the street to 12-foot lanes or something like that. 

          So that's all I have there, and I'm happy to 

answer any other questions you yet may have.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Joe.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Catherine, could I --

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- ask a question?  So Joe, you've 

addressed what you consider to be traffic issues, and you 

don't think that there's too much of a negative impact.  But 

I don't think that you've directly addressed the potential 

parking impact in the neighborhood.  Could you address that?     

          JOE BARR:  Sure.  So, you know, obviously the 

developer, you know, did do a parking study which -- as they 

acknowledge and we sort of acknowledge too is -- you know, 

potentially impacted by COVID, although it's a little hard 

to say exactly what direct that impact goes because, you 

know, there are people who aren't in the city as much and 

then there are people who are staying home much more than 

normal, so it's a little hard that we don't have a good feel 

for whether parking demand in residential areas is higher or 

lower.  We know it's obviously lower at meter parking. 

          So -- but I think between the fact that, you know, 

that parking study shows, you know, it's not just a small 

amount available parking, it's a fairly -- you know, by 

Cambridge standards, I would say relatively significant 

percentage of the available parking was vacant when they did 

the study.  So that kind of tells me that, you know, even if

there is additional parking demand during--quote, unquote-- 

"normal times" whatever that means, that we still have some 

excess parking available. 

          And then I guess, as I think Ted pointed out, we 

are -- we do have a -- you know, our only, actually off-

street resident permit parking lot in the city is located 

directly adjacent to this building.  So it's a pretty unique 

scenario where there's actually off-street parking 

available, you know, right next door. 

          So obviously that parking is used, but, you know, 

I think that as compared to many other parts of the city, 

you know, there is -- you know, parking available in the 

area.   

          And I get thinking about it in a larger planning 

context -- you know, in the context of VHO.  I mean, these 

are -- you know, for better or worse, you know, but these 

are the types of projects -- you know, with limited or no 

parking that the VHO sort of envisions.   

          And so, I think, you know, as sort of a larger 

planning and policy matter, you know, we're all going to 

have to -- we all feel comfortable with the idea that 

there's going to be affordable housing projects built.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We lost Joe again.  I 

think we got the main thrust of the point there, though.  So 

that was helpful to me.  I think a lot of that is -- 

sometimes I remember what we said on the Traffic and Parking 

side back when I worked on the city, and now that that is 

well in the rear-view mirror, I have to remind myself I 

don't know always what the current thinking is.  So it's 

good to get the refresher.   

          And that's particularly helpful in a case like 

this, where my gut says that the project actually improves 

the traffic safety and operational issues at that 

intersection.  I certainly know lots of people who have used 

the two curb cuts for a, you know, pseudo U-turn on Mass Ave 

over the years, and seeing that disappear can only improve 

how that intersection behaves.   

          You know, I think Joe's point is correct that 

while we expect lesser parking demand from affordable 

housing than from market-rate housing, it's not going to be 

none, and it is -- there will undoubtedly be some people who 

park in the neighborhood.   

          It is going to be fewer people, frankly, than if 

it was a building that had more parking, giving the

impression that every resident could bring car.  The fact 

that there is no parking provided will actually help drive 

down the demand at this particular building. 

          And I do think, you know, the demand for 

affordable housing is so dear that I am hesitant -- every 

parking space we require and every inch we take off the 

building, you know, even the space they've given up to make 

it so that the intersection functions better, it is our -- 

you know, adds up to units we're giving up.   

          And I guess I would feel pretty strongly that we 

should send a favorable recommendation to the BZA for this 

project. 

          So if my count is right, we've got three strongly 

in favor and one who has reservations about the parking.  

And Hugh, would you be in favor of a favorable 

recommendation at this stage?   I know you were more on the 

fence than some of the rest of us.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I would support a favorable 

recommendation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Then I think at this point, unless there's further 

discussion from the Board, I hear a motion to send a 

199

favorable recommendation to the BZA?    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  This is a Ted, so moved.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom, seconded.      

          CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER:  All right.  Jeff, we'll do 

a roll call vote.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On that motion, Ted Cohen?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Hm.  Can you come back to me in 

a few minutes?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  Is that an abstention?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Look, I support the project.  I 

just wish that we could -- at least that I could convey some 

concern about the parking and whether we impose a 

requirement in the leases or some way to require that the 

tenants in this building in this location will not have 

cars.  Because if they do have cars, I think that 

notwithstanding what we've heard, I think that there will be 

a detrimental impact on the neighborhood. 

          And the whole rationale for not building parking, 

which -- by the way -- is not as difficult and expensive as 

some have said here, but the whole rationale for not having

it in this location is that the tenants in this location 

don't need it. 

          So, you know, I just think that we're pretending 

that this is not an issue, but I think that it is an issue.  

So having said all of that, I support the motion.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So just -- I'm not a 

Parliamentarian, but I just want to note that I think we 

need to just take a vote on this motion --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Correct.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- and maybe we can go back to 

discuss the question of whether that gets communicated as 

well.  So that -- so I'm recording that as a yes.  Steve?      

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  That's a very qualified yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes?    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  That's a yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Niko Bowie I believe is absent, and 

I'm going to mark as absent.  And Catherine Preston 

Connolly?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  So that is five members 

voting in favor.   One is absent.  And now might be a time 

to discuss this question of --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- what comment to make about the  

--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So do Board members 

support the notion of acknowledging there continues to be 

residents and at least one Board member who have expressed 

concerns over parking overflow in the neighborhood?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I'm not in favor of sending that 

message to the Zoning Board at all.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I mean, I think there would be 

impact in the neighborhood.  I -- Steve's concerns are well- 

articulated.  But what you have to do -- what we're faced 

with is to balance that particular impact with the critical 

need, which has been stated ever since I've been involved in 

community activities in the city, for affordable housing 

which is more acute than ever.

          And so, yes, there's impact.  I'm not denying 

that.  It's just that you have to balance that against the 

need.  And that's --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Tom?  If I could respond to 

that, I'm not suggesting that that qualifies our approval of 

the project.  I'm suggesting, however, that there are steps 

that can be taken to ameliorate the potential issue.  Leases 

can provide that tenants don't have cars.   

          You know, I guess I'll have to defer to Joe that 

there's nothing that we can do in permitting -- in issuing 

of permits.  But certainly, things can be done in the 

leases.   

          You know, and if they violate the terms of the 

lease, they risk losing the apartment.  I don't see why 

encouraging -- tenants here who do not have cars should be 

an issue or inconsistent with any of our affordable housing 

goals that you have so strongly and clearly articulated.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Given 

that it is almost 11:20 now, and I am sure that the many 

attendees who are currently on the call will also 

undoubtedly bring up the issues of traffic and parking and 

impact on the neighborhood to the BZA, I would suggest that

we let the BZA determine whether or if they want to address 

that with the applicant and explore what avenues they might 

have to do that that are appropriate.  

          I'm sure that there are all kinds of funding 

issues that the applicant has to consider; there are many 

different things that I do not propose we get into at this 

late hour.  But I am sure they will have a robust discussion 

about them at the BZA.  So with that, Ted, you have your 

hand up.  Did you want to add something further?  You're 

muted.     

I have nothing to add.    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Based upon your statement, no, 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Then, having forwarded -- we're going to forward that 

positive recommendation then.  That does conclude our 

business on the agenda.  Jeff, any additional comments with 

staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Nothing from me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Anything 

further from Board members?  No?  All right.  Then we are 

adjourned.  Thank you all so much.
