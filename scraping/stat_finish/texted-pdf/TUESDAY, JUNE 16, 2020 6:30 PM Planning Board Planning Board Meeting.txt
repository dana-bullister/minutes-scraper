          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, good evening 

and welcome to the June 16, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board.  My name is Catherine Preston Connolly, and 

I am the Chair.  This meeting is being held remotely, due to 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19.   

          And in accordance with Governor Charlie Baker's 

Executive Order of March 12, 2020, temporarily amending 

certain requirements of the Open Meeting Law, as well as the 

City of Cambridge temporary emergency restrictions on city 

public meetings, city events and city permitted events due 

to COVID-19, dated May 27, 2020. 

          This meeting is being audio and visually recorded,

meeting portal, and on cable television Channel 22 within 

Cambridge.  There will also be a transcript of the 

proceeding. 

          All Board members, applicants and members of the 

public will state their name before speaking, and all votes 

will be taken by roll call.  Members of the public will be 

kept on mute until it is time for public comment.  I'll give 

instructions on how to comment at that time, but you will 

also find instructions on the city's webpage for remote 

Planning Board meetings. 

          We'll start by asking staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all Board members are audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

Jeff Roberts from Community Development.  You'll be hearing 

my voice from time to time just to take care of some 

administrative tasks, including taking attendance at the 

meeting.   

          So present remotely at today's meeting are 

Planning Board members Lou Bacci, H Theodore Cohen, Mary 

Flynn, Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, Nikolas Bowie, 

Associate Member; and Catherine Preston Connolly, the Chair.   

          I'm going to go through that list again.  I'm just

going to ask all the Planning Board members whether or not 

the meeting is visible and audible to you, and I'll indicate 

whether you are visible and audible.  So starting with Louis 

Bacci, is the meeting visible and audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, it's visible and 

audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and you are also visible

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes, good evening.  The meeting

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Tom, and you are visible

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Niko, and you are 

visible and audible to us.  And Catherine, is the meeting 

visible and audible to you?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It is visible and 

audible to me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, and you're visible and 

audible to us, so that is six full members of the Board and 

one Associate Member present.  And I'll turn it back over to 

you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  So the 

first item is an Update from Community Development 

Department, and so will the speaker introduce any staff who 

will be speaking tonight as well during that update?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  I will take care of that.

Thank you to the Chair.  I'll put myself on video for a 

second.  I am Jeff Roberts, the Director of Zoning and 

Development.  I'll just very quickly introduce the staff who 

are in attendance: 

          Swaathi Joseph in Zoning and Development is the 

one who is managing the presentation, so if you need to pull 

up a slide or the agenda or anything else on the 

presentation screen, she'll be the one doing that. 

          Jessica Caamano is also helping us out.  She's a 

Business Analyst with Community Development, and is also 

helping us on the technical side.  We have Iram Farooq, the 

Assistant City Manager for Community Development is 

available at any time to answer any questions. 

          Also from my team in Zoning and Development:   

Daniel Messplay, Liza Paden, whom you know; and Sarah Scott 

are in attendance for support.  We have the city's Deputy 

Director for Community Development and Chief Planner Khalil 

Mogassabi.   

          We also have from Community Development's Urban 

Design team Erik Thorkildsen and Suzannah Bigolin will she 

may not be on at the -- I believe she may or may not be on, 

but she will be joining us.

          And from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department we will have later in the meeting Joe Barr, the 

Director of Traffic, Parking and transportation, and Adam 

Shulman from his department.   

          Also we have from our IT staff [00:31:27] 

indiscernible proper name] is currently here.  From our IT 

staff, we have Chris Gavrin (phonetic), who is also helping 

to provide support.   

          So those are all the people who are here, and here 

we are for the first remote virtual Planning Board meeting.  

I'm just going to give a quick update, because we'll have -- 

we'll have a few sort of housekeeping type business items to 

go through first.   

          But just in terms of our schedule update, this 

meeting is intended to be for General Business items, and 

this includes some items that were left over when we put 

meetings on hiatus back in March.  So we'll be spending some 

amount of time going back through items that were left on 

our agenda at that point. 

          On June 30, we have another -- the next Planning 

Board meeting scheduled.  It will also be a remote meeting.  

It will also be for General Business items that were left

over from March. 

          And then beginning on July 14 is when we are 

expecting to start rescheduling our public hearing items, so 

special permit cases that were unacted on back in March when 

the meetings went on hiatus will begin having their hearings 

starting July 14. 

          From there, we expect we will schedule meetings as 

best we can, depending on the timing through which we 

proceed with those remote hearings, and the amount to which 

we need to allow additional time to get through cases.   

          But we will be updating our website regularly and 

providing information to the public and using our normal 

notification procedures for public hearings, as we schedule 

cases going on in the future. 

          So I'll just end my update there, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Are there any 

questions from Board members for Jeff at this time, and if 

so, state your name before asking your question?   

          [Pause]   

          Hearing none, we'll move onto the next item of 

business, which is the approval of meeting minutes.

                   Bowie            

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We'll 

 move on to the next item on the agenda, which is a 

 discussion and possible temporary suspension of certain 

 Planning Board rules while the meetings are being held

 remotely.   

           So I will pass this back over to the CDD staff to 

 summarize what we're looking at and why we're looking at 

 possibly suspending some of the rules.  

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair, this is 

 Jeff Roberts again.  So as the Board members are aware, the 

 Planning Board has rules, and many of those rules have to do 

 with meeting procedures.   

           As we were preparing for moving into a remote 

 meeting format reviewed the existing Planning Board rules to 

 try to figure out which ones might not be achievable, as we 

 are going into a remote meeting format.                 

           The Board can vote to suspend any of their rules 

 or any part of those rules by a two-thirds vote, and because 

 we on the staff often hear from applicants and other members 

 of the public who like to prepare for Planning Board 

 meetings, we think that it would make sense for the Board to 

 discuss and to determine in advance which of those rules 

 would be suspended. 

           So I'll just very quickly, you know, point out, 

 and Swaathi's put the text of the rules on the screen to 

 follow along.  In Section 5.1, there is a requirement for 

13

22

 preapplication community engagement for the Planning Board 

 meetings.   

           This was incorporated in the Planning Board rules 

 about three or four years ago.  And it encourages a sort of 

 robust community outreach program that applicants should 

 undertake before they submit their application.   

           But one specific rule is that a community meeting 

 must be hosted at a time and a location that's convenient to 

 residents in proximity of the project site.   

           And given restrictions on public gatherings at 

 this time, and given that the Planning Board itself has 

 moved to a remote format, that specific requirement is one 

 that may be difficult to meet. 

           Some applicants have suggested -- and you'll hear 

 a little bit later in the meeting -- that there have been 

 some attempts in place of a meeting at a physical location 

 to have remote meeting similar to the one that we're having 

 now.   

           So that's an option the Planning Board could -- 

 again, the Board only would need to suspend specific parts 

 of its rules, so it could suspend the rule for simply 

 requiring the physical meeting, and that could allow for 

14

 meetings to occur in the remote format.   

           So if we could go to the next page…  

           [Pause]   

           Sometimes it takes a second.  So the other 

 provisions in the Planning Board rules -- again, around the 

 same time, as you see sort of on the bottom of page 4 

 towards the bottom of page 4 -- there is a requirement for a 

 physical model of development project next to the -- and 

 with the surrounding area -- to be presented at a public 

 hearing, because the public hearings aren't going to be held 

 physically; it wouldn't be possible to bring a model to the 

 meeting.   

           There are alternatives that Board members could 

 discuss.  There could still be a requirement to create a 

 model, although it wouldn't necessarily be brought to the 

 meeting, and would have to be presented in some other way 

 through photographs or otherwise. 

           But that is a provision that would need to be 

 suspended in some manner in order for the communities to 

 proceed in a remote format. 

           And If you go to the next page, just as a small 

 point, there is a point in the Planning Board rules about --

15

 it's on page, it's the number 6.5 -- which says that all 

 individuals willing to speak at a meeting should sign the 

 list provided for the purpose at the hearing, because there 

 is no physical location and no physical list for people to 

 sign. 

           We have developed a format and a protocol for 

 taking public comment online or by computer or by telephone 

 at these remote meetings.  So that would need to be sort of 

 a detail for meetings to be suspended as well. 

           So again, the Board can discuss this, and it would 

 require a two-thirds vote for suspension.  And the rules 

 could be suspended for the duration of the time that the 

 Planning Board is conducting its meetings remotely.  

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Jeff, this is 

 Catherine Preston Connolly.  You went over 6.3 and 6.5; I 

 think you skipped 6.4, which kind of splits the two pages.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, and 6.4 if you go to the page 

 before this one, so -- right, so it says any individual may 

 appear in person.   

           So that would be -- I guess that would be another 

 detail with another provision that the individuals are not 

 appearing in person at the meeting, but they are in

 accordance with the Governor's Emergency actions 

 participating through a remote format.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  Do 

 other Board members have clarifying questions for Jeff 

 before we start discussion of suspension of the rules?  Then 

 we'll move to discussion.   

           Any Board members who want to discuss suspending 

 the rules that the staff has identified as being infeasible 

 during this time of remote meetings?  Anyone want to speak 

 on any one of those rules?       

           MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, this is Mary Flynn.  I 

 just wanted to say that I understand the reasons for all of 

 the recommended suspensions, and generally I'm in agreement.  

           But I would want to ensure that there is a very 

 concerted effort to try to complete the community engagement 

 piece -- you know, by Zoom or some other method like this 

 where people can be engaged.    

           I know it might not reach everybody that we might 

 otherwise through a regular community meeting, but I think 

 it's probably the best we can do under the circumstances.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted, did I see you 

 looking to be recognized as well?

           H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes, this is Ted Cohen.  I was 

 going to say that I think the community engagement is an 

 important piece, and while I'm perfectly happy to suspend it 

 being held in a physical locale, I think to the extent 

 feasible, it should still be required in some sort of remote 

 aspect. 

           I've actually heard from other communities that 

 are doing things remotely that they're getting actually 

 larger public attendance than when people had to physically 

 come to a meeting.  So it may be that having some remote 

 community engagement would actually be a good fit.  

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Tom?             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, yeah.  I raised my 

 hand digitally, seeing if it would work.  This is Tom 

 Sieniewicz.  I actually wanted to have a little bit of 

 discussion around the requirement of the model, 

 notwithstanding the previous two comments, which I endorsed 

 thoroughly.   

           After 12 weeks of having digital meetings, the 

 world is definitely getting used to the format, certainly 

 seeing the enthusiasm at the City Council meeting the last 

 couple of nights.  It seems a regular part of our business

 now.   

           The model, although we can see it and use it as a 

 tool physically, is an important part of how one thinks as a 

 designer about a context in a neighborhood.   

           And, you know, I don't want to tell professionals 

 how to do their work, but having that requirement in there 

 really in our rules serves two functions.   

           1) To quickly understand what the effect of the 

 proposal would be on the neighborhood by the Planning Board 

 and by the general public, but it also serves as a tool for 

 the professional to verify his assumptions -- his or her 

 assumptions about what the effects of height and massing and 

 details might be on the community. 

           So I'd be reluctant to discourage that.  I think 

 even though we can't see it physically, I think it still 

 would be a really useful tool for not only professionals, 

 but to some degree also for us.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

 comments on that question? Hugh?             

           HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  You had a --            

           HUGH RUSSELL:  So I think nowadays when you make a

 three-dimensional model, it's quite likely that it's made 

 through a printing process.  So there is a three-dimensional 

 computer model used by the designers, and then instructions 

 are given to a machine to make the model.   

           You could also give instructions to produce 

 bird's-eye renderings from, say four quadrants, which is the 

 view that we get when we're sitting in our chairs or walking 

 around the model. 

           So if we're not going to require a model, I think 

 we should require bird's-eye perspectives of a comparable 

 area to what a model would show, as part of somebody's 

 presentation.  That's it.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

 further discussion on that?  Yeah, Tom?             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I agree with Hugh.  That would be 

 one way to solve it, but those of us who've practiced for 

 years understand the drawings have a power of illusion that 

 actually is shattered by the model.   

           The model, the abstraction and the physical 

 representation of the model doesn't allow you to add the 

 entourage, add a particularly favorable view let's say that 

 would show your building in the most flattering light.

           So they're not the same.  I don't think you can 

 replace the model with the aerial perspectives.  And I would 

 also say to Hugh's point about models these days being 3D 

 printed, it used to be that we stayed up late with glue and 

 a knife and put them all together with paper, cardboard and 

 wood, and now the models are done -- you know, I'd like to 

 think with just the press of a button, it's a little more 

 involved than that, but the labor that used to be exerted to 

 build architectural models has been relieved to a vast 

 degree by the onset and universal acceptance of 3D printing 

 in the profession.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So one thing that we 

 could do then is suspend the rules for them to present the 

 model at the physical location, since there isn't a physical 

 location, but require that one still be produced and shown 

 during a presentation, you know, with whatever video 

 technology the presenter might have.   

           Is that, Tom, what you have in mind?             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  That is what I have in mind, but 

 please, if there are other members that feel that I am 

 raising the bar too high for the threshold for exploration 

 of a special permit, I'm quite willing to listen to them.

           But that's my feeling, and I think we should not 

 waive the requirement for it.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Niko?                 

           NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I think -- this is Niko -- if the 

 purpose of suspending the rule is for our benefit, I would 

 understand it.  But if the purpose of suspending the rule is 

 for the benefit of the architects, I feel like architects 

 will know what's best for figuring out how to best represent 

 their project. 

           And so, I personally do not think that I would 

 benefit from seeing a 3D model on video.  And if they want 

 to show a 3D model in their computer, I would get exactly 

 the same perspective, and they could manipulate it, and they 

 wouldn't have to print it or have someone go into an office 

 just for this purpose. 

 front of me is fine.    

           So I think the current iteration of what I see in 

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

 comments?  It sounds like from the discussion, or lack 

 thereof, that the question of whether or not to require a 

 physical model is really the only matter where the Board 

 might have some variance of opinion.

           What I have heard so far indicates that we 

 collectively are supportive of allowing the community 

 involvement piece to occur virtually, but it still must 

 occur.   

 not?   

           It doesn't sound like there's any issue with 

 allowing people to appear remotely or sign in remotely, 

 which are Sections 6.4 and 6.5.  It really is just this 

 question of do we want to see a physical model remotely or 

           And I guess I tend to fall on the same side as 

 Niko.  I don't have the same kind of eye for design and 

 appreciation of scale the same way that an architect might.  

           And so, for me, the difference between seeing a 

 video of a model versus a 3D rendering I'm not sure -- I 

 think that difference is lost on me.   

           But if other people -- if there are other people 

 who feel strongly as Tom does, that that should be available 

 to the Board members for whom it is valuable, we can 

 certainly have that -- we can suspend the rule that they 

 present it in person at the meeting, but still require them 

 to present it virtually.  Okay.     

           H THEODORE COHEN:  Hi, it's Ted Cohen.  Well, I've

 always found the models very helpful when we have them in 

 front of us and can walk around them.  I'm -- like you, like 

 the Chair, I'm not certain how much I would get out of 

 seeing a video of the physical model or a photo of the 

 physical model, although I do appreciate that there have 

 been many times when I thought that the renderings that were 

 presented to us were almost lying as to what they were 

 showing.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   I know.     

           H THEODORE COHEN:  And so, you know, 

 technologically, I don't know what would be the most helpful 

 to me to see it in this type of Zoom environment.  But I do 

 think we still should require some sort of presentation that 

 includes a model or a functional equivalent of a model.     

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Tom?             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah, one last point, I don't 

 want to belabor this too much further, but look: Architects 

 are fiduciaries, they're going to work on behalf of their 

 client to try to show the projects in the most flattering 

 light, and Ted is correct in his prompting me with this 

 thought.   

           You know, the model is right to some degree and

 again -- yes, you're right, Niko; you can show the most 

 flattering perspective of the model in a photograph, but 

 there's a way in which that pierces that natural tendency.  

           I don't blame my brothers and sisters in the 

 profession for doing that, for trying to express their ideas 

 and advocate for the best thing features for the best 

 features for their clients.   

           But the model is another way of looking at it.  

 And it pierces that illusion.  It's a miniature world.  It 

 can be used to seduce and make points as well, but I've 

 always found that that perspective is not only useful in the 

 production of design, but also in the harder and colder 

 evaluation of what's best for a given context.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Louie?   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  I kind of agree with 

 Tom and Hugh, the models do help with the massing and the -- 

 it would be nice if this were on a turntable, or a better 

 view, a level view of it.  Even though it is a miniature, it 

 does help a lot with the overall view of the project.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right, 

 well I'm persuaded that enough members of the Board would 

 find it useful that I would suggest we keep it as a 

25

 requirement that a model be produced and shown as part of 

 the presentation, even if the presentation itself and 

 therefore the model will be remote.   

           Are there any final points on that?  Anyone feel 

 strongly that we should not do that?  Okay?  Are we then 

 prepared to take action on suspending the rules as we have 

 discussed for Rule# 5.1, 6.3, 6.4 and 6.5, but requiring for 

 rules 5.1 and 6.3 that essentially the requirements -- the 

 only requirement that is being suspended is the in person 

 aspect of it, that you are still required to have community 

 meetings..  you are still required to produce and show a 

 model, you just don't have to do those in person, as we are 

 suspending the rules?   

           [Pause]   

           Okay, I'm taking the silence that yes, we're ready 

 to take action on this.  So is there a motion to suspend the 

 rules, as I've just described?             

           HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell, so move.

 have been disconnected, so I'm going to just say absent for 

 the time being, and it's a -- the vote would then be five in 

 favor, one opposed and one absent.  So that would still be a 

 two-third majority to carry.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Alright.  Jeff, 

 should we take a brief recess, and to see if we could get

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Back.     

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- has rejoined us, 

 so we can reconvene the meeting.  Our next item on the 

 agenda is a discussion and possible adoption of Mass. 

 General Law Chapter 110G regarding the use of electronic 

 signatures by the Planning Board members pursuant to 

 amendment 13.7 to the Massachusetts Deed Indexing Standards 

 of 2018, effective April 17,2020. 

           And again, I'm going to turn to CDD staff and ask

 them to describe what's before us and why?   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

 Jeff Roberts, again.   And just to briefly summarize this, I 

 think I'm getting a bit of an echo.  So if there's someone 

 with their audio on, they might consider muting.  I 

 apologize.   

           So we've been advised by the city's Law Department 

 that the Commonwealth's Registries of Deeds have accepted an 

 amendment to the Massachusetts Deed Indexing Standards of 

 2018, with the effective date of the amendment being April 

 17,2020, which allows for municipal boards to utilize 

 electronic signatures on documents that are filed with the 

 Registries of Deeds, such as special permit decisions by the 

 Planning Board. 

           So the amendment requires that a municipal Board 

 both get a public meeting to accept the provisions of GLC 

 110G, the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act, prior to 

 executing documents by electronic signature.   

           So just to put that in simpler terms, when the 

 Planning Board -- those of you who are the Chair, or have 

 chaired the Planning Board know that when the Planning Board 

 votes on a special permit decision, the decision is drafted, 

29

 and then has to be signed in multiple copies by the Planning 

 Board Chair.   

           It has to be signed in pen and filed, and the 

 Registry of Deeds has to accept an original signed copy.   

           And they have amended their rules so that they now 

 can accept electronically signed copies, and the upshot of 

 this is that it will be a logistical benefit for the 

 Planning Board Chair or whoever's acting as Chair for a 

 particular decision, as well as your staff.   

           So it's a procedural point, and the Law Department 

 and we on staff would recommend that the Board accept this 

 provision.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Do Board 

 members have any clarifying questions for Jeff?   

           [Pause]   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, hearing none --      

           MARY FLYNN:  Can that --   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mary?       

           MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, sorry, I was on mute.  Jeff, 

 was I understanding that this happens every time that we 

 agree on a special permit on going to approve one that we 

 would then approve this option for a signature as well?

 Planning Board just has to take this vote now.         

           MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  And that vote would then get 

 reported with the Registry, and from that point on, the 

 Registry could accept electronic signatures.         

           MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right, thank you.     

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Any other 

 clarifying questions for Board members?  Any discussion of 

 the proposal?     

           [Pause]    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Are Board 

 members prepared to take action on --  

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted raised his hand.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, Ted raised his 

 hand.  Ted?     

           H THEODORE COHEN:  I just wanted to -- Ted Cohen.  

 When I was Chair, I always enjoyed coming into the CDC 

 office to sign things and see people.  But I see no reason, 

 given the circumstance, to force the Chair to go in, or to

 force staff members to have to physically go to the Registry 

 of Deeds to file things.      

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

 comments or discussion?  No?  All right.  Then do we -- so 

 we would -- the motion we'd be looking for to take action on 

 is that the City of Cambridge Planning Board hereby 

 recognizes and accepts the provisions of MGL Chapter 110G 

 regarding electronic signatures, and that its members will 

 henceforth execute documents either with electronic 

 signatures or with wet ink signatures, and that both will 

 carry the same legal weight in effect?  Do I have a motion 

 to that effect?     

           [Pause]  

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So moved.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Louie Bacci moves the 

 motion.  Do I have a second?       

           MARY FLYNN:  Mary Flynn, second.      

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Roll call

           JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you very much.  

 All right.  Moving right along then to agenda item #3.  

            CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay. Our next item 

 on the agenda is the Preapplication Conference for the 

 Cambridgeside PUD pursuant to Sections 13.102 10 (sic) and 

 12.33 of the zoning ordinance.   

           CDD staff -- where we are, and then we will hear 

 from the proponent.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, thank you to the Chair, and I 

 just wanted to start briefly by explaining what a

 preapplication conference means.   

           So this is an area of the city that was subject to 

 a zoning change that was adopted last year, established a 

 new planning and development or PUD Zoning District, and so 

 that affects that for development in that area -- would be 

 to submit an application for a Planned Unit Development for 

 review and approval by the Planning Board. 

           And there are several steps that go into that.  

 There are several formal steps that begin with the 

 submission of an application, but the zoning also provides 

 that a developer can come to the Planning Board for a 

 preapplication conference. 

           And according to the zoning, the purpose of the 

 preapplication conference shall be to familiarize both the 

 developer and the Planning Board with each other's 

 intentions with respect to the PUD. 

           And it's an opportunity basically for discussion.  

 Nothing that is presented is, or said by the either the 

 Planning Board or the developer is necessarily binding.  

 It's just an opportunity for a dialogue to present some 

 issues and to help highlight some of the considerations that 

 will come up when the Board undergoes the more formal review 

34

 process. 

           And in this particular district, unlike in other 

 circumstances, the preapplication conference is actually 

 required.  So that's why the developer is here today, and 

 I'll turn it over from there.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So our 

 presenter for the applicant is going to be Rick McKinnon.  

 Please begin by introducing yourself and any other speakers 

 on your team.  And then begin your presentation.  You'll 

 have up to 30 minutes, unless the Board decides to grant 

 additional time.     

           RICHARD MCKINNON:  Thank you, Chair Catherine 

 Preston Connolly.  This is Rich McKinnon, and I'm a 

 Development Consultant for Cambridgeside.  With us tonight 

 to also do part of the presentation is John Twohig; and 

 David Manfredi, our architect from Elkus Manfredi. We 

 switched the page.    

           [Pause]    

 the next slide?   

           RICHARD MCKINNON:  Are you able, Jeff, to move to 

           JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sure it's being done.  

 Sometimes it just takes a second to show up.

           RICHARD MCKINNON:  Oh, okay, thank you.  Here we 

 go.   

           As Jeff said, what we're doing tonight is a 

 preapplication conference, and we do not want to get down 

 into the weeds and into the details, but rather give the 

 Planning Board and the public a good sense and overview of 

 what this project is, and how we're going to go forward to 

 hopefully get it approved and build it sometime. 

           This image right here is the land that Steve Karp 

 put together, began assembling about 40 years ago.  And it 

 actually looked like that.  It did not come with 

 instructions.   

           And so, Steve and the City of Cambridge figured 

 out how to do it in a way that Cambridgeside Galleria, as 

 you know it today, opened in 1990. 

           We are here 30 years after that, because the model 

 that served us very, very well doesn't anymore, and I think 

 that's true of many of the retail centers like us.  We would 

 like to work with the Planning Board and begin tonight after 

 the zoning was done to get a project that will help us stay 

 vital and stay a good part of the community for the next 30 

 years.

           So we can go to the agenda.  John Twohig is going 

 to do the first two items.  The first is he's going to 

 update the Planning Board on the project.  And most of that 

 has to do with issues of timeline and submission. 

           Next, John will do a project description.  There 

 are a thousand ways to describe the project, but he's going 

 to focus on some key ones that are an important part of the 

 development plan -- the zoning, the development program; 

 what are the uses, sizes and other elements?   

           And then because it's always not simple for folks 

 to follow, we think we're going to be able to do it very 

 easily and very cleanly, but phasing deserves a conversation 

 of its own, and John will finish by doing that. 

           After John, our architect, David Manfredi, is 

 going to come up.  David will do another type of description 

 of the project different from John's.  Not surprisingly, 

 David is going to focus on issues of urban design and 

 architecture. 

           So that finishes my little opening.  And John, are 

 we ready to turn it to you?   

           JOHN TWOHIG:  I just want to be sure that you can 

 hear me okay, as we begin and talk about Cambridgeside.

 Thank you for letting us be here tonight.  As Richard 

 mentioned, as we look at the slide, if we could just focus 

 for a minute on the timeline, and we'll try to march through 

 quickly our presentation.   

           But as you look at 2019, as Richard mentioned last 

 year, and Jeff mentioned, we were able to get the PUD-8 

 zoning approved towards the end of the year.  What have we 

 been doing since then really focused on in the last period 

 of time from January to June, the PUD special permit 

 prefiling process?  And I know some of the members mentioned 

 the need for a robust community process.   

           Just to give you a little bit of background, in 

 March we had the City Council preapplication presentation, 

 but then in April we had a community meeting.   

           And at the community meeting, we had over 68 

 people join, 15 to 18 questions went on for about two hours 

 and 15 minutes -- I have to say a very robust process, which 

 we're very pleased by people being involved in that.   

           And then last week had the opportunity to meet 

 with ECPT again in a Zoom meeting and go through some of the 

 information.   

           Our expectation is we will move forward through 

38

 prefiling through taking a formal filing with the Planning 

 Board, then move through sort of special permit building 

 design with a focus on what -- for lack of a better 

 terminology -- the Sears and the Macy's building. 

           Our expectation is that our initial redevelopment 

 will really be through the Sears and Macy's building 

 streetscape Canal Park and Thorndike Way, and that's why you 

 see on the site really the period of 2020 to 23, and then 

 finally the future development, which would be -- normally 

 would call the Best Buy and the Upper Garage building, which 

 would come at a later date. 

           As we talked about during the rezoning process, we 

 have the issue of the Mall must stay open.  We must be able 

 to both keep that electrified and loaded.  So it really is a 

 process of being able to keep one side of the Mall open at 

 all times. 

           The next slide, if we could move to it, is really 

 the structural permit submission materials.  We have for you 

 a four-volume set coming in.  I'm not going to go through 

 what's in the four volumes.   

           But, as you might imagine, in Volume 1 focusing on 

 the building materials, application, some of the narratives,

 talking about zoning, some of the technical part -- so 

 Volume 2 is really plans and graphics, all the things that 

 you would expect to see.   

           Plus remember as we wrote the zoning for this PUD-

 8, we expanded on some of the things.  But we'll have 

 phasing plans, massing plans, housing plans, utility plans, 

 high [01:18:18 indiscernible] plans, all of those things in 

 the second volume.   

           And a third volume: Building-specific detailed 

 plans and graphics.  As I mentioned, our focus is what we're 

 terming now "the Macy's building," which is really 20 

 Cambridgeside, where you'll see the schematic design -- some 

 great level of detail on that building. 

           And then 60 First Street, which is really the 

 Sears building -- again, high level of detail on there. And 

 then as you move down First Street, 80 and 90 First and 110 

 First would come and you'll see more on a conceptual basis 

 we're really focused on significant design with respect to -

 - [again I'll use the same sort of, "the Sears and the 

 Macy's building."]    

           And the final volume is really the technical 

 studies and reports -- things like the Tree Study, which

 we've been working with staff on; Green Building Report; 

 Traffic Impact Study, which we have been working with staff 

 on on scope and other related materials. 

           Just by way of background, we thought it might be 

 important that you know that some of the improvements that 

 we've made since -- you know, we met in October, then 

 obviously went into the City Council.   

           Some of the things that we focused on, which I 

 know were topics at the Planning Board, but we thought we'd 

 just touch on very briefly: The issue of expanded public 

 benefits, increased commitment to affordable housing.   

           We ended up changing -- I think when last we were 

 formally in front of you, we were at 50 percent rate of 

 affordable, middle-income units.  We actually went to 65.  

 Our affordable family-sized units went from 10 to 20, so 

 that actually all of our family-sized units are affordable. 

           Rather than focusing on the DCR boathouse, there 

 was a request for a commitment to the East End House, with a 

 long history of supporting the community.  It's a 

 substantial commitment, it's a $9 million-dollar commitment;  

 $4 million in the first payment and $5 million in the 

 second.

           A lot of discussion with regard to some of the 

 advanced -- if you could go onto the next slide, Jeff, the 

 advanced Net Zero rate commitments that were asked for, and 

 we agreed no fossil fuels associated with our residential 

 use. 

           And then also additional transportation 

 commitments.  So that as part of our physical improvements 

 in addition to those, and a $7 million-dollar commitment for 

 transportation.  And then part of that coming out of that 

 really refining the building design, with the focus on the 

 Macy's and the Sears. 

           Jeff, let's go to the next slide, just to give you 

 a sense of the proposed plan.  We sort of put in proposed 

 plan equals the approved zoning plan.   

           And what we're meaning by that, that which we 

 spent a lot of time with the Board talking about the square 

 footage, talking about the height, talking about the 

 critical elevations and setbacks, which David will get into 

 more detail, and the commitments to 200 units of affordable 

 and low-income units were really the things that we talked 

 about and became part of the zoning. 

           So what we're going to be bringing forward to you 

42

 as our proposed plan is 100 percent consistent with the 

 approved zoning.   

           In the next slide, if we could move to, Jeff, it's 

 really just touching on the site development plan, 

 confirming as you walk around the site -- and David will do 

 this in greater detail -- the 85-foot Sears building moving 

 through the Upper Garage up to the former Lechmere Best Buy 

 building, and then around to the Macy's building. 

           A lot of discussion about maintaining the core as 

 it was, having the height grading back from the Canal, 

 obviously maxing the height and the maximum opportunity at 

 155, where that would come down. 

           And then the square footage, as you see on the 

 right-hand side of the chart, the [01:22:01 indiscernible 

 net new] remaining is at 575, just to reinforce how we 

 thought about this and how we approached it, so we had 

 consistency between the zoning and much of what we showed to 

 you at the time of the zoning. 

           And then lastly, before I turn it over to David, 

 if Jeff you could go to the next slide, you can see the 

 phasing plan.  And this I just think would be helpful if you 

 look at it closely for a moment, look at the purple outline,

 which is primarily around the Canal and over by Macy's and 

 in front of Sears.   

           That’s when I talked about the timeline about what 

 we intend to do first.  It's really focusing on the Macy's 

 building, it's focusing on the Sears building, the related 

 public realm, and then all of the Canal as part of our sort 

 of first phase with the later phases of additional landscape 

 work First Street and the buildings coming at a later time. 

           So hopefully that sets the stage for where we're 

 at, and David will walk you through.  I'm cognizant of time, 

 obviously; some of the design [that] you'll be seeing when 

 we actually make the filing with CD.   

           David?   

           DAVID MANFREDI:  Good evening, everybody.  This is 

 David Manfredi from Elkus Manfredi Architects.  As you all 

 know, when Cambridgeside Galleria opened in 1990, it was 

 highly acclaimed for its urban design as an urban mall that 

 didn't use traditional anchors.  It connected Charles Park 

 to Canal Park.            

           It's many years later, and we have an opportunity 

 to reinvent Cambridgeside as mixed-use with multiple 

 addresses, street-level retail that will activate sidewalks 

44

 on First Street, on Cambridgeside and even around the corner 

 on the Land Boulevard 

           The point of this slide is really the opportunity 

 -- to show the opportunity of creating more porosity through 

 the site, the traditional from Charles Park to Canal Park, 

 but also from the neighborhood into the retail for new 

 entrances for office, lab, residential; but also a series of 

 new storefronts on Thorndike Way, on First Street, and on 

 Cambridgeside, as you please.   

           You will remember from our zoning amendment -- and 

 if I can go to the next slide, page 14 -- that we have -- 

           [Pause, "I think we might be stuck"] 

           -- and there we go, beautiful, thank you -- that 

 the new construction, the new buildings -- and they are the 

 buildings on First Street; they are the buildings at 110 

 First, the former Best Buy site, and 80 and 90 First, which 

 is the parking garage site -- we have proposed additional 

 setback from the curb that will take sidewalks which today 

 are empty and make them 20 feet to provide greater sidewalk 

 activity, allow restaurants and retail to spill out.   

           We have proposed setbacks on those new buildings.  

 They are 10-foot setbacks at a height of 65 feet, and then a

 second setback at a height of 135 feet.  These setbacks 

 occur on First Street as well as on Cambridgeside Place.   

           They obviously give the buildings a rhythm and a 

 connection to the height of the adjacent buildings, and they 

 also provide more daylight to the street. 

           And then additionally, we are proposing a material 

 pallet of stone, of brick, of terra cotta that I will show 

 you in a moment, that is very consistent, although 

 reinvented and reinterpreted to the historic, industrial 

 fabric of the adjacent neighborhood.  And that's -- that 

 will -- I will show you that all along First Street, as well 

 as on Land Boulevard. 

           On the next slide, you can see the sense of an 

 urban street wall.  And if I start from the bottom and work 

 my way up, the idea of a kind of traditional urban street 

 wall that has a base, it -- I'm going to show you a 

 different buildings stone and brick, but brick with real 

 articulation, with rustication with detail. 

           Middle to these buildings that is different in 

 different buildings, but -- again, brick of different color, 

 of different texture, more modern, and terra cotta.   

           And then tops to the buildings that include wood

 cornice, masonry, metal -- in one case zinc -- and then 

 penthouse enclosure on 20 Cambridgeside that is in fact 

 glass, channel glass, make the building lighter at its top.    

           You go to the next slide, and so, I'll spend a 

 little bit time on 20 Cambridgeside, which is the former 

 Macy's site, and on 60 First Street, which is the former 

 Sears site. 

           And our strategy on the Macy's building is to 

 demolish the building down to the second floor.  So the 

 first floor structure and the parking below grade will 

 remain intact.  The purpose of that is to maintain the 

 existing infrastructure, the loading docks, which are off 

 the street, some of the existing electrical infrastructure, 

 which is in place, and allows us to minimize disruption to 

 the surrounding neighborhood with building new foundations. 

           You can see in color the new lobby, with the 

 adjacent retail, it wraps around Cambridgeside Place onto 

 Land Boulevard.  And then you can see all of those existing 

 loading docks. 

           The ramp down to the parking will remain in place.  

 The new entrance that we've just created in the past year to 

 100 Cambridgeside, which is the third floor of the Mall, 

47

 provides another entrance along these lots and more activity 

 along these edges. 

           The 20 Cambridgeside building is 155 feet tall.  

 It is 10 stories, and it again has these setbacks at 85 

 feet, and at 135 feet.  In addition to the 155 feet of pipe 

 there's a 35-foot mechanical penthouse. 

           If you go to the next slide, you can see at the 

 base the existing corner of Cambridgeside and Land Believed 

 -- highly articulated for an anchor department store, but to 

 be replaced with a new gateway to Cambridge -- basically the 

 base of a new office lab building, with entrance on 

 Cambridgeside Place. 

           We're looking into the lobby on the first floor, a 

 two-story space, and then offices and lab space above.  

 Clearly a modern building in how the brick is detailed, how 

 the windows are detailed.   

           But you'll also see detail in the brick at 

 spandrel panels, at the headers, that we've clearly studied 

 the tradition of brick, even in the very simple, mundane 

 buildings of the surrounding neighborhoods. 

           If you go to the next slide, we've kind of pulled 

 the pieces apart.  And I'll start at the bottom.  I'll start 

48

 with number 60, work my way up to building.  So the base of 

 the building has horizontal brick belts with articulated 

 brick detailing -- this is at every spandrel where we are 

 using soldier courses of brick, we're turning brick, we're 

 creating patterning along the floor line. 

           Item #5, again a kind of modern detail -- the 

 sense of an extended window frame creating more texture and 

 depth to these building elevations.  At our first setback at 

 85 feet, which steps back 11 feet, we have a metal cornice 

 or a belt course that wraps around the building. 

           As we move up to the middle of the building, 

 vertical brick tiers.  And this is brick too.  We think 

 there's a brick from street level to 85 feet, a second brick 

 harmonious, but a second brick from 85 feet to 130 feet.  

 Another setback of 11 feet. 

           And then the top two floors of the building will 

 be clad in a bronze-colored metal panel, which will wrap 

 around to the anterior property line. 

           And then that brings us to the 155.  The penthouse 

 above will be wrapped in channel glass, to lighten the sense 

 of the mechanical floors on the top of the building. 

           On page 20, you can see a long view down Land

 Boulevard.  And you can see there the base, which is from 

 street level to 85 feet -- that's the five-story base;  a 

 second brick from 85 to 130 on floors six, seven and eight;  

 and then the top two floors 9 and 10 that stack again, and 

 that's a bronze colored metal panel; and then the penthouse 

 floors, which are the channel glass. 

           On the next slide, I'll introduce you to the 

 second building of what we see is the first generation of 

 buildings here.   

           This is 60 First Street; formerly the Sears 

 building.  And so, the Sears building is a renovation.  The 

 building footprint remains basically the same.  We will 

 demolish the top floor, the third floor; build a new third 

 floor, fourth floor and fifth floor so the building will be 

 five stories.  It will be 85 feet in height.  And again, 

 we'll have mechanical floors above the 85 feet that are 35 

 feet in height. 

           You can see what we call the Mall Connector.  This 

 goes to creating more porosity, so that there is an entrance 

 from the street along this Mall Connector.   

           Everything you see in the salmon color is retail. 

 That we'll be subdivided, it won't be big tenants.  Some of

 it will face the street.  Some of it will face Thorndike 

 Way, and some of it will face the Mall Connector, and will 

 connect into the food court on the first level of the 

 retail. 

           You can also see a separate in lavender color and 

 purple is the lobby to the building.  And again, direct 

 entrance out to the sidewalk, giving us a whole other group 

 of guests and activity out on the street.  And you can see 

 the ramp that goes to the parking -- the existing ramp that 

 goes to parking that eventually will go away when the garage 

 next door is in place. 

           You go to the next slide:  At the base of the 

 drawing you can see the existing First Street, which did 

 have a show of windows, but had a relatively high sill and 

 really not all that much to view into.   

           We will completely recreate the streetscape.  This 

 building will have a stone base, and then brick above; brick 

 with -- again probably what you would consider more 

 traditional detailing here, but a good deal of detailing in 

 the brick here with heads and sills in the masonry frame, 

 the openings. 

           And again, you can see the intention of creating

 this kind of more traditional urban street wall with a base, 

 a middle and a top -- but again, with more modern detailing.    

                And then on page 24, you can see all of the 

 parts and pieces again starting from the bottom.  That brick 

 base -- which is a story tall -- are storefronts, which give 

 a lot of transparency on three sides; on the First Street 

 side on Thorndike Way, and then on the Canal Park side…  

 rusticated brick on the spandrels, and then up to the top of 

 the building…   

           My leader line doesn't go exactly to the right 

 place.  It should go to the fifth floor, and that's our zinc 

 that creates this kind of attic story.  And then to the 

 penthouse above, the mechanical penthouse above.    

           You go to the next slide and you can see a view 

 looking south, southeast on First Street -- First Street 

 going to the right, Thorndike Way going to the left.  And 

 again, you can see that kind of urban order.  And you can 

 see the articulation of the brick, the setback at the very 

 top floor, the cornice above, and the wood that in the 

 horizontal plane of that cornice. 

           You can also see Thorndike Way.  We will now have 

 retail restaurants fronting on Thorndike Way, and we have

 the opportunity, although this is City of Cambridge land, to 

 do some lighting out here, bring restaurants out to the 

 sidewalk, and activate that edge. 

           The next section is about Canal Park and 

 streetscape improvements, and I want to show you a slide 

 #27, very similar to what John showed a moment ago.     

           Everything's outlined in purple along Canal Park 

 out onto First Street, part of 60 First; and then on the 

 corner of Cambridgeside and Land Boulevard are all [01:36:37 

 indiscernible per space] improvement. 

           And then in green are the improvements that will 

 come with 80 and 90 First and 110 First, and the little 

 pocket parks that I will describe in just a moment. 

           If you go to the next slide, you can see -- I want 

 to point out a series of improvements around Canal Park. And 

 the numbers on the plan on the right correspond to the 

 pictures on the left.  So now first is the edges of Canal 

 Park, and on the North Side #1. 

           If you go to the second photo down on the left, 

 that is the existing Canal walk.  The intent is the trees 

 will remain the same.  Basically, the configuration, the 

 width all remains the same.

           The improvements are the planting, the new seeding 

 -- basically making it more accessible and more welcoming to 

 a greater group of visitors.   

           On the right #2 is the proposal for improvements 

 to the underside of the Land Boulevard Bridge.  And if you 

 look just below that, you can see the existing bridge, or 

 the underside of the existing bridge, which is pretty dark.  

           Our intent is new pavement finishes, wood 

 flooring, new art installation, new lighting, the 

 opportunity to create a place where we can do all sorts of 

 installations and really activate that and make it 

 welcoming, and frankly make it much more secure than it is 

 today. 

           And then you see in photographs for #3,4,5 the 

 opportunity to make a series of improvements in programming 

 opportunities for kayak launch, and then #6 is the 

 improvements I just mentioned along Thorndike Way. 

           #29 -- again, this is really about Thorndike Way, 

 and make it more welcoming -- make a better connection from 

 the East Cambridge neighborhood through the Charles River by 

 making improvements in planting material in the uses along 

 the edge; the base of the 60 First Street; those kinds of

 towers that you see that will hold up cabinet lighting 

 above, and the opportunity for some local art installations 

 that may be changeable over time. 

           And also the most important thing is probably just 

 the activation of that edge. 

           And then on page 30, we have introduced two pocket 

 parks along First Street.  They're not big, but what they do 

 is they break down that big street wall, that kind of super 

 block.   

           And they separate the old Sears building from the 

 middle of the block, which is the replacement for the 

 parking garage from the building at 110 First, which is the 

 corner of First and Cambridgeside.   

           We haven't fully designed these.  The intent is to 

 collaborate with the city and with the neighborhood.  We've 

 suggested that they can be of different character.  They can 

 be passive, they can be more active, they can be children --

 focused, they can be surrounded by active uses within the 

 buildings. 

           And then page 31 -- and I'm very close to the end, 

 I think I've got two more slides -- you can see at the base 

 existing First Street.  It's a very dark photograph, but the

 point is that it's not of that very active street edge.  

           And the opportunity is really here between the 

 buildings to create these pocket parks, to let retail 

 restaurants turn the corners, to activate the private parks 

 with what goes out of them to make very transparent and 

 active operable bases to these buildings. 

           And then I think, well, I still have two more 

 left.  110 First Street the corner, which is Best Buy, will 

 become a new office lab building with retail wrapping around 

 the corner.   

           Again, you can see the setback at 65 feet.  This 

 building is clad in terracotta.  It is, again, more modern, 

 but clearly observes the kind of proportions and metrics of 

 the neighborhood in terms of the proportions of opening the 

 setbacks, the kind of traditional street walk. 

           And then on page 33, a long view down First 

 Street, where again you can see what we're trying to do with 

 our setbacks is make more daylight to the street, but also 

 connect into the heights of adjacent buildings.   

           Across the street, the height of the reinvented 

 Sears building, which will be 85 feet -- not as an 

 absolutely rigid data, but one that clearly creates this

 kind of street wall between 65 and 85, and then steps back 

 the taller buildings above. 

           And that -- with that, I will turn back to John 

 Twohig.   

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Great.  David, thank you, and Madam 

 Chair thank you for the time.  We tried to hold just to 30 

 minutes, so we're going to complete our presentation there, 

 and our next slide really does, you know, input observation 

 selections.  I would love to get a reaction from the Board 

 and others.  Any thoughts?   

           Again, we're at the beginning, we haven't formally 

 filed, obviously, but at that point I think we'll stop and 

 listen.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you so much.  

 Okay.  Are there questions or comments from Board members?  

 And reminder, just start with your name.  And unmute 

 yourself when you want to speak.       

           MARY FLYNN:  All right.  This is Mary Flynn.  Let 

 me start.  Thank you so much for your presentation, to all 

 of you.  It was very helpful, and it's exciting to be 

 looking forward on the project. 

           I guess in terms of phasing, I feel like -- and

 I'm sure probably the application is going into much more 

 detail about how much square footage is built out, what the 

 triggers are for the various commitments in the letter 

 agreement with the city, et cetera. 

           So I think the one thing I would ask you to 

 address tonight is just how that housing piece fits in in 

 terms of what is it that actually triggers the start of that 

 construction?   

           And I know it's considered to be in a later phase, 

 we're only talking about, you know, three or four years.  

 But I know that is a piece that many people are interested 

 in.   

           So I'd just like a better sense of how you see 

 that fitting into the overall scheme timewise, and the 

 reasons for it.   

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Through you, Chair, we did put in 

 the mitigation letter, and a commitment letter -- a very 

 specific commitment that our second new building we would go 

 into the residential piece.  So that would be at the end of 

 the project.   

           But we have a matrix in our filing that sort of 

 talks about when the different commitments -- many of them 

58

 are frontloaded; some occur over periods of years, but we 

 can go through that.   

           But the housing piece comes after our -- we do a 

 new commercial building, and then we would do the 

 residential building.  And that's about a 200-unit building 

 with the 65 percent affordable and middle-income quotient. 

           But that it set forth both in the mitigation 

 letter and in our application.       

           MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, I like the idea of the 

 matrix very much, because there are -- you certainly have 

 made a lot of commitments, which are truly wonderful and of 

 benefit to the city.  So it would be nice to just understand 

 the phasing on that. 

           Just so is the Sears building then -- you said 

 it's not changing in footprint, and it's actually reducing 

 in square footage, if I understood correctly, through the 

 sum?   

           JOHN TWOHIG:  No, it's currently a three-story 

 building.       

           MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Because it was a department store, 

 the roof was basically lightweight construction or lighter

 weight construction, we are going to remove the roof, and 

 then rebuild the third floor.         

           MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

           JOHN TWOHIG:  And then build two floors on top of 

 that.  So it's an addition of two floors.           

           MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So you're not considering 

 that, then your second new building?  You're just seeing it 

 as a renovation of an existing one, am I correct?     

           JOHN TWOHIG:  That's correct.         

           MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, okay.  All right, thank you. 

 Are there questions from Board members for the applicant?  

 Lou?   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I think Ted was first.      

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted?     

           H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, following up on what Mary 

 said, what -- I guess the question is what do you consider 

 your new buildings, and how they key into whether 

 residential is built?   

           And also, is there a reason why you didn't show us 

 tonight what the residential building might look like?  You 

 know, you're showing us the other buildings in great detail, 

 but somehow there's this big structure right in the middle

 on First Street that we're not seeing anything about.      

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Uh --    

           H THEODORE COHEN:  Let me go through all my 

 questions, and then you can --    

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Yep.       

           H THEODORE COHEN:  -- address them.  The next 

 issue is the penthouses look truly enormous to me.  I mean, 

 I appreciate -- you know, the optical glass you're putting 

 on top of the one on Land Boulevard, but it still looks 

 pretty enormous, and I really will expect a pretty clear 

 explanation of why they need to be so large.   

           I'm also -- not necessarily work you've done, but 

 throughout the city there have been a lot of penthouses that 

 have been built that do not look like the plans that were 

 shown to us, and I understand that, you know, you show us 

 something, or developers show us something, and then the 

 engineers say, "Oh no, you can't do this, you can't do that" 

 and it ends up being different. 

           I for one will expect that you will have figured 

 out with your engineers in advance what you really need and 

 what the penthouses are going to look like, so that the 

 board will have a clearer understanding of what they will

 be. 

           Another question I had is -- there are currently 

 two entrances to the garage on First Street, with the 

 removal of the upper part of the garage.  Do they totally 

 disappear, is that what becomes your pocket parks?  Or will 

 there still be a vehicle entrance on First Street? 

           I think those were my issues right now.     

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Thanks, Mr. Cohen.  A few things to 

 answer that.  The first new building will be -- in this 

 particular scenario, will be our Macy's building.   

           The next building will be residential.  We do not 

 include the Sears building as a new building, it's a 

 renovated building, and as you may remember, we went through 

 the zoning; that is in a separate ownership.   

           And part of all the challenge -- very candid, when 

 we talked a little bit about the zoning, we talked about the 

 City Council, is to build the residential building at 65 

 percent affordable and middle-income is challenging.   

           So our second building isn't that building, but it 

 would be -- we would build our first commercial building, 

 which in this case is the Macy's building.  So that's 

 actually how that's structured.

           I'll ask David to speak to -- we showed you some 

 of the imagery.  We have more imagery, obviously, in the 

 application, with respect to the residential building and 

 what I'll call the Lechmere/Best Buy building.  But clearly 

 our focus in our more advanced design will be on the Sears 

 renovation and the Macy's, but we will show that to you as 

 part of it. 

           With respect to First Street, there will still be 

 a garage entrance on First Street, and that will -- as well 

 as Cambridgeside. And that will be in place.  And so the 

 issue of the penthouse and the detail of the penthouse, I'll 

 let David speak to but we absolutely hear that point and 

 understand it. 

           DAVID MANFREDI:  We do.  The penthouse is on the 

 three commercial buildings, meaning on 20 Cambridgeside, 

 which is on the Macy's site and 110 First, which is on the 

 Best Buy site, and 60 First, which is on the Sears site. 

 Those penthouses are all 35 feet, and that's what you're 

 seeing and reacting to. 

           I completely understand your point about what we 

 show has to be what we build, and so, we are planning at 

 least in the Macy's building, Macy's site, and on the Sears 

63

 site, we are very -- in a very detailed way planning those 

 now, so that everything that has to go in those spaces in 

 fact stays within that envelope, and we don't exceed that 

 envelope.  But they are -- all three of those buildings, as 

 proposed have 35 foot tall penthouses above the roof. 

           The residential building, of course, is different, 

 and I can't even tell you what that would be at this moment, 

 but it's going to be determined by an elevator override and 

 significantly less -- probably less than half of that 

 height.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, back to the same -- on 

 the same subject, the new -- the Sears building, looking at 

 it quick: No side view, not a lot of good views of this 

 building yet.   

           It would appear that the matching metal from the 

 top floor of the Sears building and the mechanical enclosure 

 will blend together into a very large mechanical enclosure.   

           I don't know if you'll get enough separation with 

 that little awning roof that sticks out.  It looks like it 

 will be -- what, 45 feet?  50?  45, 48 feet?  It's going to 

 be a very gray structure on top of that building, especially

 with the neighbors that close by. 

           Also, on the Macy's building, the building seems 

 much shorter and wider.  Did we increase the width of this 

 building at all?  And yes, I agree with Ted; the mechanical 

 enclosure is enormous.     

           DAVID MANFREDI:  So I think if you go back through 

 -- I'll take the second question first -- if you go back 

 through the generations of different drawings that you have 

 seen, the building is wider than some of the those early 

 drawings I think by approximately 10 feet on floors -- I've 

 got to think -- six, seven and eight are wider.  And they 

 are over top of the existing Mall.  So you're correct there. 

           On 60 First Street -- and you can see it on the 

 slide that's on the screen right now -- the penthouse is 

 actually set -- you're right about coloration; the top floor 

 of the building, fifth floor of the building is clad in 

 zinc.   

           You know, zinc is a natural material that actually 

 will change color and finish over time.  The penthouse is 

 not zinc; it actually has quite a lot of detail in it, as 

 it's drawn today in order to give it some scale. 

           It's actually set back from First Street by 15

 feet, and set back on Thorndike Way, and set back on Canal 

 Park.  But I get your point, that -- you know, they are 

 similar in tone, but they are not coplanar, so I hope they 

 don't read as the combined height of those two component 

 parts; that's certainly not our intention.    

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  My concern was basically 

 from the same level of elevation from the residences around 

 the neighborhood, that they would seem very many the same. 

           Also, one other question:  I see the step backs 

 (sic) on the new Macy's site appear to be planted on the 

 parapets.  Is that your intention, or is that just some 

 dressing?     

           DAVID MANFREDI:  So that is our intention.  It 

 will most likely, as we have done some of these terraces in 

 Cambridge and in Boston -- most likely as a tenant 

 improvement, and tenants choose to do different things -- 

 but that's our goal is to bring some green up to the upper 

 floors of the building.   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Every time we see this done, 

 it rarely appears in the finished product.  If you don't 

 build it ahead of time to prepare it for your tenants, they 

 can't plant it anyway.

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  They never appear.     

           DAVID MANFREDI:  -- about structure.   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That's all I have for right 

 now.  I'd like to see the drawings clean; I'd like to see 

 your proposed buildings come out as proposed.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Any other comments 

 from Board members?             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I have a couple of comments.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Tom?             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Just trying to be helpful at this 

 stage in the process.  It's a big project, right?  We all 

 understand that.  It's a big part of East Cambridge, and 

 it's a big part of our waterfront.  And so, inherent in that 

 are some cautions.   

           And I just want to kind of give you a head's up.  

 As a Planning Board member, as the buildings come in and the 

 projects come in for special permits, these are the kinds of 

 things I might be looking for. 

           Because it's a big project, you know, of course 

 looking at the phasing and like, "Oh, couldn't we do all the 

 street at once, it's the public?"  but I understand you've

 got to keep them all doing, and that's a concern, right?  

 How do we keep that going, as you promised, and at the same 

 time do the massive and necessary redevelopment?   

           So I understand you can't touch all of the site 

 all at once and you have to logically phase it.  But I focus 

 on that open space, and thank you for the sheet that goes 

 through the details on Canal Park.   

           And thank you for saving the trees that are there.  

 Most landscape architects come in and the first thing they 

 get out is a chainsaw and a bulldozer to take down every 

 mature tree and plant new ones, for some reason. 

           And I appreciate the attitude of keeping the 

 mature canopy that’s there on Canal Park.  Tree canopy is a 

 concern in the community right now, so that kind of attitude 

 and commitment to the quality of landscape that surrounds 

 the place will be something this Board member is going to 

 focus on.   

           David Manfredi alluded to 20-foot wide sidewalks; 

 that's quite a promenade.   

           That's probably a good thing in the year of COVID 

 you can keep your six-foot-distance from a lot of people 

 over 20 feet, it's probably the appropriate distance for a 

68

 sidewalk.  But there's a lot of detail in what that space is 

 going to be like.  That's a lot of space; the quality of the 

 paving and how the restaurants might spill out on that; how 

 do you accommodate different modes of transportation around 

           The park's the best pocket.  Parks are also a gift 

 to the community.  So in order for those to be good, they're 

 going to need a lot of attention; I think you understand 

 that. 

 that. 

           And then lastly, because of the nature of this 

 being a very big project and a very large section of one of 

 our major streets in the city, you've done a fantastic job 

 of offering a certain amount of variety in the approaches to 

 the architecture as you move around the site.  That's 

 amazing, because it's all coming from one office.   

           I'm not suggesting that the owner do any 

 different; it's just that as the buildings come in one at a 

 time, as the projects come in for special permits, I'm going 

 to want to make sure that we maintain the qualities that are 

 promised in these renderings that suggest a variety in the 

 architectural approaches; suggest that there's delight and 

 surprise as you move along these very large elevations.  So

 I guess that would be the only thing.   

           The other thing that I would hold your feet to the 

 fire in future reviews of the project is the comparison of 

 building to building to building to make sure that that 

 variety that's promised in these elevations is maintained 

 and is ultimately delivered for the city. 

           So I tried to be helpful.  That's my view at this 

 point.  Thank you for this really good update.   

           DAVID MANFREDI:  Thank you.   

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Thank you.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh, I see you have 

 your hand raised as well?             

           HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes, I do.  So I have a sort of 

 procedural question, which is for a permit in 2020.  You're 

 going to come back in 2020 with a more detailed look at the 

 Best Buy garage site.   

           So in the -- are you going to -- when are we going 

 to look at detail on the architecture of Macy's and 

 Lechmere?  Is that going to be part of the PUD process?  Or 

 is it going to be subsequent to the PUD process?  So that's 

 Question 1. 

           I think following up a bit on one of Lou's

 comments, we need at the PUD stage to have more ground level 

 perspectives.  We share the perspective looking down each of 

 the neighborhood streets towards First Street to see what 

 you see at the end, because that will give you a better idea 

 of whether these -- how these setbacks work.    

           We're going to need another, a few more looking 

 down Land Boulevard and First Street -- again, to determine 

 how the setbacks work.  I'm quite optimistic that the 

 setbacks do work, but I think you need to prove it to us.   

           And in light of our earlier conversation about 

 whether models were needed or not, I think that's the kind 

 of thing that models allow us to do; to walk around, to 

 squat down, to look down the streets. 

           And so, I think you're going to have to be doing 

 this with renderings or model photographs.  I think you'll 

 probably need to work out a protocol with the Urban Design 

 staff as to information gets generated. 

           My third point is I've only driven in 

 Cambridgeside Garage once or twice in my life.  I learned a 

 long time ago it was better to park in between Second Street 

 and First Street at the meters.  And from what I can tell, 

 garage level is relatively complicated.

           Part of that's the history, I think there's a 

 newer garage under Best Buy, because it was, if I'm correct, 

 the first building to be built.  They were trying it as 

 Lechmere relocated.  So that was a deliberate decision. 

           So how to -- I think having diagrams of how those 

 garage levels were, where the points of access are…  upper 

 floor use…  it's something that I as an architect would like 

 to see more of, I think on a PUD level.   

           Again, they can be -- you know, schematic or 

 conceptual, but understand what the principles are and how 

 the garages work would help me understand the project.   

           I guess the fourth point would be that what we're 

 seeing tonight is clearly a -- you know, more thinking has 

 gone forward, but the basic principles we've seen before 

 that were established through our comments and the comments 

 of others, you know are there. 

           I was there when the zoning with approved in 

 December.  It's still there, it's just gotten a little bit -

 - it's a little more [02:04:45 audio unclear].  So in some 

 sense, it's not difficult for us to say, "Yeah, we 

 understand this project." And because of the way we voted to 

 recommend the project, that we're behind it.  Not to say

 that there aren't points that can't be improved or examined, 

 but… 

           So those are my comments.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, did you 

 want to say something again?   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah.  One more 

 clarification that I believe I heard that developers decided 

 not to go through with the remodeling of the Boathouse?  

 That's the first I've heard of that, and I'm curious if he 

 has anything to say about that?   

           JOHN TWOHIG:  Certainly.  Through you, Madam 

 Chair.  John Twohig again.  We had proposed the Boathouse.  

 We're still going to do the work under the bridge and 

 improving the pathways and all that.   

           But clearly there was a strong preference through 

 East Cambridge Community, through the Council, that the East 

 End House be -- you know, it is, was in great need of 

 capital improvements, of really bringing it into its next 

 phase. 

           And the work that we heard was we want -- you 

 know, the monies that might have been dedicated to 

 repurposing and rebuilding the DCR Boathouse to really be

 shifted to -- and quite honestly increased -- for the 

 benefit of the East End House and capital programs that 

 might be there. 

           So actually we agreed to, and I mentioned in my 

 earlier remarks -- $9 million dollars, $4 million of which 

 will actually be paid in the next short periods of time, so 

 that they're able to move forward with some of the capital 

 programs, and then the balance, the $5 million comes towards 

 our third building. 

           So that was really a strong message from the East 

 Cambridge Planning Team, members of the community and the 

 City Council that rather than -- still want you to do the 

 work onto Canal, still want you to fix the area on the Land 

 Boulevard, fix the pathways, do all that; but instead of 

 repurposing that community space at the DCR Boathouse, deal 

 with our existing community space that people are using 

 every day and have used for over 100 years. 

           And that was the message that was very clearly 

 given to us and became part of our mitigation commitment.    

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thanks for the explanation.  

 Just when I heard it, it just seemed like a shame not to 

 complete the Canal Park area right to both ends of the 

74

 Canal, but I understand the tradeoff.   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I'm not seeing 

 any more questions or comments from Board members.  We did 

 not receive any written materials from staff at this time on 

 the project, but if anyone has questions for staff now, we 

 can take them now.   

           Obviously, we will have many opportunities in the 

 future to talk with staff about this project.  But if there 

 are questions with staff now, we can certainly take those at 

 this time.   

           [Pause]  

           Okay.  All right.  There not being any questions 

 from Board members for the staff, we're going to move to 

 public comment.  This is -- it is a matter of General 

 Business; however, in this case we're going to go ahead and 

 take public comment, given the level of public interest 

 there has been on this project. 

           Any members of the public who wish to speak should 

 now click the button on Zoom that says, "Participants" and 

 then click the button that says, "Raise hand."  

           And if you're calling in by phone, you can raise 

 your hand by pressing *9.  We have not received any written

 comments from the public on this item, as of 5:00 p.m. 

 yesterday. 

           So I'm starting to see hands go up among members 

 of the public, so that's great.  That means the system is 

 working.  Then another few seconds, so that anyone who wants 

 to virtually raise their hand can do so. 

           [Pause]   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I'll now ask 

 staff to unmute the speakers one at a time.  When you are 

 unmuted, you should begin by saying your name and address, 

 at which point the staff will confirm that we can hear you, 

 and after that you'll have up to three minutes to speak 

 before I ask you to wrap up.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  So this is Jeff Roberts 

 again, and I'll be unmuting folks.  I'm going to start.   

           So there are some names and some phone numbers.  

 I'll do the names as best I can.   

           For phone numbers I'll just read off a few of the 

 last numbers on the phone number, and hopefully if you know 

 who you are, you can -- again give -- the first thing you 

 want to do is say your name, spell your last name, and give 

 your address.  And then I'll confirm we can hear you.

           So the first person I've unmuted is on a phone 

 with the last three numbers 311.  Can you please give your 

 name, spell your name and give your address?   

           HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hi, it's Heather Hoffman, 213 

 Hurley Street.    

 you can go ahead.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you Heather, we can hear you, 

           HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Okay.  I'm going to raise the 

 same questions that I raised at the planning team meeting.  

 The first is something that we've been asking for for 

 months, and that is views from the neighborhood.  And two 

 Board members gave parts of this.   

           There was a request for a way to see what it's 

 going to look like from the neighborhood, and there was also 

 a mention of what it's going to look like from our homes.    

           And our homes are not necessarily at ground level.  

 We live in two and three story homes, and we would like to 

 know what we're going to be looking at every time we look 

 out of our windows. 

           So I understand that they only had so much time, 

 but I am renewing my request, and I hope that the Board will 

 make sure that this happens.

           The other issue that I raised was that if the last 

 three months have shown us anything, they have shown us that 

 the nature of work in office buildings had changed.   

           And it is not at all clear that jobs that can be 

 done remotely -- and definitely not all jobs can -- may well 

 continue to be done remotely, at least in part.   

           And that will affect the market for office 

 buildings.  It will probably affect getting tenants, getting 

 financing and everything else.  And so, I urge everyone to 

 think long and hard about that, before we go putting another 

 huge building in our neighborhood.  Thanks.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  So I don't see any more hands up on 

 my screen.  I'll just give attendees another few seconds.  

 Again, you can push the button that says, "raise hand" if 

 you'd like to speak.   

           If you can't find the button, you might have to 

 click "Panelists" first and then "Raise hand."  And if 

 you're on phone, you should push *9. 

           So to the Chair, it's about 10 seconds.  I don't 

 believe there's any more hands raised.      

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Board

 to give Board members a five-minute break, and then we can 

 come back and get started on our next agenda items.  So 

 Jeff, we can recess the meeting for five minutes.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Yep.  We'll be back at around 8:35.

 from MIT.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks so much, Madam Chair.  This 

 is Jeff Roberts again.  This is a PUD special permit, and 

 it's currently under construction.   

           The Planning Board reviewed as part of an earlier 

 phase of development the design for the open space on this 

 site, but there were some items that the Planning Board 

 requested follow up on, and wanted to explore a little 

 better further.   

           So that's the purpose of this presentation.  

 Representatives from MIT are here to talk about it, and our 

 Urban Design Staff -- I understand that Suzannah Bigolin is 

 here -- has been involved, has reviewed this with the 

 applicant.  So she can help fill in any questions about the 

 Planning Board's previous comments and where things stand 

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Then I think 

 we are turning it over to Michael Owu from MIT to walk us 

 through their presentation.   

           MICHAEL OLU:  Actually, Maureen will take the lead 

 now.    

 here.

 thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.  My name is

 update with you on the final design and construction 

 progress on the Kendall Square opening phase. 

           Many of you may recall our Design Review 

 presentations back in 2017, when we received our final 

 Design Review approval.  Tonight, we're pleased to recognize 

 the many ways the Planning Board's Design Review comments 

 and additional input from city staff significantly influence 

 the final design.

           When the project construction started about a year 

 ago or so, it's been exciting to see the project come to 

           Our landscape architect, Mary Lydecker, with 

 Hargreaves Jones, located here in Cambridge, will go through 

 the project update.  Mary has been on the project's Design 

 Team since 2014, and was among our presenters in 2017. 

           Mary is also a Cambridge resident, with a great 

 fondness for the city's network of open space.  So I'll turn 

 it over to Mary to walk us through the presentation.  

           MARY LYDECKER:  All right.  Thank you, Maureen and

 just make sure everyone can hear me, thumbs up?  All right.  

 So thank you Maureen, and thank you to the Planning Board -- 

 again, for the invitation to share this update with you 

 tonight.   

           As you know, the Kendall Square open space is the 

 heart of this development initiative, a shared public 

 resource that will be open and welcoming to everyone in 

 Kendall Square and beyond -- a place for all to live, to 

 work, to learn and to play. 

           So as a reminder, the open space extends over two 

 acres from Carlton Street over east to Wadsworth Street.  

 And also, through densely treed streetscapes up to Main 

 Street with the new T station head house and plaza, which we 

 call the "Gateway" and sought help as an outpatient to 

 Amherst Street. 

           The open space itself, the core open space, is 

 defined by a broad civic promenade, which extends MIT's 

 iconic Infinite Corridor out into the Cambridge's public 

 realm.   

           This green corridor is formed by partnering into 

 the project's expansive urban forest, with smaller gathering 

 spaces carved out along the spine and along the building,

 creating a flexible destination that is vibrant and actively 

 programmed, but also an opportunity for intimate gatherings 

 and respite. 

           As Maureen noted, we are extraordinarily proud to 

 recognize the many ways that the Planning Board's Design 

 Review comments in 2017 and additional input from city staff 

 have significantly influenced the final design, some of 

 which we specifically noted here in red. 

           So beginning with the Planning Board 

 recommendation to make sure that we were creating 

 opportunities for pausing in a refuge in the midst of what 

 will be a real connective hub. 

           Another set of comments from city staff about 

 maximizing canopy tree selections for shade and comfortable:    

 So minimizing upright or fastigiate varieties, particularly 

 on the streetscapes. 

           We also received strong feedback about creating a 

 planting palate that is all seasons, from the winter through 

 the summer, but also a palate that is resilient -- including 

 natives, but also adapted species that can thrive as 

 environmental condition and planting zones in particular 

 begin to change.   

85

           And finally, as noted here, carving out space for 

 public art installation, whether it's permanent or 

 temporary, and modifying the landscape design, specify 

 around Building 3 to create a relationship with a canopy 

 installation above. 

           [Next?] 

           So the list below identifies comments that we 

 received from Planning Board during the Design Review 

 approval of the open space, all of which have informed final 

 design decisions.   

           And tonight's project update we'll walk through 

 each of these, as well as requests for clarification from 

 city staff, which we have indicated here with an asterisk. 

           [Next?]  

           So we begin with one of the real primary impact 

 Planning Review comments changed the design.  So in response 

 to Planning Board feedback, the design of the open space 

 adjacent to Building 3 developed to really integrate that 

 open space with public art in the building [02:31:12 

 indiscernible] above, creating a broader and more linear 

 connection between Hayward and Wadsworth.  You can see in 

 the paving that kind of central, civic promenade.

           [Next?]  

           And then adjustments in the open space design 

 coordinated with the architecture teams to engage that 

 canopy structure night and public art feature with an 

 additional platform below for gathering and viewing, as 

 involves a dedicated kind of paved zone. 

           Also a broader [02:31:45 zone along the south 

 façade.  Previously, we had bike racks along that edge.  And 

 in order to do that, a shift in consolidation of that bike 

 parking just north of Building E40, which is on the lower 

 right side of your screen by Wadsworth. 

           [Next?]  

           In doing so this, city staff wanted to make sure 

 that we were still providing the appropriate amount of 

 short-term bike parking, so here we're showing that the 

 design is still consistent with the original plan.  There 

 are eight bike spaces within 50 feet of a pedestrian 

 entrance to building 3.   

           [Next?]  

           And then just the reminder overall how bike 

 parking facilities are distributed across the site.  So bike 

 racks in proximity to building entrances, two Bluebike bike-

 share stations on the site, as well as a garage bike -- as 

 well as garage bike parking with access via bike elevator in 

87

 the garage penthouse.   

           [Next?]  

           We also heard that it was incredibly important 

 that the project integrate with Cambridge's broader bike 

 network.  This slide here is showing that comprehensive 

 network of existing bike facilities in solid lines, and 

 anticipated bike route facilities in dashed lines to serve 

 the project area. 

           Here notable: the new two-way cycle track, 

 recently completed on Ames Street and sharrows.  So a shared 

 lane condition with paving markings on Wadsworth Street.   

           [Next?]  

           And so, zooming into the site, it was important 

 that the bikes continue at the site scale, to be served by 

 that ample, on-street bike facilities, the bike routes, but 

 also that they are permitted to move through that central 

 open space as a slow cycling route -- a shared route with 

 pedestrians.   

           Notable that at Hayward Street, vehicles are 

 restricted in that central zone, so you will not have

 vehicles regularly moving through that area.   

           [Next?]  

           And so, here just another view to help us kind of 

 orient us to what that means, that central corridor that 

 will be used by pedestrians and slow cycling bikes.  So here 

 you are standing on Carlton Street.  You're looking east 

 past Hayward Street towards Wadsworth.  The Gateway is to 

 the north to your left. 

           And so, this shows that broad, central east-west 

 open space.  The connection that extends that Infinite 

 Corridor inside MIT out into the landscape, and creating 

 this promenade with enhanced paving; feature lighting, which 

 we'll describe in a moment; flush curves at street 

 crossings, and active programming.   

           So collectively features that emphasize the 

 pedestrian-oriented character of the space while still 

 allowing the efficient access for cyclists and integration 

 of cyclist with the on-street bike networks.   

           [Next?]  

           We received a request to confirm the height of the 

 pedestrian light poles.  So this slide is just showing us 

 the overall lighting approach to the site.  Site lighting

 here really prioritizes uniformity with low glare, low 

 contrast, discrete LED full cutoff fixtures, with taller 

 light poles in the pink and the purple in the streets and 

 the parking at 25 feet tall, and very simple 16-foot 

 pedestrian poles through the core open space. 

           So as very simple approach to that overall 

 elimination in order to emphasize the impact of feature 

 lighting on the site. 

           So an Infinite Corridor lighting installation as 

 well as feature lighting at the head house -- the new head 

 house -- and building canopies, as well as custom platforms 

 and seawalls throughout the site.     

           [Next?]  

           And so, here we have the feature lighting, the 

 feature element and the space.  And we were encouraged 

 strongly by the Planning Board to make sure that this was a 

 dynamically programmed feature.  So as you can see, really 

 the lighting installation is key to placemaking at Kendall 

 Square.   

           So in the daytime, we have this civic promenade on 

 paving, and at nighttime, it is marked by light, again, 

 extending that Infinite Corridor.  It's composed of 500

 individually controllable light fixtures.  As a reminder, 

 these are countersunk small features in 6 x 12 pavers -- 

 very similar to what you see at the Collier Memorial.   

           This is a feature that can be flexibly programmed 

 to create that dynamic and evolving destination, which is 

 both vibrant and engaging on the ground, as well as when 

 viewed from above, from the adjacent developments.   

           [Next?]  

           So again, here just emphasizing that daytime 

 expression of the promenade in paving.  This is really where 

 a lot of warmer tones especially are emphasized in the 

 paving.  And then the distribution of those lights at night 

 to mark this Corridor. 

           So at this point, Swaathi, I was wondering are you 

 easily able to pull up the animation?  

           [Pause]  

           If not, we can hold and get back to the animation.  

 So we did provide an animation that we're hoping can be 

 shared with the Planning Board, so you all can see the way 

 that the lights are able to be moved.   

           So the animation shows one possible programming, 

 but there really are infinite permutations of programming 

 because of -- oh great, thank you, Swaathi -- because each 

 of those lights is individually controllable.   

           So I think we'll just keep moving on, and 

91

 hopefully -- great.   

           [Pause]  

           So this is showing a program where certain lights 

 are programmed to go on together.  And so, you get that kind 

 of drift of lights moving west to east down the Corridor, 

 and then repeating back upon itself.   

           Again, this is just an example of one program that 

 could be used on the site.  And we anticipate that it will 

 be modified and changed and developed by MIT and their Open 

 Space Team.   

           [Pause]  

           [Next?]  

           Thank you.  I think we can switch back to the --  

           So comments we received from the Planning Board, 

 from city staff, from everybody is to make sure that the 

 space has diverse options for fixed seating.  So as you can 

 see here, seating is distributed across the site, including 

 options that are comfortable for everyone, including back 

 and backless.

           You can see the freestanding backed benches in 

 pink, stone seat walls with backed wood inserts, as well as 

 stone terraces in orange.  And then custom wood platforms 

 with cutouts shown in red, as well as movable chairs across 

 the site.   

           [Next?]  

           And as I noted, the diverse mix of seating notably 

 includes those cutout -- custom cutout platforms, which 

 evolved through an appreciation of the site's range of 

 programmatic uses.  We need to facilitate quiet and intimate 

 conversation or small classes to impromptu stages for 

 display or events. 

           The freestanding bench, which you see on the right 

 and in the image to the lower right, is an unusual playful 

 element, while also comfortable.  It's composed of two long 

 and distinctive timber-style forms that kind of slip against 

 each other. 

           And finally, of course, movable chairs throughout 

 the space, all of which have backs, and many with armrests, 

 further accommodating that flexible use, in coordination 

 with movable tables and umbrellas across the site.

           There was also, of course, huge enthusiasm across 

 the board to make sure that creative opportunities for 

 planning and learning are incorporated into the site.   

           The Kendall Square open space will be an important 

 addition to East Cambridge's larger public open space and 

 parked notwithstanding, which you're seeing here, 

 complementing existing and anticipated diverse opportunities 

 for children's play, which include traditional fixed 

 playground equipment, active recreation such as sports 

 fields or kayaking or sailing, and other actively programmed 

 spaces, such as the nearby ice there is no known.   

           [Next?]  

           And so, it's been incredibly important to us to 

 understand how this space will fit into that broader 

 ecosystem.  How can this both complement and be something 

 different? 

           So as described, these playful cutout platforms 

 have really evolved, and we're very, very excited for them.  

 They offer an engaging fixed feature for everyday enjoyment 

 -- again, impromptu performances, picnic lunches, children's 

 play -- but also moments to sit across from other people to 

 have more intimate gatherings, as the Planning Board 

94

 requested -- moments of respite, refuge. 

           We also of course have the iconic Infinite 

 Corridor lighting feature which we discussed with those kind 

 of dynamic performances -- again, offering a unique 

 destination for children and families.  Also really dynamic 

 when viewed from above. 

           And urban gardens and open lawns and broad tree 

 canopy, all supporting informal and popup children's 

 programming, as well as regularly scheduled events, such as 

 movies on the lawn or festivals.   

           [Next?]  

           So innovative and evolving activation is already 

 being led by MIT's Office of Open space Programming, and as 

 noted, will include scheduled and popup activities for all 

 ages and all abilities.   

           Pilots are already going on around campus, 

 including MIT Winter family day, which emphasizes that 

 really broad but important objective of the project at MIT 

 from the inside outside.   

           [Next?]  

           Here an example of an element that is anticipated: 

 Carts with self-serve materials; these elements, which can

 be used to distribute materials that people use on their own 

 within the space.  These could include books for a range of 

 ages and multiple languages, word games, lawn games, hula 

 hoops, puzzles, yo-yos, coloring books, jump ropes, you name 

 it. 

           And as noted, the Office of Open Space Programming 

 at MIT anticipates that these activities will evolve.  It's 

 important to have these anchors within the space, but above 

 all, this is a public open space that serves as a platform 

 for creative and collaborative play -- again, linking all 

 ages, all users together. 

           [Next?]  

           We were asked to confirm if skate deterrents are 

 necessary. In our experience in Cambridge:  yes, we believe 

 they are.  In the case of the open space here, we have 

 detailed skate deterrents as recessed grooves in the seat 

 wall; you can see on the upper right.   

           Also grooves into the freestanding benches.  In 

 our experience we want these to be integrated and discreet, 

 so that we can avoid damage or retrofits later on.   

           [Next?]  

           We also -- in -- you know, throughout the process

 created [02:46:21 audio unclear] including warmer tones 

 within the paving, making sure we used paving mockups to 

 create options that would ensure we could include warm 

 colors, ranging really from warm grays and tans to maroons 

 and reds.   

           This included close collaboration with the 

 manufacturer, to make sure that the aggregates and the add 

 mixtures were stable enough, so that the product could 

 resist fading, and also, make sure that this is something 

 that MIT could source in the future as necessary.   

           [Next?]  

           A Planning Board comment: This is quite important 

 -- was to make sure that we carefully detail the transition 

 between the Gateway paving and the main Street paving.   

           So what you see here shows how the project is 

 maintaining the continuity and precedence of the Main Street 

 public realm.  This is the concrete and distinctive 

 furnishing strip that is already installed. 

           The paving interface has been modified from what 

 you originally saw to address Planning Board comments 

 regarding that transition.  Instead of notching up and 

 running along the property line, the project aligns that

 paving transition with the edge of Building #4, creating a 

 really crisp transaction from Main Street to the big 

 Gateway. 

           Additionally, paving at the Gateway has evolved 

 since you last saw it is.  It is no longer monolithic, but 

 includes contrasting pavement bands that break up that 

 ground play which you can see here, responding to the 

 architecture of the head housing canopy above, but also -- 

 importantly -- mediating the scale from Main Street back 

 into the broader, larger scale of the central open space.   

           [Next?]  

           Modifications in this area included some revisions 

 to the trees and the tree trench.  We were asked to clarify 

 the tree count in this location.  And just to clarify, the 

 trees here have changed to accommodate the final design of 

 the MBTA head house.   

           By shifting those trees, we were able to create 

 more of a connection between the MIT forum and the MIT 

 Museum, and the trees were also consolidated into a single 

 trench, to avoid the extensive underground MBTA garage 

 structures. 

           Related to this, it's notable that we did go back 

98

 -- MIT did go back in January and have the Wind Study 

 Engineer reassess this area, which showed that there were no 

 changes to wind conditions as a result of those tree 

 relocations, and they noted a general improvement in the 

 Gateway as a function of that new MBTA head house design, as 

 well as the adjacent development at 325 Main Street.    

           [Next?]  

           And so, as I've noted, the urban forest created 

 with this project is tremendously important to us and to 

 MIT, so confirming again:  The images on the left are from a 

 tree tagging trip, beginning of this year, January. 

           So tree selection and caliper count has been 

 closely tracked to ensure that the project remains 

 consistent with the approved open space design, and 

 compliant -- importantly, compliant with tree replacement 

 requirements.  The final design remains compliant, and 

 includes 270 new trees. 

           [Next?]  

           And finally, the review of the garage ramp, 

 confirming that there is a safe barrier along that edge on 

 Hayward Street.  So the original design had a 42-inch-tall 

 concrete guard wall located along Hayward Street for the

 Amherst Street entry to the garage ramp.  Noting here that 

 there is a Bluebike station blocking the sidewalk from that 

 guard wall, as well as woody evergreen vegetation separation 

 again the guard wall from the sidewalk. 

           However, based on a city staff recommendation, we 

 did add a guardrail, a 12-inch guard rail on top of that 

 wall to make sure that people don't sit or prop objects up 

 there -- similar to what you see at Post Office Square.   

           However, the design here is made of flat steel 

 members -- you can see kind of very thin in profile in order 

 to achieve a really visually unobtrusive feature in the 

 public realm, but to ensure safety along that edge.   

           And so, now we have just a few construction 

           [Next?]  

 projects.   

           [Next?]  

           Share with the Planning Board: So here you are 

 along Amherst Street and Site R.  You get to see some 

 flatwork.  Here you are at the ambulance ramp wall and those 

 terraces.   

           So this is really the western terminus of that 

 central Corridor.  So a great place to sit and watch -- you

 around Dock Street, the pavers beginning to go in, the trees 

 -- very excited, the top of the trees there and starting to 

           And then finally wrapping up around to Main Street 

 and Site 5.  I think on the image to the left you see quite 

 clearly that crisp demarcation between the Main Street 

 public realm and the Gateway aligning with the face of 

 Building 4 in the distance beyond. 

           So with that, I will turn it back over.   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you 

 so much for that presentation.  We now turn back to the 

 Board members for any questions for the applicant.   

           I have a question.  The drawings that I received 

 the plans are very tiny in scale, and it's very hard for me 

 to really understand anything but the broadest concepts. 

           So I'm wondering if the staff -- our Urban Design 

 staff -- would care to comment if there are any outstanding

 issues that they think need more work?    

           [Pause]  

           Okay.  We can roll right into questions for staff, 

 then.  I believe though we haven't received written input 

 from staff on this matter, Suzannah Bigolin has been working 

 on it, and is here this evening to provide comments.   

           So Suzannah, why don't I turn it over to you?     

           SUZANNAH BIGOLIN:  Thank you.  And just to Hugh's 

 comment, there are a couple of areas where we thought there 

 have not necessarily been a lot of changes to respond to the 

 Board's comments, and there's different reasons for why.  So 

 I would just like to go through them.  There is the item #3, 

 which is the bicycle access.  The Board's comments were more 

 about potential bicycle pedestrian conflict through the 

 shared open space. 

           We've had discussions with the Transportation 

 staff, and they seem comfortable as long as there's a clear 

 width of 14.5 feet and there's no vertical obstacles.  So I 

 believe that's been achieved. 

           We did want to note that the bollards at the 

 intersections need to be very sort of well-identified and 

 obvious, so that would be something that you'd want to keep

 reviewing or working with MIT to address. 

           The other area is the Board had mentioned when 

 they approved the design opportunities to incorporate more 

 fixed play opportunities and to make the space more child 

 friendly.   

           So the design at the moment includes the platform 

 benches and programming as the sort of key focus for play, 

 that no sort of fixed play features have been introduced 

 specifically.  So we thought the Board should review that. 

           There was also comments from the Board about 

 consideration of seating with plaques and armrests, and also 

 preference for more curvilinear seating options.  The 

 platform benches with the cutouts are proposed, but the 

 earlier options were much more playful and had sort of 

 undulating forms.  So we thought that was something the 

 Board should review. 

           And some benches with backs have been proposed 

 that we feel that perhaps more could be added with backs 

 tall enough to lean against, so that they're not so low and 

 so it's more comfortable. 

           With the garage [02:56:30 indiscernible ], there 

 was a situation about safety by the Board, and also,

 potential for the [02:56:39 same indiscernible] to be a 

 place for us.   

           The treatment of the role has been enhanced with 

 some scoring, which is good, and we wondered if the planting 

 strip could be continued all the way along the wall, and 

 whether the strip could be made wider so it aligns with 

 bikes parked in the Bluebikes stations, so that they're not 

 sort of sticking out into the sidewalk. 

           And we thought it was great to see the lighting 

 installation and how interactive it is, but we wondered if 

 there should be some consideration given to times of 

 operation and color temperature to sort of minimize light 

 glare and pollution. 

           But that is -- overall, we're very pleased with 

 the refinements and the responses to it.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any further 

 questions either for Suzannah or for MIT on what they 

 presented tonight?             

           HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell again.      

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.             

           HUGH RUSSELL:  I was curious as to how many 

 children live in the new graduate student dormitory?  And  

104

           what sort of ages?    

           MICHAEL OWU:  This is Michael, I'll attempt to 

 answer that question.  Don't know exactly just yet.  It is 

 intended to be mixed-use, both single graduate students and 

 grad students with children.   

           The expectation is I think abdomen 250 of the 

 units, or 200 of the units would be for grad students -- med 

 grad students -- some of whom would have children.  So it's 

 possibly a replication of what's in the distant East Gate 

 tower. 

           Just as a reminder, the kids -- the graduate 

 residence has a second level play area that's accessible 

 from the graduate dorm on top -- that kids can play.              

           HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?  You have your 

 hand up as well?   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, I have a few.      

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The first one, will the 

 lighting on the walkway be able to create words and symbols 

 and so forth, and what's the level of lighting you expect to 

 see from this?

           On the platform benches with the cutouts, I'd like 

 to see the dimensions on the benches and the cutouts, and I 

 believe you'll still have the same problem that you will 

 have on your fixed -- on your masonry and wooden benches 

 with skateboarders; maybe even a worse problem skateboarding 

 across the top of the platform and jumping across the 

 openings.  You may want to look at that.   

           I'd like to see how big the cutouts are to make 

 sure they're adequate for groups.  But I don't know what 

 you're going to do about the skateboard issue on these 

 platforms.   

           I think the added color in the paving [03:00:23 

 audio unclear] the area is very gray.  I'd like to know the 

 thickness of that canopy.  It looks, in all the renderings 

 it looks very thin, and I'm curious how that's going to 

 that's going to dimension, and is it snow loaded?   

           I mean, it's a very thin canopy, and it looks like 

 it has very wide supports.  I'm just curious what it's 

 designed for. 

           Also along the ramp into the garage, the bikes 

 look like they will block the sidewalk, especially with that 

 row of trees down the sidewalk, you're -- I don't know six

 to eight feet for a bicycle, and you don't have a lot of 

 sidewalk left on both sides of those trees.   

           And I don't know if you're using tree grates.  So 

 I'd like to see something clearer there.   

           And my question was, how many high school and 

 grammar school children do you expect to get a year to the 

 MIT Museum and that area?  That was the idea with the kind 

 of stand-alone children sized play area and dedicated play 

 area.  So it might be a lot to chew on, but do your best.   

           MAUREEN MCCAFFREY:  Okay, this is Maureen 

 McCaffrey.  I'll address -- you cut out for just a little 

 bit, so I might have to ask you a question on one of the 

 items.  The lighting I think was the first item that you 

 talk about, what kind of programming can it be?  Could it 

 have symbols or words?   

           There are 500 lights in the system, and my sense 

 is the programming is unlimited.  So I would fully expect 

 that there could be messages or symbols or something like 

 that programmed into the system. 

           The platforms and benches:  You had a comment 

 about skateboards, and Mary will be able to address this 

 from a technical perspective, but I think just by virtue of

 the design of the platforms, they are not particularly skate 

 friendly, because the edges will be -- the edges won't be 

 smooth the way a skater might like to have them.  So I'll 

 have Mary Lydecker comment on that piece as well. 

           The part where you cut out, I think you were 

 talking about the MBTA headhouse; the canopy at the MBTA 

 head house.  Is that right?  

           You know, candidly, I -- it's been some time since 

 the MBTA team, our MBTA team presented that canopy to the 

 Planning Board, and I don't recall the specifics, but I know 

 that it's been engineered and designed -- you know, with the 

 architect, and of course with the structural engineer, and 

 has met all of the MBTA's requirements. 

           But I believe we don't have any open design issues 

 there, and in particular as it relates to snow load.   

           What we might not see with the canopy is there are 

 several columns that are supporting that canopy as well. 

           The garage ramp -- you have a question I think 

 about the garage ramp and the Bluebikes that are adjacent to 

 the garage ramp between the tree locations and the garage 

 ramp, and then there is an adjacent sidewalk.   

           And I do not -- I'm looking to see if I had that 

108

 dimension right here in front of me, I don't think I do, but 

 Mary might be able to comment on that specific dimension, 

 but we do have an accessible sidewalk adjacent to that 

 Bluebikes system.   

           And it's not different from other Bluebike 

 locations.  So as I see it, it's -- so it looks like it's 13 

 feet, 13.75 feet from the curb to the Bluebikes station 

 setup.   

           So it looks like it's pretty well coordinated 

 there for appropriate access, and I'll double check with 

 Mary here when she comes back on, just to confirm that I 

 have that right dimension.   

           And the last piece on the museum, you mentioned 

 the museum and programs for children and high school 

 students:  I don't have the head count for that, and I 

 apologize for not knowing the number.    

           I know the MIT Museum is very proud of their 

 programming for in particular Cambridge students, and I know 

 that access is free for all of the Cambridge students.   

           So without knowing that exact number, I can just 

 offer that I know it's intended to be open of course to 

 Cambridge high school and younger students.

           MARY LYDECKER:  So if you wanted me to add a few 

 technical comments?  So following up again on the sidewalk 

 next to Hayward Street, Maureen mentioned it's a 13, almost 

 14 feet to the Bluebike, but it leaves about 10 and three-

 quarters feet to the backup zone, the kind of -- when a bike 

 is actually in there.  And so, this is actually one of the 

 broader streetscapes on the project.  So that should be 

 ample.  

           The comment about --  

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You're calling out --   

           MARY LYDECKER:  Say that again?   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You're calling out six feet 

 as the Bluebikes station and the bicycle.     

           MARY LYDECKER:  That's right.   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I don't think your dimension 

 is correct.  I think you have eight feet or more. And 

 there's a tree behind all of those Bluebikes stations.  So 

 that restricts the movement also, and I'm curious if you 

 have tree grates or it's going to be flat paving to the 

 trees?     

           MARY LYDECKER:  That's right.  That was the other 

 question.  We do not have tree grates.  So there are tree 

110

 openings with paving up to those openings, which does create 

 more of a flow around that zone. 

           The other comment you had about the skateboards 

 and the cutouts on those platforms:  As Maureen described, 

 the planks, or the slats that form the top of it, are 

 oriented so that they’ve become kind of a natural skateboard 

 deterrent because the short side is basically in those 

 curved areas and along the flat sides, the flat sides are 

 facing the public realm. 

           Whereas the other sides are often in planting.  

 There are also often trees that pop up within those kind of 

 cutout openings, which range in size up to about 15 feet.  

 So again, it is a small kind of intimate gathering, but 

 where you could sit across, you could create a little 

 cluster or group.   

           [Pause] Let's see…   

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So next time we see these 

 drawings again, I would like to see some dimensions, because 

 if it's three feet it's too narrow, and it's great to jump 

 across with a skateboard.     

           MARY LYDECKER:  Mm-hm.     

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  And I don't think you -- I

 don't know if you watch your skateboarders.     

           MARY LYDECKER:  It's definitely not --  

           LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You have a nice, flat 

 platform, some of these are fairly long.  It's a nice run to 

 make the big jumps.  I think you better -- you should really 

 think about the skateboard issue with those flat planes.    

           MAUREEN MCCAFFREY:  Thank you for thinking of 

 that.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  I think 

 Tom Sieniewicz has his hand up.  Tom?             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Just quickly -- I know it's late 

 -- I wanted to thank you for the format where you listed the 

 comments that the Planning Board made, and responded 

 directly both in your presentation and "miniature" documents 

 that I received.   

           And so, it gives me a sense that these late nights 

 are sometimes worth it, right?  Because we're having an 

 effect.  So if I'm -- just one last thing, I guess there's 

 another phase, right?  Because there's another building we 

 haven't seen yet.   

           So the Infinite Corridor will keep going and, you 

 know, I don't mean to make it funny, but you know, you --

 what happens to the Infinite Corridor when it finally 

 reaches the property line or the end?  You know, we're 

 imagining some kind of Harry Potter amazing thing or I don't 

 know, you know?  What happens when the Infinite Corridor 

 ends?  It's a Mobius Strip or -- I have no idea. 

           So I'm really excited to see what Phase 2 might 

 look like, and how somebody -- some skillful designer is 

 going to resolve that.  So thank you.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Any other 

 questions or comments from Board members?  All right.  Then 

 we can, again, move to public comment.   

           Any members of the public who wish to speak now 

 should click the button that says, "Participants" and then 

 click the button that says, "Raise hand."  If you're calling 

 in by phone, you can raise your hand by pressing *9.  We 

 have not received any written comments from the public on 

 this item as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday.  So we will take public 

 comment now. 

           All right.  I will turn it over to staff to unmute 

 the speakers one at a time.  And again, please begin by 

 saying your name and address.  The staff will confirm that 

 we can hear you, and once they have done that, you'll have 

113

 up to three minutes to speak before I ask you to wrap up.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair.  This is 

 Jeff Roberts again.  I see one hand up and the same phone 

 number I assume as Heather, so can you please give your -- 

 please say your name and give your address and I'll confirm 

 we can hear you?

 that.   

           I know that they are harassed by police sometimes 

 when they go to the place that they're supposed to go to, 

 the skateboard park.   

           And I understand that they cause some damage.  But 

 my experience is that of all the young people of an age to 

 cause trouble, that I see, they're always well-behaved.  

 I've never seen them do anything other than try to get

 better at doing their skateboard tricks.  So, you know, to 

 the extent -- I don't want to see this destroyed or 

 anything, but it kind of bothers me to have skateboarders so 

 demonized by so many people.   

           And with respect to the lights, I hope that your 

 install will have more staying power than the lights at One 

 Kendall Square which were pretty cool when they were 

 installed, and then they were not properly maintained, and 

 water infiltrated, and eventually after enough of the lights 

 had stopped working and they didn't care to fix them, they 

 got taken out and replaced with truly boring bricks. 

           So I hope that you do a better job than that.  

 Thank you.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, that was the only -- 

 this is Jeff again -- that was the only hand that was 

 raised, so I can just give a few seconds to remind folks to 

 -- I see another hand up, but just for the sake of reminding 

 everybody, you can push the "Raise hand" button if you'd 

 like to speak, or if you're on telephone, you can press *9.  

 So please just go ahead and do that.   

           And I see another hand.  It's O.R.  Simha.  I've

 unmuted you.  Please give your name and spell your name and

           O.R. SIMHA:  O.R. Simha, 303 Third Street.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, you can go ahead.   

           O.R. SIMHA:  Thank you very much for this 

 presentation, it's quite interesting.  I wonder if the 

 Planning Board wouldn't appreciate some additional 

 information; I certainly would.   

           And that is the context that you're looking at 

 does not include Amherst Street.  Amherst Street is the 

 principal vehicular and pedestrian access from one -- from 

 the main campus to the east campus.  But it never appears in 

 these drawings. 

           And I think to really understand what's going to 

 happen here, you really ought to have that as part of the 

 context in which you are viewing it.   

           Because this is not just going to be a pedestrian 

 district, it's going to be an area in which vehicles are 

 going to be passing back and forth.  Trucks are going to be 

 entering the ramp to service all these buildings.   

           I think it will be very helpful if they could 

 provide you with a larger context drawing that shows you how

 all of that is going to work so that you can better 

 understand what the ultimate result is going to be. 

           That said, I think one of the things that you 

 should be thinking about is immediately adjacent to this 

 site are -- across the street is 100 Memorial Drive, where 

 there are 270 additional residents or apartments, as well as 

 graduate student residents next door to that, so that the 

 total population in this immediate vicinity will be fairly 

 large number of people who live -- just live here, in 

 addition to the people that are working here. 

           I hope that Michael can give you a better number 

 about the population.  So you're actually going to be in the 

 immediate vicinity of all of this activity, so you have a 

 better sense of what the intensity of use for this area is 

 going to be. 

           The other thing I would suggest that you ask them 

 to talk about is all these drawings suggest that it's always 

 summertime in Cambridge.   

           And I think one of the things you may want to look 

 at is what is this going to be like in the wintertime, when 

 there's snow and ice on all of this space?  How will people 

 who are moving through this be protected?  Or will they not?

           And what provisions will be made to ensure that it 

 doesn't become a slippery slope with all of the interesting 

 design and pavement work that's going in here. 

           So those are two or three things that I think 

 would help everybody understand better how this all might 

 work. 

           One thing I would add is from my experience 

 working on the campus for many years, I think our friends in 

 Canada may have a somewhat -- a gentle view about what the 

 winds in this area can be like, and that I certainly would 

 money on the proposition that when the Google building 

 across the street goes on, that the Venturi effects on Main 

 Street, which will whip into this area through this Gateway 

 will be on some days literally difficult to stand 

 vertically. 

           Just a few weeks ago --   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So Mr. Simha, can you 

 please wrap up?  You're over time at this point. 

           O.R. SIMHA:  Sure, yep, that's it.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All 

 right.  Are there any other commenters this evening on this 

 matter?   

118

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Just to the Chair, I'm not seeing 

 any additional hands up at this point, so I think that is 

 everyone.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right, 

 then I'll turn it back to the Board and ask if there's a 

 motion to close public comment at this time.             

           TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Tom Sieniewicz, so moved.  Motion 

 to close public comment.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?

 Any other comments we want to make to MIT or hear more from 

 them about?   

           [Pause]  

           Okay.  Seeing none, then if there's a motion to

 we'll move onto our final agenda item this evening, which is 

 a requested minor amendment to the conditions of our 

 Planning Board Special Permit 303.  Again, that's the MIT/ 

 Kendall Square SoMa PUD.  So we'll ask staff again to 

 summarize what is coming before us this evening. 

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, thank you to the Chair.  Just

 really quickly, so this is the same PUD special permit that 

 was discussed in the previous item.  But this proposal has 

 to do with the transportation mitigation conditions that are 

 attached to the special permit.   

           There is a -- MIT is seeking an amendment to those 

 conditions, and it's described more in detail in their 

 proposal, and also, in that commentary by the Traffic, 

 Parking and Transportation Department and staff from that 

 department, Joe Barr and Adam Shulman, are also present, so 

 they can speak to it.   

           And the minor amendment process is summarized in a 

 memo that CDD provided.  This was all the way back in March.  

 But you should have gotten copies of that again explaining 

 that there's a procedure for approving minor amendments by a 

 vote of the Planning Board. 

           And the Board has to make a determination that it 

 meets the criteria for a minor amendment.  So I'll just turn 

 it over from there.  And I can answer more questions later, 

 if there are more procedural questions.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

 you, Jeff.  And Michael Owu, are you going to lead this one 

 off?

           MICHAEL OWU:  I'm going to introduce the topic.  

 Good evening, Madam Chair and members of the Board.  My name 

 is Michael Owu.  I'm Managing Director of Real Estate at 

 MIT.  I'm joined tonight by Xuan Phan from my office, Tim 

 McIntosh from VHB, and Brian Dugdale from Goulston & Storrs. 

           As Jeff described, this is a minor amendment to 

 the traffic mitigation item in the SoMa special permit that 

 the Board in 2016.   

           This mitigation item, what was required was a 

 replacement of traffic signals at the intersection of Main 

 Street, Vassar Street and Galileo Way.   

           We went to extensive design process with VHB and 

 had a lot of conversation with Traffic and Parking, and 

 finally concluded that the work that was required in the 

 special permit mitigation letter was incompatible with the 

 city plans for future improvements in the session.   

           And that led us to come before the Board to amend 

 the requirement, so that we could be more aligned with the 

 city's future plans.   

           I'm going to turn it over to Tim McIntosh with VHB 

 to walk -- you're going to have some slides, so I'll try to 

 be as quick as possible, and of course I would be happy to

 take questions after this.  Tim?     

           TIM MCINTOSH:  Thank you, Michael.  I think if we 

 can go to the next slide.  Thank you for that introduction.  

 Again, this is Tim Mcintosh with VHB.  We have three items 

 on the agenda. We're going to cover the current traffic 

 mitigation requirement included in the special permit.  

 We'll provide a little background on the altered 25 percent 

 plan and our coordination with city staff, and then we'll 

 look at the minor amendment request.  And then we'll have 

 some time for questions.   

           [Next slide, please?]   

           So this is the current mitigation, which requires 

 an update of traffic signal equipment by installing 

 replacement equipment -- meaning controlled conduit mast arm 

 signal heads, and adjustment of signal timing as necessary.  

 It doesn't include changes to the existing configuration, 

 and you can see the approximate estimated value on that done 

 at that time in 2016. 

           [The next slide, please?]   

           This is just an aerial image to make sure 

 everybody is oriented, showing the existing intersection.  

 Vassar Street's on your left.  You have Galileo Way on the

 right, and then Main Street goes from top to bottom. 

           [Next slide, please?] 

           So this slide's a little complicated.  I'll take a 

 moment to orient everybody in a minute.  But two years after 

 the special permit was issued in 2018, the Alta's design 

 team working for the CRA submitted a preliminary plan for 

 this same intersection.   

           And, you know, it was clear that the magnitude, 

 the scope of the intersection reconfiguration was much 

 greater than what was intended as part of the SoMa 

 mitigation. 

           What you're seeing here is the existing 

 intersection generally shown in grey.  And then superimposed 

 on top of it in the dashed orange lines are the 

 intersection, curb lines, and reconfiguration.  And you can 

 see that the curb lines have changed quite a bit.  In fact, 

 we had proposed traffic signals included in the Alta design 

 plan actually located within the existing pavement area. 

           So our challenge was to figure out a way to 

 upgrade the traffic signal system, but not locating it such 

 that it would interfere with the future designs.  And then 

 as Michael put it, we concluded that it was incompatible.

22

           [The next slide, please?]  

           But we did go through a pretty lengthy process 

 beginning in late 2018.  We met with city staff on numerous 

 occasions after we had evaluated the Alta preliminary design 

 plans.   

           We had prepared approximately seven intersection 

 reconfiguration options, and discussed with city staff over 

 the course of three meetings, and determined that it would 

 be unfeasible to try to upgrade a single system now, in the 

 hopes that it wouldn't have to be relocated later on once 

 the Alta plan was final designed and implemented. 

           And so, you know, in early 2019, we came to the 

 conclusion that a financial contribution would be the best 

 way forward.   

           [Next slide, please?]  

           So this is the current minor amendment request, 

 which basically replaces the current requirement, and 

 requires the applicant to contribute a monetary value of 

 $250,000 so that the city has the flexibility to apply that 

 towards the future design.  And it would be implemented with 

 as much flexibility as possible at the time of that final 

 design and construction.

           That's the third brief presentation that we have.  

 If we have questions, we can try to answer them.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  We appreciate 

 your brevity.  Thank you very much.     

           TIM MCINTOSH:  You're welcome.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So we can now turn to 

 Board members.  As Jeff mentioned, we do have Joe Barr and 

 Adam Shulman at the meeting tonight as well.  So if you have 

 questions either for MIT or for staff, now would be the time 

 to raise them.       

           MARY FLYNN:  Catherine, this is Mary.  I do have 

 one for Joe or Adam, and that is what is the timing for the 

 intersection improvements?    

           JOE BARR:  This is Joe Barr, B-a-r-r, Director of 

 Traffic, Parking and Transportation.  So the -- it's a 

 little hard to say exactly.   

           The main thing I can say is that that stretch of 

 Galileo, Galileo Way, is in the DPW five-year plan in 2025 

 at this point -- and obviously those things can move around, 

 and obviously we're at a little bit of an unknown or 

 unchartered territory on the physical side of this moment. 

           But I think we have -- over the course of the 

127

 various development projects that have happened along 

 Galileo Way and Binney Street, we've kind of picked up most 

 of the stretches of Binney that we want to reconstruct and 

 add better bicycle facilities and narrow the roadway; you 

 know, starting at First Street and coming all the way around 

 the corner.   

           So this is one missing stretch that the city has 

 taken on, and then not to preview future discussions, but, 

 you know, as the developer of the Volpe parcel comes forward 

 at some point, we expect that, you know, that remaining 

 piece between Sixth and Third would be -- the responsibility 

 would be obviously -- that's a subsequent discussion.   

           But yeah.  So I think we would reconfigure this 

 intersection as part of that Galileo Way project.  At this 

 point, I would say it's revised.  Sorry for the long-winded 

 explanation.       

           MARY FLYNN:  Oh no, not at all, that was very 

 helpful.  Thank you.  And just one other question on the 

 Astor agreement.  I understand it was still undergoing 

 review.  Is that still the case, or have you concluded those 

 negotiations?   

           JOE BARR:  I believe that our Law Department and 

128

 [03:30:41 indiscernible proper name] those legal folks were 

 still discussed that at the point when this was originally 

 supposed to be on the agenda in March, and obviously there 

 are many, many, many legal issues that have had to be 

 addressed during the COVID-19 --       

           MARY FLYNN:  Yes.    

           JOE BARR:  -- situation, so I doubt that they've 

 made a ton of progress.  But I don't -- I think it's -- you 

 know, we've had agreements specifically with the [03:30:40 

 same indiscernible proper name Tim co] in the past, but 

 certainly with many developers and other entities. 

           So I don't anticipate that there would be a 

 significant issue around that piece, as long as we're in 

 agreement on the monetary piece and the basic plans.       

           MARY FLYNN:  Great.  All right, thank you, Joe.     

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions from 

 Board members?   

           [Pause]  

           No?  Okay.  Then we can turn to public comment.  

 Again, any members of the public who wish to speak should 

 now click the button that says, "Participants," and then the 

 button that says, "Raise hand."  And if you're calling in by

 phone, you can raise your hand by pressing *9.   

           With this item as well, we have not received 

 written comments from the public, as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday.  

 So if anyone wants to speak on this, now would be the time 

 to electronically raise your hand.   

           [Pause]  

           All right.  Jeff, I'm not seeing any hands.  Do I 

 have that right?   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  I'm also not -- this is Jeff, 

 I'm also not seeing any hands.   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Okay.  

 Then is there a motion from the Board to close public 

 comment?     

           H THEODORE COHEN:  Ted Cohen, so moved.       

           MARY FLYNN:  Mary Flynn, second.

           JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.   

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All 

 right.  Any additional discussion from the Board on the 

 matter?  Jeff, do you want to go over the criteria for a 

 minor amendment for us again?   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Certainly I can do that.  This is 

 Jeff Roberts, Community Development.  As we indicated in the 

 memo, which I have to pull open, because we wrote it a long 

 time ago, so: 

           "PUD special permits can be amended by major 

 amendment or minor amendment.  Minor amendments are 

131

1

 described in the zoning ordinance as changes which do not 

 alter the concept of the PUD in terms of density, floor area 

 ratio, land usage, height, provision of open space or the 

 physical relationship of elements of the development. 

           "Minor amendments shall include but not be limited 

 to small changes in the location of buildings, open space or 

 parking, or realignment of minor streets -- in this case 

 none of those physical changes are being proposed; it's a 

 change to the conditions for mitigation by replacing one 

 measure with an alternative that's been worked out with the 

 city." 

           So it's a grant, a minor amendment.  The Board 

 simply has to make a determination and take a vote, and it 

 would be reported as a written determination that the Board 

 finds this is a minor amendment. 

           And it carries on an affirmative vote of at least 

 five members of the Planning Board.   

           And the Board should make a determination that the 

 change does not violate applicable sections of the zoning 

 ordinance or if it requires relief pursuant to a special 

 permit or variance.  such relief has been granted -- that is 

 not the case for this proposal.

22

           And that change will not substantially alter the 

 findings upon which the decision is based.  That would be 

 the original special permit decision.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  So those are the findings that the 

 Board would have to make and then could just vote to approve 

 it as minor amendment.      

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Do we -- 

 as a reminder from me -- do we have to vote on the findings 

 separately, or can we vote on the findings and granting at 

 the same time?   

           JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, the vote could -- the Board 

 can state the findings and then take the motion to grant the 

 minor amendment based on those findings.     

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  All right.  

 All right, so I think then we -- unless there is further 

 discussion -- let me pause and just see if anyone has any 

 further questions or wants to discuss the matter.   

           All right.  Then I would entertain a motion from 

 Board member to make the findings that this does qualify for 

 a minor amendment based on the criteria laid out in the 

 staff memo, and just reiterated by Jeff, and that the Board 

133

 wishes to grant that minor amendment.             

           HUGH RUSSELL:  So moved, Hugh Russell.    

           CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?

 vote?

 amendment, Lou Bacci?  Lou Bacci?
