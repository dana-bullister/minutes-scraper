Maria McCauley & Joy Kim 
June 15, 2020 
A to Z Databases 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

●  A to Z Databases is a research database for library patrons, which provides 

information on business & executives profiles, 220 million residents, 1.1 million 
healthcare professionals, genealogy, background and criminal searches, email 
marketing and more. The database does not collect personal data from patrons but 
provides patrons with access to existing sources. 
 

●  The Library provides access to A to Z Databases for patrons' personal research only.  
The Library does not collect or retain any patron-specific data. The Library does 
collect reports regarding patron usage of the service, but that information is 
aggregated and does not describe any individual patron’s use of the service. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

●  Analyzing and managing service delivery 
●  The database allows patrons to conduct searches in a range of directories and 

databases. It is primarily used to look up addresses and phone numbers in lieu of 
traditional paper-based phonebooks. It can also be used to develop contact lists for 
small business marketing efforts. 

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

●  Database is available at all Cambridge Public Library locations: 

o  Main Library, 449 Broadway 
o  Boudreau Branch, 245 Concord Ave 
o  Central Square Branch, 45 Pearl St 
o  Collins Branch, 64 Aberdeen Ave

●  Library patrons may also access the database remotely by authenticating with their 

library card number. 

●  Subscription renewal is pending Council approval.  Database has been available for 

library patron use since January 2014. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

●  Library staff will not have access to personal data from patrons’ personal use of the 
database.  Staff provide instructions to patrons on request/as needed on how to use 
library databases. Patrons are then able to use the database for their own personal 
purposes. 

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds?  
 
●  $2,348 annual subscription cost, all included. The source of funds is the Library 

materials budget.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $60,000 received from Community Development Block Grant 
(CDBG) program income to the Public Investment Fund Community Development Extraordinary 
Expenditures Account. 
 
Periodically, the Community Development Department (CDD) receives CDBG program income related 
to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grant programs in the form of loan 
repayments or interest earned upon loan pool funds or program fees.  Under grant program regulations, 
this program income is considered an available resource in addition to the annual HUD block grant 
appropriation. 
 
$60,000 has been received in loan repayments. 
 
CDBG expenditures are administered by CDD, which implements projects and programs written in the 
City’s One Year Action Plan and Five-Year Consolidated Plan mandated by HUD.  This appropriation 
will increase funds available to continue the development of affordable housing for residents.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
During the May 26, 2020, hearing on the submitted FY21 Budget, the City Council’s Finance 
Committee voted to move the Information Technology Department (ITD) budget forward with 
an unfavorable recommendation.  The proposed $10,087,610 ITD budget maintains and secures 
critical IT infrastructure and systems and supports IT systems that staff and the public use daily 
to conduct their city business, as has been particularly evident during the COVID-19 crisis. The 
Finance Committee’s vote was obviously not about the ITD budget, but rather the Committee’s 
desire for a municipal broadband feasibility study. 
 
Since and prior to becoming City Manager, I have clearly stated my serious financial concerns 
with a City-owned and taxpayer-funded municipal broadband system, and the potential financial 
risk of such an endeavor. It is my understanding that most communities with successful 
municipal broadband systems have some combination of a municipal electrical plant and/or a 
substantial broadband market failure.  
 
In 2016, when the Broadband Task Force concluded its work, the body advocated for an in-depth 
examination of digital equity issues. To that end, we procured the services of CTC Technology 
and Energy (CTC) to carry out a research project to further inform our understanding of the 
inequities and challenges with broadband in Cambridge. As you know, this year-long study 
began in July 2019, and we expect the final report by October, but potentially by the end of 
summer. While this date is a delay from the original timeline due to the shutdown caused by the 
COVID-19 pandemic, we anticipate some improved findings since the pandemic has heightened 
the City’s understanding and the public’s awareness of gaps in broadband connectivity, access to 
devices, and IT education and training. 
 
I am committed to addressing the digital divide in Cambridge and ensuring there is digital equity 
in our City, and I know that this is a shared goal with the City Council. I also believe that 
targeted interventions can help address specific issues that exist in Cambridge. In fact, tonight, 
you will see a Free Cash Appropriation request for a new initiative to help qualified residents, 

1.9

 

 

Packet Pg. 38

1.9

particularly our school families, to receive broadband access at home.  
 
Access to quality and affordable broadband is an important issue to the City Council, our 
residents, and me. Over the summer, staff will draft a scope of work, and in the fall, I am 
prepared to recommend a Free Cash appropriation for a feasibility study on municipal 
broadband. It is my hope that the data from a feasibility study will allow us to find common 
ground on the best approach to addressing broadband access and affordability for our residents. I 
look forward to further discussion with the City Council regarding steps we can take to address 
the outstanding questions from the 2016 Broadband Task Force Report.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $50,000.00 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Executive Extraordinary Expenditures account. 
 
Funds will be used to support the City’s digital equity efforts to support qualifying families 
during the COVID-19 pandemic who do not have internet access at home. The initial priority 
focus will be on supporting households of Cambridge Public School students and Department of 
Human Service Programs participants. The City is entering into a sponsored service agreement 
with the Comcast to provide 12 months of broadband internet service to eligible households 
through the Internet Essentials program. Individuals may qualify for this pilot program if they 
are eligible for public assistance programs such as Housing Assistance, National School Lunch 
Program, Medicaid, SNAP, SSI, and others; live in the City of Cambridge; do not have any 
outstanding Comcast debt under 1 year old; and, are not an existing Comcast internet customer 
or a subscriber to Comcast internet within the last 90 days. The City is working with the 
Cambridge Public Schools and the Department of Human Service Programs to identify priority 
eligible households. Through this pilot program, the City expects to provide over up to 400 
households with broadband access for 12 months.

WHEREAS: 

In response to the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, 
Breonna Taylor in Louisville on March 13 and Eurie Stamps in Framingham on 
January 5, 2011—as well as the deaths of numerous other Black Americans murdered 
in the name of law enforcement—a wave of massive and sustained protests has 
erupted nationwide; and 
 
The same communities of color leading these protests have been the hardest hit by 
COVID-19 and the ensuing economic recession; in Cambridge, Black residents are 
testing positive at a rate three times higher than white residentsi; and 
 
On May 30, reflecting some demands many Black movement leaders have begun to 
coalesce around, Black Lives Matter launched a new combined campaign to 
#DefundThePolice and #InvestInCommunities hit hardest by the coronavirus 
pandemicii; and 
 
On June 1, the City Council unanimously passed POR 2020 #126iii, describing 
horrifying instances of police violence across the country, condemning police 
brutality wholesale, and affirming its solidarity with people of color who have 
suffered under unjust criminal justice systems; and 
 
Because of COVID-19, the City is anticipating less revenue for FY21 than originally 
anticipated and is expecting to delay the hiring of new positions, including in the 
Human Services and Community Development Departments; and 
 
Commitment to anti-racism in Cambridge requires material policy changes away from 
using policing as a response to our city’s problems and toward addressing the human 
services issues of poverty, healthcare and education that are the underlying causes of 
those problems; now therefore be it 
 
Reallocations from the Police Department budget can be accomplished through 
funding changes to proposed positions in the FY21 budget that are currently vacant 
and will not require layoffs; and

ORDERED: 

The council does not want to see any reallocations from the Youth and Family 
Services (SRO/YRO), Community Relations, Procedural Justice, School Crossing or 
other community building programs in the FY21 budget , or any other cuts that would 
jeopardize the hiring of Cambridge community members into the police department in 
FY21, or that would otherwise reduce the diversity of the police department; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager commit to placing a temporary hold on filling police 
department vacancies while beginning the hiring process for the following positions 
currently budgeted for only three months. These vacancies equal the $2.5 million 
Police Department budget increase. These positions which reflect City Council 
priorities include:  
 

o  The hiring of a new case manager in the city manager’s Housing Liaison 

Office,  

o  The hiring for a new Associate Housing Planner, Preservation and 

Development Housing Planner, new Compliance and Asset Manager, part-
time inclusionary Housing Assistant, 

o  The hiring for a social worker in the Central square library, 
o  To provide funding for additional leadership for Equity and Culture, 
o  The hiring for two new Birth to Third Early child positions

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours, 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Anthony I. Wilson  
     City Clerk 

 

 

 

 

 
      

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

hereby _______ approve      _______ disapprove of said driveway petition.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Thursday, June 11, 2020 9:40 AM
City Council
Clerk; City Manager
Regarding Last Night's Meeting

Dear Councillors and Mayor Siddiqui,

I would like to submit a response in writing regarding Police Commissioner Bard's statement at the City Council meeting 
last night.

Commissioner Bard said that many of the emails sent to the City Council regarding defunding the Police Department 
appear to have been form letters from a "national website". Indeed I am sure that many people did use the 
defund12.org/cambridge website to send emails to the City Council and the City Manager. That is because I, a 
Cambridge resident and activist, wrote and posted the "form letter" listed on that website. Its contents are a mix of 
language taken from the letter to the Boston City Council and my own research on the Cambridge Police Department 
based on data found on our open data portal.

You can check out the link to the issue request I made on code sharing site GitHub here: 
https://github.com/defund12/defund12.org/issues/130 and cross reference the handle on the post (jsstoroz) with my 
name in this email and on this account: https://github.com/jsstoroz

I am personally offended and disgusted by the Police Commissioner's insinuation that my work organizing our 
community around an issue which they feel passionately and the #DefundThePolice hashtag is some kind of 
disinformation campaign staged by outside aggressors. The Commissioner does not get to decide whose voices count as 
"authentic". In addition, as Councillors Zondervan and Sobrinho-Wheeler pointed out in the footnotes of their Policy 
Order 2020 #133, the movement to defund the police was literally started by Black Lives Matter leaders.

To the Mayor and the Clerk specifically - I thank you for your calm and rational handling of the proceedings last night. I 
am disappointed to find, however, that while there are procedural rules about the use of offensive language there is no 
similar procedural way to handle blatant lying and misrepresentation of the truth. I am disappointed that Councillor 
Zondervan's interruption was met with such hostility. I understand that interrupting a speaker is impolite, but I believe 
that the Council has the right and the responsibility to hear the truth at all times.
Allowing Commissioner Bard to make inaccurate claims on top of allowing him such a long amount of time to speak 
without time for rebuttal, either from the public or from the Council, was unconscionable.

Although he is an expert with a PhD, Police Commissioner Bard is by no means a "neutral party" in this debate. He is first 
and foremost a spokesperson of the Cambridge Police Department and has a vested interest in seeing that institution 
carry on its business as before. If the Council wishes to have expert testimony, it would behoove them to invite experts 
in the fields of prison abolition, decarceration, and racial justice to speak, as racial justice is the goal we are trying to 
accomplish! There are many such experts who indeed also live in Cambridge and the greater Boston area. Seek them 
out, and listen!

Do you realize that last night was, for many Cantabridgians, the first time they ever watched a City Council meeting? Is 
this the kind of image you want to portray to the people who elected you? Frankly, it was embarrassing to see 
Councillors so blatantly reveal their personal enmity towards each other in an official meeting of our City's government.

As my elected representatives, I urge you to spend less time arguing over supposed infractions of decorum and your 
personal feelings. Spend more time listening to the message that speakers are trying to convey and listening to the 
message that the people are sending you. Over 400 people signed up to speak on Monday and thousands of emails 
flooded your inboxes. Listen to that voice - your citizens, the people who elected you, who have no "agenda" except to 
tell the City Council and the City Manager how they feel and what they think ought to be done.

Councilors,

Ashley Brown <ashleybrown415@gmail.com>

City Council; City Manager; Clerk
Defund the police, and do this instead

As your constituent, I want you to know that I stand in strong support of removing funds from the police department 
and using those funds more appropriately.

Here are a few of the reforms I'd like to see:

•

•

•

•

•

•

End overtime pay. For example, having a cop stand at every single road construction project all over the city is 
asinine. I see cops from many other cities at our local road construction projects. Other states do not do this. It's 
a waste of money and it needs to end.
End traffic enforcement by armed police. Traffic stops by armed cops disproportionately affect people of color. 
They are excuses to conduct searches that would otherwise be illegal. We all know about "speed traps" that 
exist to generate revenue for small towns -- like so many other things, traffic stops are largely about 
money. There are other, better ways to keep our roads safe.
Create a publicly-available database showing all complaints against police officers and the outcomes of those 
complaints. There is no need for privacy here. The cop who killed George Floyd had 17 prior complaints against 
him, but no one could see them. We need to be able to see them.
Stop using my tax dollars to pay for incredibly expensive used military equipment. Police departments today 
own assault rifles, armored personnel carriers, and stuff you’d see in a war zone. Police officers have grants and 
huge budgets to spend on guns, ammo, body armor, and combat training. 99% of calls for service require no 
armed response, yet when all you have is a gun, every problem feels like target practice. Cities are not safer 
when unaccountable bullies have a monopoly on state violence and the equipment to execute that monopoly.

• Use armed police extremely sparingly, only when they are truly needed. Armed police should not be used to 
make roads safer, or respond to car crashes, or help a mentally ill person who is not a danger to others, or 
handle noise complaints, or find missing people, or rescue people in dangerous situations that don't involve 
another armed person, or make schools safer, or to stand at every construction site, or to conduct interviews 
about committed crimes, or to help during natural disasters, or to help with crowd control...

• No more qualified immunity. Police officers should be personally liable for all decisions they make in the line of 

duty. Consider refusing to indemnify city police officers if they are sued.

• No more civil asset forfeiture. Did you know that every year, citizens like us lose more cash and property to 

unaccountable civil asset forfeiture than to all burglaries combined? This is theft, pure and simple.
Break the power of police unions. Police unions make it nearly impossible to fire bad cops and incentivize 
protecting them to protect the power of the union. A police union is not a labor union; police officers are 
powerful state agents, not exploited workers.
Require malpractice insurance. Doctors must pay for insurance in case they botch a surgery, police officers 
should do the same for botching a police raid or other use of force. If human decency won’t motivate police to 
respect human life, perhaps hitting their wallet might.

Sincerely,
Ashley Brown
Michael Way, Cambridge

Public Comment on Charter Right Item 1: POR 2020 #133 

“If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be 
necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty 
lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it 
to control itself” (Madison, Federalist 51).  

Hello, my name is Carl Rothenhaus and I am a resident of 75 Lawn street in the Strawberry hill 

neighborhood of our fair city. I believe this quote nicely sums up the challenge we face in the city of 
Cambridge today. The problem of public officials, namely police officers, and the inability to exercise the 
cherished quality of restraint. The Cambridge government must always work to control itself, especially 
now. One of the best ways to do this is through allocating funds towards programs that prize restraint 
and societal growth and allocate funds away from programs that do not. Tactical Operations Units do 
not uplift restraint, and as we have seen in other cities, do not foster government control of the 
governed. Increasing militarization has only led to the increasing distrust amongst the populous towards 
the members of the Cambridge Police. I thus urge the passing of this policy order and look forward to 
the city council adopting further reform policies that prize restraint and societal growth in all branches 
of the Cambridge government.

On the charter righted policy order

Charles Franklin <cjfman@gmail.com>
Monday, June 15, 2020 4:43 PM
City Council; Clerk
Tonights Comments

Last Monday I spoke about my experience as a black man with the police in general, but  I didn’t talk about the 
Cambridge Police in particular as I have mixed feelings about this department. More than once I've seen the Cambridge 
Police use the minimum force necessary in response to a person in Central Square who was a danger to themselves or 
others. On the other hand, I hear and read stories about excessive use of force from the same department. I myself have 
had my own scary experience with a Cambridge officer. I’ve often say to friends that the Cambridge Police have earned 
my trust, something I've never said about any other police department, but sometimes that trust falters. I can't explain 
why, I just know that it does, fair or otherwise.

I meant what I said last week, that everytime I see an armed officer I fear for my life, even if only for a brief moment. 
When Commissioner Bard took the stage at the protest last a week ago in the common, the first thing I saw was his gun 
and thought why did he bring it on stage. That's even after seeing him in person basically every Monday for two years in 
this chamber.

Regardless, I support the policy order to redirect the increased budget and to sell that ridiculous tank thing, not because 
of a fault with the Cambridge Police, but because not every social indiscretion needs an armed officer to respond. As a 
community we need to rethink how we solve certain problems, diversify and specialize our responses as well as increase 
direct funding for social programs that may help decrease the need for armed intervention in the first place

To end all of that, I believe that we’re a strong community and we’ll get through this profoundly turbulent time 
regardless of the budget. Be kind to your neighbor, and most importantly be kind to yourself. Thank you.

~Charles

Re: Invest More in our Community Health & Future, Not Policing

My name is Charlotte Cooper, I am a resident of Cambridge and I am writing to you once again to ask you to 
vote for Policy Order #7 in Monday’s vote.

According to the ACLU, the United States’ current police budgets total more than $115 billion per year,
collectively. That growth of government funds committed to policing and the criminal legal system has 
enormously outpaced spends in community-based services that provide the foundation for safe and healthy 
communities. I am passionate that here in Cambridge we should be at the leading edge to start turning this 
devastating tide. It will take time to take a magnifying glass to our cities budget at large but there are steps we 
can take today to begin that work. I believe that we can be a model in Massachusetts and beyond for the 
investment in community care over cops, and that begins with a vote for Policy Order #7.

Black and Brown members of our community have felt the presence and excessive force of our police 
department more than white members of the community and white members of the community, of which I am 
one, have failed our neighbors in our silence. When I began writing to the council the loss of George Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery were on my mind. Today, I sadly must add Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta to 
that list. These four people are the newest names in a list that stretches back through our histories. These four 
lost lives are part of a painful legacy of policy violence that we must work harder to correct. We cannot bring 
back the dead, nor can one letter or one vote undo the legacy of anti-Black racism but there is work that we are 
called to do. We are obligated to participate in the rebuilding of our country, to reimagine how society functions 
so that each person is able to live their lives truly free.

I am writing this letter of support for Policy Order #7 today in solidarity with the leadership of groups and 
movements such as the Movement for Black Lives, the Agenda To Build Black Futures and Black Lives Matter. 
I will continue to invest in that leadership, to support and follow their lead in the development of community-
controlled institutions and interventions that pave a strong route to public safety and health. And as long as I 
am a resident of this city, I will continue to use my voice to ask you for that support too. Please vote for Policy 
Order #7.

My Regards,

Dear Mayor Siddiqui,

My name is Charlotte Cooper, I am a resident on Cambridge and I am asking you to vote in favor of Policy Order #7 to 
reallocate a significant amount of the proposed police department funding to essential human services, which are 
under threat during this pandemic.

I was moved by the 250 or so testimonials I heard yesterday evening at the City Council meeting and the knowledge 
that over 2,000 folks had emailed the Council in full throated support for Policy Order #7. From recent graduates, to 
born & bred Cambridgians, from mothers, fathers to doctors and teachers... the community came together and spoke 
in unified favor of Policy Order #7. I urge you to follow that call for action and vote for Policy Order #7.

The push for justice did not begin with the tragic murders of Black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna 
Taylor at the hands of police officers, and this step will not complete the work we have to do but it is a very 
real commitment to real and lasting change for our community. 

Cast your vote to decrease funds for systemic police violence. Decrease funds that criminalize Black and 
Brown members of our community. Decrease funds that turn health and family emergencies into prison 
sentences, physical injury or death. Support Policy Order #7 and increase funds for health and human 
services. Help us meet both the urgency of this moment--for true justice and healing--and create a 
stronger foundation for us to weather the storm of Covid-19 through this year and next. 

I ask that you do everything in your power to respect the community’s clear calls for justice and change, and 
vote for Policy Order #7 and vote against any weakening amendments to it—especially those that 
would dilute or strip the final “Resolved” clause that commits the Council to approve next year’s budget 
only if it reallocates these funds.

With Kind Regards,

Support for Proposal to Reallocate Resources

I’m writing as a resident of Cambridge living on Linnaean Street since 2016. It recently came to my attention that the 
Council is considering a proposal to reallocate $4.1million dollars for the Cambridge FY21 budget from policing to 
community health initiatives. I am writing to enthusiastically support such a proposal.

In my time as a resident of Cambridge, I have witnessed startling interactions between police officers and civilians in 
public spaces such as Danehy Park, the Corcoran Playground, and the Radcliffe Quadrangle. Despite reassurances that 
CPD receives world-class training in proper protocols for interactions with civilians of a diverse range of life 
experiences—such as differences in race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, ability status, and so on—I remain 
disturbed by the abrasiveness of policing interactions that I have witnessed these past four years. I am left with the 
overwhelming sense that the “proper protocols” are the problem, insofar as they dehumanize my fellow Cambridge 
residents and generate a sense of disenfranchisement in those who bear the brunt of the most unsavory interactions, 
often unwarranted, with CPD personnel.

I have similarly been disappointed by the weaponization of police by civilians against other civilians. For example, I was 
recently made aware of the CPD being called on a Black resident of Cambridge who was removing their own bike from a 
bike rack using clippers after misplacing their bike lock keys. There are, of course, even more notorious and infamous 
instances of similar racially-inflected dynamics in which white residents call the police on Black residents who are 
behaving well within the law (consider, for example, the case of Henry Louis Gates, Jr. having the cops called on him for 
attempting to enter his own home in Cambridge . The point, in my eyes, is that certain bodies continue to garner 
unwarranted suspicion from their fellow citizens, and the police are used to turn that immaterial suspicion into material 
violence against law-abiding members of our community.

For these reasons and many others, I am enthusiastic about the reallocation of funds to community health initiatives. 
The possibility of such a reallocation makes me proud to call Cambridge “home” at this critical time of national uprising 
in defense of Black lives. I hope the City Council will help bring such pride to fruition by approving the proposal to 
reallocate funds to community health initiatives.

In solidarity,
Denson Staples

Re. Rethink Cambridge Police

A few hundred Cantabrigians have apparently signed a letter penned by Malaika Moses and "spoke 
overwhelmingly in favor of Policy Order #7" in a meeting on Jun 8, according to the site www.rethinkcpd.org.

As a Cambridge resident, I have not been informed about this exercise, and only found out about it after the 
fact. Moreover, I wonder how many of the close to 100,000 other adult Cambridge residents (who did NOT sign 
the letter OR speak in favor of Policy Order #7) were actually aware of this exercise, and whether or not they 
would be right to feel intimidated into NOT speaking up against some or most of the demands.

The City must confirm whether or not it intends to enact policy change based on agitation, without proper or 
representative consultation, and in the absence of a public referendum on the subject.

We Need a Budget That Represents US

Hello, My name is Emma Bryson. I am a resident of Cambridge, MA and I am emailing to demand the restructuring of our 
city budget, so as to prioritize more social services for our community, and to drastically minimize spending on Police. It 
is unconscionable that 1/3 to 1/2 of the city’s budget is going to the police department. This does not align with the 
values that I have as your constituent and I demand that you and other city officials work together to draft and approve 
a budget that diverts funds from the police department and reallocates them directly to benefit those in need. 
Defunding the police and restructuring the budget is an absolute necessity now more than ever. Police perpetuate a 
pattern of excessive violence and force, especially directed towards Black People and their communities. The police 
refuse to hold their own accountable and this is unacceptable. We are in the middle of a global pandemic that has killed 
100,000 Americans and more than 40 million people have filed for unemployment. Healthcare workers are without 
proper equipment and essential workers are not being fairly compensated or protected for the great work they do. We 
don’t need more police, we need more social safety nets. Funds intended for police would be better off being sorted to 
initiatives that Enrich our public schools and students Provide more affordable housing and mental health care initiatives 
Protect and bolster our parks Support small businesses struggling due to COVID-19 Provide cheaper and cleaner modes 
of public transportation Our nation is grieving the deaths of Black Americans that were murdered at the hands of police 
officers who have yet to be held accountable. While the police department has more funding than it knows what to do 
with, we have communities who desperately need funding and every day they don't receive it their quality of life 
worsens. Thousands have died who did not need to. You have the ability to change this, so do it. Sincerely, Emma 
Bryson

Support for Proposal #133

I am a student and employee of Harvard University, and as such spend much of my week in the City of Cambridge, 
though I am a resident of a neighboring town. I would like to express my support for the proposal that would reallocate 
the $4.1 million increase to the police budget and divert it to public health initiatives in other departments.

The reason I support this proposal is that it would make Cambridge safer for my fellow students, for residents of 
Cambridge, and for all the people who pass through Cambridge on a daily basis. I support all proposals that would 
reduce police funding and reallocate those funds to positive community initiatives, especially those providing health 
care, education, and housing.

Thank you,

Abolish the Cambridge Police Department

My name is Mac Loftin and I am a graduate student at Harvard. I am writing to demand that the City of Cambridge 
abolish the Cambridge Police Department. The city must spend its budget on truly essential services - education, 
pandemic relief, healthcare, community centers - not surveillance, weapons, and the criminalization of our Black and 
brown community members.

Please support Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler's Policy Order POR 2020 #133 and only support an FY21 budget 
if it eliminates the police budget and reallocates funds to the real needs of Cambridge’s residents and workers.

Additional Public Comments in Support of Policy Order #7

I am sharing with you the comments I made during this evening's call. Thank you for the opportunity to express our 
continued support for Policy Order #7.

Public Comment:
This is Malaika Moses. I'm calling-in to underscore the Moses family's point of view on the police budget and to 
reinforce the points made in the letter we submitted to City Hall last week, which was signed by over 300 people.

This is not about 'defunding' the police. This is about developing a moral budget.

We fully expect that The City Manager, The Police Commissioner, The Mayor and the City Council will come together to 
design a budget that serves the needs of young black and brown youth in Cambridge.

We have an opportunity to do three things:
#1)  Restructure the budget and put money into programs that actually work to help black and brown kids in Cambridge.
#2) Preserve the jobs of minority officers who are actually doing good work and helping black and brown kids in 
Cambridge.
#3)  Establish clear and enforceable regulations of accountability such that police who  abuse their powers of office are 
fired.

Institutional racism is embedded in the school dept, banking institutions, and our police department. It's time for the 
city of Cambridge to address the issue in all its forms.

Policy Order #7 doesn't intend to stop the good work that the Police Dept is doing nor put good programs at risk for 
defunding.  

It's time for our leaders to do what needs to be done to build a budget that pivots the police force away from being a 
force of oppression, intimidation and brutality and towards public safety and justice.

Sincerely,

Malaika Moses

Bard's remarks on Policy Order 7

Dear Cambridge City Council members,

I watched the city council meeting on Wednesday. And, frankly, as a citizen of Cambridge, I find it offensive that the 
police commissioner dismissed the outcry from constituents as some kind of baseless, performative act. Just because he 
does not agree with us does not mean he should dismiss our concerns so readily. It may be good to remind the CPD that 
their role is to serve the public, and that includes listening to and considering our concerns rather than immediately 
going on the defense.

Furthermore, Commissioner Bard misrepresented the proposal by discussing all the program cuts he would have to 
make if it passes, despite the fact that this proposal is for diverting funds from a proposed increase in his budget. 
Therefore, it would not even be a cut to their current budget. I would like to know why keeping the police budget at the 
same level would so adversely affect them/those programs.

Additionally, I have seen reports that the Cambridge Police did in fact obtain military-grade weapons 
(see: https://www.cctvcambridge.org/CPDMilitarySurplus and http://www.cambridgeday.com/2020/06/10/motion-
over-redirecting-4-1m-in-police-funding-causes-council-to-explode-in-anger-accusations/), so I would like to know if 
they have gotten rid of those weapons/vehicles or if it was just a blatant lie.

For being such a progressive city, I have to say that it is disheartening to see how defensive Commissioner Bard was with 
a proposal that essentially just asks that the police department maintain their current funding level next year. I can only 
imagine what the reaction would be to a measure to divest from or dismantle the police.

Thank you for your service and for taking the time to read my comments.

Sincerely,
Maria Suarez

Policy Order #7

My name is Michael Roberson. I’m a resident of Cambridge and a city employee and union member for going on ten 
years. I am writing to once again voice my strong support for Policy Order #7, to divert the 4.1 million dollar increase to 
the police budget to other city departments.

This is a crucial time in Cambridge, and in the country as a whole. Racist violence by police forces across America is out 
of control. Mild reforms are not the answer. Diverting funds is.

The community has made their voice heard. Almost 400 Cambridge residents, myself included, made time to speak at the 
city council meeting last Monday to voice our support for this policy order. Please do not ignore the voice of your 
constituency or the greater call to action nationwide. The time for change is now. Please vote for Policy Order #7 and vote 
against any amendments that would seek to weaken or dilute it.

Now and always, Black Lives Matter.

Thank you for reading,

Michael James Roberson

Reduce the Cambridge Police Department budget

My name is Michelle Bentsman and I work in Cambridge and live on the Cambridge-Somerville border. I write 
in avid support for City of Cambridge reducing the Cambridge Police Department budget. Cambridge’s needs 
must be addressed by the provision of care, and not the threat of violence. It is time to invest in public services 
that build towards a truly “free and fair society” rather than an armed force that endangers us.

Enduring racial inequalities within this city have been brought into sharper focus as a result of the pandemic, 
and they cannot be solved by policing. Many have lost access to income, putting their food security and 
housing at risk. Essential educators are living on starvation pay while repeated and overwhelming community 
demands to right this glaring injustice are ignored.

Meanwhile, the Police Department is the single largest expenditure in the City’s General Fund behind loan 
repayments. The CPD currently spends 52% of its budget on patrolling–$33,000,000–or 7x as much spending 
on patrol than social justice initiatives. This imbalance is appalling.

It is time for City Council to stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in Black 
and Brown communities–starting with cutting the least transparent and most harmful parts of the CPD budget.

Please support Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler's Policy Order POR 2020 #133 and only support an FY21 
budget if it reallocates this funding from the Police Department to other measures that promote public safety 
and address underlying issues that can’t be solved by policing – like poverty, the lack of affordable housing, 
and healthcare.

Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities–it happens here in Cambridge too. The City Council 
must stop investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown communities 
need to be safe and healthy: COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, school equity initiatives, 
cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects.

Thank you,
Michelle Bentsman

please add my name to this letter
Letter to City Council- Policy Order 7 -June 9 2020.pdf

I support this attached letter.  
 
I've lived in Cambridge for 18 years. And while in general, I think the Cambridge police often do a good job, we can do 
better and spend our money more wisely.  
 
The time is now to make the changes we need. I want to make Cambridge a safer, better place for everyone‐‐and Black 
people, in particular, need some real changes, which I support.  
 
sincerely,

Statement presented to Cambridge City Council on Tuesday, June 8, 2020: 

My name is Malaika Moses. I am a black woman born and raised in the Port. I'd like to speak on 

behalf of Janet Moses and the Moses family in support of Policy Order #7.

  

We want to thank 

Councilors Zondervan and Sobrinho-Wheeler for their courageous stance that the city budget is a 

moral document that reflects what we as a city truly value.   We have an opportunity to 

re-imagine, to re-think and to re-create a department of public safety for the City of 

Cambridge.  Here are six suggestions: 

 

1. Reduce the police force to reflect the national average of hires for cities with at least 

The national average is 16.8 officers and 19.4 department personnel for 

100,000 residents.  
every 10,000 people.  Cambridge has 24.9 officers and 29 personnel for every 10,000 people. 
While reducing the police budget we must preserve jobs for all minority officers with ties to the 
community and give them more leadership roles on the force. 
 

2. Require that all new hires live in Cambridge and all previous hires who 

 to relocate do 
the same. 
Substantial citations for abuse of police power 
 
The City would subsidize their housing.
 
would result in a loss of housing subsidy.

3. Require elections to vett members of the Police Review & Advisory Board and review 

The board was established to reflect the community 

current members for Anti Black biases.  
but current composition does not.  Board members have five-year terms and can serve 
To the best of our ability, we must ensure that the Board does not harbor anyone,

regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity, with racist "Amy Cooper-like" mindsets.  
 
Inventory the military hardware that the police department harbors and demand that all 
equipment be returned to the federal government, including the three armored tanks that 
the city has. 
 

4.

5. Disarm the police in multiple ways  

a. Study the UK model of using billy clubs rather than guns. 
b. Eliminate the use of chokeholds and other overly aggressive and life-threatening tactics. 
c. Require that body cameras be worn and turned on when officers are on duty. 

 

6. Rename the department: 

Words matter so, in closing, we propose that the department be

The Department of Public Safety

re-named, 
symbolize a break from the historical mission of Police which is rooted in slavery - the mission 
was to monitor, terrorize and control black bodies who must be reminded to stay in their place or 
be beaten or killed.  These practices are still being carried out.

For decades, police in Cambridge have been reminding black boys and girls in this city that they 
are black and require a heavy hand.  I’ll never forget the looks, the glances, the steady and 
persistent harassment my brothers and friends had to face as boys and face as grown men. 
 

The time is now to make the necessary changes in the funding of public safety, and in the 

policing practices that are employed to help ensure that Cambridge is a safe, just and peaceful 

community. 

 
ADDENDUM 
Over 300 people have signed in support of the ideas presented in this letter (pages 4 and 5).  Below are 
additional ideas 
 

that have been expressed by those in support of this letter.  

 

officers
 

1. As the department restructures, 

we must preserve the jobs of Black and Brown 

 with longstanding ties to the community. 

2. Keep the jobs of school officers 
if they’re just working with kids.  
 

but they should not have guns or wear full uniforms 

3. Of particular concern is the use of police for mental health emergencies. Having an 

armed police officer show up when someone is undergoing a mental health breakdown is

Identify the priorities (with community input) for the money saved by reducing the Police 
Dept. budget - i.e. schools, mental health & social services, community programs for 
youth, more community health initiatives, services for homeless folks, etc.

Hi Cambridge officials,

Demanding a Change in Budget

My name is Natalie Taylor, and I’m a resident of Cambridge—Cambridgeport specifically. I am emailing to demand the 
restructuring of our city budget. We must prioritize preventative measures and social services for our community and 
drastically minimize spending on police. It is unconscionable that so much of Cambridge’s budget goes toward the police 
department. 

Police perpetuate a pattern of excessive violence and force, especially directed towards Black people and their 
communities. The police refuse to hold their own accountable and this is unacceptable.

The overfunding of this department does not align with the values that I have as your constituent, and I demand that 
you and other city officials work together to draft and approve a budget that diverts funds from the police department 
and reallocates them directly to benefit those in need.

We don’t need more police, we need more social safety nets. Funds intended for police would be better allocated to 
initiatives that:

• Improve our public schools and enrich our students • Provide more affordable housing and mental health care 
initiatives • Support small businesses struggling due to COVID-19 • Provide cheaper, cleaner, more reliable modes of 
public transportation

Our nation is grieving the deaths of Black Americans that were murdered at the hands of police officers who have yet to 
be held accountable. While the police department has more funding than it knows what to do with, we have 
communities who desperately need funding. Thousands have died at the hands of a system that does not protect them. 
You have the ability to change this, so please do it.

I look forward to seeing how you will work to keep our communities safer and better supported through a defunding of 
the police department.

Best,
Natalie Taylor

Dear Cambridge City Council, 

Miura, Naohito <naohito_miura@fas.harvard.edu>
Sunday, June 14, 2020 11:01 AM
City Council; Clerk; City Manager
concerns about the Cambridge Police Department budget

My name is Naohito and I am a resident of Cambridge. I am writing to ask the City Council to redirect parts of 
the Cambridge Police Department budget to invest instead in public services that build towards “a free and 
fair society” (rather than an armed force).

Our city faces racial inequalities that can’t be solved by policing. The City Council can take a stand for racial 
justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in Black and Brown communities—starting with cutting 
the least transparent and most harmful parts of the CPD budget.

I've heard that the Police Department is the single largest expenditure in the City’s General Fund behind loan 
repayments, and that the CPD currently spends 52% of its budget on patrolling—$33,000,000—or 7x as much 
spending on patrol than social justice initiatives.

Please support Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler's Policy Order POR 2020 #133 and only support an FY21 
budget if it reallocates this funding from the Police Department to other measures that promote public safety 
and address underlying issues in our community that can’t be solved by policing—like poverty, the lack of 
affordable housing, and healthcare.

The City Council must stop investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and 
Brown communities need to be safe and healthy: COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, school 
equity initiatives, cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects.

Thank you,
Naohito Miura

Re: Vote YES on Policy Order #7 

Dear Mayor, 
I tracked the recent debate over PO#7. I was deeply disturbed by the number of bad faith arguments put forward 
against this policy order. I would urge you to support the policy when it comes up or I will have to reconsider my 
vote in future elections.

Sincerely, Paul Clarke

Subject: Vote YES on Policy Order #7 

Dear Mayor Siddiqui,

My name is Paul Clarke. I’m contacting you as a resident of Cambridge (30 Langdon St #11) and as someone 
who voted for you with a high priority in the last election. I urge you to vote in favor of Policy Order #7 to 
reallocate a significant amount of the proposed police department funding to essential human services, which 
are under threat during this pandemic.

Your community has spoken clearly in favor of Policy Order #7. Almost 2,000 people sent emails to 
Council supporting Policy Order #7, and over 250 supporters testified at Monday night’s meeting in support. 
People across the country are taking to the streets to demand an end to the tragic murders of Black Americans 
like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police officers. Policy Order #7 answers these demands 
with real and lasting change in the form of decreased funds for systemic police violence, and increased funds 
for health and human services that protect and empower Black and Brown communities.

I ask that you do everything in your power to respect the community’s clear calls for justice and change, and 
vote for Policy Order #7 and vote against any weakening amendments to it—especially those that 
would dilute or strip the final “Resolved” clause that commits the Council to approve next year’s budget 
only if it reallocates these funds.

Thank you,

Paul Clarke

Reduce the Cambridge Police Department budget

My name is Rebeccah Stromberg and I am a resident of Cambridge. I am writing to demand that the City of Cambridge 
reduce the Cambridge Police Department budget. Cambridge’s needs must be addressed by the provision of care, and 
not the threat of violence. We must invest in public services that build towards “a free and fair society” rather than an 
armed force that endangers us.

Our city faces racial inequalities, borne from historical injustice and brought into sharp relief by the COVID-19 epidemic, 
that can’t be solved by policing. Members of our community live in tight quarters and on lean budgets–this before a 
pandemic stole three months of wages, and counting. Thousands of us are becoming food-insecure and are at risk of 
eviction as soon as the ban is lifted. Essential educators are living on starvation pay while repeated and overwhelming 
community demands to right this glaring injustice are ignored.

Meanwhile, the Police Department is the single largest expenditure in the City’s General Fund behind loan repayments. 
The CPD currently spends 52% of its budget on patrolling–$33,000,000–or 7x as much spending on patrol than social 
justice initiatives.

Now especially, the City Council can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and investing in 
Black and Brown communities–starting with cutting the least transparent and most harmful parts of the CPD budget.

Please support Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler's Policy Order POR 2020 #133 and only support an FY21 budget if it 
reallocates this funding from the Police Department to other measures that promote public safety and address 
underlying issues in our community that can’t be solved by policing – like poverty, the lack of affordable housing, and 
healthcare.

Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities–it happens here in Cambridge too. The City Council must stop 
investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown communities need to be safe and 
healthy: COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, school equity initiatives, cooperative businesses, community 
centers, community-led organizations and projects.

Thank you,

Market Failure: On Appropriating $50,000 to Comcast To Fix The Problem They Created

Below, are the remarks I plan to make during public comment tonight:

To The Honorable, The City Council:

These comments refer tot City Manager Agenda items #9, about the unfavorable recommendation for the City IT budget and #10, a request to 
appropriate $50,000 to pay Comcast for internet services for families who couldn’t other wise afford it.

i want to thank Councilors McGovern, Carlone, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Zondervan and Vice Mayor Mallon for their “no’ vote on the City’s 
Information Technology Budget, a vote that forced the Manager’s hand to finally agree to a municipal broadband feasibility study. I’d urge you 
to refer his communication to Committee and hold a hearing to gather more details of what the City is planning. And I want to apologize to the 
City’s new Chief Information Officer, Pat McCormick, for welcoming him to Cambridge this way. Pat, I’m sorry but I’m sure you understand.

Let me call your attention to one line in the Manager’s communication.

It is my understanding that most communities with successful municipal broadband systems have some combination of a municipal electrical 
plant and/or a substantial broadband market failure.

“Market failure.”

This brings us to the Manager’s next agenda item, a request for $50,000 to purchase internet access for 400 households who otherwise 
couldn’t afford it. Surely the City put this out to bid and…

Of course it didn’t. And nobody expects it to because we all understand that we don’t actually have a market for broadband, we have a 
monopoly. I’m not sure what the Manager thinks a market failure looks like but, for the rest of us, the mere existence of this request 
demonstrates market failure.

I’ve talked about the telecommunications policy vacuum in the City and I’m sure eyes are already glazing over. But this is what it gets you: 
Councilors are presented with a vote to support digital inclusion which requires handing $50,000 and untold City staff hours to one of the most 
hated corporations in America, a company whose profits continue to grow, a company that continues to use our money to buy back its own 
shares, and whose policies have reinforced digital redlining. Rather than penalize this bad behavior, we’re rewarding them with some of the 
easiest money they’ve made. Meanwhile, somewhere else in the City, folks are renegotiating the Comcast cable TV franchise agreement, 
seeking to maintain the federally mandated fees Comcast is obligated to pay. Why bother when you’re just going to turn around and hand 
Comcast money anyway?

Personally, I’m not going to hold a pro-Comcast vote against any Councilor. Getting our neighbors connected, especially at this time, can be a 
matter of life or death. But I will expect Councilors to hold the City accountable for putting us in this position. And, let’s be frank. The City 
describes this as a “new initiative” but if this is what digital inclusion in Cambridge is going to look like - just paying peoples’ internet bills - we 
could have done this a decade ago.

We all know what this is, and all the happy talk I expect to hear can’t disguise it. Please just make sure that, the next time, we have better 
options than just giving City money to the entity that created the problem in the first place.

Statement presented to Cambridge City Council on Tuesday, June 8, 2020: 

My name is Malaika Moses. I am a black woman born and raised in the Port. I'd like to speak on 

behalf of Janet Moses and the Moses family in support of Policy Order #7.

  

We want to thank 

Councilors Zondervan and Sobrinho-Wheeler for their courageous stance that the city budget is a 

moral document that reflects what we as a city truly value.   We have an opportunity to 

re-imagine, to re-think and to re-create a department of public safety for the City of 

Cambridge.  Here are six suggestions: 

 

1. Reduce the police force to reflect the national average of hires for cities with at least 

The national average is 16.8 officers and 19.4 department personnel for 

100,000 residents.  
every 10,000 people.  Cambridge has 24.9 officers and 29 personnel for every 10,000 people. 
While reducing the police budget we must preserve jobs for all minority officers with ties to the 
community and give them more leadership roles on the force. 
 

2. Require that all new hires live in Cambridge and all previous hires who 

 to relocate do 
the same. 
Substantial citations for abuse of police power 
 
The City would subsidize their housing.
 
would result in a loss of housing subsidy.

3. Require elections to vett members of the Police Review & Advisory Board and review 

The board was established to reflect the community 

current members for Anti Black biases.  
but current composition does not.  Board members have five-year terms and can serve

regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity, with racist "Amy Cooper-like" mindsets.  
 
Inventory the military hardware that the police department harbors and demand that all 
equipment be returned to the federal government, including the three armored tanks that 
the city has. 
 

4.

5. Disarm the police in multiple ways  

a. Study the UK model of using billy clubs rather than guns. 
b. Eliminate the use of chokeholds and other overly aggressive and life-threatening tactics. 
c. Require that body cameras be worn and turned on when officers are on duty. 

 

6. Rename the department: 

Words matter so, in closing, we propose that the department be

The Department of Public Safety

re-named, 
symbolize a break from the historical mission of Police which is rooted in slavery - the mission 
was to monitor, terrorize and control black bodies who must be reminded to stay in their place or 
be beaten or killed.  These practices are still being carried out.

For decades, police in Cambridge have been reminding black boys and girls in this city that they 
are black and require a heavy hand.  I’ll never forget the looks, the glances, the steady and 
persistent harassment my brothers and friends had to face as boys and face as grown men. 
 

The time is now to make the necessary changes in the funding of public safety, and in the 

policing practices that are employed to help ensure that Cambridge is a safe, just and peaceful 

community. 

 
ADDENDUM 
Over 300 people have signed in support of the ideas presented in this letter (pages 4 and 5).  Below are 
additional ideas 
 

that have been expressed by those in support of this letter.  

 

officers
 

1. As the department restructures, 

we must preserve the jobs of Black and Brown 

 with longstanding ties to the community. 

2. Keep the jobs of school officers 
if they’re just working with kids.  
 

but they should not have guns or wear full uniforms 

3. Of particular concern is the use of police for mental health emergencies. Having an 

armed police officer show up when someone is undergoing a mental health breakdown is

Identify the priorities (with community input) for the money saved by reducing the Police 
Dept. budget - i.e. schools, mental health & social services, community programs for

Dear Cambridge leadership,

Yasmeen Abdel-Ghaffar <yaghaffar0912@gmail.com>
Thursday, June 11, 2020 4:23 PM
City Council; Clerk; City Manager; Siddiqui, Sumbul; Mallon, Alanna; Carlone, Dennis; 
McGovern, Marc; Nolan, Patricia; Simmons, Denise; Sobrinho-Wheeler, Jivan; Toomey, 
Tim; Zondervan, Quinton
Concerns on Cambridge's Policy Order #7

I have been following the events occurring in Cambridge and am sure you all have your plates very full. So, I will keep 
this as concise as possible. I appreciate you taking the time to read this despite the current climate and challenges you 
are facing.

I was raised in Cambridge and matter of fact graduated with Mayor Sumbul Sidiqqui, of whom I am deeply, deeply proud 
of. She has entered office at one of the most critical times in Cambridge's history.
I know the old Cambridge, the essence of Cambridge in how progressive and accepting it is of people of all walks of life. 
It has been the greatest place I could have ever grown up in as a first generation Boston born woman. I don't see the 
best in Cambridge being reflected with this policy order #7. It is hastily put together, incomplete, and not based on merit 
or statistics per Cambridge PD. Cambridge PD has always been an overwhelmingly positive force in my life and in the 
lives of many Cantabrigians (who are not transient). From SROs to experiences as an adult. Cambridge PD is not 
Minneapolis PD. Cambridge PD is not Chicago PD. Cambridge PD is not NYPD. To allow the blanketing of Cambridge PD 
with police departments across a country of over 300 million is to continue the creation of this culture of blanketing. 
Which is exactly what the peaceful Black Lives Matter movement is fighting against. Blanketing in all regards and to ANY 
group is immoral and a threat to the achievement of greater justice and equality.

The city of Cambridge and native Cantabrigians and long term residents of Cambridge need to be apart of the discussion. 
This policy order has been moving at a rapid pace without the consideration of the most valuable community leaders. 
For these decisions to be considered at a time where emotions are high is going to show protests (during a pandemic) 
and riots work. People repeat things that work. You can't change racism overnight. Racism is a belief set. It has to 
change. The peaceful protests have mostly had a good message. But there are elements that are not progressive 
especially the movement within BLM called "Defund the Police" These are major changes that will affect the morale of a 
police department that is being backed into a corner which is asking for greater instability. This is no time to experiment. 
This is no time to cave to pressure. Truth always lasts, lies and altered realites never do no matter how much it appears 
it does. No one has to pick a side here. Please survey the community. Survey, survey, survey. You cannot determine the 
future on the feedback from less than 1% of the city's population.

I also suggest you survey data from individuals who GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE. I would be glad to help with this. It can be 
done.

I plead with you to include many more in the discussion of this policy order #7 and work together with Cambridge PD as 
a community. The stronger the partnership, the easier it is to see the instigators and dividers that just want a whole 
different Cambridge than the one most want. Please don't let it happen. Stay united.

WHEREAS: 

In Cambridge, 45.4% of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, 
demonstrating there is a large demand for school meals; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  When Cambridge Public Schools made the shift to remote learning in response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, students who typically rely on school meals were put at risk of 
experiencing food insecurity; and 
 
Eight school meal distribution sites were created to fill in this resource gap, offering 
breakfast and lunch each weekday to students in need since March 16th; and 
 
These school meal distribution sites are led by a team of site captains:

volunteers are trained, that meal distributions run smoothly, and that each family feels 
connected to this devoted team committed to their health and wellbeing during these 
daily interactions, all while risking their own safety to perform this crucial work; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record as thanking these dedicated site captains for their 
critical efforts in expanding students’ access to nutritious food; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

The Y2Y Shelter serves 18-24 year old unhoused youth by providing shelter, 
connecting them to services providers, offering case management and programming, 
performing advocacy, and raising awareness about the issues homeless young adults 
face; and 
 
As a student-run youth shelter, Y2Y’s operations were jeopardized when many college 
campuses across the Greater Boston area closed in response to the COVID-19 public 
health crisis; and 
 
A group of dedicated students remained local in order to keep the shelter open, filling 
in a critical gap, as unhoused young adults often feel uncomfortable in shelters serving 
broader age groups; and 
 
Together, this group volunteered hundreds of hours, allowing the Y2Y Shelter to 
remain open through the traditional season end (April 15th) and beyond to meet this 
need and adapt to ever-changing circumstances; and 
 
The Y2Y Shelter volunteers:

MAYOR SIDDIQUI 
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
 
WHEREAS: 

On June 19th, people throughout the country will be celebrating Juneteenth, which 
commemorates June 19, 1865, the day in which slavery was formally abolished in the 
state of Texas, and which has come to be regarded as the final, formal date of 
emancipation of all remaining former slaves throughout the United States of America 
at the end of the Civil War; and 
 
45 states in the union currently recognize Juneteenth and celebrate this holiday each 
year in acknowledgement of the ending of one of the most shameful aspects of this 
country’s history, and in the continual hope that the United States shall forever strive 
to become a more perfect union, and shall forever work to move closer to its founding 
ideals of being a nation where all the citizens truly are considered equal; and 
 
In the 155 years since the end of the Civil War, the United States has unquestionably 
made great strides, and has also suffered from numerous setbacks, in the long march 
toward civic equality for all its citizens; and 
 
Juneteenth remains an important date for us to pause each year to reflect upon the 
progress we have made, and to contemplate the work that remains as we seek to create 
a more just country for the generations to come; and 
 
On June 1st, this City Council went on record recognizing the importance of June 19th 
and urging all Cambridge residents to reflect upon the meaning of this important day; 
now therefore it be 
 
The City Manager is hereby requested to find the appropriate City staff to raise the 
Juneteenth Flag on June 19th at City Hall.

Cambridge City Council 

Quinton Y. Zondervan, City Councillor 

Amendments to Policy Order 2020 #133 

I’m planning to introduce these amendments on Monday night to make it absolutely clear that 
Policy Order 2020 #133 is not asking for any layoffs in the Police Department, and that we want 
to protect and increase the diversity and community representation of the Department. 
Insert the following WHEREAS and RESOLVED after the last WHEREAS of the existing order: 
WHEREAS: The FY21 proposed Police budget includes $3.7 million in vacant positions 
(not counting the vacant school crossing guard positions), including $1.7 million in the 
Day Patrol, Night Patrol and Traffic cost centers, and the budget also includes $1.1 
million in the Tactical Operations unit, one of the more militarized aspects of the 
department; now therefore be it 
RESOLVED: The City Council does not want to see any cuts to Youth and Family 
Services (SRO/YRO), Community Relations, Procedural Justice, School Crossing or any 
other community supporting programs, or any other cuts that would jeopardize the hiring 
of Cambridge community members into the police force in FY21, or that would otherwise 
reduce the diversity of the police force; and 
So that the full Policy Order would read as follows: 
WHEREAS: In response to the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 and 
Breonna Taylor in Louisville on March 13-as well as the deaths of numerous other Black 
Americans murdered in the name of law enforcement-a wave of massive and sustained protests 
has erupted nationwide; and 
WHEREAS: The same communities of color leading these protests have been the hardest hit by 
COVID-19 and the ensuing economic recession; in Cambridge, Black residents are testing 
positive at a rate three times higher than white residents[i]; and 
WHEREAS: On May 30, reflecting some demands many Black movement leaders have begun 
to coalesce around, Black Lives Matter launched a new combined campaign to 
#DefundThePolice and #InvestInCommunities hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic[ii]; and

WHEREAS: On June 1, the City Council unanimously passed POR 2020 #126[iii], describing 
horrifying instances of police violence across the country, condemning police brutality 
wholesale, and affirming its solidarity with people of color who have suffered under unjust 
criminal justice systems; and 
WHEREAS: Because of COVID-19, the City is anticipating less revenue for FY21 than originally 
anticipated and is expecting to delay the hiring of new positions, including in the Human 
Services and Community Development Departments; and 
WHEREAS: Commitment to anti-racism in Cambridge requires material policy changes away 
from using policing as a response to our city’s problems and toward addressing the human 
services issues of poverty, healthcare and education that are the underlying causes of those 
problems; and 
WHEREAS: The FY21 proposed Police budget includes $3.7 million in vacant positions (not 
counting the vacant school crossing guard positions), including $1.7 million in the Day Patrol, 
Night Patrol and Traffic cost centers, and the budget also includes $1.1 million in the Tactical 
Operations unit, one of the more militarized aspects of the department; now therefore be it 
RESOLVED: The City Council does not want to see any cuts to Youth and Family Services 
(SRO/YRO), Community Relations, Procedural Justice, School Crossing or any other 
community supporting programs, or any other cuts that would jeopardize the hiring of 
Cambridge community members into the police force in FY21, or that would otherwise reduce 
the diversity of the police force; and 
ORDERED: That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to report back to the Council on 
how some, or all, of the $4.1 million dollar increase in the Police Department budget between 
FY20 and FY21 may be redirected towards measures that promote public health and safety in 
other departments; and 
 
ORDERED: That the City Manager report back to the Council in time for the June 15 City 
Council meeting at which the Council will vote on whether to adopt the proposed FY21 budget. 
RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record stating its intention to support a proposed FY21 
budget only if it includes a significant reallocation of funds towards measures that promote 
public health and safety other than policing.
