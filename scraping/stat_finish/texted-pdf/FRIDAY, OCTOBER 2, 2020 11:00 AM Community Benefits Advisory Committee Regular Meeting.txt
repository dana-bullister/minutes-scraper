Instructions on application: [Please attach] A brief description of how grant funds will be used, including a description 
of services, anticipated number of residents served, duration of services, and how this funding will support your 
continued ability to meet the needs of vulnerable Cambridge residents (2 paragraphs suggested)

are received by the City.

the grant agreement, and can be expended sooner.   

 
Proposed language: Please provide a brief description of how grant funds were used to deliver services and indicate the number 
of Cambridge residents served with this funding 
 
Discussion 
• 
•  Don’t want to make this burdensome on grantees, and reasonable to ask for financial reporting to understand how 

Include that grantees need to submit invoice – i.e., report on $10k and invoice for $4k 

money was spent 
•  Ask for four things:  

o  Number of residents served  
o  What services were delivered  
o  What needs they met 
o  How they spent the money 
For reporting, take hybrid approach:  

• 

o  Electronic form:  

▪  Number of residents served 
▪ 
Key/ primary needs met (top 3) 
▪  Amount spent of staff/ salaries 

City of Cambridge                                                                                                                                                                    cambridgema.gov

III. Implementation Grants & Communications with Partnerships 

Fall timeline:  

• 

SEPTEMBER/ OCTOBER 
Communications from CBAC to 
reconnect, identify forthcoming 
evaluation tools [COMPLETE!] 

OCTOBER/ NOVEMBER 

Check-in meetings between CBAC 
and each Partnership* 

•  HRiA administer evaluation tools: 

Social Network Survey & 
Organizational Capacity Survey   

• 

• 

NOVEMBER/ DECEMBER 
Partnerships submit 6-month 
report to CBAC (including basic 
outputs to date) 
*CBAC supports for partnerships 
(potentially including convening?) 

• 

 

 

• 
Check-ins with Each Partnership 
Purpose: Strengthen direct connection between CBAC and each Partnership, and understand where each Partnership is and 
how CBAC can be helpful moving forward 
 
What questions should we ask during check-ins? What, as funder, do we need to know? How can these check-ins be helpful to 
Partnerships?  
 
Proposed dates: 
•  M October 26, 11:30am – 2pm 
• 
T October 27, 12pm – 2pm 
•  W October 28, 10:30am – 1pm 
• 
F 10/30, 10:30am – 12:30pm 
 
CBAC Discussion:  
Questions to consider asking –  
•  What are they learning about their Partnership?  
•  How have they been impacted by COVID and what are the implications for their Partnership, their services, the people they 

• 

are serving/ intended to serve? How have things changed?  
From their perspectives as service providers, what is the impact of COVID on the people they serve? What are they seeing 
on the ground?  

•  What are observations/ reflections about collaboration?  
•  What kinds of barriers/ obstacles have they encountered (that they didn’t expect)? 
•  Where are they at, and how is that different from original and revised timelines – where are they in relation to where they 

•  How do they think things will play out moving forward? What are their plans for the next 3 months?  
•  How can CBAC help them – what is it that we, as a committee, can do to support them?  
•  How much is COVID fundamentally impacting the goals to address housing insecurity and homelessness, financial 

insecurity, and mental/ behavioral health? To what degree are Partnerships still able to address each of these?  

expected to be?  

 
For shared context –  
• 

The purpose of the check-ins is to strengthen direct connection between CBAC and each Partnership, and understand 
where each Partnership is and how CBAC can be helpful moving forward 
CBAC understands that the world has shifted dramatically in the past 6+ months – even since Partnerships submitted 
revised plans in April – and we recognize the severity of the crises we are living in; CBAC is holding the intention that amid 
these crises, there is opportunity to work differently together  
CBAC had clarified some things – but not everything – about Implementation and our expectations of Partnerships pre-
COVID, and hearing from Partnerships can help with further definition of Implementation moving forward; this includes 
considering what will be required to receive Year 2 funding 
CBAC wants to be in partnership with Partnerships to help them meet their intentions, even as they may become further 
modified – i.e., work with Partnerships to make this work

• 

CBAC funded very different kinds of Partnerships, and they may be in very different places – we are seeking to understand 
the place(s) they are in 

•  We know that they are all at different phases in their Partnerships and in implementation – CBAC is looking to measure 

against their own timelines/ phases   

•  May be useful to be collectively grounded in what Partnerships said they would do pre-COVID and then where they thought 

they would be with revised plan 

•  HRiA data will provide complementary information to help inform us 
 
CBAC’s expectations for these conversations –   
• 

Be very clear about our expectations for these conversations – we are seeking to listen and learn from them to inform our 
future conversations, decisions, and supports; CBAC is open to hearing what they need, even as we are unsure how we will 
respond  
CBAC wants Partnerships to succeed and recognizes that we need to be in ongoing communication and hear honest 
feedback to learn/understand where they are and how to help  

 

 

Check-in meetings with Partnerships – end of October, poll forthcoming 
Planning Grant Process Evaluation Report – CBAC will revisit at future meeting to determine what it wants to do with this  
Lisa Peterson announcement:  

o  Retiring in January after working with City for 31 years; CBAC work very meaningful; will remain with CBAC until 

o  Committee member terms will be discussed with each member and vacancies (her position, resident member, 

January 

business member) will need to be posted
