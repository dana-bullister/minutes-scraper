carnival has dimensions far beyond civic.  He questioned how an event is cancelled based on something 
that happened in Boston two weeks ago.  Regarding cannabis, he said that the American world is looking 
to Cambridge as to how equity will be rolled out for all.  He said that it is an opportunity to ensure that 
people who have been at the end of the line can get closer to the front.   
   
James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, spoke on Policy Order #15.  He said that if there was evidence of 
a threat, why couldn’t something be done to address the threat.  He said that he thinks that a better job 
could have been done.  As it relates to Calendar Item #8, he asked for the definition of affordable storage.  
He said that when it comes to conversations about affordable housing, the people who are left out of the 
conversation are the people who live in affordable housing units.   
 
Mahmood Abu-Rubieh, 170 Brookline Street, spoke on Calendar Item #8.  He stated that he supports the 
New Street project that will bring 22 affordable housing units to Cambridge.

June 8, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing to update you on the City’s efforts to respond to the restaurant community’s need to 
expand outdoor dining services in response to Governor Baker’s announcement that restaurants 
will be permitted to provide outdoor dining services at the commencement of Phase II of the 
Commonwealth’s Reopening Plan; and to request that the City Council vote to temporarily 
authorize me or my designee to issue all permits for temporary street obstructions, including 
Sidewalk Business Use Permits to restaurants that seek to operate outdoor dining on the sidewalk 
from this date until November 30, 2020 without prior City Council authorization, as explained 
below. 
 
The City has established a new streamlined process  that will allow a restaurant to file a single 
application through the City’s online licensing and permitting system to obtain all necessary 
approvals for operating outdoor dining services.  The single application will be reviewed by all 
necessary City Departments simultaneously and will result in an expedited review and approval 
process.  The application will be used for restaurants seeking initial approval to operate outdoor 
dining services, and for restaurants seeking to expand their existing outdoor dining services.  The 
application will be used for outdoor dining services on both private and public property, and for 
restaurants that have a permit to sell alcohol with food in their outdoor dining patio if they are 
using the City’s sidewalk to do so. Finally, the application will allow restaurants to apply to 
expand their outdoor patio dining area to other parts of the public way, beyond the sidewalk, if 
approved by all of the permitting departments as well as the City Manager.  After a complete 
application is filed and all necessary City Departments have reviewed and approved applications, 
there will be a final approval from the Board of License Commissioners (the “Board”), and 
issuance of a Temporary Outdoor Extension License and Temporary Street/Sidewalk Alcohol 
Extension License.   
 
This streamlined and expedited procedure for such temporary approvals is authorized by 
Governor Baker’s June 1, 2020 Order Clarifying the Progression of the Commonwealth’s Phased 

2.7

 

 

Packet Pg. 101

2.7

Workplace Re-Opening Plan and Authorizing Certain Re-Opening Preparations at Phase II 
Workplaces (the “Order”).  The Order temporarily waives some of the time-consuming 
procedural requirements for restaurants that are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-
premises consumption that are applying to operate outdoor dining services and waives the 
requirement that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission approve such requests.  The Order 
also waives zoning requirements that may prohibit outdoor dining services.  Any approval for 
outdoor dining services issued pursuant to the Order is in effect only until November 30, 2020.  I 
note that there is also legislation pending (House No. 4774) that was passed by the House of 
Representatives on June 3, 2020, as amended, that if passed by the Senate and signed into law 
would address some of the same issues addressed by the Order, and depending on whether the 
Senate passes any amendments, may alter some of the requirements in the Order.  We are 
carefully following this pending legislation and will revise the City’s procedures if necessary. 
 
Additionally, the City will be expanding its policy of allowing outdoor dining services on the 
public sidewalk and will also allow outdoor dining services in existing parking areas and other 
portions of the public way.  The new application procedure set forth above will allow an 
applicant to request the use of a parking area or the public way for outdoor dining services, 
subject to the approval of the Department of Public Works, the Traffic, Parking and 
Transportation Department, the License Commission and City Manager. 
 
Finally, presently the City requires that restaurants that seek to operate outdoor dining on the 
sidewalk obtain a Sidewalk Business Use Permit, after permission to grant such approval is 
issued by the City Council. In order to expedite this process, and to address the anticipated 
increased demand, I am hereby requesting that the City Council expand its prior authorization for 
me or my designee to grant such approvals, along with any other necessary approvals for 
temporary street obstructions, from this date until November 30, 2020.  In 1997 the City Council 
adopted a standing order authorizing the City Manager to act on such requests after the final City 
Council meeting in June and prior to the first September meeting of the City Council. The 
proposed order expanding the time frame for that approval process would allow approval for a 
restaurant to use the sidewalk to be incorporated into the streamlined procedure set forth above, 
and not require a separate application and approval process.  
 
I look forwards to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have. 
 

 

 

Very truly yours, 

 

Louis A. DePasquale

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Definitions 

Cycling Safety Ordinance 

Chapter 12.22  
 
Section 12.22.010 
 
This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.  
 
Section 12.22.020 
 
This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the 
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected 
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City. 
 
Section 12.22.030 
 
A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or 
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle 
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in 
both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.” 
 
D. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that 
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City. 
 
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of 
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction 
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion, 
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine 
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a 
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

H. “Public Transportation” shall mean bus and shuttle stops for the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific 
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist 
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or 
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible 
loading, intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle 
lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so 
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better. 
 
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a 
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.  

      
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours,

     City Clerk

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Needed: Better communication for local response to Covid-19 

 

 

 

As we push to reopen businesses and schools, leaders are talking about hygiene, distancing, 
screening, and masks -- the four tools that have kept health-care workers safe. These tools can 
work, says Atul Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, but he warns that “it’s 
worrying how little officials are discussing what it takes to deliver them as a whole package.”  

There is a fifth element to success, says Dr. Gawande, “culture. It’s one thing to know what we 
should be doing; it’s another to do it, rigorously and thoroughly.” 

We know we can count on zero leadership this year from Washington toward these practices and 
culture. At the state level, Governor Baker is helping by promoting testing, contact tracing, and guidance 
for distancing and masking. But it is mainly up to local leadership to persuade people to follow public 
health guidance rigorously and thoroughly. 

Cambridge has been doing this through mailings, email and web updates, phone messages, signs, cable 
TV Q&A sessions with the Mayor and City Manager, and loud speakers on sound trucks. Uniformed 
police officers have promoted the use of face coverings by distributing thousands of masks. 

New strategies are needed to promote consistent use of all the tools necessary for safety. These 
strategies will have to work on a continuing basis for months if not years. By comparison, the message 
for the initial lockdown was simple, “stay inside and don’t get near to anyone if you can avoid it.” The 
challenge now is to persuade as many people as possible to follow a demanding package of new 
practices until a reliable cure or vaccine for the coronavirus becomes widely available.  

These practices can’t be imposed in the same way as public closures and the masking order, which are 
already meeting resistance.  In workplaces and schools handwashing, distancing, monitoring for 
symptoms, and self-isolating can be required. It’s up to government to promote the same practices in  
homes and public spaces. These efforts will reinforce each other. And it will be much easier for people 
to follow a consistent set of practices that don’t shift from one situation or place to another.  

The City can do much more to promote the culture of Covid-19 safety we need. Here are three specific 
proposals that can be rapidly implemented. 

First, bring the campaign to as many people as possible and engage the public in streets and squares 
with 60 to 100 large-screen television displays in windows of public buildings and stores at strategic 
locations broadcasting public health videos, such as from the Centers for Disease Control, current local 
guidance, bulletins, and alerts in a short, visually appealing loop. The goal would be to reach everyone 
who lives in or visits Cambridge, including young children, who can be key influencers, people who are 
not on the internet, and newcomers who will arrive in large numbers as businesses and universities re-
open. The displays would also remind everyone to keep up the four basic practices.

Unlike printed signs, the content of the displays can be continually updated as guidance changes and 
there is new information about local cases, testing, prevention, treatment, and care. Everyone needs to 
have the same information and guidance. All the time. 

Second, support independent reporting on local impacts and responses to Covid-19 by placing regular 
public health notices in local newspapers including the Cambridge Chronicle and Cambridge Day.  Paid 
advertisements could include the text of the City’s bulletins and news releases as well as reminders of 
current guidance. They would reach off-line audiences including many elderly and at the same time 
support independent reporting on responses to Covid-19. Local stories and reporting are essential 
ingredients for creating a new culture of vigilance and response.  

Third, lead with medical and health expertise by organizing regular public briefings and Q&A sessions by 
the Commissioner of Public Health, medical experts, and scientists. Greater transparency and metrics 
will build public trust and confidence. Town halls with the City Manager, an administrator with a 
background in finance, and Mayor, a political leader, do not have this effect. The public is hungry for 
current, scientific information about the pandemic. (When Broad Institute CEO Eric Lander held an 
informal Q&A session by Zoom recently, over 250 local residents participated.) 

There would be costs to implementing these measures. It is reasonable to ask if the City can afford them 
as it spends more in other areas to respond to the pandemic. Better communications are urgently 
needed to foster and sustain the new culture that says “I might be contagious and don’t want to be the 
one who infects someone else.” It will help contain the coronavirus, save lives, and improve health and 
our economy. It will be money well spent.

June 4, 2020 
 
Dear City Council: 
  
We are a coalition of Cambridge residents, those who work or own businesses in Cambridge, 
and members of Cambridge Bike Safety. 
 
We are deeply concerned that the City has not done enough to ensure residents’ safety when 
conducting essential travel during the coronavirus pandemic. The lack of safe pedestrian, 
cycling, and transit options for essential travel has exacerbated the current public health crisis, 
as well as the economic crisis that Cambridge local businesses are currently facing. Nearly 30% 
of Cambridge residents are without a car, and now have no way to safely get to their local 
businesses while ensuring appropriate physical distance from others.   
 
In the last two weeks, well over 1000 of us have signed a petition asking the city to take 
immediate and comprehensive action to enable safe essential travel and to support local 
businesses. The petition requests that the City take five specific actions: 
  

1) Create a continuous citywide network of widened sidewalks on busy streets by adding 
signage and barriers that allow people to walk safely in the street while maintaining 
physical distance from others. 
  
2) Implement Neighborhood Slow Streets in areas where widening sidewalks isn’t 
possible, so that people can walk or bike safely through their neighborhoods to local 
business districts. 
  
3) Request that DCR widen sidewalks and bike paths on Memorial Drive by blocking off 
two lanes for people to use for walking and biking for essential travel, while leaving two 
lanes for motor vehicles. 
  
4) Complete the 20-mile citywide network of protected bike lanes that promotes safe travel 
by bike for people of all ages and abilities. 
  
5) Help the MBTA to quickly implement changes to improve and continue access while 
enabling social distancing (e.g., more frequent and longer bus service, and creating 
priority bus lanes), and to make significant investments now for the long-term. 

  
We are pleased, therefore, that the City has announced that its Shared Streets pilot will start in 
mid-June and that the City Manager and City Staff have worked with City Councilors and 
community members to prepare an amendment to the Cycling Safety Ordinance currently on 
the table that accounts for the coronavirus pandemic and will allow the Cycling Safety 
Ordinance to move through the legislative process with the joint support of the City and 
Cambridge Bike Safety.

These, however, are only small first steps. 
 
We ask that the Council ensure that the Shared Streets pilot expands substantially beyond its 
current scope, so that it creates a network that reaches all neighborhoods in the city; that the 
Council and Manager advocate to DCR for a 24/7 shutdown of two lanes on Memorial Drive for 
those who walk or bike for essential travel; and that the Cycling Safety Ordinance be passed 
into law as soon as possible. 
 
This is a critical moment. Cambridge has made great progress over the past years to enable 
everyone to get around the city safely and equitably. If we do not, however, move much more 
aggressively than we have to date during the coronavirus pandemic, we risk squandering this 
progress. 
  
Thanks for your support. 
 
 
Petition to Enable Social Distancing on Cambridge Streets 
 
This petition was developed by a coalition of Cambridge residents, local business workers 
and owners, and members of Cambridge Bike Safety. 
 
Background 
 
Over the past several weeks, Cambridge residents and essential workers have had to rely 
increasingly on walking or biking for essential travel in lieu of public transportation to 
minimize exposure to COVID-19. However, Cambridge residents and workers are currently 
unable to maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet from others when walking on narrow 
sidewalks and paths. When they choose to get on a bicycle for essential travel, they 
encounter unsafe roadway conditions. Cambridge has completed only 4 of 20 miles of the 
planned network of protected bike lanes that would ensure biking is a safe travel option for 
people of all ages and abilities. In the last month alone, people on bikes have been killed in 
Arlington and Boston due to the lack of protected bike lane infrastructure. 
 
The lack of safe pedestrian, cycling, and transit options for essential travel has 
exacerbated the current public health crisis, as well as the economic crisis that Cambridge 
local businesses are currently facing. Nearly 30% of Cambridge residents are without a car, 
and now have no way to safely get to their local businesses. Sidewalk space will be in even 
higher demand as local businesses smartly expand onto sidewalks for queuing, outdoor 
dining, and other uses to continue serving the community as safely as possible.  
 
Many cities in the metro Boston area, as well as across the US and the world, are acting 
decisively to provide safe routes for people walking and biking, and it is imperative that 
Cambridge take action now to protect the health of vulnerable residents and to encourage 
support for local businesses. Cambridge must also work with the MBTA to ensure residents

While adjustments in travel planning and behavior would 
have to be made, the positive effects on neighborhood, 
county and planet (sic!) outweigh all that!  

Right now, walking or biking in Cambridge while social 
distancing is simply not possible. The sidewalks are not wide 
enough. I sometimes just chose to walk down the middle of 
street instead, but that is also scary (especially with the cars 
driving faster than ever). As we head into a long summer, 
Cambridge needs to allow its residents to safely access open 
spaces, including their own streets.

Larchwood Drive (and "The Larches" in particular) serves 
a
h
even in normal times as a thoroughfare for walkers and bikers 
S
 
e
from all over Cambridge, Belmont, and elsewhere - now, 
n
during COVID-19, both the number of walkers and bikers has 
about tripled. There are, now, only very few cars driving 
through, but if they do, often they are extremely fast (driving 
fast seems a sign of the times), thus endangering people 
considerably. In normal times, people drive through here in 
order to avoid the Huron/Freshpond Pkwy traffic light. Since 
this is mostly during rush hours, people tend to be extremely 
s
a
impatient, drive way too fast, and often blow their horns at 
w
n
bikes and pedestrians. All in all, drive through traffic is a 
o
i
serious annoyance to many people enjoying their (bike or 
t
a
c
foot) commute or daily exercise, and, what is more important, 
n
u
is endangering those people's lives. Making the car commute 
m
m
through this street considerably harder (but not impossible), 
o
c
especially if the street is narrow enough that cars have to pay 
A
more attention, might limit traffic to those cars who are not 
just looking to shave of 10 second off their commute. Please 
also note that this is one of the few streets that allow free 
parking, thus offering people access to Fresh Pond. This is a 
good thing, but in present traffic conditions, with cars 
whizzing through, the extra parked cars create extra 
obstacles that causes the through traffic to swerve and thus 
be more of a danger to bikes and pedestrians.

We have no car, a one-year-old child, and two dogs. We have

Outdoor time is essential for mental and physical health. The

frustrating that this is the case when there is so much more

each makes it seem like the reverse is true. In addition, since 
car traffic is so low, cars are traveling faster, increasing the 
chance of fatalities in collisions. Slow streets would mean I 
wouldn't have to worry about this risk as much. When 
businesses open up, fewer people (including myself and my

It would make me less afraid to go outside.  

in groups, who meet someone on our 3-4 foot sidewalk. 
Moreover, we all need more room to walk, ride bikes 
(especially kids) and generally be outside AND keep social 
distance from others, even if we all try to wear masks. 
Sometimes you are thrust into situations where you cannot 
avoid close contact.  

With people unlikely to return to full public transit use during 
the pandemic, there is a risk that public transit use will be 
replaced with driving. This would have a strongly negative 
effect on the city due to increased traffic and air pollution (not 
to mention moving in the wrong direction towards carbon-
reduction goals to fight the larger climate change problem). 
We need creative alternatives to driving, and shared or 
closed streets that can encourage more walking and biking 
are a great way to start.

as expanding initiatives like Neighborhood Slow Streets, it will 
make the streets feel safer for both pedestrians and cyclists 
alike.  

I would be able to bike more safely between my home and 
Brookline and Cambridge. Thank you for your efforts to keep 
us healthy and safe.  

I feel the impact would be positive. The more space there is 
for bikes and pedestrian traffic the better both in terms of 
social distance and climate impact.

As a resident of Cambridge, and a cyclist/walker, these 
proposals would make cycling and walking around my 
neighbourhood not only safer, but also more enjoyable. I 
strongly support this plan  

I don't own a car. My bike is my primary means of 
transportation. We need more space for bikes and 
pedestrians, especially in this period of social distancing.  

I would be more likely to frequent local businesses, as my 
radius of daily exploration is restricted by fear of car 
accidents.

They would make me much more comfortable walking and/or 
biking instead of using rideshare apps or public transit, which 
put me at higher risk of contacting COVID-19.

Expanding walkway/bikeway space along the river would 
allow me to stroll my baby alongside my older child on his 
scooter while staying 6 feet away from others. We also have 
significantly reduced traffic for the time, so it creates the 
opportunity to shift Mem drive to two inner-most lanes and 
also enforce the citywide speed limit.

Most sidewalks are too narrow to walk safely and keep 
distance with passers by.

I bike to work at Mount Auburn Hospital and it is dangerous 
along the very narrow paths along memorial drive to fit all the 
cyclists and pedestrians safely even before trying to maintain 
safe distance. Widening the paths along memorial drive 
would improve safety for everyone.  

I would feel I could more safely bike. The bike path on the 
Charles is TOO NARROW for all the runners, walkers and 
folks with children!

Expanded pedestrian access would greatly contribute to our 
mental and physical health through the duration of the Covid-
19 pandemic, and in the future as well.  

I would feel safer biking and walking on the streets, and it

would motivate more people to bike instead of driving the car,

which would also increase the quality of air in Cambridge.

Covid-19 months with sheltering has been a much safer time 
for pedestrians, bicyclists and also drivers in our 
neighborhood - also a reminder of how unsafe it has been for 
over a year with the neighborhood used as a cut through to 
avoid lights at Huron, Brattle and Fresh Pond Parkway.

People are currently walking/running in local streets, and 
biking on DCR parkways, to maintain distance - this would 
protect them and allow many others to enjoy time outdoors 
while maintaining safe distance.  

would make is safer for me to exercise because the paths 
and sidewalks, especially on nice days, are packed. 
moreover, many paths are in desperate need of repathing: 
this could be a perfect opportunity to "pathe" them with solar 
walkways.  

It would make it easier for me and my wife, who is pregnant, 
to be able to go outside safely  

As the weather gets warmer, more people want to be outside-
- I want to encourage people to be outside and to exercise 
outside while maintaining social distance!  

I would feel safer about my family and all people walking, 
running, and cycling in Cambridge. We would all be able to 
keep appropriate distance without having to potentially run in 
the road to dodge others. Of note: Like many others, we 
rarely drive these days; there is less traffic; cars need fewer 
routes of travel to reach their destinations. It's a reasonable 
time to close roads.

It's essential to our collective health and safety to do this. 
With more people moving outside their homes, we have to 
reconfigure our public realm to address the current public 
health crisis. I look forward to being able to support my local 
business and maintain my health through outdoor exercise 
and simply do not feel safe with the current conditions. There 
is plenty of evidence from other cities about how effective 
these measures can be. Please listen and take action now!  

My family and I are regular bikers and walkers in Boston and 
Cambridge, and this will improve our quality of life and 
safety.  

 

i

 

Ive been working in Cambridge for 18 years. Bikes are 
everywhere! This era of diminished traffic seems like an 
s
a
important opportunity to make these improvements as well as 
w
n
create the space for safe distancing  
o
i
t

These changes would improve our quality of life, simply. 
c

While the Charles River parklands are the primary outlet from 
u
m
East Cambridge's dense street grid, a neighborhood slow 
m
o
streets initiative would do much to improve the comfort and 
c
A
safety in our immediate neighborhood. The public right of way 
 
:
 
0
directly abutting the residential district is constrained by 
2

competing uses of car storage, street tree planting, and, now, 
2
#
physically distant outdoor activity. Sandwiched between 
3
0
3
bustling Kendall Sq. and the Rt. 28 corridor, this 
M
O
neighborhood should be able to support universal public 
C
health goals and avoid the out-sized risks presented by fast-
moving traffic and narrow sidewalks which compress walkers 
too-tightly. This would also provide an opportunity to invest in 
our local urban forest in the part of the City with the lowest 
canopy coverage. Making this environment more 
accommodating to these trees serves to improve local air-
quality, mitigate heat-island effects, and maintain the integrity 
of what remains of our local, Charles River-based 
ecosystem.

with less busy streets, automobile drivers have taken 
advantage to speed even faster, resulting in a maintenance

Will help improve the mental health of residents as they will 
be more able to move about the city safely (away from cars 
while maintaining physical distancing).  

I live in Somerville and work in Cambridge. The more 
pedestrian- and bike-friendly Cambridge is, the more 
comfortable I will feel spending additional time in Cambridge 
to patronize the Cambridge business community outside of 
work. Currently, Cambridge feels rather hostile to me in this 
respect.  

Much safer for families who walk/bike outside for 
exercise/sanity (sidewalks get too crowded when 2 families 
pass each other, someone must walk in a street with traffic)

bicycling options is critically important to the safety and health 
of the citizens of Cambridge.  

It is important to me for Cantabrigians to have safe bike 
routes for commuting, exercise, and enjoying fresh air.

The path along the Charles is too narrow to enable proper 
social distancing. More space should be allocators allow for 
safe exercise and alternative commuting options.

Would be great not to have to dodge pedestrians in bike 
lanes while cycling. We can't stop making complete streets, 
now or ever.  

I bike from Somerville to Cambridge (HubSpot, 25 First 
Street, Cambridge) for work, and also drop my son at 
preschool, soon to be Kindergarten. I need a safer path to 
ride!

i bike and walk regularly, owning no car (by choice). cars 
speed by, i need to walk in roads to safely distance from 
other people, and the city and dept of conservation and 
recreation have unwisely continued to allow vehicles to use 
memorial drive on sunday (despite the annual closures in 
spring thru summer) rather than opening it to walkers and 
cyclists (as of May 13, 2020). i call on leaders and officials to 
implement the requests of this petition.  

Cambridge I think Cambridge would be safer and easier to 
get around. Initially it may be some what difficult to get use 
to.  

Winchester's Climate Action Plan call for similar changes. 
The more towns can work together to change our 
transportation system, the better. Transportation doesn't stop 
at the town/city line.  

I agree with the above. Frequently people have to walk in the 
street to social distance and that does not feel comfortable to 
do with my two school age children when we are walking 
around, and we have purposefully avoided the streets with 
more shops.

More space in cities should be given to pedestrian and cyclist 
only use. Widening sidewalks and creating cycling thorough 
fares would go a long way towards making safer cities for all. 
And as pedestrian zones typically increase land values and 
rent costs, would bring in valuable tax dollars to communities 
which enact these changes.

I work in Cambridge and bike there from Medford daily under 
normal circumstances. It is regularly a terrifying experience, 
and any efforts to increase safety would take a lot of stress 
out of my life (and quell the worries of my family who often 
are nervous about my commuting method).

We need safe space for our children to walk and bike while

The single greatest challenge in our society is climate 
change. The horrendous situation of Covid forces us to make 
change now to both address safe distancing and address 
climate change. There are countless cities stepping up - 
London as one example, here: 
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52689372 
Our city should be a worldwide example.  

Makes it easier to travel to/from & pick up food from 
restaurants in Cambridge.  

Making our streets and sidewalks safer and wider for walkers 
and bikers not only makes it easier to exercise and travel but 
it makes it easier to keep our social distance when 
exercising.

With so much less traffic these days, and more people out

walking and riding bikes, it is incomprehensible to me that the

city is making no effort to accommodate pedestrians and 
S

n
renewed interest in healthy, non-polluting forms of 
transportation. We'd be crazy not to take advantage of the 
moment.

I have two major concerns as a Cambridge Resident: 1. As 
much as possible I try to shop at and support local business. 
It's part of what makes Cambridge, Cambridge. We need to 
be supporting the community, and if these businesses are 
saying that can't survive without additional support, we need 
to support them. Cambridge won't be a place I want to live 
without the community and local businesses we have today.

2. Living in a tightly packed city was always a conscious

:
choice for me. If I had an excuse to never get in a car again, I 
t
n
e
would. But even as a resident, walking on the streets feels 
m
h
stressful in today's climate. There's no way to pass another 
c
a
t
person and maintain a 6 foot distance. I end up walking 
t
mostly in the bike lane, which poses its own issues. If we 
want people to feel safe going on a walk and staying sane in

a city, we need to give them solutions where they can do so 
safely. I don't want to have to choose between my mental 
health and my physical health.  

 

i
l

I often take the middle of the street when I cycle or walk; it'd 
nice to feel a bit more safe. I live in West Cambridge, where 
some of the sidewalks are very narrow and yet, the streets 
are very empty (aside from car storage).  

o
r
a
C
m
o
r
f
 
I cycle to work. I choose to cycle because it is the cheapest 
d
e
v
and fastest means of transportation within Cambridge and the 
i
e
c
northern parts of Boston. The lack of protected bike lanes in 
e
r
 
Harvard Str, Mass Ave. and parts of Broadway and 
Cambridge Str. makes me feel unsafe every time I commute. 
I generally opt to cycle outside of peak hours to avoid traffic, 
or to cycle in the sidewalk because it feels less dangerous. 
Cycling in the sidewalks is however inconvenient for 
pedestrians. Better bike paths and more spacious sidewalks 
would be a great win for our community.

and everyone will get to where they need to be.

large number of unleashed dogs. This may a separate issue 
but UNLEASHED dogs are a hazard to cyclists .especially if 
you are 80 . I have twice been knocked off my bike by dogs 
there. Even the best of owners ignore their dogs and just 
assume they will get out of your way ..but they are just like 
toddlers they go where they please . IN THIS PANDEMIC

In Theory this will also reduce the over use of local parks not 
on the route so those of us in the high risk group can use 
them for exercise walking without encounter as many people 
as currently occurs. Presently we have days of heavier 
congestion near Hoyt Field etc that makes it hard to social 
distance at various hours of the day.

I am a bike commuter who works at On The Rise, an 
o
c
organization in Cambridge that provides services to homeless 
A
people. I have been hit by a car door on my commute before 
(I was in an unprotected bike lane) and carry that fear with 
me each time I commute. I have observed that in this crisis 
time, though there are fewer cars on the road, drivers seem 
to be driving more quickly and less carefully. We've seen that 
reflected in the death of Charles Proctor just last month. I am 
understanding of how hard it is to coordinate transportation 
infrastructure and to balance the needs of pedestrians, 
6
n
bikers, individual drivers/vehicles, and public transportation 
o
i
t
i
drivers/vehicles. However, I think it is plain to see that 
t
e
p
pedestrians' and bikers' safeties are the most at risk because 
_
n
o
they are physically unprotected in comparison to those in 
n
n
vehicles. Furthermore, from a climate justice perspective, it is 
a
h
S
important for the City to make good on its promise to invest in 
 
e
n
transit options that do not create carbon emissions. I'm calling 
o
on the City to take action in prioritizing the lives and health of

the people in cars will hopefully be more attentive. I would like 
to see the 20 m/hr enforced.  

Without sidewalk widening, protected bike lanes, and 
neighborhood streets, it will be impossible for me to get to

I love walking around our city, but it has become more 
dangerous with COVID-19. I regularly feel the stress of other 
walkers to move into the road to avoid sidewalk traffic, which 
creates a dangerous pedestrian situation

be invaluable for my sanity and ability to do my job.  
 

I believe they will be good for public safety on many levels, 
from social distancing to safety from car accidents.

I bike all throughout Cambridge and am happy to have a 
means of getting around that doesn't take up a ton of street 
space, makes more space on buses (I don't have a car), and 
is good for my own health. But cars are flying these days and 
seem more and more unmindful of being careful and I am 
super afraid that if Covid doesn't get me, a car will.

It is hard walking around mid-Cambridge and keep a safe 
distance due to narrow sidewalks. Some people are good 
about moving away, other do not seem to have any sidewalk 
etiquette. Closing streets to traffic is a good idea. I 
understand that drivers still need to be able to get where they 
are going too.  

I don't have a car! I would love to be able to spend more time 
outside walking and biking with a mask, as many health 
officials has deemed it safe, but I implore the city of 
Cambridge to consider a large scale closure of streets to car 
traffic to help make this safe for car-less Cambridge 
residents.

I'm so disappointed in Cambridge for its blatant disregard for 
the needs of its residents. Like many city residents, I do not 
have a car. To keep public transit safe for the essential 
workers who need (and drive!) our busses, I walk or bike. But 
because of increased speeding on our empty roads, I feel I 
am sacrificing my own safety. Protect people, not cars.  

My children use bikes for transportation- make it safer for 
them. Though bikers when sharing roads with cars need 
better manners.

It's scary how fast drivers are speeding. I regularly see 
drivers going 25+ mph over the speed limit. Moving space 
from automobile use to pedestrian and cyclist use would 
provide more safe space for people to be active and would 
limit speeding and reckless driving.

Cambridge because there is a section of the route that is 
extremely unsafe for cyclists.  

The proposal to devote 2 lanes of Memorial Drive to bikers & 
pedestrians will not only facilitate social distancing, but 
enable better separation of bikers from pedestrians and 
thereby reduce the risk of biker-pedestrian collisions

I am biking everywhere now, and I am very aware of how 
much more reckless the few remaining drivers are being. It's 
very scary. Cycling in cambridge has always been 
dangerous, and it feels more dangerous now, not less. 
Everywhere else is adjusting to the increase in 
biking/walking/running, why not us?  

Living in East Cambridge, I walk almost everywhere I need to 
go. Given the speed and volume of vehicles in my area 
(especially on Cambridge St.) there's no way I could utilize 
the street as a way to maintain social distancing.  

(
 
 

I regularly end up running in the road on Memorial Drive to 
b
maintain social distancing. Fortunately the lack of cars makes 
4

that possible at moments, but would be safe if a lane was

fully closed.

The health and quality of life benefits of a fully realized 
protected cycle path net work for the city are immeasurable. 
No I take that back, there is a library of science that supports 
this position.  

i

Nearly everyday there is a calculus one does as a pedestrian 
- ignore social distancing guidelines and walk too close to 
one another on the sidewalk or walk in the street to maintain 
social distance from others and risk getting hit by drivers 
emboldened by the empty streets to speed and drive 
recklessly. Create safe streets now!

I have two 5 year olds and don't own a car. We used to bike 
everywhere, but kids who are 5 aren't able to safely bike in 
the street yet and staying six feet away from people on the 
sidewalk is just impossible. So we just don't go out with them 
on bikes anymore, but we would if there was more space on 
the streets for them to ride safely and stay safely distanced 
from people.

investment in greener transportation options over more

My whole family, and the families of everyone who lives and 
works in Cambridge, would be safer if we had more space to 
walk and bike while maintaining distance.  

Improve safety during outdoor exercise  

 

i

 

More safe cycling paths and walking options would allow me, 
my wife and my son bike and ride electric scooter safely and 
without worrying that a speeding car would kill us. There are 
fewer cars on the road - but they are going faster! Also, more 
area for walking and cycling would lessen the chance of 
passing too close to other pedestrians, which now is risky 
because of COVID.  
 

This is a tricky situation for both drivers and 
cyclists/pedestrians, but with work I'm sure the situation can 
be improved.  

As the weather gets nicer and more people go outside every 
day, it would be so nice if the city would accommodate 
increased pedestrian/bike traffic by opening up more space 
for us. I have also noticed that with reduced car traffic, cars 
seem to be driving faster than usual, so I'd like to see some 
enforcement of slower driving for pedestrian and cyclist 
safety.

As I’ve been hit by cars in Cambridge before, I’d like to see 
more bike-friendly streets and accountability placed on 
drivers. More signage put up by the city would help visually 
inform drivers when there are hard-to-see bike lanes or bikes 
turning. This signage should be considered and well-
designed - if the driver can’t see or read it, it doesn’t help!!

I am a resident living on Harvard street and I am in strong 
support of the slow street that is planned to run the length of 
Harvard St. You must make signs bigger: at least 10 square 
feet each, fully blocking one lane. This was implemented 
successfully in Oakland, CA.

I regularly bicycle on the bike path along the Charles River to 
get to Trader Joe's and Whole Foods for shopping. 
Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has made this ride 
difficult, as the path is very narrow and there is far less than 
6' of space to separate walkers, joggers and bicyclists from 
each other. At the same time, motor vehicle traffic is 
dramatically reduced now, so much of the motor travel lane 
space on Memorial Drive is not being used. The current 
conditions are a public health risk and should be addressed 
by opening up some of the lanes on Memorial Drive to 
walkers, joggers, and bicyclists. Similar road changes should 
be made on other roads in Cambridge to create an 
interconnected network of roads that bicyclists can use for 
essential trips.  

I am constantly moving into the street to provide 6 feet of 
space between myself and other pdestrians. I am also more 
reliant on traveling by bike now that I would prefer not to use 
the T. I REALLY would like more protected space.  

I think this would be a great idea since the weather is looking 
up and we’re all desperate to get outside. My only concern is 
for those who must street park. Perhaps, since many people 
are still working remotely, we might open the municipal lots 
for residents (such as on green street) the way we do when 
there’s a snow emergency?  

You can't social distance by six feet on a five foot wide 
sidewalk. Since I suffer from Asthma I choose to drive way 
more than I did before COVID. I would love to return to being 
a pedestrian/bicyclist if I had the space to stay safe while 
doing it.

I don't own a car so I primarily walk or bike to the store to pick 
up groceries. While walking to the store I find it extremely 
)
n
difficult to maintain proper distance from my neighbors on the 
o
n
sidewalk. Inevitably one person will step into the road or the 
n
a
bike lane in order to maintain a safe distance from the person 
h
S
 
on the sidewalk. If we "extend the sidewalks" we will just be 
e
n
making it safer to do what people are already doing (ie 
o
r
a
stepping into the roadway to avoid others) by giving people 
C
the space to distance without fear that they'll come into 
m
o
contact with a car or take a biker in the bike lane by surprise.

f
 
d
e
I am an essential worker and am walking or biking to work so

that I do not need to take the bus during this pandemic. It can

be hard to maintain the 6 foot distancing with so many people

When there are bike lanes and dedicated bus lanes I will 
always try to stay out of the car. I believe many will feel this 
way, and the dire congestion on city streets can be

i would feel more safe biking in the city if there were a 
network of streets that were closed to through traffic. so i 
would be able to bike more.  

I would be more comfortable biking my son on essential trips. 
His Doctor's office is in Cambridge and it is one of the few 
locations I will drive to because I don't feel it is safe to bike 
with him.  

We need more and safe outdoor spaces for foot and bike 
traffic!  
 

I don't use my bike to go anywhere in Cambridge, although I 
want to do so. I am too afraid to ride on the street, To get to 
any bike path from my house I would need to ride on the 
street, walk my bike to a bike path or put my bike in the car 
and drive over to the bike path. It would be so great if I were 
closer to a dedicated, separated, bike lane!  

My children could go to school more safely, we could get 
groceries and commute more easily. It would be life-
changing!  

It would be great to have more places to walk and bike safely 
with my kids. We're a bike-only family and these days spend 
all of our time in Somerville, Cambridge, and nearby towns 
that we can easily bike to -- but the few off-road bike paths 
around are just too crowded.  

I'd be able to safely walk around now with COVID19, and feel 
more safe in a more transition period away from COVID19.

Drivers are paying less attention than normal because of the 
decreased traffic. I have experienced several close calls 
walking around east Cambridge, despite using cross walks 
and other safe walking practices.  

My street people often seen maskless it is very worrisome 
need some way of enforcing need whenoutside, wear a 
mask. Vent if next door neighbor can be close and maskless. 
Very worrisome  

With reduced traffic, many of the remaining drivers are 
speeding, making sharp turns without looking, and otherwise 
endangering those on foot or bicycle. Please increase 
enforcement.

As a resident of the Cambridge/ Somerville area, I've felt very 
unsafe due to COVID-19, as would be expected. What 
)
n
increases this feeling of a lack of safety is having to walk into 
o
n
the street to avoid other people on the sidewalk. It doesn't 
n
a
make sense to keep prioritizing motor vehicles over basic 
h
S
 
safety during such a severe global crisis. Also, most residents 
e
n
of this area don't drive; the majority of us bike, walk, or take 
public transit. While I understand that some essential 
workers, such as delivery drivers, require roadways to drive 
on, many of our essential workers commute via bike or 
transit. And, any slight inconvenience in time or energy 
caused to a driver is justifiable when weighed against the 
larger health risk of the majority of people outside having to 
either pass each too closely on the sidewalk or walk into the 
street to avoid getting hit. It is unreasonable to expect people 
to choose between social distancing and being run over. We 
need to side with public safety.

As a Somerville resident, I am also impacted by decisions 
made in Cambridge. Please make our city streets safer for 
people, not cars - at a time when use of outside space is so 
necessary for physical and mental health. Thank you.  

 

I have a stroller often while I'm walking and can't easily just 
avoid other people in the path. I currently take my walks in 
North Pointe/Paul Revere Park instead as I don't feel 
comfortable socially distancing on Cambridge side walks - 
even getting there right now is hard with all of the 
construction going on with Lechmere station and Obrien hwy. 
I don't have a car and worry about the ability to socially 
distance to run errands once things reopen.

I try to ride my bike whenever possible, but my concern is 
mostly for others who need to get to work or essential 
appointments, etc. I am retired so for me it's about access to 
safe walking/biking for everyone.  

Cambridge is a very crowded city. we have had to drive to 
other towns to walk. i think it is a great idea to close some of 
the streets. It is a shame that Cambridge elects the city 
council but the unelected city manager makes the decisions.  

.

I bike commute from Cambridge to downtown Boston (when 
my workplace is open), and I take the Charles River Trail 
most of the way. It would make my commute much safer if 
there were bike lanes on the roads for a larger part of the 
ride. The bike trail is very crowded right now, especially 
around 5-7pm, and I would feel that I was failing to properly 
'socially distance' if I took the CRT on my evening commute, 
but I am at risk due to aggressive Boston drivers and the lack 
of bike lanes every time I take the road.

Walking through the city while maintaining safe distancing 
requires frequent dodging of other pedestrians, stepping out 
into the road to wait for folks to pass, and crossing the street. 
Pedestrians and cyclists need more space to be safe.

Comment  

Cambridge should follow the example of enlightened cities 
around the world and expand biking and walking 
opportunities in the wake of the pandemic. Many people are 
apprehensive about returning to mass transit in light of the 
pandemic and we need to provide alternatives to these 
people as well.  

I have been avoiding walking because of the unavoidable 
proximity to others. This would increase my walking, and 
therefore I would more likely spend money at Cambridge 
businesses instead of driving out of town as I currently do

We live on Inman St. with our twin 5 year olds, and don't own 
a car. As such, we walk or bike everywhere, and have 
definitely found it super stressful to be navigating our 
sidewalks and streets in this environment, especially with 
small children. It would be an immense relief to have the 
measures above implemented, and would help our family 
spend more time outside, at lower stress levels, with lower 
chance of transmission.

I often, and more recent, change lanes into the car lane to 
avoid runners/walkers in the bike lane. Extending sidewalks 
would certainly impact the number of runners/walkers putting 
themselves at risk in the roads and subsequently, putting 
cyclists at risk.

I often have to step into the street while walking around the 
neighborhood to maintain appropriate social distance, which 
feels unsafe. Expanding sidewalks and implementing slow 
streets would make a big difference!  

My family and I bike. We want to be able to access the whole 
city on our bikes but I don’t feel safe outside of a streets that 
have very nice bike paths (western ave being the main one). 
We ride the sidewalk very often and get off our bikes to let 
people pass. We need more attention to this area of safe 
biking/walking and keeping distance! Thank you  

I don't ride now in the city because it's too dangerous. Too 
many people have been killed or injured. With these changes 
many more people would ride bikes and that would alleviate 
the congestion.

I am ten years old and love to bike. When I go to other cities

In East Somerville, I'm able to walk because the streets are 
residential and uncrowded. My daily walks are critical for my 
mental and physical health right now. Cambridge has so 
many more business districts and main streets, which are 
much more crowded (not to mention the bike path!). I want 
the benefits of the outdoors to be accessible to my 
Cambridge neighbors!

I regularly bike to work along Memorial Drive - now with

but also to maintain social distancing, there is little space for 
cyclists and pedestrians to share and remain apart. All of this 
while there is a paucity of cars on infrastructure not being 
used.

Fewer cars along the river would allow more to enjoy this 
natural resource without risk of violating social distancing

I bike through Cambridge on my commute between Medford 
and Boston, having a safe connected cycling network would 
make my car free commute tremendously happier.

Frankly, I find it appalling that the most important bike route in 
v
i
e
Cambridge, Mass AV, has no bike lanes between about 
c
e
r
Ellery and Lee streets. Really? Seriously? Are you kidding 
 
me?  

 

I'm one of the thousands of Cambridge residents who does 
not own a car. I and others like me need to be able to go to 
the grocery store, pharmacy, etc. on foot while maintaining a 
safe distance from others. These changes would make that 
possible in areas where it currently isn't. Also, get rid of beg 
buttons. They're germy and stupid.  

Walking and biking are my main means of local transport, 
vastly safer and more pleasant in recent weeks without 
having to dodge multi-ton vehicles whizzing past inches 
away. This is not just a theoretical concern, as I was serious 
injured by a car while riding my bike 2 years ago and am still 
recovering. Post-Covid we should not simply return to our 
broken, car-centric model.  

I typically ride to work in Cambridge 5 days a week. 
Increasing space for bikes and pedestrians would make the 
ability to maintain social distance much easier and safer. I 
urge you to consider implementing these changes!  

My kids and I need safe ways to get around and enjoy being 
outside, especially this summer without summer camps or 
public pools  

I commute on a bike everywhere and am in constant conflict 
with automobiles despite my regular observance of - and 
compliance with - the law.

We have no outdoor space where we live and walking has 
been extremely stressful around our neighborhood because 
of crowds (Fresh Pond is impossible) and small sidewalks. 
This would be extremely helpful for our physical and mental

It would enable me to move around the city with a greater 
sense of security. I do not own a car. Cars now are travelling 
extremely fast. This has been well documented throughout 
the country. Even traditionally less progressive cities have 
closed their streets. Cambridge is a huge disappointment.  

We must help those who ride bicycles, which offers a great 
boon to all of us in terms of air quality and city safety, to have 
the kinds of space and buffers needed for our personal 
safety.  

I used to travel by bicycle and public transit. Now I travel 
entirely by bicycle. These changes would help keep me safe 
and feel comfortable getting around the Cambridge and 
beyond.

sidewalks are too small, and a lot of people walk around 
there.  

I commute through Cambridge daily on my bike: We need 
wider lanes, more of them, and greater visibility! This need is 
amplified through social distancing, more folks walking, and 
as work places open up, a greater need for safe alternatives 
to public transport. Safe bike routes - paths, width, visibility -

are critical so that people feel safe biking and walking and our

People need to be able to move around safely! Pedestrians 
are dodging each other on narrow sidewalks of Mass Ave 
while the streets are wide and have much less traffic. We 
need to widen the sidewalk space, especially since now 
sidewalks are being used as takeout. Roads need to be 
closed to cars (Memorial Drive) â€” even just reducing a lane 
would help! As a cyclist I have noticed fewer cars on the 
roads, but they are going much faster and driving more 
recklessly than usual. It’s really dangerous for the 
pedestrians, cyclists and anyone without a car who needs or 
wants to move around the city.

I commute primarily by bicycle and have had too many close 
calls with calls to count. A number of my Cambridge-based 
coworkers are worried about biking due to traffic. Safer 
streets would be a huge improvement to my life and allow 
others to enjoy active transportation.  

It is very hard to socially distance while running on a 6 foot

I have found that the sidewalks in east Cambridge are not 
wide enough to allow for safe social distancing given the 
number of people walking.  

in the street to avoid these people, but I really don’t want to 
get hit by cars. I was so hoping that all of Memorial Drive

would be closed, but closing 2 lanes (with barriers) would be 
o
n
better than nothing. But closing small streets all around

Cambridge would be even better as getting out while

maintaining physical distancing is so important to our physical

My family could walk together to the grocery store and bike 
together more safely to the open fields like Danehy and 
Sennott without fear of speeding cars and encroaching 
joggers or Walker's on narrow sidewalks. My son will have 
somewhere to ride his bike again safely.

I have no car and need to walk safely to my destination! 
These changes are desperately needed and would make 
Cambridge much safer for pedestrians.  

It would allow more space for me to walk safely with my 
family (including a 2 year old) and still socially distance. As 
the weather gets nicer, more people will be taking walks, 
runs, and bike rides, and this will allow for better social 
distancing while we still get to enjoy parts of the city.  

This would both make it safer: (a) during the covid pandemic 
to minimize the spread of the dises (b) after covid for the 
purpose of minimizing risk of bike-on-car collision (c) after 
covid for the purpose of minimizing continued germ spread 
after the current pandemic has settled.

empty. I regularly go into the street to pass other pedestrians 
safely on mid-Cambridge's very narrow sidewalks. These 
measures would make it easier for me to shop and exercise 
safely, and I believe they may save lives and injuries while 
also making Cambridge more livable in the long term.  
 

These changes would not impact me directly at this point 
because I am working remotely but even prior to COVID-19 I 
felt I was forced into traffic all too often while commuting to 
and from work and have seen it with others innumerable 
times.  
 

I used to commute through Cambridge on a daily basis and 
would’ve felt much more comfortable with protected bike

I currently have no car and I rely on Bluebikes to get around 
and would feel 100% safer with better bikelanes and safety 
measurements to ensure the health of all of Cambridge 
residents. This is specially worrying as I plan on using the 
bikes once I go back to work.  

I travel into Cambridge all the time and this will make my life 
so much better. Slower traffic to no motor vehicle traffic 
around Cambridge would take so much stress out of my life. 
By doing this now, we can improve upon it as we move out of 
this pandemic.

I am in Cambridge frequently to grocery-shop and to get to 
my mother's place in Somerville: she is in her 80s and still 
recovering from a fall she had in October. I would very much 
like to be able to bike on the more picturesque route on the 
bike path next to Memorial Drive but am amazed that while it 
has been too crowded to social distance for nearly two 
months at this point, the (empty!) roads next to paths haven't 
been opened up for bike and pedestrian use only which 
would instantly solve this problem. Please do this!  

I ride my bike daily in Cambridge so this would increase my 
safety and the safety of other cyclists and pedestrians  

I would also like the city to enforce truck restrictions on roads 
like Cardinal Madeiros Ave which have truck-restriction signs 
that are completely ignored by trucks. There are a lot of 
families in the Wellington-Harrington neighborhood and the 
cut-through truck traffic is both a safety hazard and noise

My teenage kids and I would prefer to bike to and from work 
and school, to the parks and down to the river paths and 
parklands but streets don’t feel safe for bikers. Lane 
separation is critical. Some streets have lanes but they dead 
end suddenly. Separation barriers are badly needed. 
Cambridge has potential to be a MODEL US city like Holland 
and Denmark. Let’s be visionary! We could save gas 
emissions, improve health, and give our teens the autonomy 
to get around safely. We could also improve social distancing 
and not have to take the subway. I wouldn’t have to hire a 
sitter to schlep them to and from soccer practice because 
they could bike but not when paths aren’t safe.

With parks closed and two small kids, access to more outdoor

space where I don’t have to worry as much about vehicular 
O
C
traffic would be a game changer. Even after parks reopen, as 
someone who commutes and takes my children to school by 
foot and bike, i would feel much safer with some â€œbicycle 
boulevardsâ€(cid:0) similar to what Berkeley, CA has- streets 
closed to cars unless you live there (with speed breaks to 
enforce it). And the long term environmental impact means 
that Cambridge can continue to be a home for my kids!

Having three elementary aged kids, outdoor activity is critical.

We've taken to biking in the streets as the sidewalk is not 
C
safe or practical. Having my 5, 7, and 9 year old share the 
road with cars makes not just me, but the car drivers as well, 
very nervous. Despite living .2 miles from Memorial Drive we 
can't use it because of the narrow, crowded sidewalks. 
Certainly more people have been getting out for walks, runs, 
and bike rides than cars have been driving, it seems! 

It would help me and my family to bike and walk safety.

It is hard or impossible to safely pass people on the narrow 
often congested paths along the Charles River while roads 
right next to them are nearly empty. I go that way, and others 
with similar issues, walking or by bicycle to shop for food, it 
would be very helpful if some of this barely used road space 
were made available.

If it were safer to bike around the city not only would I let my

how about creating "10-minute parking only" spaces in both

I am a resident on Harvard St. and I am overjoyed with the 
planned Slow Street that will run the length of my street. 
Please implement this as soon as possible. I would also like 
to encourage the use of a lane-wide sign that denotes 
 
â€œlocal access onlyâ€(cid:0), which would be larger than the 
:
t

It is impossible to ride my bicycle from my home in Arlington 
to my workplace in Cambridge or grocery store in Somerville 
without negotiating dangerous intersections, roads that are 
used by tractor trailers, potholes, and other hazards. I should 
be able to ride my bicycle with the same level of safety as I 
could walk or drive my car.

These are important steps to remain vigilant and minimize 
risks, especially as we get closer to summer and the 
pandemic is not yet under control.  

These changes would allow me to bike rather than drive to 
work in Watertown, and would make exercising in the city 
easier (both running and biking). When driving, I worry a lot 
about not seeing a biker coming from behind in a lane-less 
area. Having dedicated, safe lanes all over the city would 
help a lot.

Currently I see more walkers than drivers. Walkers need to 
keep their distance from each other in a way that drivers do 
not. It seems appropriate to reallocate the paved areas of our 
city to conform with the amount of use and the health needs 
of the users.  

I have been having to leave the city to get outside for my 
workouts.  

They will make exercising, traveling, and running errands a 
great deal safer.

It is wonderful to see so many people out walking and I would 
m
h
like this to be part of the new normal. Right now the walkers 
c

Making sidewalks wider with barriers and a separate bike 
lane would be a wonderful option!

As a frequent runner, I am so lucky to be able to have access 
O
C
to the Charles’s River but so do thousands of other people. 
Outdoors is the only place right now for us to escape our 
homes. There are sections of the River way that can’t 
accommodate social distancing forcing people to either jump 
to the busy streets or come in closer contact with each other. 
Not everyone wears a mask. I’d feel much safer with wider 
sidewalks and traffic restricted lanes. I dont know who’s out 
there who I can infect and vice versa. Car traffic is down 
anyway so we need to be agile and adapt for what the city 
needs now.

I live in Cambridgeport along Pleasant St near Alberico Park / 
r
a
C
Allston St. While auto volumes have decreased significantly 
m
at the intersection outside my third-floor window, pedestrian 
o
r
f
volumes have undoubtedly increased. I can attest that both 
 
d
e
Pleasant and Allston, two streets identified within the Bike 
v
i
e
Plan as Neighborway-esque facilities, act as conduits for 
c
e
r
Cambridgeport/Mid-Cambridge grocery shoppers living to the 
 
s
a
north, south, or west of the Whole Foods on River St and 
w
n
Trader Joe's near Memorial Drive (plaza between Pleasant 
o
i
t
and Magazine). Closing low-hanging fruit streets, such as 
a
c
those identified in the bike plan as slow speed streets or other 
n
u
m
neighborhood thoroughfares that connect to commercial 
m
centers, would help reduce potential exposure for me, my six 
o
c
year old daughter, and, most importantly, my immuno-
A
compromised wife. As a transportation planner I am gravely 
disappointed at the City's inaction on this front. Without 
repurposing at least a portion of the automobile sewer for 
people walking and biking, our urban form/built environment 
simply does not guarantee the space required for social 
distancing. As a result, vulnerable users are inevitably faced 
with a dilemma of accepting a known risk (passing a fellow 
6
user while staying within the sidewalk or trail) or taking a 
n
o
gamble on the unknown (departing from the facility and 
i
t
i
t
e
potentially colliding with another user/vehicle). Neither of 
p
_
these should be an option in the COVID-19 world where 
n
o
n
congestion is non-existent and volumes have plummeted by 
n
a
over 90%. I would love for commercial parking areas, 
h
S
beginning with those that already act as emergency tow/snow 
 
e
n
clearance zones, to be steadily repurposed into overflow 
parking for residents. This would enable the current on-street 
 
spaces to be converted into more productive uses, like bike 
:
t
n
parking, parklets, green infrastructure, etc. Providing some 
e
m
form of parking relief should help provide the City with cover 
h
c
a
when naysayers begin to push back. Thanks for doing all that 
t
t
A
you do!

Finding places to safely move around our city has always 
been challenging with small children. There are many street 
crossings that are dangerous and as my 4 year old has taken 
to riding his bike there just aren't great options. He can ride 
on the sidewalk but that isn't great for me as I am riding a 
larger bike. In the few places where we have bike paths or 
protected lanes he can ride with me. With the lower traffic 
o
r
a
volumes, we have been riding on the street in neighborhood 
C
streets. The cars parked are still an issue as he isn't ready to 
m
o
avoid the door zone, wear a mask, socially distance when 
r
f
 
d
others are on the street etc. This is our chance to pilot the 
e
v
i
whole big connected bike network we all want for our city. We 
e
c
e
have fewer people driving and that will either continue with 
r
 
s
the slow ramp up or openings or it will get to a really bad 
a
w
place if more people decide that it isn't safe to travel any way 
n
o
other than in a private car. If we can reallocate the space to 
i
t
a
c
people walking and biking and give them enough space to 
n
u
safely socially distance, we can make it attractive to bike and 
m
m
walk and unattractive to drive. This is the future we want. Lets 
o
c
take this as a chance to move on it quickly.

I live on a very narrow intimate private right-of-way footpath. 
We are now getting flooded with people walking on our path. 
People none of us know. I have seen strange men staring at 
the young kids playing in the yard across from me. I have 
been verbally assaulted twice when asking passers to please 
be sure to wear a mask (the path is only 8' wide at it widest) 
and someone decided to snap off a lilac branch, probably 
thinking it was constricting traffic too much. People physically 
push past me if I'm not going fast enough for them if I'm 
carrying heavy things or dragging my barrels to the curb. 
 
Little children without masks climb on the low fence, their

I bike between North Station and Kendall square to get to

Cars have had so much privilege for so long. It is past time 
for a change.  

The sidewalks are overcrowded with walkers, joggers and 
bikers on top of each other, while low volume traffic speeds 
by on nearly empty streets - this makes no sense! Forget 
being a leader, why isn’t Cambridge at least following the 
lead of other cities like Seattle, New York and Oakland?

I live in Cambridge without a car. In order to be able to go

walk. With the high density population in Cambridge it is very

I would like to be able to bike through the city safely and 
away from car traffic.  

I'm already finding it difficult to walk in Cambridge since the 
spring weather began, both on errands and for my health 
(with degenerative polyarthritis I must walk daily to stay 
 
:
t
mobile). Lots of people need to walk for their health, but many

parks are closed and now the golf course, even after 6pm 
h

when golfing stops. Meanwhile people walking in pairs or

into the street to avoid them (many younger people wear their

This would be very helpful for us since we don't have a car. It 
would make social distancing on the sidewalks easier too.  

finishing the Fresh Pond bike path to Watertown would be a 
welcome start.  

I like to walk in Cambridgeport and Riverside and along the 
Memorial Drive path . Sadly, the Mem Drive the path is too 
narrow to accommodate an increasing number of speeding 
bikes. We seniors need safer spaces to walk  

I bike or walk to work in Cambridge, and these changes 
would make it safer for me to do so!

I would like to walk along the river, but particularly where the 
BU Bridge circle is, there are very narrow sidewalks. Also, I 
do not understand the decision to suspend the Sunday 
shutdown of Memorial Drive - it is the one, safe way many 
people can get out and remain safely distant while they 
exercise. I would also like the opportunity to sit outside a 
 
restaurant safely spaced with friends, providing those

We should be encouraging social distancing and a car-free 
lifestyle. If we had more space outside, we’d be able to 
spread out and travel by foot and bike more safely. Not to 
mention, I’d feel much more comfortable patronizing dining 
establishments if they were able to have expanded outdoor 
space. This is both a public health and a sustainability issue.  

i

 

 

 

I don't have a car, so these modes of transportation are my 
only ways of getting around. With reduced traffic, I have 
noticed drivers taking more risks, rolling stop signs, etc. It is 
important to change our streets to enforce safety (slow down 
car traffic.)  

Fewer cars results in greater safety for pedestrians and 
cyclists of all ages.  

I live and work in Cambridge. I would start cycling to work 
again rather than driving and parking on the street, as I have 
done for the past two years. I stopped cycling out of fear.

I travel around Cambridge for shopping and also in order to 
safely exercise (bike, walk, run), although I have avoided 
most of these exercise activities due to the challenges of 
social distancing while engaging in them. A better system for 
safe walking and biking in my surrounding neighborhoods 
would be very beneficial for me, as well as making the 
community safer in general.  

I might be more likely to go out riding or just out for walks - 
right now I don't like the crowded paths and cars are taking 
"advantage" of quiet streets and driving faster and with less 
car than usual.  

Safe walking routes throughout the city that support social 
distancing is important to my family to promote a healthful 
 
lifestyle. Cycling routes should be separated from pedestrian 
:
t
n
e
routes because 6ft separation between cyclists and 
m
h
pedestrians is not enough based on Dutch studies of airflow 
c
a
around cyclists and runners. Pedestrian only routes should be 
t
t
A
prioritized because they can serve more people including at 
risk populations like seniors.

I run or bike 6 days a week. Wearing a mask is a significant 
hindrance to the intensity I am able to exercise at so I have 
been trying to be incredibly diligent in finding remote areas 
within the city to continue my exercise regimen. This has 
been nearly impossible, causing me to often run in bikes 
o
r
a
lanes, if not in the roadway, for the majority of my runs. I work 
C
m
at Boston Children's Hospital doing obesity prevention work, 
o
r
and I am so heartened to see how people are taking 
f
 
d
e
advantage of this challenging time to get outside and 
v
i
e
increase their exercise. That being said, we need to ensure 
c
e
we are able to provide safe spaces for this, and hopefully, we 
r
 
can continue to encourage even more people to use this time 
to increase their physical activity.

I commute to Cambridge exclusively via bicycle and would 
love to love to an old age! Thanks!  

When it reopens, I'll be walking or biking to my job in 
Cambridge. I'd like to know it's safe to do so.  

My partner and I both have offices in Cambridge, and our 
child’s preschool is there as well. Being able to safely travel 
by bicycle is essential to us. Thank you for prioritizing safety 
for our family.

Cambridge. I don’t understand why you didn’t open Memorial 
Drive as normal. The least harmful thing you could have 
done. There are fewer and fewer cars on the streets and 
more and more people and bicycles and many more children 
with no school, day care and who knows about summer 
camp. It just makes sense to close some streets to cars. Our 
restaurant business is suffering and this could be an 
opportunity for spacious outdoor dining.  

My bicycle commute would be safer and more pleasant. My 
wife might accompany me more often; right now she drives 
because she finds it unsafe and unpleasant on a bicycle, 
even though we travel to very nearly the same place.  

I would feel a lot better as a pedestrian and a driver knowing 
that Cambridge is a safer place for pedestrians.  

Safer walking is essential for me, I get extremely tired of 
dodging cars due to lack of restrictions on car speed or 
inadequate cross walks. Also, when I drive I prefer the safety 
of well-designed bike lanes on the roads I am driving on to 
prevent accidents.  

If these changes were implemented, I would not feel so 
constrained (as an older adult) about using the riverfront for 
walking and biking, and I would also feel much better about 
patronizing local restaurants for takeout if the sidewalk 
spaces were made broader, at least temporarily. One of the 
"unknowns" about the opening up strategy for Boston and 
Cambridge is how citizens are going to react. We need to try 
new solutions to make the next months (or longer) work for 
Cambridge residents and businesses.

We're finding it hard to go out and about with kids: more 
public space would make it easier to social distance, keeping 
us and others safe!  

I would feel safer walking and social distancing, and would 
also feel safer cycling - something I don't do now because of 
the crowed streets.  

I think we would all feel safer when we have to walk outside, 
whether to run essential errands or for necessary exercise. 
Thank you!  

I walk my dog 2ce a day - this would give me safer streets 
with cleaner air to walk and stay at least 6 feet away - 
physical distancing - without difficulty. I also enjoy riding my 
bike in Cambridge and would take streets that are less likely 
to have traffic - again for safety and clean air.  

I don't drive, I get around by bike and walking and 
occasionally the MBTA (but not in the last two months). 
Protected bike lanes are a joy, the more the merrier, and the 
safer.

I work in Cambridge and I believe the city should take these 
actions which benefit everyone. People driving cars are not 
our community's highest priority.  

I'd be able to more easily access bicycle routes between 
Somerville and Cambridge for work and recreation. I'd spend 
more time outside shopping at local small businesses and 
being in community without feeling the danger/stress of 
contracting COVID-19.  

My spouse and I work in Cambridge, one of us bikes to work 
most days. The bike traffic has significantly increased, which 
is great! We need more space devoted to walking and biking 
for the health of our community.  

If more people have more space to social distance, more 
s
a
w
people will stay healthy. And if more people stay healthy, 
n
more people are likely to feel safer working with providers like 
o
i
t
a
me that offer personal one-on-one in-person services. And 
c
n
my business can return to brining in the amount of revenue it 
u
m
did before the pandemic hit us. Right now it remains to be 
m
o
see how people will react to this slow opening.

I'm in my 60s, immunocompromised, with arthritis and 
resulting bad balance, but I have to walk to maintain my 
limited mobility and to get to curbside pickups at stores. 
Younger people and especially panting joggers without 
masks continually force me over curbs into the street, into 
traffic or not, to stay 6+ feet away from them (in 2 months 
only one jogger has shown the courtesy to take to the street 
instead of making me dodge him!). Sometimes I have to 
move quickly, risky with bad balance--especially as people 
drive faster lately, even on side streets. Mass Ave is 
impossible. At this point I can only walk safely after dark, 
which brings its own risks, especially to someone with bad 
balance. This will be our situation for a few years. Widened 
sidewalks, more bike lanes, above all a safe MBTA would 
change everything. Now, I'm a prisoner. As a taxpayer and 
citizen, I'd like to feel equal.

Cambridge is missing an opportunity to re-shape our streets 
to promote health and safety during a time of reduced 
automobile traffic. I would like to bike and walk more with my

1. We have a dog who needs to go outside 6-7 times a day. 
We used to take him to the dog park a few times a week but 
now that they are closed we have to get him adequate 
b

exercise by walking him just on the sidewalks. This means we 
6
n
are encountering more people, more frequently, and in closer 
o
i
t
proximity, because we are spending more time on the narrow 
i
t
e
p
sidewalks in Cambridge. We often have to step into the street 
_
n
to avoid other pedestrians, putting ourselves at risk. If the 
o
n
n
sidewalks were widened we would not be forced to step into 
a

traffic every time we encountered someone else on the

sidewalk. 2. Our only modes of transportation are by bike and

incorrect. Drivers are speeding and paying even less

when at least the volume of traffic served to limit the speed of

individual vehicles, we conduct more errands by foot than we 
would otherwise. As I already pointed out, this means we're

I bicycle to work, and also shopping, and have done so for 
nearly 25 years. I laud the improvements Cambridge has 
made for cyclists. However, bike lanes are routinely used for 
delivery parking (delivery trucks should hold up car traffic 
before taking to the bike lane, as is the case in European 
cities), and where bikes and pedestrians share space, there 
is often too little room for safe transit. I was also amazed that 
o
r
a
the Sunday car-free memorial drive was cancelled because of 
C
Covid. This causes more crowding, not less. Memorial Drive 
m
o
would be better off as a pedestrian zone 7 days a week than 
r
f
 
d
cutting the one good day.

As the weather gets better, more people will be coming 
outside. Let's prioritize people's health by giving more space 
)
n
to people. Why should cars get so much street, especially 
o
n
now when tehre is so little traffic? We also know that being 
n
a
outside and exercising is good for our health and that 
h
S
 
pollution from cars is bad for our health--not to mention that to 
e
n
transition to carbon neutrality for the whole planet's health, 
we need to move away from a car culture. This is a perfect 
time to take cars off many Cambridge streets, the way so 
many other cities are doing, so we can be outside and 
continue to keep a safe distance.  

i
l

 

I focus on items 1 and 3, something our City Manager could 
do. 1. Making walking easier on a few selected streets all 
over the city will mean everyone can go for walks and keep 
distance without having to step into the street and risk falling 
(age 78) or getting hit by a vehicle. 3. Closing some lanes on 
Memorial Drive every day would mean no worry about great 
masses of walkers on single Sundays, no need for big police 
presence.  

safer ways to social distance while being outside.

I have kids who ride bikes on the sidewalks/streets and we

Opening some streets as pedestrian-only will allow us to take 
longer, safer walks without CONSTANTLY running into 
maskless morons.

I love riding my bicycle no matter what and I love seeing more 
people ride their bicycle. There is always some good that 
comes out of a bad situation and after all of this Coronavrius

will be better off from an environmental perspective and from 
a human health perspective. Bike on!

It would be safer and would encourage Me to get takeout 
from locally owned restaurants more often  

 

Not a resident, but very frequent visitor to libraries, doctors, 
shops, and restaurants in Cambridge. This is essential 
infrastructure.  

City families have inadequate public space to exercise, and 
this is causing a decline in activity that in turn affects physical 
and mental health.  

These would allow comfortable and trustworthy methods of 
moving through dense city life for all residents. This is 
necessary given the current pandemic challenges. It is 
imperative you listen to your citizens, and care for all your 
citizens.

As someone who cycles 10,000-12,000 miles per year, these 
changes would provide peace of mind that the city is taking 
seriously the mandate to serve and protect (and regulate) not 
just cyclists, but pedestrians and motor vehicle drivers too. 
Cambridge has far too many vehicles moving on narrow 
streets at speeds that exceed the posted city limit. (Oh that 
the local police would spend X hours every day monitoring 
A
streets throughout the city and ticketing those who are driving 
recklessly - which, of course, speeding is.)

I would spend much more time in Cambridge and traveling 
though Cambridge if this is implemented. I am dependent on 
biking through Cambridge as long as the T is unsafe. My son 
goes to school in Cambridge and will need to bike. My 
brother-in-law was killed on his bike in Cambridge.  

Thank you! I love Cambridge and these measures would 
make the city even better! More residents are seeking 
alternative transportation over time and the numbers who 
want to bike, walk or take public transportation are growing 
fast. It's a win-win for all. We just have to ramp up the 
infrastructure.  
 

This would vastly improve the walking and cycling conditions 
s
a
w
of the city, making things safer as we need to socially 
n
distance and also better for cyclists and pedestrians in 
o
i
t
a
general. It will also help offset potential traffic increases in the 
c
n
short term as people avoid the T.

I would walk and bike much more. I am only a casual biker 
now, but could make it my main form of transportation.

Right now, there's limited space to avoid people outside so I

enough to accommodate social distancing. If I were able to

staying inside has been important for my health and safety, 
exercise and movement is important too.

I walk and bike with my kids around the neighborhood. So, 
dedicating as much space as possible to walking and biking 
would improve our situation a lot. Also, re the green line 
extension, making the Union Sq stop directly accessible from 
Cambridge (or, even better, adding a stop at/near Medford St 
bridge/Target) would make the T much better accessible in 
our neighborhood.  

I bike from Medford to my work in Cambridge. I often feel 
unsafe biking and would really appreciate safer streets and 
more awareness around bike safety.  

I commute to MIT by bike almost every day from the Porter 
Square area to reach Kendall Square, and frequently feel I 
am in danger because bike lanes are not protected

My family and I have been walking much more since the 
lockdown began. Living near both Mass Ave and Alewife 
Brook Parkway, our options are fairly limited, and walking 
with an 18 month old means it’s impossible for her to wear a 
mask. It’s frustrating to see both of these enormously wide

It would make me feel much more safe traveling to/from 
essential activities! It would improve my mental health by 
allowing me to safely get outdoor exercise! It would restore 
my faith that the government of Cambridge is committed to

committing to.

I would feel safer while going on a run. As of right now in 
order to distance from people I have to run in the street, 
which is not safe when the streets are open and cars are 
running by. I would also be able to go on a walk and enjoy it, 
whereas right now I am always thinking about keeping a 
distance from people, and how to pass a slower walker 
safely, etc.  

Some of these goals are easier to implement than others, but 
I think they are all reasonable goals during this difficult time. 
And since we don't know if things will ever really return to

By giving people space to ride their bikes, walk, jog etc it 
would positively impact my place of employment, a 30yr old 
bicycle coop in Cambridge that relies upon the spring rush of 
commuters and college & high school students. With the 
workforce and students sent home it has drastically impacted 
the workflow at my bike shop. Let’s positively impact local 
businesses by supporting the widening of sidewalks and 
streets to pedestrians and bicyclists.

These and other measures are urgently needed to reverse 
the dangerous behavior of drivers who are driving faster and 
appear to be more likely now to ignore signs and signals. 
Please help us to return our streets for the safe use of 
pedestrians and cyclists.  

These changes would improve our employees' access to our 
business as we slowly resume operations at this critical time. 
Many of our employees do not use personal vehicles and live 
in the Cambridge area where they like to enjoy the open air 
and increased safe distance from other individuals, business 
patrons and vehicles.

connects parks, grocery stores, is a â€œsafe routeâ€(cid:0) to

sidewalks are narrow and uneven. Please reverse direction 
for traffic on some alternating blocks, use diverters, etc so

I ride my bicycle to work during the summer months to 300 
Tech Square and this would help facilitate a safe bicycle ride  

protection to get around Cambridge without fear and constant 
danger. This is an clear opportunity to address road safety, 
social distancing, fossil fuel addiction, air pollution and 
personal health requirements for regular exercise. I am 74 yo 
and do not own a car and get around by foot & bike, I heartily 
endorse this petition!!  

These measures would make my required daily walks much 
safer. They also would reclaim a lot of the waisted space to 
parking and roads, for use by residents who travel more 
locally and spend more in the city, from residents who travel 
more outside the city, and spend outside the city.  

My bicycle commute from Davis Square to MIT travels 
through the heart of Cambridge and would be made safer by 
this initiative. Thank you!

creating a city that prioritizes healthy transport instead of

Friends and neighbors with any limited mobility, those more 
vulnerable to COVID19, and children will be more easily able 
to get to their essential needs or to be able to move about as 
well as service providers such as the postal service. 
Blockages in the sidewalk are common and giving distance 
by entering the street is not always safe.  

As an essential worker who bicycles or walks most places, 
having safer, more bike friendly streets would make my 
commute less stressful, easier, and more efficient.

My main activity includes walking and running locally and I've

find it impossible or dangerous to maintain proper social 
distance. Often I or fellow walkers will have to either walk into

order to manage to adhere to the rules. If we, as citizens,

Cycling and walking are the original mass transit. In the era of

Moving around our city now requires us to walk in the street. 
We need this access protected.  

I work in Cambridge and I know how critical it will be to give 
people safe alternatives to taking transit for people who don’t 
own cars. Following through on bike and pedestrian 
infrastructure and making it safer for all is necessary in this 
new world we all face.

With the shift away from mass transit we need to make the

I am observing many more people biking and walking in our 
neighborhood of East Cambridge. Even with less traffic, 
6
corners and intersections still pose a hazard to people who 
n
o
are walking in the street. Having a "slow streets" initiative 
i
t
i
t
e
would help slow down cards who do have to access our 
p
_
neighborhood streets, and remind them that they should 
n
o
n
expect more pedestrians in the street. In addition, widening 
n
a
existing linear park areas to give people more room to spread 
h
S
 
out seems to be the best way to allow outdoor access while 
e
n
maintaining social distance. Due to the decreased traffic, we 
o
r
have been using our bicycles more to go to the local grocery 
a
C
 
store. I would normally not have tried to bike in Cambridge as 
:
t
n
e
it has been so unsafe. Increasing bicycle safety, dedicated 
m
h
bike lanes and pedestrianized routes must continue if we are 
c
a
to keep both health issues and environmental goals in mind.

Streets with less cars have caused to those still driving to 
move even faster adding to the danger for bikers and 
pedestrians.

I bike to Cambridge almost every day for exercise at the 
Charles River and to shop at Trader Joe's. Memorial Drive 
has become a terrifying part of the journey and obviously the 
very very narrow pedestrian path would be inappropriate to 
use. There needs to be pushback immediately - we can't just 
let speeds on that road to keep climbing without providing a 
safe alternative for the rest of us not using cars and trucks.

I would fear for my life less while trying to commute around

This will improve the ability of my family to be safe while 
being in public.

Using a bicycle as our primary mode of transportation would 
be much safer- especially for children- and closing off streets 
would dramatically improve the ability to socially distance

I work in Cambridge and often bike to work from North

Of the few cars on the street, they often are driven at high 
speeds. I just want a wide street to walk everyday while I 
enjoy the single outdoor hour of my day. And if it were by the 
river, I could actually enjoy it, unlike the motorists speeding 
down Memorial Drive at speeds that require 100% focus on 
the road.

social distancing has become necessary, we no longer take 
this route because of the narrowness of the sidewalk along

I work in the building industry and I am involved with a project

in Cambridge that is currently paused. Normally the T is my

main mode of transportation to the job site, but I am seriously 
v
i
e
considering biking once things open up again. Memorial drive 
c
e
would be my main route, however it is currently unsafe and 
r
 
far too narrow even when there are few people using it. 
Providing space on memorial drive, even if it is just one lane, 
would make my commute a lot safer and more feasible.

as soon as one person is walking in the opposite direction,

there's not enough room to pass safely.  

I'd like to see completely closed streets, especially Memorial

As a runner, I would love to see widened sidewalks and slow 
M
O
streets so that I can stay safe and respect pedestrians around 
C
me. Efforts to avoid high-trafficked areas has led me to 
smaller streets where encounters between pedestrians and 
drivers on windy, cobbled sidewalks and tight roads can be 
challenging and tense, creating stress and frustration for all 
involved. As the weather warms and summer arrives, let's 
create streets that allow all of us to get outside for fresh air 
without creating increased social distance concerns

the street where there are few cars but being scared when 
one of those few cars comes by. I believe right now we 
should reduce 2 lanes to 1 and declare many roads car free. 
There are few enough cars this will not make a meaningful

Protected city streets are invaluable to personal safety and

we need a place to safely exercise outside!  

I commute daily to work by bike in Cambridge and have had 
to adjust my commute to avoid the over-crowded and narrow 
multi-use strip of broken asphalt and dirt that has been 
neglected by DCR along the Charles River. Protected bike

We only get around by bike and with runners and walkers 
moving into the bike lanes it's getting dangerous for bikes 
with more cars on the roads.  

i
l

Please open Memorial Drive for socially-distanced excercise 
and for essential employees; I ride from Somerville to 
Waltham to sort mail in my office at Brandeis University and 
use Mem Drive Path as the safest off-road option to connect 
o
r
a
to Greenough Blvd/Watertown. I choose to ride because it is 
C
m
safer than taking public transit. But the Path is not safe for 
o
r
social distancing-- it is only 5ft wide in many places which 
f
 
d
e
makes that impossible to do. Meanwhile I see people 
v
i
e
deciding to take the lane on Mem Drive due to path crowding, 
c
e
and that is extremely unsafe as drivers are speeding more 
r
 
than usual on a road that already sees high traffic speeds. 
There is less than half of the normal car traffic, and Mem 
Drive should be open to commuters/walkers/bikers 7 days a 
week while we see a transportation mode shift during the 
pandemic. Please, keep people safe by providing four-travel 
lanes of space in the name of public health.  

i

 

 

I support encouraging walking/running/biking in a way that 
allows social distancing, especially at a time of dramatically 
decreased vehicle traffic.  
 

I live just across the river from Cambridge and will be 
spending my summer here - would love to be able to walk 
and bike more with my kids, including on Memorial drive and 
Mass. Ave.  
 

These measures would hopefully help increase bicycle use, 
and reduce auto traffic with its associated pollution and 
noise.

I'm deeply distressed that Cambridge has responded to the 
covid-crisis by closing down streets that are usually open to 
bikes and pedestrians (Mem drive) rather than by opening 
more of them up. Meanwhile, many drivers are responding to 
the lower traffic conditions by driving faster, causing a RISE 
in fatalities. Many other cities (Denver, New York) have seen 
the wisdom of closing more streets, opening spaces to allow 
people to walk and bike without coming too close to one 
another. Yet somehow Cambridge has failed to be in the 
vanguard.  

I would feel safe to leave my house to go to work once they 
let our office spaces open. Otherwise I am relying on busy 
sidewalks and buses, when I would feel safest riding my bike 
in a safe bike and pedestrian designated street. I have had 
multiple vehicles almost run into me although I respect the 
rules of the road. This would allow me to live and work safely 
in my community.

I would feel safer biking around Cambridge if I could do so 
while socially distancing from other bikers.  

As someone with out a car, it would make it safer for me to 
travel to work as well as exercise and grocery shop- having 
enough space to safely walk and bike throughout the city, 
without having to step into trafficed-streets to avoid being 
near other pedestrians, etc.

I cannot safely walk down the narrow streets of Cambridge 
without reaching an unsafe distance from other pedestrians. 
When I need to enter the street to maintain a safe distance 
from others, I have experienced many occasions of drivers 
wildly exceeding the 20mph speed limit, and putting me and 
others in danger due to reckless violation of traffic laws. The 
city can effectively address these safety and public health 
problems by allocating more street space for pedestrians and 
cyclists, and down-prioritize car storage and car volumes.

Currently Cambridge is something of an embarrassment. 
e
c
e
Despite claiming to be a progressive City, it lags behind many 
r
 
s
in innovating in response to Covid-19, choosing â€”Â it 
a
w
seems â€” to be reactive rater than proactive. Many cities 
n
o
around the world, including in the US, have made the 
i
t
a
c
decision to close off 10s or 100s of miles streets (some 
n
u
permanently!) and convert them to bike and pedestrian areas, 
m
m
or allow local business to expand out into them. There's no 
o
c
excuse for not doing that here.

It would be awfully nice to be able to maintain social 
distancing when passing others on the sidewalk without 
having to step into a car lane.

I walk and jog with my dog; I use my bike for exercise; I have 
noticed that there needs to be more space on the trails along 
Memorial Dr in order to social distance from others.  

I would be MUCH more likely to shop or pickup curbside 
things from businesses in Cambridge if the sidewalks and 
bikeways were widened and expanded.  

I bike to the grocery store, and also use the path by the river 
to jog for exercise twice a week. I am also starting an 
internship with a solar electric company (essential business!) 
and will need to be able to bike there. We desperately need 
more space both for the paths along mem drive and increase 
the number of bike lanes throughout the city!

As a Harvard street resident I highly support this initiative 
forSlow streets! I believe the cars currently drive too fast 
)
n
especially the dump and tow trucks. Large beautiful signage 
o
n
would help to deter traffic and move it to mass ave. Residents 
n
a
would enjoy the beautiful buildings, and wider paths, which 
h
S
 
currently are far too narrow for social distancing. In addition it 
e
n
could be a great main commuter route for bikes. Thank you!

These changes would enable my husband and I to get to 
work, the grocery store, the doctor's office and other 
destinations far more safely. They would also allow us and 
our neighbors to maintain our mental and physical health 
through necessary biking, walking and jogging in our 
neighborhood.  

Would love to feel safe traveling by bike around the city, 
especially during this time when commuter traffic is so 
reduced!

Although I don't like in Cambridge, I bike through it almost 
daily, and would love to see greater measures taken to 
ensure safety for all community members.  
 

Memorial Drive should be closed to vehicular traffic to allow 
for pedestrians and cyclists to commute / get fresh air and 
exercise safely  

A
Making the streets more accessible for walkers and bikers will 
help people to maintain social distancing.

This would be good for everyone. Many streets in 
Cambridgeport can be made 1 way. They are unreasonable 
small for 2 way traffic. This will help build a bike lane.

This would allow my family and I to take walks safely in 
places where sidewalks are not wide enough and for us to 
feel safe biking together as a family (including my eight year 
old daughter)  

Increased sidewalk space and protected bike lanes will make 
it possible for more people to safely navigate our streets. 
Implementing safer street strategies were critical pre-
pandemic and essential now.  

I'm an Arlington resident and frequently visit Cambridge 
businesses by bicycle, along with being a daily bike 
commuter to a Cambridge-based business. Every time I 
bicycle, I feel threatened by drivers in Cambridge who 
dramatically exceed the speed limit, don't observe signal 
requirements, and pass me too closely.

space enough for all of us. Since there's less vehicular traffic,

As a parent of young kids, I've relied on bike rides as a safe 
way to get the kids out of the house. While this was relatively 
possible at the height of the pandemic with minimal traffic, 
s
already the streets are getting busier and the drivers are 
a
w
driving fast and many are distracted by phones. It is more and

more dangerous for pedestrians, runner and bikers. This plan

This would help both for commuting and recreation when 
biking in Cambridge, nudging me to take the bike our more 
frequently than if I have to face dangerous traffic. It would 
help me feel safer.  

Though I live in Medford, I still enter Cambridge frequently, 
whether to get groceries and drop off items for people. For 
me as a cyclist, I'm amazed that I still feel nervous on the 
road because of other drivers even during this time of social 
distancing. Wide roads allow drivers to drive their cars fast,

and because there are fewer people out, I notice that drivers 
drive very fast on residential areas. By widening the 
sidewalks and implementing slower streets where widening 
isn't possible, I know I'll feel safer as a cyclist and I am sure 
that pedestrians will also feel safer out walking and being 
able to cross streets if they need to move out of another 
pedestrian's way. It's also frustrating to me that those who 
want to bike on a bike trail cannot safely social distance. 
During this time when social distancing is still extremely 
critical AND going outside and exercising is a godsend for 
people's mental health and wellbeing, we must implement 
these changes to make everyone safer and healthier.

This would be a huge benefit to pedestrians, cyclists and

Residents Alliance letter to City Council supporting policy orders #1, 7, 8

Perez, Lori

Importance:

High

Dear Mayor, Councilors, and Manager,

We at the Cambridge Residents Alliance want our city to work even harder to ensure that black and brown communities 
are safe and healthy in Cambridge.

We are writing to express support for Policy Order 7, to reduce the $65 million police budget and redirect those funds to 
promoting public health and safety in other departments.  It does not seem right to withhold funds for a second position 
providing housing assistance, while instead increasing the police budget.  When members of Black Lives Matter 
Cambridge chained themselves to the the city hall doors in 2016, they were calling for more affordable housing, and 
Cambridge Residents Alliance supported their call.  Policy Order 7 is aligned with BLM's call.

We support the idea of re-thinking the Cambridge Police. That includes not our police using military hardware and 
weaponry.  We also ask if it makes sense that the social workers within the police department are on the police payroll, 
which makes them accountable to the police staff, instead of being on the payroll of the human services department 
and working closely with police as needed, but also able to do more preventive work before a person encounters the 
police.  And we think Councilor Zondervan makes many good points in his COF #2, including on revising the use of force 
policy and improving the accountability and transparency of the Police Review Advisory Board.

We also support Policy Order #1 for police wearing body cameras, which may help in the event of something going 
wrong; privacy protections would need to be established. 

We also support Policy Order #8, declaring racism to be a public health crisis.  Our city will need to thoroughly analyze 
the city's budget, policies, and practices to see what we should do differently in light of that crisis.

Thank you all for working to make Cambridge better.

Sincerely,

Lee Farris
President, Cambridge Residents Alliance

I wanted to share my opinions with you on Policy order 1, 4, 7 and 8, which are of great importance to me 
as a resident of Cambridge. This is our opportunity to make a difference and be a leader on these 
important issues for the greater Boston area.

• Support Policy order 1: please schedule a meeting for this important conversation
• Support Policy order 4: during this pandemic, food access is critically important and determining 

funding for extending such a program should be a priority

• Support Policy order 7: we must consider how we are spending resources, I hope that we can 

fund a broad range of social services that will allow us to care for our residents as appropriate and 
allow policy to focus on their job, rather than serving as the default social service program

• Support Policy order 8: as a recent graduate of Harvard's public health program, it is incredibly 

important that Cambridge declare racism as a public health crisis.

Thank you,
Emma

Please consider discussion and voting for this Policy Order.  It works both ways:  Depending upon what the camera 
captures, it can protect residents and police officers.  Transparency is so important in order for us to move forward 
toward justice for all.

Thank you for your consideration.

Policy Orders #1, #7, and #8

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Council Members, and CIty Manager,

I want to support policy orders Policy Order #1 (POR 2020 #127), Policy Order #7 (POR 2020 #133), and Policy Order #8 
(POR 2020 #134).

Implementing these policy orders must be the beginning of a sustained, affirming response to the demands being made 
by People of Color in the City of Cambridge.

Elected and non-elected leaders of the City of Cambridge must enact broad based, comprehensive reforms to all 
educational, housing, public health, public safety, and economic institutions in this city.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Support policy orders 1, 7, 8

As the nation with the greatest per capita incarceration on the planet; a military larger than the seven runner-up nations 
combined; and decades of cuts to government programs aimed at improving opportunities for low-income people, while 
increasing funding for police and prisons; it is clear that these trends must be reversed. If we spend our money to equip 
people to contribute to society, they won't have to resort to crime to survive.

I register my support for the following policy orders, so that Cambridge can become part of the solutions:

Policy order #1 POR 2020 #127 : That the Cambridge City Council schedule a hearing to discuss the possible use of body 
cameras by the Cambridge Police Department  
Policy order #7 POR 2020 #133 : That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to report back to the Council on how 
some, or all, of the $4.1 million dollar increase in the Police Department budget between FY20 and FY21 may be 
redirected towards measures that promote public health and safety in other departments .
Policy order #8 POR 2020 #134 : That the Cambridge City Council declare racism as a public health crisis.

City Council Orders

Cambridge City Councilors: Thank you for considering our comments on the follow policy orders now under 
consideration. 

Policy Order 127: Body Cameras on Police. The current uprising over the excessive use of police force has credence 
because of the wide use of citizen camera photos that has exposed the self-serving inaccuracy of police reports, 
especially as they relate to encounters with Black People. Police too often lie on reports that are then exposed by citizen 
film footage. Restoration of confidence in policing rests on transparency. (What really happened?). Body cameras on 
police are a necessity because "we need to know what happened" and we cannot trust the police to tell us. Period. We 
give police the power of the badge and weapons. We need to know how they use that power. Body cameras are a 
necessity in modern day policing to begin the restoration of citizen confidence in our Criminal Justice System. Given the 
current blatant racism, use of excessive force, and mendacity in policing, it is shocking that body cameras are not already 
required.

Policy Order 133: Allocation of Funds to promote Public Health: The nature of policing needs to be reexamined. The de-
militarization of police needs to begin. We need to put our money into promoting public health and "real safety". We 
need to focus on deescalation of violence and put resources into combating poverty and disease and promoting mental 
health. An examination of the real needs of our people and an examination of how policing can play a positive role is in 
order. It can begin with a look at how most Scandinavian countries approach "public safety".

Policy Order 134: That the Cambridge City Council declare racism as a public health crisis. This order is a good start but 
two things have to follow: an action plan and the execution of that plan in a timely fashion.

Finally, we would like to know what is happening to the movement to get city-wide free broadband and why it has 
stalled in Cambridge. This is an equity issue. This pandemic is the final illustration that free broadband has to be 
provided so that everyone can adequately participate in this society. Even public education is now dependent on online 
access. If we truly care to address the equity issues in Cambridge, free broadband must be included.

Dear Council of the City of Cambridge, 

 
My name is Carl Rothenhaus and I am a resident of 75 Lawn Street in the Strawberry Hill 

neighborhood of our fair city. I am writing to communicate my support for Policy Orders 2020 
#129, #133, and #134.  
 
#129: Affordable housing is a necessary commodity in the city of Cambridge. Most large cities 

in the United States, before the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus, were experiencing 
massive housing bubbles. The city of Cambridge was no exception. Now with almost 40 
million Americans filing for unemployment, many are struggling to pay their mortgages 
and high monthly rent. Increased affordable housing in the city of Cambridge, and 
increased ability for builders and developers to build more affordable housing within the 
city of Cambridge is necessary to be able to come out of this crisis on the right foot and 
firmly establish Cambridge as a world class city, for those of all incomes, for years to 
come. Moreover the 100% affordable housing overlay is forward looking. The 100% 
Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) does not include motor vehicle parking minimums, 
and encourages the construction of green transport infrastructure, such as covered bicycle 
racks. Finally, while being forward looking, the AHO does not neglect the importance of 
maintaining neighborhood character by instituting well-conceived height limits and 
setbacks. I look forward to the implementation of the AHO. 

 
#133: The Boston area is home to the oldest police forces in the country. The Minutemen in 

Cambridge were some of the first individuals to represent the rebellion against the British. 
These minutemen defended 18th century Cantabrigian’s right to life and from the immoral 
practices of quartering and unwarranted search and seizure. Unfortunately, these immoral 
British practices and disrespect of the rights laid out in the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights have pervaded modern police forces since their inception, especially 
towards those of color. Cambridge has always been a revolutionary city, from the first 
encampments of the revolutionary army to the first same sex marriages in the United 
States. Today, Cambridge has a chance to be revolutionary again. I am encouraged to see 
the calling for the reallocation of the increased funding for FY2021. But, I along with 
many of my Generation-z peers wish to see the city manager go further in his attempts to 
not only reallocate the 4.1 Million increase but to slim the police budget by as much as is 
feasibly possible for FY2021 and to reallocate these funds towards increased social 
services (to prevent crime in the first place) and increasing the funding for the Police 
Review Board (to prevent further instances of excessive force and improper rhetoric). 
However, in my own opinion, I will stress that no part of these funding decreases should 
affect insurance plans for current public safety workers. The Cambridge Police should be 
transformed from a body of enforcement and violence to a body of support for all people. 
Finally, I must mention that a police force that does not infringe on people’s rights is a 
cheap police force, as legal fees and settlements can substantially drive up costs. 

 
#134: Racism is a public health crisis, plain and simple. I look forward to the passage of this 

order. 

Sincerely, 
Carl F. Rothenhaus

Clerk
City Council
Speaking tonight on Policy Order #3 & Policy Order #7

Mayor Siddiqui, Councilors,

My name is Carolyn Fuller and I live at 12 Douglass St in Central Square Cambridge. I am 
a member of A Better Cambridge, and, as such, I am here this evening to thank you for 
reintroducing the Affordable Housing Overlay, Policy Order #3. After over a year of public 
debate and amendments, I hope the AHO is now on a path for a speedy passage.

I am also here tonight, representing myself, in support of Policy Order #7, the review of 
the Police Department’s budget. It is way past time for police reform. Police unions across 
the country, including here in Cambridge, have far too much power, and use that power to 
stymie reform. The one tool that is available to our political representatives and is beyond 
the control of the police unions is the police budget. This budget should be directed toward 
effectively preventing crime and away from ineffectively policing it.

Needed Modifications to Policy Order #3

To the Cambridge City Council :

The Policy Order #3 on the Council Agenda is intended to 

allow for public hearings, as provided in Section 5 of Chapter 
40A.  I propose three changes to the first paragraph of the order.

The agenda language for June 8 is correctly labeled as "100% 
Affordable Housing Overlay Petition 2020."  This designation 
has the advantage of retaining the "100%" to 
distinguish the new AHO petition from existing 
affordable housing incentives through inclusionary 
zoning (Section 11.203). The 100% means that 
the provisions are directed towards affordable 
housing only and not to some fraction of new 
housing being built. Therefore the wording in the 
first paragraph should have "100%" inserted 
before the word "Affordable."

The "2020" at the end identified this petition as being distinct 
from last year's petition, which it is. I see a value in discussing this 
petition as it stands and not to discuss all the changes that 
were made last year to the original AHO submission.

The proposed order refers to the "attached proposed zoning 
ordinance." The Cambridge Zoning Ordinance or CZO refers to 
the entirety of the zoning ordinance, and not to changes made 
to parts of the ordinance, which is what this amendment is 
designed to do. Thus the words "proposed zoning ordinance" 
should be replaced with "zoning petition."

Finally, the first paragraph ends with the archaic legal/academic 

term "to wit." This words come from the 14th century Middle 
English, "to witen" meaning literally "to know." Modern usage 
suggests "namely," but for clarity I would prefer to replace "to wit:" 
with "The full text of the petition is :"

With these changes, the first paragraph would be in good form 
to move the petition of the four Councillors towards the next step, 
which is public hearings.

The next two uses of the word "ORDERED" would appear to 

have legal problems. The present wording suggests that the 
Council as a whole would by order seek to amend Section 2.000 
on definitions and add section 11.207. By the provisions of 
Chapter 40A, the Council can take action on any petition 
only after public hearings, and not before. Chapter 40A is explicitly 
structured for that sequence.

The solution is straightforward : simply delete the last two uses 

of the word "ORDERED:"

Public comment (via email): Reduce the Cambridge Police Department budget

Dear Cambridge City Council and City Manager,

My name is Nell Hawley and I am a resident of Cambridge (254 Upland Road, Apt. 1, Cambridge MA 
02140). This is the first time I am giving a public comment on any issue, anywhere, and I am motivated 
to do so because I want to help put an end to the systemic anti-Black racism inherent in policing across 
the US, including here in Cambridge. I believe that the best way to combat anti-Black racism in Cambridge 
would be to take $4 million from the proposed CPD budget and use it to fund Cambridge public schools, 
housing access, support for essential workers, the recovery and promotion of Black-owned businesses, 
and public health of all kinds (including mental health).

I am writing to demand that the City of Cambridge reduce the Cambridge Police Department budget. 
Cambridge’s needs must be addressed by the provision of care, and not the threat of violence. We must 
invest in public services that build towards “a free and fair society” rather than an armed force that 
endangers us.

Our city faces racial inequalities, borne from historical injustice and brought into sharp relief by the 
COVID-19 epidemic, that can’t be solved by policing. Members of our community live in tight quarters and 
on lean budgets–this before a pandemic stole three months of wages, and counting. Thousands of us are 
becoming food-insecure and are at risk of eviction as soon as the ban is lifted. Essential educators are 
living on starvation pay while repeated and overwhelming community demands to right this glaring 
injustice are ignored.

Meanwhile, the Police Department is the single largest expenditure in the City’s General Fund behind loan 
repayments. The CPD currently spends 52% of its budget on patrolling–$33,000,000–or 7x as much 
spending on patrol than social justice initiatives.

Now especially, the City Council can take a stand for racial justice by significantly defunding policing and 
investing in Black and Brown communities–starting with cutting the least transparent and most harmful 
parts of the CPD budget.

Please support Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler's Policy Order POR 2020 #133 and only support an FY21 
budget if it reallocates this funding from the Police Department to other measures that promote public 
safety and address underlying issues in our community that can’t be solved by policing – like poverty, the 
lack of affordable housing, and healthcare.

Racist police violence doesn’t just happen in other cities–it happens here in Cambridge too. The City 
Council must stop investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown 
communities need to be safe and healthy: COVID19 relief, housing, healthcare, treatment, school equity 
initiatives, cooperative businesses, community centers, community-led organizations and projects.

Policy Order #139 Affordable Housing Order

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors,

I am not surprised to see that the AHO is back, but I am deeply saddened by this fact. It is frustrating to have spent so 
much time and energy on this highly problematic and divisive issue last year, and to see it emerge in the middle of the 
COV-19 pandemic with seemingly no changes – either for key improvements or in response to the massive changes the 
city is now undergoing and will continue to do so as a result of COV.

Far greater consideration is needed for new and ongoing factors related to the city’s affordable housing situation such 
as:

1.

the sizable increase in unemployment rates in Cambridge - and how this will impact not only city funding, but 
also basic things like housing. Note: without employment these people will not likely to be included in the AHO 
as currently framed, because they would not be able to pay the needed rents.

2. The likely sizable down turn in taxable commercial and other funds that will come into the city coffers as a result 

of COV in the foreseeable future that can be used to pay for this overly expensive and. underperforming 
developer-exclusive model of increasing housing availability.

3. The vast expenses the city has had to (and will have to) incur as a result of COV – resources that cannot be used 

viably for these projects.

4. Changes in state and federal policy since the last AHO discussion that now make every citizen of the country (not 

just Cambridge residents) available for inclusion in the long lists of eligible candidates.

5. The increase in city and area homeless populations in part as a result of COV – people not intended for inclusion 
in the AHO as currently framed because they do not have the requisite financial and other means of paying 
rents.

6. Possible changes to state law on rent control policy that may help alleviate some of the affordable housing 

needs both here and the broader area.

7. Ongoing changes in work that enable more and more employees to fulfill jobs from home where ever they live, 

making the need to travel to Cambridge for employment less critical.

8. Ongoing property value considerations in the city that will make these massive projects (in some cases 7 to 8 
times the density/scale of current structures) most viable in our poorer areas, regardless of zip code, further 
impacting these sectors.

9. Ongoing concerns about allowing a FAR of 2.0 throughout the city, as of right - a scale of development that is 

normally only allowed for massive urban high rises – whether we are talking about Mumbai, New York, or other 
cities.

10. Ongoing concerns about the AHO plan because it stands at odds with both Livable Cities Movement and other 
now widely accepted Urban planning guidelines to keep the massing of new housing on the main corridors in 
proximity to public transportation and key amenities.

In the end, I hope that you will come together to support an affordable housing policy that is far more compatible with 
our progressive values, the dramatically transformed situation of our time, our financial concerns, real housing needs, 
and established livable cities and urban design considerations.

Cordially,
Suzanne Blier

Comment on June 8th Policy Order #7

Hello, my name is Jan Stefan Kaczmarek and I live at 3 Riverside Place. I moved to Cambridge in 2002, but this is my first 
time giving public comment. The murder of George Floyd has so shocked and horrified me that I want to advocate for 
tangible actions and real change to help my black and brown neighbors. Our police department already has sufficient 
funding. In order to further reduce crime, support communities of color, and become a national leader in policing for 
racial equity, those funds would be better used for preventive social services, economic empowerment initiatives, and 
similar programs. Thank you for your time, and I will be closely following the CIty Council's steps on this issue.

Re: Closing streets
Petition · Cambridge City Manager Close some Cambridge Streets to promote a healthy 
re-opening · Change.org.pdf

I am writing to follow up on my letter sent May 14, 2020. I did not receive a response from the City Manager, which is 
unfortunate considering the time I took to write the letter, but such is life, I suppose. In the meantime, I started a 
petition and am respectfully submitting it here to the City Manager and City Council.

Over the past month, the City has announced plans to create three shared streets. I applaud this first effort and expect 
to participate in the first opening day next week by taking my mother, who requires the use of a wheelchair, from her 
home near Central Square to mine via the Harvard (shared) Street. She has not done this trip (or many others) on her 
own before because traveling long distances in her chair is often fraught with dangers including broken sidewalks, 
uneven or missing curb cuts, or other obstructions and obstacles that make it dangerous.

My mother, with several preconditions that make her extremely vulnerable to COVID, is terrified of being outside near 
others. The sidewalks around her apartment are woefully inadequate and do not promote social distancing. Recently, I 
went to Whole Foods on Prospect Street to get her tea, and noticed that the line forming on the sidewalk to enter 
means you either walk/wheel within a foot or two of all the people waiting or step into traffic. A person in a wheelchair 
cannot do the latter, and thus puts themselves and others at risk by failing to maintain proper distancing. 

The inadequacy of our sidewalks to accommodate pedestrians and wheelchair users during "normal" times is sad. During 
a pandemic it is dangerous and potentially deadly. Will it take someone getting run over by a driver to cause the City to 
create more sidewalk space? We have narrow streets, I get that, but we also allocate a lot of the public right of way to 
private car storage and too-wide travel lanes. To safely allow retail and restaurants to reopen, street parking or excess 
road space for vehicle travel needs to be given to people. I know the city is issuing sidewalk dining permits, but I ask, 
where do the pedestrians go?

Finally, I want to convey another incident I observed two weeks ago. When driving my car (I am not anti-car) on Lambert 
Street by Millers River Apartments, I observed another driver honk their horn at a man in a wheelchair who was 
traveling slowly in the street, probably because the sidewalk is too narrow or otherwise obstructed. The audacity of the 
driver to honk at a person who requires the use of a wheelchair was sickening (and I let that driver know), but also 
maddening is the fact that our streets are not able to safely accommodate all users, with priority given to cars first. This 
must change now.

I respectfully submit the petition and it's 31 signatures and two comments. Please read the comments.

Thank you,
Luis Mejias

Good evening,

It’s incredibly frustrating that there has been little to no action on the part of the City to close streets or reduce vehicle 
lanes to widen sidewalks so that we can safely walk down the street while maintaining proper distances from 
others. We also need to implement (enforced) bus lanes and give more space to restaurants and retail.

Countless cities around the world are moving aggressively to prepare their cities for reopening, yet Cambridge seems 
stuck in some sort of time warp, having done nothing since the Council recommended the Manager act on this.

I’ve been on many walks where I have to venture into traffic lanes to avoid oncoming pedestrians. I’m passed by 
runners who cannot stay 6’ away without putting themselves and me in danger. How is this putting our health first and 
foremost?

We also should be immediately striping bus lanes to allow MBTA buses to move through as efficiently as possible so 
that they can operate more frequently. This is imperative to promote less crowding on our bus routes. We also need 
more sidewalk space at bus stops so people waiting have space to spread out.

As restaurants and retail shops prepare to open, they will be required to limit occupancy. How is a small shop or 
restaurant supposed to survive if they can only have a 20-40% of the tables full at any one time? They need room to 
expand seating outdoors, and our sidewalks are woefully inadequate to support them.

Now is the time for Cambridge to reduce travel lanes and prepare our business districts by limiting on street parking 
and traffic so that more space can be given to people. If we don’t do it now, it will be too late when the gridlock 
returns.

I urge the City Manager to consider closing Mass Ave through Central Sq, Harvard Sq, Porter Sq, and Cambridge Street 
from Inman Sq into E Cambridge, to all vehicles except buses and emergency vehicles — Cars will find their way 
around, but we shouldn’t be going out of our way to convenience those who want to get through our city as quickly as 
possible. Give the street space to restaurants, bars and stores so our local businesses can reopen successfully. 

Further, consider closing a network of local streets so people have more space to walk, run and bike without fear of 
speeding cars. Let our kids have free reign this summer.

Finally - close Memorial Drive for good. Connect our city with its waterfront for its entire length from Arlington to 
Kendall and Lechmere. If someone wants to drive 50 mph, let them use limited access Storrow. The paths on Memorial 
Drive are WAY too narrow to support the number of people who use it. Why force them onto sidewalks that at times 
are no more than 4-5’ wide? Why are we prioritizing cars zooming through? We could have a world-class riverfront 
linear park and a bike highway, so that when people return to their offices in Kendall Square, maybe more will bike 
instead of drive their cars as fast as possible from Belmont and Arlington through our city. There’s no reason we need a 
4-lane highway on our waterfront.

I urge you to act now. Waiting until June or July will be too late. 

Thank you,

Luis Mejias started this petition to Cambridge City Manager Louis DePasquale and 2 others

Cities around the world and right here next to Cambridge, MA, are acting responsibly toward re-opening their economies
by reducing travel lanes or closing streets completely to:

1.  Promote safe physical distancing,
2.  Provide outdoor space to accommodate safe restaurant dining and retail patronage,
3.  Provide room for buses to operate more efﬁciently, thereby reducing crowding at bus stops and on-board, and
4.  Encourage those who need to travel for work or pleasure to do so without a car, by expediting the expansion of safe

bicycling space, preventing congestion from returning with a vengeance.

5.20.b

We are already experiencing the beneﬁts of reduced trafﬁc, including much lower air pollution and less noise.  The re-
opening of our economy without proper planning will lead to a return of trafﬁc congestion and all of its ills, in addition to
making it harder to stay safely apart when walking, running or cycling.  Restaurants and retail establishments will ﬁnd it
hard to turn a proﬁt if their occupancy is limited. We know how to avoid this and promote the public health and safety.

Local examples could include reducing vehicle access and parking on Mass Ave in Central, Harvard, and Porter Squares,
and Cambridge Street around Inman Square into E Cambridge, allowing for wider sidewalks for restaurant seating and
retail, to reducing travel lanes or closing Memorial Drive completely, fully connecting Cambridge to its waterfront and
creating a walking/running paradise and bicycle highway from Arlington to Kendall Square and downtown Boston.

The City Council recommended the City Manager enact such measures weeks ago, but nothing has happened.  From
Arlington, Brookline and Boston to Paris, Oakland, Tampa, Vilnius and Birmingham, cities are proactively promoting
livability, creating an environment where people feel safer congregating and making their city the vibrant place that they
are.  Cambridge needs to do the same.

We, the undersigned, ask the City Manager to begin implementing these measures for the health and safety of
Cantabrigians without further delay.

Keep your supporters engaged with a news update. Every update you post will be sent as a separate email to signers of
your petition.

Thank you for signing the petition. I will be submitting this petition to the City Manager and City Council over the
weekend.

I walk every day and it seems to be getting more and more dangerous out there. One has to walk in the street to maintain
the legal distance from others, and at ﬁrst that worked, as there were fewer cars on the streets and they all seemed to be
Keeping within the speed limit. Now most of the cars are speeding a lot and even when you’re in a crosswalk… Read more

I am a senior citizen, she 69. I exercise by walking in the city. It is already difﬁcult with a regular handful of pedestrians
unmasked and/or not moving over at all when our paths cross. I frequently have the choice to walk close to them or go into
the street, outside parked cars. I think opening streets will help a lot by creating width. Safer… Read more

Public Comment - June 8th - Police Department Budget

My name is Lydia Ducharme. I live at 216 Banks St, Cambridge, MA 02138, and work at the Community Charter School of 
Cambridge, just outside of Kendall Square. I have never given a public comment before, but today marks a 
crucial decision point for the city of Cambridge, so I'm motivated to engage in this conversation.

I want to see action that strongly condemns and seeks to prevent racial injustice. Due to the pandemic, many 
organizations are seeing cuts. The police department has the highest allocation of the city budget, after education -
above fire, public works, human services Cambridge Health Alliance, and transportation. I want to see education, public 
health, and social service organizations prioritized over police.

Cambridge must stop investing in targeted criminalization and surveillance, and fund what Black and Brown 
communities need to be safe and healthy. As a resident of Cambridge, I want to see action.

Thank you for your time.

Tonight’s CC Meeting

Dear Cambridge City Council, 

My name is Caitlyn O’Brien and I am a resident of Cambridge. 

I am writing to urge that the city lead in the fight against racism in support of Policy Order 8, declaring racism a public 
health emergency to take action in the following ways:

Please reduce the CPD budget and increase funding and care of their citizens, especially the black and brown people of 
our community.

Please support Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler's Policy Order 7, POR 2020 #133 and only support an FY21 budget if it 
reassigns this funding from the Police Department to other outlets promoting public safety and addressing deep seeded 
issues in our community that can’t and shouldn’t be solved by policing – like poverty, the lack of affordable housing, 
education, mental health and healthcare. 

The Cambridge Police has stated that it is very close to adopting all 8 of the recommendations by the 8 Can’t Wait 
project. Commissioner Bard spoke yesterday at the Cambridge Common that the City Council Plans on finalizing that 
today. I urge you to please adopt the 8 Can’t Wait policies today and to ensure that the transparency is increased within 
the CPD with rapid enactment of the procedure justice "dashboard" reporting on any differences in police treatment 
based on race or bias. 

Lastly, I am in support of Policy Order POR 2020 #129, enabling affordable housing developers to build more city-wide. It 
is an unreasonably imbalanced and tight market making it even harder to live here. This would be another way to help
make a more equitable city.

Please help the community’s unheard voices soar.

Please submit these comments to the record.

Thank you,

Caitlyn O’Brien

Public Comment from Beca Han

My name is Beca Han. I’ve been a resident at 211 Harvard St since 2016.

Given the continuation of systematic racism and police brutality, I feel compelled to be here in support of the Black 
communities affected. 

I believe strong action needs to take place in both solidarity with the black community, but also in order to see real 
change happen. I think we should drastically reduce the police budget and demilitarize the police.

Cambridge still accepts excess military equipment for the police, yet the crimes do not require such equipment. These 
resources can be allocated elsewhere, such as human services and public health.

I am hopeful of change in Cambridge and will continue to support the Black communities and watch for action to take 
place.

Support for Policy Orders 1, 7, 8

The past several weeks have highlighted a painful truth that our approach to policing and justice in this country have 
often led to violence against our black and brown neighbors, and without reconsidering the role of policing in ensuring 
safe and vibrant communities I'm afraid we will continue to see this type of violence play out.

It's clear through the response from the police commissioner to the events surrounding George Floyd's death that the 
Cambridge police are aware of and taking seriously their role in this system. And it's also clear that they have already 
spent considerable time thinking about how to interrupt the expected cycles of criminalization and violence, as was seen 
in last week's request for additional resources to support a dedicated Cambridge outreach worker through the ROCA 
program.

All that aside, I hope we will push ourselves to think even more creatively as we attempt to interrupt familiar 
patterns. Specifically, I hope we will consider whether the police are the right institution to respond to all that we have 
charged them with in recent years - as mental health resources, social workers, school resources, addiction resources, 
etc. Whether a better future would have us ask more and more of a single institution, or whether there are other 
resources in our neighborhoods which are better suited to address critical needs and with less history of harm. We need 
to think more creatively about how to minimize the number of scenarios which call for a resource with a gun and a 
uniform.

I support policy order 8 - declaring racism a public health crisis - and hope this will enable additional resources and allow 
us to further intensify our focus on this issue.

I support policy order 7 - questioning whether additional police funds requested might be better spent elsewhere. This 
will undoubtedly require difficult conversations about whether our current best intentions are enough, but it is 
impossible to imagine the police being successful in scenarios where community member's expectations and past 
experiences will be a real barrier to that very success.

I support policy order 1 - a hearing about the potential usefulness of body cameras. This should be considered as a 
possible tool, although I have seen conflicting indicators as to whether this actually does anything to address incidence 
of violence between police and community members, including this study 
(https://www.pnas.org/content/116/21/10329.short?rss=1) which suggest that it does not significantly impact police 
behaviors.

I support Councilor Zondervan's move to hold hearings in the Public Safety Committee and think that centering black 
voices will be critical to progress.

Thank you again for your continued focus and efforts,

Kathryn Deane

Going outside business-as-usual in budget considerations

I’m writing to ask you to seriously consider thinking outside of business-as-usual in the upcoming discussions of the 
place of police funding in the city budget and the declaration of racism as a public health crisis. As a resident of 
Cambridge, I want our city to do the best we can in making us an anti-racist, inclusive, and safe place to live and work. As 
a relatively recent arrival, I do not have the depth of knowledge of Cambridge policing and the budget in general, but I’m 
sure you will be hearing from those who do. Please prioritize the voices of people who have lived experience of racism in 
Cambridge and those who have been working on this struggle for too many years. Please seriously consider any 
proposals they have that might at first glance seem impossible or impractical. Restricting ourselves to the expected right 
now is limiting. I have hope that the unexpected can help us create a more equitable, just, and livable Cambridge.

Perez, Lori

Please declare racism a public health crises and allocate resources to make 
improvements

Dear Councilors,
I'm writing to encourage you to declare racism a public health crises and to allocate resources to make improvements 
here in Cambridge.  

I know you will listen to the voices of our Black residents who can speak to what the priorities should be.  

From my own experience as a long time white resident and parent of kids in the school system, I think it is a top priority 
to find new ways to continue to address racism in our schools. I also hope we can provide more housing for people of all 
income levels. In fact wouldn't it be amazing if all city staff were able to find housing within our city!  

There are many committed and caring people in this city and I believe that we can make Cambridge a national leader in 
equity and anti-racism if we focus on that. I am personally committed to being part of that work.

Thank you for your service,
Ruthann Rudel

VICE MAYOR MALLON 
 
WHEREAS: 

Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, many meals programs frequented by 
Cambridge’s homeless population were forced to close their doors for health and safety 
reasons, and homeless shelters were often left short-staffed, and therefore couldn’t 
prepare meals on-site; and 
 
To fill in this gap for this vulnerable population, the City has been partnering with 
local restaurants to provide meals to local homeless shelters in need, and distributes 
2,600 meals each week through this program; and 
 
Audible has made a generous donation of $30,000 to this meals program, helping 
ensure its longevity and success; and 
 
This is just one of many of Audible’s efforts nationwide to fight food insecurity, while 
supporting restaurants during a time when many small businesses are struggling; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record thanking Audible for their generous donation of 
$30,000 to the City’s restaurant meals to shelters program; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of 
this resolution to Audible’s Cambridge office at 101 Main Street on behalf of the entire 
City Council.

WHEREAS: 

The nation is grappling with how to improve police interactions with residents, and 
how to create a police department that is equitable and accountable to the community; 
and 
 
The City of Cambridge has a vested interest in ensuring the safety of both residents 
and police officers, and embedding opportunities for transparency to facilitate this 
work; and 
 
Having police officers wear body cameras is one way of increasing transparency in 
local policing. While the research results are mixed about whether the technology 
decreases police use of force, it is at least a means of oversight and accountability of 
individual behavior and overall policing; therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council schedule a hearing to discuss the possible use of 
body cameras by the Cambridge Police Department.

That the Cambridge City Council amend of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of 
Cambridge, by inserting a new section 11.207, AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
OVERLAY, to read as follows: 
11.207.1        Purpose and Intent  
The  purpose  of  this  Section  is  to  promote  the  public  good  by 
supporting  the  development  of  housing  that  is  affordable  to 
households earning up to 100% of area median income. The intent 
of this Section is to allow incremental increases in density, limited 
increases  in  height,  and  relaxation  of  certain  other  zoning 
limitations for residential developments in which all units are made 
permanently affordable to households earning up to 100% of area 
median  income  (referred  to  as  “AHO  Projects,”  as  defined  in 
Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance); to incentivize the reuse of 
existing  buildings  in  order  to  create  AHO  Projects  that  are  more 
compatible  with  established  neighborhood  character;  to  promote 
the city’s urban design objectives in Section 19.30 of this Zoning 
Ordinance  while  enabling  AHO  Projects  to  be  permitted  as-of-
to  non-binding  advisory  design  consultation 
right,  subject 
procedures  that  follow  all  design  objectives  set  forth  within  this 
Zoning  Ordinance  and  the  results  of  the  design  review  process 
shall be provided to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust; and 
to  apply  such  standards  throughout  the  City,  to  promote  city 
planning goals of achieving greater socioeconomic diversity and a 
more equitable distribution of affordable housing citywide.

An  AHO  Project  shall  be  permitted  as-of-right  if  it  meets 
all  of  the  standards  set  forth  in  this  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay  in  place  of  the  requirements  otherwise  applicable 
in the zoning district. Any development not meeting all of 
the standards set  forth in this Affordable Housing Overlay 
shall be subject to the requirements otherwise applicable in 
the  zoning  district,  including  any  requirements  for  special 
permits.

Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO 
Project  shall  comply  with  the  following  procedure,  which  is 
intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and 
staff input into the design of the project. 
(a) 

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance 
the  City’s  desired  outcomes  for  the  form  and  character  of 
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable  housing  units,  AHO  Projects  are  permitted  to 
have  a  greater  height,  scale,  and  density  than  other 
developments  permitted  by the zoning  for a given district. 
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that 
are  compatible  with  the  existing  neighborhood  context  or 
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 
The  City’s  Design  Guidelines  for  100%  Affordable 
Housing  Overlay,  along  with  other  design  objectives  and 
guidelines established for the part of the city in  which the 
AHO  Project  is  located,  are  intended  to  inform  the  design 
of  AHO  Projects  and  to  guide  the  Planning  Board’s 
consultation  and  report  as  set  forth  below.  It  is  intended 
that  designers  of  AHO  Projects,  City  staff,  the  Planning 
Board,  and  the  general  public  will  be  open  to  creative 
variations  from  any  detailed  provisions  set  forth  in  such 
objectives  and  guidelines  as  long  as  the  core  values 
expressed are being served. 
At  least  two  community  meetings  shall  be  scheduled  at  a 
time  and  location  that  is  convenient  to  residents  in 
proximity to the project site. The Community Development 
Department  (CDD)  shall  be  notified  of  the  time  and 
location  of  such  meetings,  and  shall  give  notification  to 
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or 
private  street  or  way,  and  abutters  to  the  abutters  within 
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which 
the  AHO  Project  is  proposed  and  to  any  individual  or 
organization  who  each  year  files  with  CDD  a  written 
request  for  such  notification,  or  to  any  other  individual  or 
organization CDD may wish to notify. 
(i) 

The purpose of the first community meeting shall be

RESOLVED: 

 Mildred Jean (Jeter) Loving and Richard Perry Loving, from the state of 
Virginia, married for love in 1958, but traveled to Washington D.C. to get married 
because it was illegal for an interracial couple to marry in Virginia; and 
  
The Lovings returned to Virginia to be near their families, but soon after their return, 
the police raided their home in the middle of the night and arrested the couple; they 
avoided going to jail by agreeing to a suspended sentence on the condition that they 
permanently move out of the state; and 
  
The couple returned to Washington D.C., where life was difficult for them because of 
social isolation and financial problems, though they were saddened and frustrated by 
their inability to travel together to visit their home and families in Virginia; and 
  
The Lovings fought the law that prohibited them to live as a legally married couple in 
their state by taking their case all the way to the United States Supreme Court; and 
  
On June 12, 1967, in a landmark civil rights decision, the Supreme Court struck down 
the Virginia Interracial Marriage Ban Law and similar laws in 15 other states because 
it violated the 14th amendment, and the Lovings could now return to their home 
without fear of persecution; and 
  
The courage of the Lovings is an inspiration to us all and a true example of 
perseverance and persistence in the face of great struggle; and 
  
In 2018, the Council unanimously passed a resolution declaring “June 12 to be 
Loving Day in Cambridge in the years that follow with the goal of making this day an 
opportunity to recognize, accept, and applaud all kinds of families;” now therefore be 
it 
 
That the City Council renews its observance of Loving Day on June 12, 2020 and 
encourages all Cambridge residents to embrace the diversity of families and recognize 
the importance of this day.

On March 10th, Governor Baker declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 
outbreak; and 
 
The City of Cambridge has taken measures to mitigate the impact of this highly 
contagious virus, such as mandatory face coverings and social distancing guidelines; 
and 
 
Despite the City of Cambridge’s efforts to alleviate the transmission of COVID-19, so 
many families and residents have been impacted by COVID-19, and we mourn for 
those who have been impacted; and 
 
As of June 3, 2020, over 1,000 Cambridge residents have tested positive for COVID-
19 and 94 residents have died from COVID-19; and 
 
The COVID-19 global pandemic has killed over 100,000 people in the United States, 
with over 1.8 million confirmed cases of COVID-19; and 
 
The individuals who died from this virus were family, friends, healthcare workers, 
grocery store clerks, and first responders, and many were housed in nursing home 
facilities; 
 
Social distancing guidelines prevents us from gathering together to celebrate, honor 
and properly say goodbye to those lives lost; and 
 
Lowering the flags to half-staff serves to symbolize our collective grief; therefore be it 
 
That the flags half-staff will serve as a reminder that every life lost to COVID-19 was a 
loved community member, and those lives were lost too soon due to this deadly virus; 
and be it further 
 
The City Manager is hereby requested to find the appropriate City staff to position the 
flags in front of City Hall and City/school buildings at half-staff for the remainder of 
June to honor the lives lost due to COVID-19.

ORDERED: 

In response to the police killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 and 
Breonna Taylor in Louisville on March 13—as well as the deaths of numerous other 
Black Americans murdered in the name of law enforcement—a wave of massive and 
sustained protests has erupted nationwide; and 
 
The same communities of color leading these protests have been the hardest hit by 
COVID-19 and the ensuing economic recession; in Cambridge, Black residents are 
testing positive at a rate three times higher than white residentsi; and 
 
On May 30, reflecting some demands many Black movement leaders have begun to 
coalesce around, Black Lives Matter launched a new combined campaign to 
#DefundThePolice and #InvestInCommunities hit hardest by the coronavirus 
pandemicii; and 
 
On June 1, the City Council unanimously passed POR 2020 #126iii, describing 
horrifying instances of police violence across the country, condemning police 
brutality wholesale, and affirming its solidarity with people of color who have 
suffered under unjust criminal justice systems; and 
 
Because of COVID-19, the City is anticipating less revenue for FY21 than originally 
anticipated and is expecting to delay the hiring of new positions, including in the 
Human Services and Community Development Departments; and 
 
Commitment to anti-racism in Cambridge requires material policy changes away from 
using policing as a response to our city’s problems and toward addressing the human 
services issues of poverty, healthcare and education that are the underlying causes of 
those problems; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to report back to the Council on 
how some, or all, of the $4.1 million dollar increase in the Police Department budget 
between FY20 and FY21 may be redirected towards measures that promote public 
health and safety in other departments; and 
 
That the City Manager report back to the Council in time for the June 15 City Council 
meeting at which the Council will vote on whether to adopt the proposed FY21 
budget.

RESOLVED: 

That the City Council go on record stating its intention to support a proposed FY21 
budget only if it includes a significant reallocation of funds towards measures that 
promote public health and safety other than policing.

The United States has a long history of racism against the Black community. Through 
Jim Crow laws, redlining and slavery, racism is woven into the very fabric of 
American history over the past 400 years; and 
 
To this day, racism causes disproportionately high rates of homelessness, incarceration, 
poor education and health outcomes, and economic hardship for Black people; and 
 
Last year, more than 1,000 people were killed by police in the United States, and Black 
people were disproportionately among those killed. Black people accounted for 24% of 
those killed, despite making up only about 13% of the population; and 
 
The current COVID-19 pandemic also shows Black people have been 
disproportionally affected, with the latest data showing that Black individuals have 
died from the disease at almost three times the rate of white people, and Black people 
have tested positive at almost three times the rate of white people in Cambridge 
specifically, further showing racial disparities and inequities; and 
 
The CDC defines public health as the science of protecting and improving the health of 
people and their communities; and 
 
The U.S. Office of Disease Prevention has recognized that discrimination has a 
negative impact on health in a community; and 
 
The Boston Public Health Commission states that racism impacts social determinants 
of health, including social capital, education, transportation, employment, food access, 
health behaviors, socioeconomic status, environmental exposure, access to health 
services, housing, and public safety; and 
 
On March 2, 2020, the City Council passed a policy order that asked for a “Racial 
Equity Impact Statement” to be included on all relevant agenda items; and 
 
On April 13, 2020, the City Council passed a policy order to convene an advisory 
committee to review the impact of the pandemic on local communities of color, to 
propose ways to better disseminate information, relief, and resources to these 
communities, to begin collecting data on the neighborhoods that have been hardest 
hit in an effort to reduce infection rates and improve recovery rates; and

residents in Cambridge; now therefore be it

Communicating information from the School Committee’s Special Meeting and Regular 
Meeting 

The School Committee held a Special Meeting last Thursday, May 28th and a Regular Meeting this past 
Tuesday, June 2nd. At both meetings, the School Committee and administration and heard Public Comment. 
I’m  thankful  to  everyone  that  tuned  in  and  signed  up  to  provide  their  testimonies.  We  must  actively 
dismantle the structures of systemic racism in our City and school system. Ensuring a safe and supportive 
school environment for our black and brown students is at the center of this work and to be successful, we 
must further elevate the voices of our community members.  
 
At  last  Thursday’s  meeting,  Superintendent  Salim  and  his  team  gave a  presentation  on the  work  of  the 
Office of Student Services (OSS) in distance learning for special education students with Individualized 
Education Plans (IEPs). The administration spoke to their goals of establishing systemic special education 
resources  and  engaging  every  student  and  caregiver  in  meaningful,  regular  two-way  exchanges.  They 
reported to have a system of robust engagement with students and families, which some parents say is not 
consistent with their own experiences. The Superintendent will survey students and families to gain a better 
understanding of the barriers they are facing and how OSS can support them. 
 
This  past  Tuesday,  Superintendent  Salim  and  Deputy  Superintendent  Turk  provided  an  update  on  their 
planning  for  their  summer.  They  shared  8  CPS  administered  programs  that  will  be  available,  in  what 
capacity, and to which students. Every program will be offered virtually during the months of July and 
August and registration will be live at www.cpsd.us/summer by June 12. Following this update, a number 
of motions were passed, including a requirement for the Superintendent and Chief of Information Services 
to work with the City Manager in exploring options (beyond existing Wi-Fi hotspots) to close the digital 
divide. Most importantly, in response to a request by the CRLS Black Student Union, we adopted a motion 
to  raise  a  Black  Lives  Matter  flag  outside  the  CRLS  building  through  the  20-21  school  year,  effective 
immediately.  
 
The Building & Grounds Subcommittee will convene June 5 at 12:30pm to continue the discussion on the 
facilities planning as a response to COVID-19.

Funding our Community, Transforming our Policing 

 
 
 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
Policing as we know it evolved from slave patrols and is a fundamentally racist institution. The 
tragic murder of George Floyd and the resulting protests across the country serve as another 
reminder that we need to fundamentally rethink the role of policing in our society. As Chair of 
the Public Safety Committee, it is my intent to hold hearings that center Black voices and chart a 
course to transformative change. This Communication lays out some of the steps and approaches 
that could be taken at the municipal level.  
 
Re-allocation of Funding 
 
The FY21 proposed Police Department budget totals $62 million, including a $4.1 million 
increase from FY20. This means the Police Department makes up almost 9% of our operating 
budget, the largest department outside of Education. While the proposed budget does include 
several initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence and preventing criminal behavior among 
young people, it also contains many millions of dollars for traditional violent policing and 
equipment including a $1 million cost center for a tactical operations unit 
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_tactical_unit>, which is generally the most militarized 
component of a police force.  
 
Traditionally, we have responded to criminal activity among young men by increasing the 
policing of them. Often, these young men are left behind in our traditional education, artistic, and 

Packet Pg. 795

8.2

athletic pathways to economic opportunity, creating immense pressure for them to fall into a 
potentially violent and deadly criminal lifestyle. While the Department has implemented some 
programs in an attempt to disrupt this cycle, including even some that have been moderately 
successful, not enough is being done and we continue to lose too many of our youth to violent 
crime and incarceration. Police-centric programs also come with their own inherent limits, since 
once down a criminal path a certain distance, the individual becomes potentially unreachable this 
way. The response of adding more and more violent policing into the mix through reflexive 
annual police budget increases, without sufficiently addressing the underlying socio-economic 
risk factors, has allowed generations of young men (often Black) to fall into a life of crime that 
becomes difficult to rescue them and society from. 
 
Meanwhile, our very successful youth programs like the King Open Extended Day program 
remain shockingly underfunded and limited in scope, despite their demonstrated success and 
potential for assisting in the education and wellness of our youth. Many opportunities remain in 
our budget to better support young people, especially Black youth. With the final budget vote 
coming up on June 15, it is not too late for the council to call on the City Manager to better fund 
these programs and to reduce the police budget correspondingly. Specific areas to consider for 
increased funding include the many initiatives in the Human Services Department, our summer 
youth programs, the RSTA <http://rsta.cpsd.us> program at CRLS, Project Elevate and other 
efforts to recruit more teachers of color, providing better mental health services for young 
people, and many other ideas that can and should be sourced from the community and those who 
have been historically most impacted by our racist and anti-Black approach to education and 
economic opportunity. 
 
Body Cameras 
 
The Cambridge Police Department does not currently use body cameras, although they have 
done other things to reduce incidents of excessive force. Body cameras can increase 
accountability by creating an objective video record of an incident from the perspective of the 
officer. While cell phone recordings of incidents have become prolific, body cameras can 
provide consistent footage that is more credible in a courtroom. They do come with significant 
privacy concerns, however, which must be addressed as part of any policy and implementation.  
 
I support the effort of my colleagues to move forward with a body camera program in the 
Cambridge Police Department. However, we should be cognizant of the fact that such a program 
will ultimately have a limited impact, and to the extent that body cameras give us comfort in 
continuing to fund and expand traditional policing methods, they will be counterproductive to 
efforts of deeper and more transformative solutions. 
 
The ACLU and the ACLU of Massachusetts have provided <https://www.aclu.org/other/police-
body-mounted-cameras-right-policies-place-win-all?redirect=police-body-mounted-cameras-
right-policies-place-win-all> extensive guidance on how to craft an effective body camera 
policy. Key considerations from this guidance include: 
 

●  The need to avoid continuous recording while at the same time blocking officers from 

selectively determining which encounters are filmed. Body cameras should not be used as 

Packet Pg. 796

8.2

general surveillance tools, but allowing for officer discretion undermines any benefit that 
the cameras might bring. Special consideration should also be given to encounters 
involving domestic violence and rape in order to protect the identity of the survivor. 

●  The need to create consequences for noncompliance with body camera recording, 

including direct disciplinary action against the officer and the disallowment of verbal 
evidence in favor of the officer that otherwise could have been verified if the camera had 
been turned on, except in situations where the officer couldn’t reasonably have turned on 
the camera or where other verifiable forms of evidence exist. 

●  The need to implement privacy considerations at the point of recording. The ACLU 

recommends limiting cameras to uniformed police officers and marked vehicles only, and 
requiring that officers notify people that they are being recorded. Additional 
consideration should be given to instances in which police officers enter someone’s 
home, particularly in non-exigent circumstances. 

●  The need to incorporate policies related to retention and use. The ACLU recommends 
that retention periods should be measured in weeks not years, and policies should be 
clearly posted online. Careful thought should be given to who can flag a recording for 
further retention, and when they can do so.  

●  The need to ensure that anyone recorded by a body camera can access and make copies of 

said recording for as long as it is retained by the department. 

●  The need to regulate public disclosure, including redacting information to protect 

identities when possible. 

●  The need to implement protocols and technological controls that prevent tampering or 

destruction of evidence by the department. 

●  The need for explicit forbiddance of body camera use by government officials who do not 

have the authority to conduct searches and make arrests. 

 
Use of body cameras would fall under the Surveillance Ordinance, which was used 
<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=2590&Med
iaPosition=&ID=11391&CssClass=> by the Council to rubber stamp massive amounts of police 
surveillance the first time we had an opportunity to review these technologies earlier this term. 
 
Use of Force Policy 
 
The version of the Use of Force Policy available online took effect in 2011 and was publicly 
released in 2015. The Police Use of Force Project <http://useofforceproject.org> is a helpful 
resource that the council can use as a starting point when analyzing our Use of Force Policy. This 
tool analyzes use of force policies from 91 of the hundred largest cities in the country, evaluating 
them across eight different metrics. As of 2016, none of the 91 cities had a policy that satisfied 
all eight of the criteria put forward by the project. The criteria are listed below, along with my 
analysis of how Cambridge’s policy measures up. I want to be clear that these eight criteria are 
by no means sufficient in my mind, and that a deeper and more radical analysis of the use of 
force policy is warranted in order to arrive at a satisfactory place.  
 

1.  Does the policy require officers to de-escalate situations, when possible, before using 

Packet Pg. 797

8.2

force? No. Cambridge’s policy does not even reference de-escalation. The policy only 
stipulates that the force must be immediately necessary. That wording gives an 
uncomfortable amount of discretion to officers, and the policy should be modified to 
explicitly require de-escalation before using force whenever possible. 
 

2.  Does the policy use a force continuum/matrix that defines/limits the type of force 

and/or weapons that can be used to respond to specific types of resistance? No. The 
policy does not contain such a thing. It does define “lethal” and “less-than-lethal” 
weapons, but it doesn’t make it clear how and when to choose between them. Such a 
force continuum/matrix would clarify expectations for each type of interaction, and it 
would create more clear boundaries around when “lethal” and “less-than-lethal” weapons 
can be used. 
 

3.  Does the policy restrict chokeholds and strangleholds (including carotid restraints) 
to situations where deadly force is authorized or prohibit them altogether? Yes, 
mostly. The policy does explicitly ban “carotid control or chokeholds”. Strangleholds are 
not explicitly mentioned. However, it also includes a giant loophole, exempting “those 
types of manual holds for which a police officer has been specifically trained in gaining 
control or maintaining control of a detainee”. We need to better understand exactly which 
manual holds are currently considered permissible. Also, while it does say “Officers will 
not use any other type of manual holds that are intended or designed to inflict pain or 
injury”, I would prefer something more like “Officers shall not use any maneuver 
whatsoever that is intended or designed to inflict pain or injury”. Manual holds seems to 
refer specifically to the use of hands, which as we saw in the George Floyd case, can be 
subverted by using other body parts like knees and full body weight to hold down, 
asphyxiate and kill someone. 

4.  Does the policy require officers to give a verbal warning, when possible, before 

using deadly force? No. The policy states that “Where practical prior to discharging a 
firearm, officers shall identify themselves as law enforcement officers and state their 
intent to shoot.” As we saw in the recent deadly shooting 
<https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-03/vallejo-police-shoot-kill-man-
that-officer-mistakenly-thought-had-a-gun-he-had-a-hammer> of a suspected looter in 
Los Angeles, this type of guidance does almost nothing at all. The officer pulled up in his 
vehicle and fired 5 shots through the windshield, striking and killing the suspect who was 
kneeling on the ground with his hands in the air. The officer had seen what looked like a 
possible butt of a handgun sticking out, which turned out to be a hammer. Presumably the 
officer in that situation did not think it was practical to announce his intent to shoot, and 
so he didn’t. Furthermore, deadly force is not limited to discharging a firearm, as we saw 
tragically in the cases of Eric Garner, George Floyd, and many other police killings that 
did not involve firing a weapon. 
 

5.  Does the policy prohibit officers from shooting at people in moving vehicles, unless 
the person poses a deadly threat by means other than the vehicle (for example, 
shooting at people from the vehicle)? Yes. The policy clearly states that "Officers are 

 

Packet Pg. 798

8.2

also prohibited from discharging a firearm at a moving vehicle, except when the 
occupants of the vehicle are using it to employ/exert deadly force against the officer or 
another victim..." 

6.  Does the policy require officers to exhaust all other reasonable alternatives before 
resorting to using deadly force? No. The policy states “Whether the degree of force 
used is reasonable depends upon the specific facts surrounding the situation. Only a 
reasonable and necessary amount of force may be used. The degree of force that the 
officer may reasonably be expected to use depends upon the amount of resistance, or the 
threat to safety that the situation presents." None of this indicates that other alternatives 
must be exhausted; rather, it reads more like support for a post-hoc analysis justifying the 
amount of force that was used. 

7.  Does the policy require officers to intervene to stop another officer from using 

excessive force? No. The policy appears to be silent on this issue. 

 

 

 

8.  Does the policy require comprehensive reporting that includes both uses of force 

and threats of force (for example, reporting instances where an officer threatens a 
civilian with a firearm)? Yes. The policy clearly states that “...any officer who points a 
firearm at another individual shall be required to fully document the incident in a Use of

male member also being the current PRAB chair. The vacancy represents an opportunity to make 
the PRAB more representative. 
 
In addition, the PRAB has many procedural and transparency limitations that render it largely 
ineffective as a police oversight body. While the secretary reported to the Council that only 10 
complaints have been filed in each of the past two years, it is unclear how many complaints are 
not filed because of a lack of faith in the process. Significant reform of how this body operates 
should be considered, including greater independence from the police department, and greater

Funding our Community, Transforming our Policing 

 
 
 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
Policing as we know it evolved from slave patrols and is a fundamentally racist institution. The 
tragic murder of George Floyd and the resulting protests across the country serve as another 
reminder that we need to fundamentally rethink the role of policing in our society. As Chair of 
the Public Safety Committee, it is my intent to hold hearings that center Black voices and chart a 
course to transformative change. This Communication lays out some of the steps and approaches 
that could be taken at the municipal level.  
 
Re-allocation of Funding 
 
The FY21 proposed Police Department budget totals $62 million, including a $4.1 million 
increase from FY20. This means the Police Department makes up almost 9% of our operating 
budget, the largest department outside of Education. While the proposed budget does include 
several initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence and preventing criminal behavior among 
young people, it also contains many millions of dollars for traditional violent policing and 
equipment including a $1 million cost center for a tactical operations 

, which is generally the

most militarized component of a police force.  
 
Traditionally, we have responded to criminal activity among young men by increasing the 
policing of them. Often, these young men are left behind in our traditional education, artistic, and 
athletic pathways to economic opportunity, creating immense pressure for them to fall into a 
potentially violent and deadly criminal lifestyle. While the Department has implemented some 
programs in an attempt to disrupt this cycle, including even some that have been moderately 
successful, not enough is being done and we continue to lose too many of our youth to violent 
crime and incarceration. Police-centric programs also come with their own inherent limits, since 
once down a criminal path a certain distance, the individual becomes potentially unreachable this 
way. The response of adding more and more violent policing into the mix through reflexive 
annual police budget increases, without sufficiently addressing the underlying socio-economic 
risk factors, has allowed generations of young men (often Black) to fall into a life of crime that 
becomes difficult to rescue them and society from. 
 
Meanwhile, our very successful youth programs like the King Open Extended Day program 
remain shockingly underfunded and limited in scope, despite their demonstrated success and 
potential for assisting in the education and wellness of our youth. Many opportunities remain in 
our budget to better support young people, especially Black youth. With the final budget vote 
coming up on June 15, it is not too late for the council to call on the City Manager to better fund 
these programs and to reduce the police budget correspondingly. Specific areas to consider for 
increased funding include the many initiatives in the Human Services Department, our summer 
youth programs, the 
 program at CRLS, Project Elevate and other efforts to recruit more 
teachers of color, providing better mental health services for young people, and many other ideas 
that can and should be sourced from the community and those who have been historically most 
impacted by our racist and anti-Black approach to education and economic opportunity. 
 
Body Cameras 
 
The Cambridge Police Department does not currently use body cameras, although they have 
done other things to reduce incidents of excessive force. Body cameras can increase 
accountability by creating an objective video record of an incident from the perspective of the 
officer. While cell phone recordings of incidents have become prolific, body cameras can 
provide consistent footage that is more credible in a courtroom. They do come with significant 
privacy concerns, however, which must be addressed as part of any policy and implementation.  
 
I support the effort of my colleagues to move forward with a body camera program in the 
Cambridge Police Department. However, we should be cognizant of the fact that such a program

will ultimately have a limited impact, and to the extent that body cameras give us comfort in 
continuing to fund and expand traditional policing methods, they will be counterproductive to 
efforts of deeper and more transformative solutions.

an effective body camera policy. Key considerations from this guidance include: 

 extensive guidance on how to craft 

have provided

● The need to avoid continuous recording while at the same time blocking officers from 

selectively determining which encounters are filmed. Body cameras should not be used as 
general surveillance tools, but allowing for officer discretion undermines any benefit that 
the cameras might bring. Special consideration should also be given to encounters 
involving domestic violence and rape in order to protect the identity of the survivor. 

● The need to create consequences for noncompliance with body camera recording, 

including direct disciplinary action against the officer and the disallowment of verbal 
evidence in favor of the officer that otherwise could have been verified if the camera had 
been turned on, except in situations where the officer couldn’t reasonably have turned on 
the camera or where other verifiable forms of evidence exist. 

● The need to implement privacy considerations at the point of recording. The ACLU 

recommends limiting cameras to uniformed police officers and marked vehicles only, and 
requiring that officers notify people that they are being recorded. Additional 
consideration should be given to instances in which police officers enter someone’s 
home, particularly in non-exigent circumstances. 

● The need to incorporate policies related to retention and use. The ACLU recommends 
that retention periods should be measured in weeks not years, and policies should be 
clearly posted online. Careful thought should be given to who can flag a recording for 
further retention, and when they can do so.  

● The need to ensure that anyone recorded by a body camera can access and make copies of 

said recording for as long as it is retained by the department. 

● The need to regulate public disclosure, including redacting information to protect 

identities when possible. 

● The need to implement protocols and technological controls that prevent tampering or 

destruction of evidence by the department. 

● The need for explicit forbiddance of body camera use by government officials who do not 

have the authority to conduct searches and make arrests. 

 
Use of body cameras would fall under the Surveillance Ordinance, which

Police Use of Force Project

Use of Force Policy 
 
The version of the Use of Force Policy available online took effect in 2011 and was publicly 
released in 2015. The 
 is a helpful resource that the council can use as 
a starting point when analyzing our Use of Force Policy. This tool analyzes use of force policies 
from 91 of the hundred largest cities in the country, evaluating them across eight different 
metrics. As of 2016, none of the 91 cities had a policy that satisfied all eight of the criteria put 
forward by the project. The criteria are listed below, along with my analysis of how Cambridge’s 
policy measures up. I want to be clear that these eight criteria are by no means sufficient in my 
mind, and that a deeper and more radical analysis of the use of force policy is warranted in order 
to arrive at a satisfactory place.  
 

1. Does the policy require officers to de-escalate situations, when possible, before using 

No

. Cambridge’s policy does not even reference de-escalation. The policy only 

force? 
stipulates that the force must be 
uncomfortable amount of discretion to officers, and the policy should be modified to 
explicitly require de-escalation before using force whenever possible. 
 

. That wording gives an 

immediately necessary

2. Does the policy use a force continuum/matrix that defines/limits the type of force 

and/or weapons that can be used to respond to specific types of resistance? 
policy does not contain such a thing. It does define “lethal” and “less-than-lethal” 
weapons, but it doesn’t make it clear how and when to choose between them. Such a 
force continuum/matrix would clarify expectations for each type of interaction, and it 
would create more clear boundaries around when “lethal” and “less-than-lethal” weapons 
can be used. 
 

The 

No. 

3. Does the policy restrict chokeholds and strangleholds (including carotid restraints) 

Yes, 

 
The policy

does explicitly ban “carotid control or chokeholds”. Strangleholds are

not explicitly mentioned. However, it also includes a giant loophole, exempting “those 
types of manual holds for which a police officer has been specifically trained in gaining 
control or maintaining control of a detainee”. We need to better understand exactly which 
manual holds are currently considered permissible. Also, while it does say “Officers will 
not use any other type of manual holds that are intended or designed to inflict pain or 
injury”, I would prefer something more like “Officers shall not use any maneuver 
whatsoever that is intended or designed to inflict pain or injury”. Manual holds seems to 
refer specifically to the use of hands, which as we saw in the George Floyd case, can be

asphyxiate and kill someone. 

4. Does the policy require officers to give a verbal warning, when possible, before 

shooting

The policy states that “Where practical prior to discharging a 
No. 
​

using deadly force?
 
firearm, officers shall identify themselves as law enforcement officers and state their 
 of a suspected looter in Los 
intent to shoot.” As we saw in the recent deadly 
Angeles, this type of guidance does almost nothing at all. The officer pulled up in his 
vehicle and fired 5 shots through the windshield, striking and killing the suspect who was 
kneeling on the ground with his hands in the air. The officer had seen what looked like a 
possible butt of a handgun sticking out, which turned out to be a hammer. Presumably the 
officer in that situation did not think it was practical to announce his intent to shoot, and 
so he didn’t. Furthermore, deadly force is not limited to discharging a firearm, as we saw 
tragically in the cases of Eric Garner, George Floyd, and many other police killings that 
did not involve firing a weapon. 
 

5. Does the policy prohibit officers from shooting at people in moving vehicles, unless 
the person poses a deadly threat by means other than the vehicle (for example, 
Yes. 
shooting at people from the vehicle)? 
also prohibited from discharging a firearm at a moving vehicle, except when the 
occupants of the vehicle are using it to employ/exert deadly force against the officer or 
another victim..." 

The policy clearly states that "Officers are 

6. Does the policy require officers to exhaust all other reasonable alternatives before 

No. 

The policy states “Whether the degree of force 

resorting to using deadly force? 
used is reasonable depends upon the specific facts surrounding the situation. Only a 
reasonable and necessary amount of force may be used. The degree of force that the 
officer may reasonably be expected to use depends upon the amount of resistance, or the 
threat to safety that the situation presents." None of this indicates that other alternatives 
must be exhausted; rather, it reads more like support for a post-hoc analysis justifying the 
amount of force that was used. 

7. Does the policy require officers to intervene to stop another officer from using 

excessive force? 

No. 

The policy appears to be silent on this issue. 

8. Does the policy require comprehensive reporting that includes both uses of force 

and threats of force (for example, reporting instances where an officer threatens a 
The policy clearly states that “...any officer who points a 
civilian with a firearm)? 

Yes.

Comments on 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance Amendment 

TO: 
 
FROM:  
DATE:  
RE: 
 
 
Fellow Councillors: 
Coronavirus has created uncertainty that did not exist when the 2020 Cycling Safety Ordinance was first 
introduced. To respond to this uncertainty, Cambridge Bicycle Safety, the City Manager and City staff, 
and a number of City Councillors have worked jointly to prepare an amendment to the Ordinance’s 
original language, which has been circulated to Councillors by the City Clerk. 
The amendment: 

•  Adds a new category of bike lane, the “Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated 

Bicycle Lane,” to allow the City more flexibility in hitting the yearly bike lane goals. The 
City expressed concern that coronavirus will make public processes more difficult and that it does 
not want to install permanent bike lanes without adequate community engagement. “Temporary 
Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes” allow the City to install temporary bike lanes 
with traffic barrels that would count towards the City’s bike lane mileage requirements under the 
Ordinance as they long as the City installs flex posts or a permanent lane by the end of the 
applicable deadline for the street segment the temporary bike lane is installed on. 

•  Allows the City Manager, with City Council approval, to extend any deadline contained in 
the Ordinance due to coronavirus-related revenue shortfalls. If coronavirus makes any of the 
deadlines contained in the Ordinance impossible to meet due to revenue shortfalls, the City 
Manager can come before the Council by July 1, 2022 with proposed dates for an extension, 
which the Council will have to approve. 

•  Allows the City Manager, with City Council approval, to extend by up to four months the 
deadline for the completion of the city-wide protected network (see subsection C of the 
Ordinance) due to coronavirus-related public outreach activity delays. If coronavirus makes 
the deadline for the completion of the city-wide protected network impossible to meet due to 
public outreach activity delays, the City Manager can come before the Council by July 1, 2022 
and ask for an extension of up to four months, which the Council will have to approve.
