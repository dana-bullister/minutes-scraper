proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

          I'll start tonight by asking the staff to take 

Board member attendance and verify that all members are

there are five Planning Board members present.  I'll turn it 

back over to the Chair.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  The first item is 

an Update from the Community Development Department.  I'm 

not sure who's giving it, but whoever is presenting, please 

introduce the staff present at the meeting.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, Mary.  I'm going to assume 

that that's me again.  So here I am, Jeff Roberts, Director 

of Zoning and Development. And with me from the Zoning and 

Development Division Swaathi Joseph, Daniel Messplay, and 

Sarah Scott and Liza Paden. 

          Swaathi is, as usual, running the slides for this 

meeting.   

          We also have Iram Farooq, we'll be hearing from 

shortly, Assistant City Manager for Community Development; 

Khalil Mogassabi, the Deputy Director and Chief of Planning 

in our Department; and Erik Thorkildsen, urban designer in 

Community Development; and Adam Shulman from the Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation Department, all available to 

discuss the cases tonight. 

          Just as a quick update, the schedule coming ahead 

is a reminder.  I went over this last week.  Tonight we have

two special permit hearings.  They're cases that we received 

the applications for, back before the Planning Board 

meetings were on an unexpected hiatus. 

          On August 18, we have two additional -- we have 

one special permit hearing, 759 Massachusetts Avenue, an 

application for a cannabis retail store; and we have a 

public hearing on a zoning petition from the City Council 

regarding reporting on the use of fossil fuels for energy in 

buildings.   

          Those are both cases that we actually received the 

applications and petitions after we went on hiatus.  So 

we're starting to get into some newer cases. 

          And then on August 25, we actually have a 

continued case that the Planning Board had heard previously.  

It's a public hearing on a special permit case for 

development at 75 to 115 Smith Place.   

          There is no Planning Board meeting on September 1 

-- that's the state primary election.  There are some 

Ordinance Committee meetings coming up for the City Council.  

          August 19, the Ordinance Committee is having a 

continued hearing on the Affordable Housing Overlay, which 

the Planning Board heard last week. 

8

          And on August 26, the Ordinance Committee is 

having a public hearing on that fossil fuel zoning petition.  

          So Planning Board meetings will start up again in 

September, starting September 8, and we'll give an update a 

little bit later, once we have the hearing scheduled for 

those. 

          That's all for me, thanks.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  Do any members of 

the Board have questions for Jeff on the update?  If you do, 

please state your name and raise your hand.     

          [Pause]. 

          I don't see any.  Okay.   

                               * * * * * 

(6:42 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  H Theodore Cohen, Steven A. Cohen, Mary T. 

                  Flynn, Hugh Russell, and Nikolas Bowie           

          MARY FLYNN:  Hearing none, we'll move onto the 

next item, which is approval of meeting minutes.  The Board 

has not received any new transcripts, so there are none to 

approve this evening. 

           

          And that takes us to the first public hearing.

                  Flynn, Hugh Russell, and Nikolas Bowie             

          MARY FLYNN:  The next item on the agenda is a 

public hearing on Planning Board Special Permit Case PB 362, 

an application by the City of Cambridge to convert an 

existing building at 101 Rogers Street to a multipurpose 

center known as, "The Foundry." 

          CDD staff will begin by summarizing why this is 

before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  I'll just start by noting 

that this is a project review special permit.  This 

application requires a project review special permit for 

accommodation of a change of use in the existing building, 

plus new construction, totaling just over 50,000 square feet 

of gross floor area.   

          And it's also seeking special permit relief from a 

few other zoning requirements which are described in the 

application and in the CDD memo.  And I'm sure it will be 

covered in the applicant's presentation. 

          The Board's action will be to grant or deny the

requested special permits, and the applicable criteria for 

those special permits have been provided to the Board.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you Jeff.  The presenter 

this evening is Iram Farooq, on behalf of the city.  Before 

we start, let the record show that there are only five 

Planning Board members present for this hearing. And an 

affirmative vote of five members will be necessary to grant 

a special permit. 

          Iram and petitioners, are you prepared to respond 

-- I'm sorry, prepared to proceed with the five members?      

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Yes, we are 

prepared to proceed, recognizing that we will need 

affirmative votes from all of the members present today.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you.  If you would 

please introduce the project team and begin the 

presentation.  Thank you.           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you so much.  Good evening 

members of the Planning Board.  I'm normally here at 

Planning Board meetings in my capacity as the Head of 

Community Development, but today I am before you in my 

capacity as the Assistant City Manager.

quarterbacking this project for the City Manager's office.  

She is out this week, and was not able to be at this 

meeting.  And so, the City Manager has asked me to fill in 

to introduce the project. 

          I do want to introduce, before we move forward, 

that along with me are Tom Evans from the Cambridge Street 

Development Authority, which is our partner in this project; 

and our architect and design team, led by Stefanie 

Greenfield from CambridgeSeven Associates.   

          So back to the project, some of you might recall 

that the city received the building at 100 Rogers Street as 

part of the community benefits package negotiated during the 

Alexandria Rezoning of 2009.   

          The zoning requires that a minimum of 10,000 

square feet of the building's GFA be dedicated to community 

uses, such as educational, cultural or other institutional 

uses.   

          The Foundry is a brick and timber frame industrial 

building built in 1990, and after the city received the 

building from Alexandria, based on interest from the 

community, landmarking proceedings were initiated by the 

Historical Commission.

          And the building is now a designated historic 

landmark, representing the industrial history of East 

Cambridge. 

          Ever since the city -- the parcel was transferred 

to the city approximately 2013 or so, we started having 

conversations in the community about future use of the 

building, that have then segued into conversations about the 

design and so forth.  So there has been extensive years of 

community process related to the building and it's design. 

          So the project before you, then, is an adaptive 

reuse of the building to repurpose it into a creative, 

innovative and collaborative, multipurpose center.  And when 

it's completed, it will provide both community space and 

programming for art, for entrepreneurship, technology and 

for workforce education. 

          And then combined with that, those community uses 

will be market-rate and some community-supported sort of 

non-profit space in the rest of the building.  That is 

operationally going to support the community uses.  There is 

also a theater in the building. 

          The city owns the building now, and is responsible 

for design and construction.  About five or six years ago,

the city entered into a long-term agreement with the 

Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, so that they would 

operate the building. 

          The city has made a significant -- and the CRA -- 

have made significant investments in the building, and the 

city has committed 29 million dollars to the design and 

reconstruction of the building.   

          CRA has dedicated $7 million dollars to that end, 

and in addition the CRA is also committing $2 million 

dollars to initial operations, and as the operational 

reserve to the building. 

agencies in this building. 

          So there's a lot of investment from multiple city 

          I will say that we have had a very productive 

partnership with the CRA.  It's been really, really a good 

and positive partnership, and we feel that together we have 

developed plans for construction and operation of a building 

that will be a true community asset, combined with the 

Rogers Street Park, which is really almost across the street 

from this building. 

          We will create a cluster of community uses that 

will be a real asset, not just for the East Cambridge

neighborhood, but for the city as a whole. 

          So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tom 

Evans, Executive Director of the Cambridge Redevelopment 

Authority.  Tom?   

          TOM EVANS:  Thank you, Iram.  Once again, I'm Tom 

Evans, Executive Director of the Cambridge Residents 

Alliance.  I am joined at this meeting tonight by CRA Board 

Chair Cathy Borne, her Vice Chair Conrad Crawford, and Board 

member Barry Zevin [phonetic], along with our Foundry 

Project Manager, Erika Schwartz. 

          The CRA first came before the Planning Board to 

discuss the Foundry almost six years ago, when the city and 

CRA were just beginning to enter into our formal partnership 

to facilitate the revitalization of 101 Rogers Street. And 

that was through the adoption of the Foundry Demonstration 

Project Plan. 

          The initial Demonstration Plan was put together 

after a significant amount of community discussions about 

what the city was to do with the building, and how best to 

go beyond the requirements of zoning to create a building 

that provides many community beneficial uses as possible. 

          Over the years, since the original Demonstration

Plan was adopted, the city -- the CRA and its partners, both 

design partners and program partners -- have continued 

multiple cycles of community conversations in various forms 

to arrive at this point this evening. 

          While I'll let CambridgeSeven - Stefanie will take 

you through the building and discuss the physical 

redevelopment plans, I wanted to first take a moment to 

outline the reason why we're here, and why the city is 

making the significant investment. 

          And I thought the easiest way to start was to 

craft -- to read to you our well-crafted mission for the 

building that evolved through all the community conversation 

we've had over the past six or seven years.   

          The Foundry is to be an adaptive reuse project to 

build a self-sustaining center for creativity and 

collaboration for the Cambridge community.  It sits at the 

intersection of the Kendall Square Innovation District and 

the East Cambridge Neighborhood.   

          And the Foundry building will provide space and 

programs for visual and performing arts, entrepreneurship, 

technology, and workforce education within a historic, 

industrial setting.

          The Foundry will also help facilitate access for 

residents, especially underrepresented communities and 

adjacent neighborhoods to the dynamic working and learning 

environment of Kendall Square. 

          The how of how we will implement this mission is 

also quite unique, much like the building's architecture.  

It is a private collaboration between the city and CRA and 

our non-profit partners.  First off, beginning with a master 

lease between the CRA and the city. 

          The first-floor of the building is dedicated to 

community uses, fully accessible to the public.  We like to 

think of it much, as Iram mentioned, as a partner with 

Rogers Park at Tim Toomey Park, as public realm on both 

sides of Third Street. 

          And the goal is for -- in serving that mission -- 

to make the building feel as welcome to as broad a sector of 

the community as possible. 

          A portion of the second building is also dedicated 

to additional community uses. 

          And then the balance of the building around 40 

percent of the usable square footage provides small and 

medium-scale office space that we believe has actually been

kind of a difficult thing to find in Kendall Square and 

serves its own economic development niche.   

          And those office leases will provide the majority 

of the operational funds needed to keep the building 

running, such that 60 percent of the building -- the 

majority of the buildings that is servicing arts, education, 

workspace and meetings for the community can be provided at 

low cost on a sliding scale to the community and non-profit 

groups. 

          The CRA is not taking on the operation of the 

building directly, but through our partnership with the 

Foundry Consortium.   

          The Consortium came together in response to an 

Operator RP that was issued by the CRA in 2018.  The 

operator is expected to facilitate three major roles for the 

building to curate the program to provide outreach and 

property management, along with assistance in tenant 

recruitment. 

          As the name implies, the Foundry Consortium was 

formed as a collection of groups and individuals that were 

all interested in facilitating the mission of the Foundry. 

          The Consortium, which is led by MIT and Lesley

University in its initial formation has now become a formal 

501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and we're working with 

them to build up its staff and its operating capacity, so 

that it can meet the community expectation for the Founder's 

opening, which we see opening day in 2022. 

          The Foundry Consortium will ensure that the 

Foundry becomes a collaborative and thriving innovation 

space that serves the visual and performing arts, and 

entrepreneurship and technology and workforce education for 

all the Cambridge community. 

          The CRA's role is to really assist the Consortium 

to bring the Foundry to financial stability and to provide a 

backstop against future financial challenges and assisting 

the community outreach efforts. 

          Part of that is that the CRA facilitates the 

continued work of the city's Foundry Advisory Committee, 

which is the community formed by the Demonstration Plan and 

the master lease with the city.   

          And the Foundry Advisory Committee has 

representative from both the East Cambridge community, other 

neighborhoods around the area, and the multiple disciplines 

of art and education programs that we anticipate will make

the Foundry their home. 

          Together, the Foundry Consortium, the city and the 

CRA seek your approval of the special permit application 

tonight, so that we can transition the years of planning and 

design into the implementation of an inspirational center 

for community collaboration in East Cambridge. 

          I will now pass along the virtual microphone icon 

to Stefanie Greenfield now, from CambridgeSeven, who will 

walk you through the building and it's design, and how that 

design meets the program discussed above. 

          Afterwards, I look forward to fielding your 

questions about the program and its planned operations.  But 

first I'll let Stefanie walk through the visuals. Thank you.  

          STEFANIE GREENFIED:  Thank you, Tom.  We can go to 

the next slide.  I am Stefanie Greenfield, Principal in 

Charge at CambridgeSeven, and I am joined today with the 

Project Manager, Justin Crane, Danielle McDonough, our 

Project Architect; and also, Mikyoung Kim is our landscape 

architect.  She's going to make a short presentation at the 

end, and she's with Jess Hamilton from her firm. 

          And then we also have our Traffic Engineer from 

BHB here, Christina Hodge, if there are questions at the end

that need addressing. 

          So I'd like to take 10 minutes, go very quickly 

through the design process. And as you can tell from this 

presentation, this is a labor of love and lots and lots of 

community meetings, lots of outreach, neighborhood 

conversations to come up with this program that you see here 

on the left:  Workshops, multipurpose rooms, performance 

space, the dance studio, and art studio, a cooking lab, a 

café, a community hall, office space and support areas. 

          And you can see the historic image on the right.  

All of this programmatic use had to fit into a beautiful, 

historic building that needed a lot of love and care from 

the industrial turn of the century. 

          So next slide please?   

          As we talked about, this is a community-driven 

project.  And you can see the red circle here is the Foundry 

building. And once the Third Street apartment building got 

built, the Foundry building found itself kind of nestled 

into Roger Street. 

          And so, our task as architects and designers and 

this whole team has really been, "How do we celebrate the 

architecture of this building, but also bring people in -- 

21

draw people in?"   

          The goal has always been on this view of East 

Cambridge, "How do we get residents to be able to migrate 

easily in and out of the building?"  And all along, that has 

been the goal of how to make this a real community hub. 

          I will say as a historic building, the Cambridge 

Historical Commission designated the building a landmark in 

2018.  So they've been working really closely with Charlie 

Sullivan and his team on the best way to adaptively reuse 

this building. 

          Next slide? 

          So the plan now, you can see Rogers Street is on 

the left here, and Third Street is on the lower part of the 

screen.  I don't know if you can see my cursor -- can you 

see my cursor? Or not.   

          So this outline in red that you're seeing is what 

we call the project limit lines.  We are creating a 

community street on Rogers Street, and we will talk about 

that with the landscape plan.   

          But as you can see, the existing plan of this 

building had parking in the front yard.  It had an addition 

in the '80s, a portal that was put on the front door that

was entry portal. 

          And so, over time this had been a building for 

Foundry uses, but over time it had been an automotive body 

part shop.  And then in the 1980s a developer came in and 

inserted three floors and turned it into an office building. 

          Next slide? 

          So the removals plan includes taking off the 1980s 

foyer and taking off the furnace building at the back on the 

Verizon side of the parking lot, because it's seismically 

unsound. 

          And the new plan, which is the next slide, is we 

are proposing a three-story addition on the Verizon side of 

the building, and then adaptively reusing all the historic 

parts of the building, really preserving the ridgeline of 

the building, preserving the side portions of the building, 

and then creating a really fun outdoor, useable space. 

          So the total square footage is 50,200 square feet. 

And our special permit is requiring side yard setback 

requirements, parking requirements, and two other items for 

the performance space, and a special permit for the building 

size. 

          Next slide?

          So this was our design inspiration.  This was the 

existing interior of the original erecting hall.   

          These are from the Historical Commissions 

research, but this really excited us, when we saw this image 

of what the building had originally looked like with the 

wood truss support, the steel gantry -- just a vibrant 

interior space that when we found the building -- 

          Next slide? 

          -- this is what the building looked like.  All 

those open spaces had been inserted in the 1980s with new 

floors. And a parking garage was sort of dug out of the 

basement, and the ground-floor had been raised five feet. 

          So there was no ADA -- there was no universal 

access to the building.  It's very challenging just to get 

in and out of the current building. 

          Next slide?   

          So our plan was to remove all the floors, which 

obviously have other seismic conditions and other problems 

with them.  So we removed all the -- the idea is to remove 

all the floors and expose the historic timber. 

          Next slide? 

          To put in a new floor, which aligns with the 

ground floor for barrier-free access, so everyone can enter 

24

at the same level. 

          And next slide? 

          And then in order to get this program square 

footage to fit in here.  We are inserting a new system of 

steel frames that have become the architectural language of 

the building.   

          On the left, you can see where the new three-story 

addition is going.  And then inserted into this wood frame 

and wood timber structure, we are putting these steel floors 

in, and then expressing through this interior hall a new 

community hall space. 

          Next slide? 

          And this is a concept image of what that community 

space will feel like with all these program elements with 

windows into each space, easy access and visibility to all 

the existing programming that’s going to happen in the 

building, and two floors above of the retail space that -- 

rental space that Tom spoke of. 

          Next slide?  So I'm just going to walk you through 

the ground-floor plan.  And you can see Rogers Street here 

is on the left, and the yard and Bent Street is on the

right.  The two stars represent egress for the building.  

Guests will be allowed to come in off Rogers Street and off 

the side yard to invite the public to come from East 

Cambridge and from Binney Street and from Rogers Street.   

          And you can see the area in gray is the new 

addition, that's where we're really putting two means of 

egress, all the code upgrades for the transformer hall, 

restrooms, and the elevator.   

          And we really wanted to keep the elevator out of 

the main spine of the building, because we didn't want to 

interrupt the Ridgeline of the historic building.   

          So by putting on this addition, it allowed us to 

get all the code requirements we needed for the building in 

a thoughtful container, and also, put a penthouse and 

mechanical equipment on that new roof.  So we don't touch 

the ridgeline of the historic building.   

          Everything in blue that you're seeing is public 

space.  You're seeing all the workshops on the left, you're 

seeing this large, yellow space is our community celebratory 

hall.  At the end on the far right, you can see the 

performance space. 

          And then there's a series of rooms and classrooms

that are going to face the yard plan south here that we will 

open up all the windows on that yard side to allow 

visibility for all the activities happening in the building. 

          Next slide?  This is a section diagram showing 

that concept.  Again, in yellow you can see the community 

hall, that soaring space that really inspired us and we'll 

be able to expose the historic trusses, and then inserting 

in blue all the program space and the potential for rental 

space.   

          And then in gray the transformer hall on the side 

of the building that faces the horizon of the building. 

          And you can see we're really keeping the ridgeline 

intact and, as we said before, the addition is meant to not 

interrupt that historic structure. 

          Next slide? 

          This is an overall site plan that shows -- again, 

I kind of want to focus a little bit on traffic and parking 

on this diagram.   

          So I know questions have come up about the events 

that are going to happen in the theater.  And these are -- 

the idea is this is a walk-in community.  We are providing 

two ADA spaces on Rogers Street.  We will have two-way 

27

traffic on Rogers Street.   

          But the notion -- and we work very closely with 

Cathy Watkins (phonetic) and her team about creating a 

shared street that's very clear where the car goes, where 

the bike goes, where the drop-off zone is right in front of 

the front door at Rogers Street, but also making it playful 

enough that people can migrate from the Rogers Park on the 

right here down this street and have an interactive 

expression.   

          There will be opportunity.  There's three to five 

parking garages that have commercial spaces, so there'll be 

up to 100 to 300 spaces that could be open for use, if 

people need parking for theater use.  And we are providing 

11 long-term bike areas and 14 short-term bike areas. 

          We are within a 10-minute walking radius from 

public transportation -- and again, it's in a walking 

neighborhood.   

          Next slide?   

          The next four slides just show very carefully how 

we worked with the Historical Commission to really celebrate 

and bring back what had been here.  I'm not showing you 

what's here now.  I'm just showing you what we envision the

building to look like.  There are no existing condition 

drawings of this building.   

          So everything we did was to work really closely 

with photographs.  Danielle and Justin and I worked very 

closely looking at every nook and crannies of photos to gain 

clues and really work closely with Charlie, very close with 

him, to come up with this restoration. 

          So we will have -- the windows will all be 

replaced, and you can see here this is a view facing Rogers 

Street at the gable end, and on the left is our loading 

area, and the new addition with a metal-clad panel.  And you 

can see the penthouse over on the top is concealing our 

mechanical equipment.  We worked very closely with the 

acoustic engineers on how high that screen wall needed to 

be. 

          Next slide?   

          This is the Bent Street elevation, and this is 

also where the theater door will be.  And on the right, you 

can see we're very tight to the property line, and you can 

see this is the back side of our new addition. 

          Next slide? 

          This is the yard side, and formerly -- I don't

know how well you know the site, but all these windows are 

closed up right now, so the project is opening up all the 

windows in this elevation, taking that whole clear story, 

putting in all new windows there that have the 1980s windows 

in them, and really just trying to bring life back into this 

and industrial building.  We will have solar panels.   

          Next slide?  

          And this is the west elevation that faces the 

Verizon parking lot.  We're using a metal panel wall system, 

and you will see in the next slides of our renderings sort 

of the coloration of that.   

          But really, it's -- we're right on the property 

line, so we need to really maintain their openings for the 

windows.  They have very -- the building code required very 

strict requirements for this percentage of opening on the 

property line. 

          Next slide? 

          So this is what the building looks like today.  

And I know questions have come up about that giant structure 

in the background.  That is the Verizon building looming in 

the background there.  In the foreground is our 200-foot 

long main space, and then the 1980s addition is on the front

of the building.  Next slide? 

          So this is our artist's rendering of our vision 

for what the space could look like.  And you can see in 

white in the back that's the Verizon building, that's not 

our building that is trying to be sympathetic to an existing 

condition, but that's not part of the project. 

          We are restoring the brick.  We are putting on an 

exuberant entry portal that's a little bit sculptural.  The 

use of the grass coloration hearkens to the metalsmithing 

that happened on this industrial campus.  There was brass 

metalworking.  And so, it's not to the kind of industrial 

spirit that was here.   

          Next slide? 

          This is a view towards the furnace structure right 

now from the Verizon side of Rogers Street, looking for the 

Rogers Park.  And you can see that furnace building in white 

is what was structurally needed work.   

          Next slide? 

          And this is our rendition of the new addition, 

which is home now to a large transformer hall that needs to 

be closed -- enclosed.  And then levels two and three on 

this addition you can see areas for rental space.

          We have been very sensitive to how the new 

building and the old building meet.  We have created a very 

elegant zipper kind of detail, which is a metal channel that 

runs up between the two buildings.  So that's a detail we 

worked really closely with Charlie as well. 

          Next slide?   

          And you can see here the last view of Bent Street.  

This metal wall is the property line.  So we're right up 

against the property line, and it really is a party wall.   

          So the next slide I believe is the landscape plan, 

so I'd like to introduce Mikyoung Kim to just talk about 

some of these outdoor rooms. 

          MIKYOUNG KIM:  Hi.  Thanks, Stefanie.  So we've 

been working closely with CambridgeSeven on this project, 

and we're -- you know, pleased to be here today.  I think 

we're -- really these are kind of very slender, thin, 

streetscapes that we tried to kind of make into a community 

street, a place where people could be drawn into the 

building.   

          But also, Stefanie had mentioned the yard.  So 

Rogers street is on your left.  And you might recall from 

the previous slide that there's a kind of paving pattern 

32

that we designed to kind of draw people towards the front 

door, and to that sculptural kind of intervention. 

          But also, there's this rectangular site that's 

purely pedestrian, and it has -- we've done two things.  One 

is that in the everyday condition we've kind of broken it 

down into a series of rectangular square rooms that are -- 

that correspond with the building on the interior.  And so, 

there's a community table where everyone could have a seat 

at the table.  There's a place where you can park your bike.  

There's some high-top tables and some kind of garden areas.  

But all of these have a kind of flexibility that when you 

have a mid-size event, you can also kind of clear this area 

out, and there can be larger activity that happens here 

          Both on Bent Street and Rogers Street, we wanted 

to really make this a green statement, and make it a kind of 

community garden when you enter these buildings.  And so, 

you know, I think that the two streets give the entry an 

identity. 

          We worked closely with the city and with 

CambridgeSeven to understand the parameters that we're 

working within.  Stefanie mentioned the kind of number of 

bikes parking that we have, and vehicular parking.  And so,

I believe that I am the last slide, Stefanie.  And I want to 

just kind of go through this briefly.  And I'm happy to 

answer any questions.  Jess Hamilton from my office, who's 

the Project Manager, who can also kind of get granular and 

answer more questions if needed.                        

          STEFANIE GREENFIED:  Great.  Next slide? So now 

we're just going to open up to a discussion, because I 

talked a lot.  But I'm going to moderate who the question 

should go to if you do have any design questions.            

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thanks, Stefanie.  Madam Chair, that 

brings us to the conclusion of our presentation today.   

          I just wanted to say that I neglected to introduce 

somebody really important at the start, and that's Rob 

Gardner, who is the city's Project Manager for this 

building.   

          One of the things that Rob does is make sure that 

everybody is on task and on schedule, and I did that -- that 

reminds me that COVID has actually impacted our timing of 

coming before the Board for this hearing and the city's CRA. 

          And we're really anxious to begin construction and 

minimize any future delays, so that this building, this 

great community asset, can be open and available to the

Cambridge community as early in 2021 as planned.   

          So I'll just conclude our presentation by 

requesting on behalf of the City Manager the Planning 

Board's favorable consideration and approval of the special 

permits requested for the Foundry project.  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Iram and to the whole 

team.  That was a very detailed presentation.  Thank you for 

it.  We are not going to do discussion right now.  Starting 

last week, we tried a new format where we went directly to 

public comment after the presentation.  And so, we're going 

to do that again this week, and then we'll come back to talk 

to the proponent more.   

          So, as I mentioned, this is a public hearing, and 

right now is the time for any member of the public who 

wishes to speak to click the button at -- I believe it's at 

the bottom of your screen -- that says, "Raise hand."  If 

you're calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by 

pressing *9. 

          And while people are doing that, I'll also note 

that as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board received written 

communications from Dedra Tao (phonetic), Daniel A Egan 

(phonetic) on behalf of Equity Residential, and C.A. Webb

(phonetic) on behalf of the Kendall Square Association.  

Additional written communications received after 5:00 p.m. 

yesterday will also be entered into the record. 

          So let's see.  So there are a few hands, and there 

may be more going up.  So at this point, I'll ask staff to 

unmute the speakers one at a time.  You should begin by 

saying your name and address, and staff will confirm that we 

can hear you. 

          After that, you will have up to three minutes to 

speak before I ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  So this is Jeff 

Roberts with Community Development.  I'm going to control 

the muting and unmuting and speakers, and I'll read the 

names.  So I'm going to -- I see some hands kind of continue 

to go up.  So I'm just going to say the speaker, and then 

the next speaker, so that you know -- so that you're ready 

to go next.  

          The first speaker is Dan Marshall, followed by 

Stephanie Couch (phonetic).  Dan Marshall, at this point you 

can start by saying your name and address.    

          DAN MARSHALL:  Hi, Dan Marshall of the Cambridge 

Community Center for the Arts in Canal District Kendall.

And I'm a huge fan of this project, and the more I see of 

it, the more I like it.   

          To me, the most positive and impressive portion 

here, other than the first thing it's really grassroots 

collaboration between community members, arts 

administrators, financiers -- everybody in a municipality in 

a very, very collaborative spirit that this project has 

obviously been designed very, very flexibly.   

          It combines the past, the history, as well as 

modern amenities.  It's really welcoming every time I look 

at the new rendering it's extremely evocative to me as an 

artist and as well as a person who does some community 

development and industrial redevelopment.  So every time I 

see a project like this, I'm extra inspired.   

          But this one is special, because it allows for 

evolution over time.  It allows for flexibility.  It has a 

welcoming nature to it.  It's open, but it's also 

introducing to you all the other aspects of the building all 

at the same time.  You walk through, you see everything at 

the same time. 

          And they really thought about how to best 

apportion the spaces in a way that they're going to be able

to collaborate with each other, but they're also going to be 

able to stay multipurpose and flexible.   

          You know, the way things go is if you let the 

community embrace a project, they will bring to you the art 

or the education or the different components that they'd 

like to see most as the years progress. 

          And I feel that this diversely designed and 

beautiful building and the fact that it's well-funded, well-

structured, has a great Board of advisors, and, you know, 

through and through is going to be a great success.   

          All support for it.  I don't see any negatives 

whatsoever, and if anything every time I get surprised by 

all the positives and all the new things I learned about it.  

So big round of applause.   

          [Rooster cawing] I hope that you approve this 

project.  Doesn't seem that they're asking for anything 

unreasonable and it's a great addition to our community.  

Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker is 

Stephanie Couch, followed by Marie Elena Saccoccio 

(phonetic). Stephanie Couch, you can unmute yourself and 

give your name and address, please.

          STEPHANIE COUCH:  Hi, this is Stephanie Couch.  I 

live at 10 Rogers Street.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We can hear you, go ahead.   

          STEPHANIE COUCH:  Okay, great.  So as you heard 

earlier, this has taken a long time.  I feel like a relative 

newcomer when we put together a proposal for community 

residents to have the Foundry consortium be the operator of 

the building when it opens.   

          I am President of the Board of the Nonprofit and 

we -- you know, every day try to make sure that we are 

involving residents of this community and shaping the path 

forward.  

          What I'd like to say is, please let's not make 

perfection the enemy of the good.  It is time to move 

forward.  It's time to get this building built, and the 

doors open.   

          The recommendations before you, there are many 

that seem very reasonable, but I am concerned about the 

recommendation to relocate the elevator.  You wouldn't 

believe how many times we've gone through this design; how 

many hours have been spent with different models.   

          And I think we've arrived at something that is as

it's going to get, and I really would hate to open up 

another can of worms that could cause further delay.  So I 

encourage you not to go down that path. 

          And then there are some concerns about possibly 

putting restrictions on the theater use, and I just -- again 

-- would respectfully request that you not do that as a 

Planning Board.  There are plenty of other mechanisms for 

public accountability to make sure that the consortium is 

stewarding the use of the building in a way that is 

responsive to the need of neighborhood residents and the 

community as a whole.   

          For example, the existence of the Foundry Advisory 

Committee, whom we must report to and share metrics with and 

will be consulting with.  And there's also the possibility 

for putting guidance and restrictions through the agreement 

we would have with the CRA to operate the building.   

          So there's other mechanisms if problems arise, and 

it would be a shame to tie our hands at the get go in this 

way with the use conditions associated with the step and the 

progress.   

          So I thank you for your thoughtfulness in the 

recommendations that have been brought before you, but would

respectfully request that on those two items that you take 

these concerns into account. 

          But anyway, a big thank you to everyone.  This is 

a real asset.  And as a resident here, I feel so grateful to 

be in a city like Cambridge that provides these kinds of 

amenities and public benefits for our community, I know it 

will really help a lot of us, who need a neighborhood.  

Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  Next is Marie Elena 

Saccoccio, followed by Steven Gardiner. Marie Elena 

Saccoccio, you can unmute yourself and begin, thanks. 

          MARIE ELENA SACCOCCIO:  Okay, Marie Elena 

Saccoccio.  I live at 55 Otis Street in Cambridge.  I'm 

fourth generation East Cambridge, and I served on the 

Foundry Advisory Committee.  And I have to support what 

Stephanie has just presented.  Essentially, you know, it's 

time to go forward. 

          I only have two comments.  It's very hard from the 

diagrams to understand how large that side yard really is.  

And we had always discussed among the Foundry Advisory 

Committee anyway the great usefulness, because you could 

essentially increase your square footage by openings into

the yard.   

          I was on site last week, and I asked about it, and 

I was told that there were three openings, there were three 

doors, which I didn't see on the diagrams that we were 

given.  And tonight it appears that there's only one door.  

          The other thing is that part of the mission 

statement even presented to the Planning Board specifically 

says, "Operable Windows."  Not that everyone wants every 

window to open, but especially now, post COVID it becomes -- 

you know, a really, really important criteria for windows to 

be operable.   

          And especially since they're rebricked now, and 

they're going to do reproductions, I assume -- they are 

really lovely reproductions, even if just the top light 

opens.  You could get incredible cross-ventilation in that 

building.   

          So essentially, I love what they presented.  I 

would want to see openings to that yard, because that side 

yard is immense.  And without adequate openings, it's really 

not going to be useable.  Thank you very much.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Steven 

Gardiner, followed by Phyllis Bretholtz.  Steven Gardiner,

you can start by giving your name and address.   

          STEVEN GARDINER:  My name is Steven Gardiner.  I 

live at 29 Otis Street.  I have been on the Consortium's 

gathering from the early stages, led very capably by Lesley 

University and Stephanie Couch at MIT. 

          We've spent this evening getting quite an 

extraordinary presentation of the adaptive reuse of this 

building as an important asset, uniquely situated between 

the residential community of East Cambridge where I live, 

and the vibrant Kendall Square community. 

          But I wanted simply to add, because I have no 

objections with what's being designed.  I certainly endorse 

the qualifications that Stephanie Couch has made.  But I 

also wanted to emphasize for the Planning Board the 

importance of this building and what it is providing for the 

larger Cambridge community. 

          As you noted, the renderings present this 

extraordinary high vibrant interior.  Nonetheless, it's 

still relatively small, given what we're trying to 

accomplish in operating that for the community.  What we 

have designed as a way of implementing this plan is to 

actually make this as a focal point for other activities

elsewhere around Cambridge.   

          Not everything will happen exclusively in this 

building.  We will link to other community centers, other 

assets around Cambridge, other community groups around 

Cambridge, to use this really as a hub of activity. 

          So the programming will change as necessary to 

engage for the community.  This isn't simply for East 

Cambridge and the Kendall Square community; this is for 

Cambridge as a whole.  It's an extraordinary gem.  It's an 

incredible commitment on the part of the city and the 

Community Redevelopment Authority to support this.  It will 

be a wonderful asset, and I look forward to the Board to 

approve it.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The next speaker is Phyllis 

Bretholtz, followed by Heather Hoffman.  Phyllis Bretholtz, 

you can unmute yourself and begin.     

          [Pause]  

          If you're speaking, you're still on mute.  So if 

you could unmute yourself.  If you're on telephone, you 

unmute yourself by pushing *6.  Of if you're on Zoom, you 

can push the button to unmute.

          Just giving you a second.  We still can't hear 

Phyllis Bretholtz.  I am going to move to the next speaker 

at this time, and I can come back.  I believe it's Heather 

Hoffman by telephone.  You can begin.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Hello, Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  And I would like to recognize all of the 

people who got us to this point.  Some of the people here 

might not know that back when this building first was 

offered to the city, the then City Manager did not want it, 

and looked for ways to get rid of it.   

          And community members including Ilan Levy and 

Marie Saccoccio worked really hard to change that.  And it 

has changed.  And I'm really excited.  This is something 

that the city deserves, that the community deserves, and I'm 

not going to quibble about anything.   

          I think you should look at the specific things 

that Marie mentioned, because I know that she has paid way 

more attention than I have to details like this, and those 

don't sound like huge things that should get in the way of 

having this move forward. 

          I hope that when it's built, we'll actually be 

able to use it.  Thank you.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So before I go back to Phyllis 

Bretholtz to see if Phyllis has been able to unmute, at this 

time, that's the last hand that's raised.   

          So if at this time you still want to speak and you 

haven't spoken yet, please push the, "Raise hand" button, or 

if you're by telephone, you can push *9 on your telephone or 

push the, "Raise hand" button. 

          Once again, Phyllis Bretholtz, if you can -- 

unfortunately, I've allowed you to speak, but I can't unmute 

you.  So you'll need to, if you're tuned in, find the unmute 

button or press *6 if you're on a telephone.     

          [Pause]  

          So I still can't hear, so I'm going to -- there's 

a few more speakers now, so I'm going to go back and I'll 

circle around back if we can get that resolved.   

          So Jamie Sabino is the next speaker, followed by 

Ilan Levy.  And I just -- Jamie Sabino, you can begin by 

giving your name and address. 

          JAMIE SABINO:  Hi, my name is Jamie Sabino.  I 

live at 54 Western Avenue in Cambridge, and I'm a member of 

the Foundry Advisory Committee, and I've been a member of it 

since the creation.  And I just wanted to do two brief

things.   

          One is when we started this, I was skeptical that 

we could come up with a building design and people who run 

it that could really do as many different things as people 

wanted.  And we certainly can't do everything, but I think 

this is an exciting, flexible proposal that will meet many 

of the needs. 

          I also want to urge to be careful about 

restrictions in this case, particularly about the theater.  

Scheduling of theater is very complicated.  Over the last 

few years, people have reached out to a lot of theater 

people in Cambridge.   

          I think you may want a Theater Advisory Committee 

just on that issue, but not put in restrictions at this 

point and leave them that flexibility.  Because we can't 

plan for two weeks from now, never mind a year from now.  

Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the next speaker is Ilan Levy.  

You can begin giving your name and address, please?          

          ILAN LEVY:  Yeah, Ilan Levy -- 148 Spring Street.  

So I'll start by -- the thing I'm a little bit frustrated 

about, but I'll keep it really short, because there's many 

47

things to be happy about.   

          The one particular thing that I'm frustrated about 

is the use of the yard and the windows, which look like a 

park that cannot be used, as it was designed early on.  I 

think in the first iteration when I went to the meeting of 

the CRA to see how things were developing, the windows were 

an entire part of the space that were going to exist inside, 

kind of an extension, as stated by Marie. 

          And if you open them, it could give a space 

outdoors to do creative things.  And right now, the use of 

the outdoor space seems like very limited in the 

possibilities. 

          And considering the very little amount of space 

that is given to the common space, only half of the 

building, even if that's enough already for some, I don't 

think it's as much as it should be, I think that the outside 

should be -- there should be another vision for that 

terrace.  I think really there's a rethink that's needed 

          You know, I don't think it's a showstopper, but I 

really think it should be reconsidered in a way that expands 

there.   

the inside.

          And on top of that, considering COVID, where open 

space is the place where we can actually be together with a 

very low incidence of transmission, it's almost amazing that 

actually we've closed up the space.   

          But I don't know -- I know that it's not in 

reaction to the COVID that it was don't even prior, but I 

think that it's new times, we have to think differently, and 

we have to take that extra money the city is not able to 

give the money for that.   

          We really have to think about that, because I 

think it's a health issue and an important need in order to 

keep the space viable for the long-term future.   

          Now that I've said my piece on that side, I would 

like to give my appreciation to everyone who has 

participated in this project since 2011, 2012, when this 

came into the city.    

          I know there's been a lot of frustration, a lot of 

ups and downs, and we've argued a lot about a lot of 

different things, but I think that where we are now is 

pretty amazing. 

          And I'm hoping that we are going to see the dreams 

of all the participants materialize in this building, and

that it's going to live up to the expectation and the vision 

that we have put forward for it. 

          I want to give a shout out to my fellow neighbor 

(sic), Edward, Marie, Chuck -- all of the residents of East 

Cambridge who in one way or another have participated -- all 

of the residents of Cambridge in general, who have 

participated -- the people who first came at the Foundry 

creation in 2013.   

          And I'm really hoping that after the approval 

tonight, we'll see a project flourish in our neighborhood.  

And despite the fact that people say that it's for the 

entirety of Cambridge this building, I want to remind 

everybody that this was given as a benefit to East Cambridge 

itself for the expansion of the Alexandria development in 

2011.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And once again I'm going to let 

Phyllis Bretholtz try to speak, if you're tuned in, and you 

have your hand raised because you like to speak.  You still 

need to push the button that says, "Unmute" if you'd like to 

speak, or if you're on telephone, push *6 on your telephone 

to unmute yourself before speaking.       

          I'll give you just one -- a few more seconds to

try again, Phyllis Bretholtz.  If you'd like to speak, push, 

"Unmute" or *6 on your phone.  Unfortunately, I don't think 

it's working for this particular speaker.   

          I'll remind you and everyone here if you would 

like to submit written comments, they can be entered into 

the record.  You can e-mail Planning Board comments at 

cambridgema.gov.  I'll turn it back over to the Chair at 

this time.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you, Jeff.  Okay.  So 

that concludes the public comment portion of the hearing, 

with the exception of the written comments that Jeff just 

referred to.   

          So we're going to move now from public comment to 

Board discussion.  If the hearing is continued to a future 

date and additional information is received, there will be 

an opportunity for public comment on the additional 

materials.  And, as Jeff noted, additional written comments 

may also be submitted. 

          We also received memos on this application from 

Community Development Department and Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation Department staff, who are available to answer 

any questions you may have.  And we also received a memo

from the Department of Public Works. 

          So at this time, do any Planning Board members 

have questions for the applicant?  And if you do, please 

raise your hand online, or wave me down.   

          Hugh?  Hugh Russell?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have two questions on things that 

were brought up in the public testimony.  The first is part 

of the plans we received shows that every room on the first 

floor that faces the open space has a door in that room 

directly to the open space. It shows in plan, it shows an 

elevation. 

          I just want to confirm that that is in fact what's 

going to happen.  Because I think it's a good idea, and I 

think the speaker was correct. 

          The second is whether the windows are operable to 

allow for ventilation, or whether they're not operable.  So 

those are the questions.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Hugh.  Stephanie, would 

you like to respond to your team, or direct it to whoever is 

the appropriate person?                  

          STEFANIE GREENFIED:  I'm going to take the first 

half, which is the operable piece, and then I'm going to ask

Justin to talk about the windows.  There are doors and a 

large garage door that open onto the yard.  So there is 

ability to communicate in and out of the yard through these 

doors -- three doors and a large garage door on the yard 

side. 

          I also want to just say this is a public building.  

And we do need to be mindful of where people come in and 

come out of the building.   

          And that was a big part of the discussion about 

how you can operate a building where everyone wants to come 

in and have it very porous.  But we also have to have some 

sense of control over the front door and the side door. 

          So yes, there are doors to the yard.  I'm going to 

let Justin talk about the windows. 

          JUSTIN CRANE:  Sure Justin Crane with 

CambridgeSeven.  And I think maybe some of the confusion in 

the public comment had to do with we showed a red star in 

front of one of the doors from the yard.  And that is a main 

entrance, a vestibule.  But there are doors from 

multipurpose room -- from two multipurpose rooms and from 

the art room to the outside.  So in total there are actually 

four doors that go to the yard.

22

          As far as the windows in the design, they're not 

operable.   

          And a large -- part of the reason that we decided 

to do that was because it's easier to manage energy use in 

the building, it was a more energy efficient decision, 

especially in a building that's used by so many different 

users.  It also increases the security of the equipment 

that’s inside of the building. 

          In regard to the concerns about COVID, I would 

like to suggest that being able to open windows is only 

helpful if the air is circulating properly.   

          And circulating the air properly is something that 

we do with the mechanical systems.  So we have once through 

outdoor air ventilation, so that outdoor air ventilation as 

the building is used is circulated only once through a 

space. 

          The public spaces -- the rooms in the public 

spaces -- are each contained.  So there's not air traveling 

from one of those rooms to the other. And then we have high 

levels of filtration on the mechanical system.  We're 

looking at using MERV 13, which is a hospital grade filter 

in the mechanical systems.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Hugh, does that answer your question?         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah, those are satisfactory

answers to me.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Very good.  Are any other Board 

members who have questions at this time?  I'm not seeing 

any.  Okay.  So I do have -- I do have a couple myself, and 

it relates back to what was brought up -- oh, yes, during 

that common period.  Because I don't recall seeing this in 

the memo. 

          Actually, maybe there's just one question.  The -- 

and this might be for CDD staff -- the question about 

recommending to relocate the elevator, is that still an open 

recommendation?  I didn't see anything, at least that I 

read.  I can't recall seeing it in the memo.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff Roberts.  I will pass 

over to Erik Thorkildsen, if he is with us to respond to 

that.   

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Hello, yes.  This is Erik 

Thorkildsen, CDD.  Yes, and that is in the memo.  We were 

concerned that it's just a bit obscure where the elevator is 

located for a newcomer to the building coming in to the long 

hall, the nave down the middle -- that it's, you know, it's

down this kind of fairly narrow corridor to the left, not 

very close to the stair that goes upstairs. 

          Just sort of speaking off the cuff, the reason for 

locating it there is a sensible reason -- not wanting to 

sort of have it affect the existing -- you know, the 

original building.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  So it could be that it's a 

matter of signage, or it could be a matter of widening that 

corridor a little bit, widening the throat of the corridor, 

where it joins the long hall down the middle.   

          There -- in other words, there could be ways of 

making that elevator more obvious to a newcomer that needs 

to use it, then simply relocating it.  And maybe those 

should be considered as possibilities.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.  Okay.  Thank you, Eric.  Let 

me just see.  And I noticed on the site plan it looked like 

there were five parking spaces across the way.  I assume two 

of those are the accessible spaces, and who has access to 

the other three spaces?   

          Justin, do you want to talk about the parking?   

          JUSTIN CRANE:  Sure.  Well, I can answer the

question directly. 

          The other day spaces you're asking about belong to 

residents of the Equity building.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.          

          JUSTIN CRANE:  It's across the street from the 

Foundry.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Thank you.           

          JUSTIN CRANE:  And there are two spaces that are 

to be dedicated for accessible parking for the Foundry 

building.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you so much.  Appreciate 

that.  Let's see, all right.  So let me go back -- any other 

Planning Board members with questions at this time?  Okay.  

          Seeing none, then let's open it up for discussion 

from the Board, and if you will please state your name when 

you're called on to comment, and let's start if we could 

maybe with Ted this evening.      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  I really have no 

comments.  It looks very attractive to me.   I know it's 

been a long process.  And I would say the one concern I had 

that one person sent in a note about was the absence of any 

parking on the site or for the site, but Traffic and Parking

submitted a quite extensive memorandum on the issue.  And 

so, my concerns about that have been alleviated.   

          It seems to me an excellent project.  I went and 

took a look at it again yesterday, and certainly putting in 

the windows where they are bricked up now not only will be 

an asset for the Foundry, but I think it will be a 

tremendous asset for the apartment building on Third Street.  

So even though it is close and meets the special permit, I 

think it's actually a win-win all around. 

          I really have no other comments about it.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Hugh, would you 

like to go next?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Sure, I'd be happy to.  I think the 

program that has been developed for this building is really 

terrific, and the -- I commend all of the people who worked 

together to make that happen.   

          The architectural design is also fabulous.  It 

makes it very clear what the shell is and what the infill 

is, and it's going to be an exciting place. 

          In terms of the comments from the staff, I would 

comment on the staff's comments.  I would be in favor of 

more trees on the street, if that's possible to accomplish 

58

that.  I think, you know, the tradeoff between trees and 

program space in the side yard has been -- there's been a 

balancing there that I find really convincing.   

          The elevator -- I think the logic behind why it's 

where it is, it works very well with the upper-floor plans.  

It's, you know, in the new addition, and I think it's going 

to be used primarily by the people who work upstairs.   

          And so that they're not -- they'll be -- 

wayfinding is going to be less important.  Now, basically 

there will be clients and other people going there. 

          I think it can be solved by some bold and 

inventive signage.  You know, I would -- I was thinking it 

would be great to see a corner of the elevator shaft bump 

out.   

          But in fact you could just do that with, like, a 

triangular sign and a triangular plan that stuck out at the 

other side of the elevator that was maybe six or eight 

inches into the corridor that said in bold letters, 

"Elevator."   

          I think, you know, over the entrance to that 

eight-food wide corridor down there can be signage.  Maybe 

it's even projecting signage, to get out into the -- more

visually with the space. 

          And there was a comment about making every 

possible effort to maximize the window performance as a 

tradeoff to leaving the brick walls exposed.  And I would 

think they should really work as hard as they possibly can 

on the glazing of those windows to get the best performance 

they can.  Those are my comments.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great, thank you.  Steve, would you 

go next?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure.  Substantively, I think 

it's a great design.  And procedurally, we're frequently in 

the position where we are the only ones reviewing a project.  

But that's not the case here.   

          In this case, it's been -- it's had the benefit of 

extensive review -- not only by great architects at the 

CambridgeSeven, but by Tom in the CRA and by Cathy in the 

Redevelopment Authority, and by Charlie in the Historic 

Commission.  And I've got to respect and defer to their 

extensive review. 

          So my own personal review:  It's a great project, 

and I respect and defer to the extensive review by all of 

the others in the city.  So I think it's ready for a

decision today.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Okay, and Niko?           

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I don't have any comments that are 

different from what Ted said.  I think it's a great project, 

and I'm really excited about it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Great, thank you.  Well, I 

agree with my colleagues that it is really a very exciting 

project.  I particularly like that center community space.  

It's very dramatic but inviting at the same time.   

          So I think we are in a position based on what I'm 

hearing from everyone to move this forward, if I am correct.  

I may need a little clarification on items for continuing 

review, but we will get there.   

          I will say I think my colleagues are correct that 

signage can solve any of the elevator access issues.  And I 

think in terms of the theater use, I don't know -- it 

doesn't sound to me from reading this that we're trying to 

limit the types of performances necessary [1:36:03 audio 

unclear] information as to what types of performances that 

might be there, just so that suggestions can be made as to 

how to -- you know, maybe best present those.   

          So in my thinking, unless I'm wrong in that, and

someone from staff can tell me if that is an incorrect 

interpretation --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I can respond to that, to the 

Chair, [Jeff Roberts.]  Yeah, just on that point, we did 

note -- and I apologize again for looking kind of ghostly, 

but the sun sort of went down before I could turn the lights 

on in my office and this light switch is way over there -- 

the comment that staff made is just kind of the tricky point 

here that a theater use is a conditional use in the zoning 

district.   

          So just after the zoning ordinance, the Board -- 

as you get to the findings, the Board will have to make 

findings that the use complies with all the special permit 

criteria, not having an adverse impact on adjacent uses.  

And so, staff just suggested that some additional 

information would be helpful to the Board in making that 

finding.   

          I think that, as was indicated in public comment, 

you know, this is a public/private partnership.  There's an 

awful lot of public oversight over this building.   

          So I wouldn't say that staff would recommend any 

restrictions on the use, it was just a matter of making sure 

62

that the Board felt comfortable making the finding to 

approve it.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Well, I would say, 

then, based on the discussion that we just had, that the 

Board -- it seems as though they are comfortable, since no 

one raised it as an issue when discussing the project.   

          So let me ask the Board members, is everyone in 

agreement that we are ready to move forward and grant a 

special permit for this project this evening?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Niko?     

          [Pause]  

          Niko?                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.  Okay, great, thanks.  Okay.  

All right, so bear with me here, because I'm going to have 

to use a little technology to go back and forth between 

documents.   

          Let's see -- so we need -- in order to grant the 

special permit, we need to find the proposal meets the

following criteria: [And let me just go back to that.] Okay.   

          So the requested special permits are the Project 

Review Special Permit, which is Section 19.20.  The findings 

that we need to make are the project will have no 

substantial adverse impact on city traffic within the study 

area, upon review of the traffic impact indicators analyzed 

in the Transportation Impact Study and mitigation efforts 

proposed. 

          And we have a memo from the Traffic, 

Transportation and Parking Department, in which they lay out 

mitigation efforts and agreed that the waiting of the 

parking, et cetera, was not detrimental. 

          We also have to find that the project is 

consistent with the urban design objectives of the city, as 

set forth in Section 19.30 and I think we are in agreement 

that that is the case.  It's a very carefully thought out 

and much discussed with the public restoration of an 

important building in the city.   

          Let me ask as we go through this, rather than do 

it all at once.  Is the Board in agreement with those 

criteria?  Can we make those findings?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.     

64

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL: Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  And Niko?                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  All right.  Then, the 

second one is a special permit should reduce the requiring 

parking, Section 6.35.1.  A lesser amount of parking will 

not cause excessive congestion, endanger public safety.  

Substantially reduced parking availability for other uses, 

or otherwise adversely impact the neighborhood, or will 

provide positive environmental or other benefits to the uses 

of the lot and the neighborhood, including assisting in 

provision of affordable housing units.   

          The last phrase does not apply, but I think the 

rest of the -- we can make the rest of those findings.  So 

does everyone agree on that?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.               

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Niko?                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Let's see.  Okay.  Then, 

a special permit altering an existing nonconforming building 

façade, Section 8.22.2(a) it says, "The changes, extensions 

or alterations of preexisting nonconforming structure will 

not be substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood 

than the existing condition."   

          And really, the footprint of the building in terms 

of the side yard, as far as I understand, has not changed.  

It really had to do with the placing the windows back in the 

structure, the historic windows.   

          So is everyone in agreement that we can make that 

finding on changes and extensions or alterations?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.                             

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess I feel like we can be more 

positive and --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- not more detrimental.  This is 

actually providing substantial advantages, given the 

historic renovation.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.  Well put, Hugh, thank you.  Mm-

hm.  And Niko, I think you were --                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah, I said yes already.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, okay, all right.  Very good.  

And then -- oops, let's see.  There is a special permit for 

performance-based use in industry A1, which is section 

4.35(h) which is in the zoning and basically, I believe it 

meets -- that you need to meet the general special permit 

criteria in order to meet that special permit.   

          And the special permit criteria in Section 10.43 I 

think everybody is familiar with those.  If anyone needs me 

to run through them, now is the time to say so.     

          [Pause] 

          Okay.  Let's see.  Let me go back.  Okay.  Is 

there anything in particular in the written decision that 

Board members would like to include?  We will have -- there 

are the suggested conditions in the two memos; one from 

Community Development and Traffic, Parking and 

Transportation -- and also the standard conditions for 

continuing review and certification by staff that the 

conditions are met. 

          Are there other conditions that the Board would 

like to include?             

67

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I would like to modify the elevator 

condition to refer to the signage and not suggest that the 

internal ground-floor related building needs to be changed.       

          MARY FLYNN:  And I think based on what Jeff has 

said, that we have agreed that it meets the special permit 

criteria for theater use, so that the additional information 

that was suggested in the memo is not required either.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That's -- I agree.       

          MARY FLYNN:  So based on the findings and the 

modifications to the conditions that are set in the two 

memos, is there a motion to grant the requested special 

permits with those conditions, based on the Board's finding 

that the applicable special permit criteria are met?  So 

this is going to be a roll call vote.  So at first, I need a 

motion and a second.  This is remote.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steven Cohen, so moved.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, Steven Cohen has moved it.  Is 

there a second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Ted Cohen, second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Ted seconded.  Okay.  Jeff, would you 

call roll call, please?

          MARY FLYNN:  Excellent! Well, congratulations to 

the team.  You did an excellent job it seems.  It's a very 

impressive building, and I look forward to attending a 

performance there in the not-too-distant future if we can 

get past COVID and get the project done.

to come up, but I think it probably makes sense to just take 

a quick break --

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, you're very welcome, Mm-hm.  So 

it is now 8:04.  How about if we are back at, I don't know,

little longer, we'll wait, obviously, until we have a quorum 

again.  Thank you.

public hearing on Planning Board Special Permit Case PB#

convert an existing space at 1908 Massachusetts Avenue into 

a cannabis retail store.  CDD staff will begin by 

summarizing why this is before us.  And Jeff, if you would 

do that, please?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Vice Chair.  Jeff 

Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, once again.  

This is another new hearing on a case that had to be 

postponed, and it's a proposal for a cannabis retail store.

C, but require a special permit from the Planning Board, per 

the requirements of Section 11.800 of the zoning ordinance, 

which the Board is very familiar with at this point. 

          The Board's action is to grant or deny the 

requested special permit, and the applicable criteria have 

been provided to the Board.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  So the 

presenter for the applicant this evening is Walter Sullivan.  

Before we start, let the record show that there are only 

five Planning Board members present for this hearing, and an 

affirmative vote of five members will be necessary to grant 

a special permit.   

          Attorney Sullivan, are you prepared to proceed 

with the five members?  Again, please just state your name 

and your response. 

          ATTORNEY SULLIVAN:  Attorney Walter Sullivan, yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, okay.  You will have up to 

30 minutes for your presentation.  Please be as concise as 

possible, and if you would begin by introducing your project 

team.   

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  My name is Walter Sullivan. I'm 

the attorney that represents Porter Square Remedies, a woman

and minority-owned business locally, local kid, seeking a 

special permit to operate a cannabis retail establishment at 

1908 Massachusetts Avenue. 

          With me I have the family members, Laxmi Pradhan, 

Binoj Pradhan and Shweta Pradhan, who will give an 

introduction to the project; along with David Barsky, the 

architect and Rick Nagle, the security consultant.    

          The project does meet the requirements set forth 

in 11800.  There is no school, et cetera within 300 feet.  

There are no other cannabis retail establishment within 1800 

feet.  The closest is 2200 feet away. 

          With that being said, I will introduce the family 

to give their presentations. 

          SHWETA PRADHAN:  Hi, everyone.  My name is Shweta, 

Shweta Pradhan.  I'm here with my father-in-law, who is 

right behind me, Laxmi.  S-h-w-e-t-a, Shweta Pradhan, P-r-a-

d-h-a-n.  Sure.  And as I said, my father-in-law is right 

behind me, Laxmi Pradhan.  And we're together the applicants 

for Porter Square Remedies.   

          We're super excited to be in front of the Planning 

Board Committee, even though it is just through video call.  

And today I would like to take this opportunity to introduce

ourselves, who we are.   

          As Walter just mentioned, we're a minority-owned, 

women-owned family business.   

          We'd love to introduce ourselves to let you know 

who we are, give you a little bit of a background of what 

we've done so far in Cambridge and Somerville as a family 

business, and also, go through a little bit about our 

management and operations of -- especially about our 

security, what we're planning -- what our hopes and 

aspirations are, especially when it comes to making a 

positive impact in the neighborhood of Cambridge and beyond. 

          So with that, I'd like to pass on the camera and 

the audio to Binoj to -- actually could I ask the moderator 

if it would be okay for us to share the screen, just so we 

can navigate through the different slides and the floor 

plans, if that's all right?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Jeff and Swaathi, I think that's a 

question for you.  I think generally Swaathi manages all of 

this.   

          SHWETA PRADHAN:  Okay, yeah.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:   I have to allow it.  If you -- I 

mean, if you want to do that, that's fine, I can do that,

and then we'll switch it back.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay. 

          SHWETA PRADHAN:  Okay.  Currently I think the 

screen says that it's been disabled.  Let me try that again.  

All right.  Is that visible on your end as well?     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, we can see it.   

          SHWETA PRADHAN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  If you put it in full screen, it 

might be helpful.   

          [Pause] 

          SHWETA PRADHAN:  Let me do that.     

          I think two screens show up.  Would that be -- I 

think it should be fine.  All right.  I'll just go ahead and 

introduce myself.  I am a recent graduate of the Fletcher 

School.  I studied Economics and International Business.    

          [Technical difficulties conversation]   

          SHWETA PRADHAN:  So as I mentioned, I'm a recent 

graduate from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.  

Studied International Business and Economics, and I don't 

this there might be as many applicants whose father-in-law 

and daughter-in-law do trying to operate a business, 

especially one that's newly regulated as the cannabis retail

industry. 

          But we're really excited.  We want to take this 

opportunity to work as a team.  The location that we 

proposed is 1908 Massachusetts Avenue.  And just for a 

reference, this is right in front of the Porter Square 

Shopping Mall.  We've been -- I would like to say that I've 

been blessed that I get a chance to work together with my 

family.   

          I'll let my husband and my father-in-law go into a 

little bit more detail about their back story, which started 

more than 20 years ago, when they moved from Nepal.  I'm 

from Nepal as well, and was married into the family a couple 

of years ago, and I'm considering it a great opportunity 

that we could have the prospect of operating a cannabis 

business together. 

          So I'll let my husband take over and explain a 

little bit about their back story. 

          BINOJ PRADHAN:  Hi.  As you can see, this is my 

father, and he just came from the hospital.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Before you go on, could you please 

state and spell your name. 

          BINOJ PRADHAN:  Sure.  My name is Binoj Pradhan.

I'm the husband to Shweta, and he's the --       

          THE REPORTER:  Please spell your name. 

          BINOJ PRADHAN:  Binoj, B-i-n-o-j Pradhan, P-r-a-d-

h-a-n.  So yeah, like, Shweta mentioned, we just got married 

and it was my father who was medically -- he has some 

problems right now, so he just came from the hospital, but 

he -- you know, he took that time to come to this meeting.   

          So basically, talking about the family business, 

we moved to Porter Square area about 20 years ago from 

Nepal, and we worked -- our family worked in the Porter 

Square area like my Mom used to work at the Dunkin Donuts 

right across from 1908 Mass Ave. 

          And my father worked as a realtor at the time, and 

I was a college student.  And first, once we start -- you 

know, working together, save some money, we decided to open 

our first business, which is in Union Square, a Subway small 

franchise restaurant we opened.   

          And from there -- just giving you a little bit of 

history about ourselves, sorry about that. 

          So from there, we opened our first actual business 

that we actually operated was a Masala restaurant in 

Somerville in Thiele Square. We have been opening this for

almost 10 years now, and we're still operating, but right 

now because of COVID, we are only doing takeout and delivery 

only. 

          From there, you know, with some savings, we bought 

this building on Cambridge Street and, you know, this Board 

-- very Board -- actually approved this project, which 

allowed to make four apartments upstairs and two commercial 

spaces on the first floor, and we renovated this property 

and we operate the business as well -- the City Liquors. 

          And from here, with the remodeling and with the 

[2:01:26 indiscernible operations] in property we took some 

loans out, and then we bought this building -- actually I'm 

sure your Board is very familiar, because you guys granted 

the permit on this.   

          So we brought this property, and right now I'm 

sure everybody knows the improvement that we're making, 

because one day I was going to S&S restaurant and I saw this 

property on the wall and I said, "Wow, it's a beautiful 

property, I should bring it back to its original state."   

          And basically, and like I said, everybody knows -- 

like now the -- you know, we have tried to -- you know, make 

it as close as possible to what it was before.  And a lot of

people, you know, praise to us the Association, the Inman 

Square Association, they love the building.  A lot of 

neighbors asked us to bring it back to its original state. 

          And I actually thank you guys for approving the 

permit on this, because I thought it was going to be a no 

when I went to the ZBA when the member asked about the 

parking issue.  But luckily, there was a lot of neighbors 

supporting this project, so we got it approved.   

          We're almost done with this project.  I would say 

within a month and a half we'll be starting to rent two 

apartments.  There's one voluntary unit that I offered to 

affordable housing, which I didn't have to, but as being 

part of the community, I feel like -- you know, there has to 

be some contribution if the community is looking about 

support you.  It's always good to give back as well. 

          As you go down, we have a lot of engagement with 

the community.  For example, we are part of Union Square 

Main Street.  We've been part of the Union Square Main in 

Street for twenty years.  They have made a lot of 

recommendations.  We closely worked with the small business.   

Even though it's tough time, we're still working together to 

help small businesses.

          We're also part of Teele Square Business Group, 

where my restaurant -- Masala -- is.  That's where we 

actually operate our restaurant business.   

          We're part of the East Cambridge Business 

Association, because we have the city [2:03:25 indiscernible 

leaguers].  This is a family-owned business as well.  This 

is a highly regulated business, a lot of people -- you know, 

getting to do cannabis.   

          I don't know how much they understand the 

intensity of -- you know, how, you know, it's regulated.  

Because with the liquor industry, we check IDs.  We have to 

make sure we're not selling to minors.  We have all that 

experience.  We got audited many times.  So we have a lot of 

backgrounds operating a liquor store.   

          We are part of the Inman Square Business 

Association as well.  So as you can see, we've been part of 

all these communities for many years, from 20 years until 

the last five years. 

          So about our involvement in the community, you 

know, in the past -- like I said -- 20 years, we've been in 

the community.  We shop for our food in Star Market, because 

we live close by.  I and my family -- everybody used to go

to Bally Fitness, but unfortunately there's no more Bally 

Fitness. I miss Bally Fitness.  They were a very good 

membership.  You could go all over the country, anywhere, 

Bally, but unfortunately, they no longer exist. 

          I miss the Blockbuster Video where I used to go on 

the second floor and get my videos…  Radio Shack, where I 

used to try to do all my gadget stuff.  You know, I'm a 

little bit of a techie guy.   

          You know, Gift of the Wind when I first came to 

this country, 21 years ago, coming from a third-world 

country and looking at that, you know, Gift of the Wind, I 

was like, "How he doesn't hear each other?  You know, if 

something really amazing -- and even until today it's still 

amazing. 

          Like I said, CVS, Star Market, Ace Hardware, 

Healthworks -- again, these are part of our daily lives.  

Commonwealth Locks -- best locksmith in the co -- I would 

say in the state.  You can find any sorts of locks, they fix 

anything.  You know, it's an awesome group.  Thai 

restaurant, that’s where we get almost all our Thai food 

from, and the Sprint Store that no longer exists -- I've 

been a Sprint Store member for almost 21 years, and still we

are Sprint customers.   

          Right now, we are proposing this location in 

Porter Square.  Like I said, my Mom used to work right 

across the street.  It's kind of funny that, you know, we're 

getting an opportunity to work and own a business -- you 

know, a dream come true in a way.  

          Also, you know, being across from Porter Square, 

every time it reminds me of picking up my mother.  So I'm 

going to pass the mic to the architect, as he talks more 

about the architectural end.  I think he might be the best 

person, and I would ask David Barsky to join the group.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Would you please state and spell your 

name?    

          DAVID BARSKY:  Yeah.  My name is David Barsky -- 

that's B-a-r-s-k-y, an architect for this project.  I'm 

going to address specifically some of the things that the 

Board -- the concerns of the Board -- if you'd be so kind to 

pass me my notes?  Yeah.  And go from there.   

          So you all have the documents, so I'm going to try 

to limit my presentation specifically to some of the issues 

that were addressed in the report.   

          Here you have a -- you know, a picture of the

existing conditions, existing building nestled between the 

restaurant on the left and an H&R Block on the right.   

          We're not proposing any changes to the building or 

the structure, per se.  We really addressed specifically the 

storefront.  The Board had some comments about a lack of 

visibility into the space.   

          We have an unusual situation where we have a 

vestibule where we can control what is being viewed from the 

street into the space, and we're able to conform to the 

regulations that prohibit certain aspects of the product to 

be visible from the street. 

          We made an adjustment to the elevation and the 

façade -- or rather the storefront treatment by creating the 

-- we're either going to propose a deck type of design, or 

some kind of etched glass to give us, like, some degree of 

visibility while at the same time, you know, creating a 

design that mitigates a little bit, you know, so it's not 

completely open from the street. 

          The signage that you see there is really -- gives 

you the scope of the sign.  We assume that the branding will 

be evolved somewhat, and the logo and what not.   

          We're proposing essentially a glass storefront 

82

22

with one structural element that you can see in this -- I 

suppose I can use the -- yeah, there we go.  So this is 

really a structure that will hold the glass.  We're 

proposing a kind of an aged wood look to it, and then the 

glazing, the sign…  the glazing wall have this deck thing.   

          One other comment that is not addressed here, that 

we do plan to address, which is that -- making it a bit 

clearer that this is the entry door.  We were anticipating 

some small level of signage on the door with the name of the 

company and the fact that that's an entry. 

          Scroll down a little more?  Okay, this is just 

information about the location.  Oh, one other -- yeah, we 

will get to that.   

          Yeah, one other thing that came up that we wanted 

to address -- this is the exit door, this is the entry door.  

Both are right on the property line at the moment.  The exit 

door opens out into the public way.   

          In order to address the concerns of the Board, we 

would like to -- we'll propose that that door be recessed 

enough that it can be opened.  It needs to be opened 

outward, because it's also a means of egress.  And we know 

that those doors need to open in the direction of egress.

22

          So to address that concern, we're -- we would like 

to propose that that be set back about four feet, and you'll 

see from the plan that we have the ability to do that. 

          And some of the existing conditions. 

          I also -- I was the architect that did Hotel 1868, 

which is just up the street a little ways, so I'm pretty 

familiar with the area -- very familiar with the area, in 

fact.  And it's helped me a little bit to sort of understand 

the dynamics of how this place might work. 

          I'm going to address some of these other issues in 

the plan, it has it's more effective.  Sort of scroll down 

from the panels that you already have. 

          This -- I'm going to go to this floor plan here. 

          So just a real quick -- oh, thank you, very good -

- a real quick tour.  There's your main entry.  You can see 

here from the exit that that will be -- it will be quite 

easy to create a small partition here, and have that exit 

recessed. 

          This is a pre-COVID drawing where you can see 

everything nice and close together, but this -- the 

clearances in here are wheelchair accessible.   

          We did not put dimensions on here, but we have

more than adequate space to accommodate the AAB regulations.  

Customers will check in here and enter through this doorway 

into a rather large open space, where they can get more 

information on the product.  There will be small tabs, iPad 

tablets and some visuals against the wall. 

          And then we have the main sales counter, which is 

divided up into a number of substations.  And at the very 

end, we also have -- we have medical sales, and we have an 

accessible interface there, as well as here for -- to 

address that. 

          We added a restroom, which we initially 

anticipated as being downstairs in the basement, but we've 

since rethought that.  We have the space for it at the 

ground level.  The basement is a space that’s only going to 

be used for utilities and that’s basically it.   

          There will be a sealed doorway here, which is not 

yet shown, and there will be no access to the basement and 

no activity of the business will be conducted, except on the 

ground level. 

          You have controlled entry to the back of house, 

which is -- which includes the employee area, some security 

element -- programmatical elements, which our security

expert is going to elaborate on -- a small office, and then 

          [I want to go back down just a little bit here, 

okay]  

          And then this leads out to the rear of the 

building in the parking area, and that's something else we 

can discuss as well. 

          This exit also is one of the two main emergency 

egress.  It will have a panic bar on it, but will otherwise 

be not accessible to customers.  But in a case of an 

emergency, both the front and rear egress doors will be 

accessible. 

          Now, the parking -- this is the existing parking 

setup.  I sort of did a little bit of vetting and looked at 

the some of the aerial photos, as well as consulting with 

the tenant and the owners as to how -- the way that the 

parking is being used now.   

           You can see that these are not your typical 

conforming parking spaces.  Everything here is existing, and 

basically this diagram is meant to basically show how the 

parking is being used now, and to delineate the number of 

spaces. 

          A couple of important points:  The access from the

street is along this alleyway here.  You have four parking 

spaces here.  We anticipated the possibility that you would 

have a drop-off here for Uber and Lyft.   

          This is only to get them off of Mass Ave and allow 

them to come back into the space, so that they don't impede 

on the bicycle path, which is between the sidewalk and the 

street on Mass Ave in this location. 

          These two parking spaces here, which are adjacent 

to the door, will function specifically for deliveries and 

dropping off a product after hours, and that will be 

elaborated on as well by our security consultant. 

          The spaces that you see along this lot line and 

along the rear are tenants' spaces that are assigned 

specifically to the renters of the property.  So they have 

nothing to do with the store itself. 

          Another item that was brought up by the Board had 

to do with lighting.  There will be a metered -- not a 

metered, but a sensored lighting condition at the doorway, 

which will be -- which will conform to, you know, the

lighting should work in Cambridge. 

          The -- so that light will go on at dusk, and then

cut off automatically at dawn, and will be facing downwards 

and will -- you know, create the light that we need in this 

area, in that setting.  We have existing trash pickup in 

this area here. 

          The building -- the new space is going to have its 

own new HVAC system, the components of which will be on the 

roof.  It's a split system, and it's a very quiet, efficient 

system.  The new technology, as you probably know, allows 

for a highly efficient performance, and a very, very low 

noise ratio. 

          [If there's anything else in here?]  

          I think I can address questions after, but I'll 

hand it over to our security expert, and he can elaborate on 

some of the specifics of the security plan for the front of 

it.   

          RICK NAGLE:  Hi. My name is Rick Nagle, N-a-g-l-e.  

I'm working security for this establishment.  I've been 

involved with the security procedures for the establishment 

since the onset.   

          My experiences prior to doing the security 

consultant:  I was with the Massachusetts State Police for 

over 30 years.  Part of my assignment, I was the Supervisor

in charge of all narcotics that were seized by the 

Massachusetts State Police for the Commonwealth of 

Massachusetts. 

          What made the job hard is we were compromised.  

Somebody had stolen over $1 million dollars' worth of 

product.  As a result, we developed policy and procedures 

not only for all state police and local law enforcement, but 

for the District Attorney's Office and Attorney General's 

Office in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

          I got involved because I wanted to make sure that 

if this was coming to Massachusetts -- and it was -- that 

hopefully I could be part of it, and if I had any expertise 

at all, I could wrangle. 

          For this community here, I know the community.  

I'm from -- born and raised in Cambridge.  Prior to the 

State Police, I was Director of Community Relations for CEOC 

-- Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee -- which is 

located on 11 Main Street. 

          So I know Porter Square.   I know it well.  What 

we're hoping to do in this establishment here is if you 

looked at the -- well, what we're hoping to do is -- I'll 

walk you through it -- is as you see, they show it again, as

the gentleman before me mentioned that in prior to COVID 19, 

it shows it's kind of like congested there.   

          What we're going to do is we're all -- first out 

front, we're concerned about loitering.  We will have 

cameras, nonintrusive.  We will have security that will go 

in and out to make sure that everything is -- no one's 

congregating. 

          Once you come in, to prevent diversion in minors, 

we will have an ID scanner.  Now, what this ID scanner 

entails, it -- within 15 seconds you enter your license -- 

it can be a passport, and it's conducive for all 50 states.  

          After 911, these licenses -- if you remember, you 

had to turn your old license in to get a new license.  

There's so many bar codes and identifications on these 

licenses, that are numerous, that it's almost impossible to 

duplicate and to make these fraudulent.   

          So we'll put them in there.  We'll ascertain that 

the person is over 21 years of age.  It also -- not only 

does -- it does the 50 states, it will be Mexico and Canada 

-- and also, will do military IDs.  So it's an excellent 

tool.  It's used in the U.S. Department of Justice -- DOJ 

uses it.  Airports use it.  It's a good tool to prevent

diversion. 

          So what happens is you have two doors.  One is the 

main door that will come in.  The other door here will be 

secure.  What we call this is basically a Sally port, to 

make sure that no one just runs in.  It's a security port.  

Once we ID them, we're comfortable who they are, they're of 

age, they're allowed to come in, they're going to a point of 

sale and make their purchase.  

          What's nice about this establishment:  We have the 

separate entrance, and we have the separate egress, which 

makes the flow excellent.  We will have all alarms on all 

windows, points of entry doors, et cetera.   

          Video cameras will be not only outside to capture 

the entire building, it'll also be on every point of sale.  

It will not only be on the customer, it will also be on the 

employee, and if there's cash or product -- again to prevent 

diversion. 

          So anything there with the cash, we'll be doing 

cash management, which means that what I call frequent cash 

loops, which means managers will come and make sure there's 

not over X amount of money in the till.  So what they will 

do, their responsibility is to make sure that money doesn't

exceed let's say we'll put a cap $300, they will put it in 

the safe. 

          As we move along, we're going to have two safes, 

which is very important.  One is going to be to store the 

product at night, and the other one's going to be to store 

spoilage, which is important.   

          To make sure anything that's marijuana or edible 

or anything else goes in one of those two rooms, and it'll 

be allowed.  It will be two persons access that will be 

allowed in that room.  We'll have cameras not only at the 

entrance, but inside the vault 

          As we move along, we will have a Security Office 

that will be secured all the equipment that is responsible 

for the video and alarms.  We're going to have motion 

detectors.  They cover the entire square footage of it. 

          What's important to note what I tell everyone is 

God forbid this is compromised.  For some reason, someone 

breaks in, we're going to have a motion to take this on the 

roof and in the basement and so forth and so on.  But God 

forbid someone breaks in, there's no product in the 

building.  It's all in this vault.  This vault's going to be 

highly secure.

          So if they break into this building -- and usually 

it's novice people who break in, they're not cat burglars, 

and they break in here, they're going to have to spend 30 or 

40 minutes before they can even figure out what to do.  By 

that time, if they still stay in the building, the police 

are going to be well on their way and they're going to be 

there.   

          So if they break in in nonbusiness hours, there's 

no prize.  So I tell that to everyone, because I want them 

to understand we don't need products in the counters here.  

We don't need large amounts of paraphernalia. 

          Also, most of your product is at cultivation 

sites.  This is not a cultivation site; this is a retail 

store.  So what that means is there's going to be minimum 

amount of product.  They're going to know after they're open 

for a while what their date entails.   

          They're going to be by appointment, so you're not 

going to have this congestion here at the beginning.  

They're going to have an idea how many people are going to 

come and visit their facility.  So as a result of that, 

they're going to know how much product to bring in. 

          When we bring in a product, we're not going to be

bringing it in at night, and we're going to try to look at 

our neighbors and see when they open and try to do it prior 

to when they open, so we're not inconveniencing anyone.   

          We're in nondescript vehicles.  When we come in, 

again we're not coming in with a tractor-trailer unit full 

of marijuana.  It's going to be a small vehicle, not marked.  

They're going to come in and they're going to come out, and 

they're going to use the rear entrance. 

          What's important about security -- a lot of people 

talk, which I just did in physical security, but not many 

people talk about the operation part of security, and what 

does that mean?  And I tell everyone that's training.  We 

need to train.   

          We need to develop procedures, policies.  We need 

it constantly.  Training can be on a daily basis.  But we 

need to train them and let them know about a myriad of 

issues that may happen.  And the staff will be highly 

trained.  We're going to focus on training for the security.  

And I think -- what I just alluded to; I think that's 

basically everything.   

          And card entry -- card entry is important.  We're 

not going to let people just use any card, where Paul can

give it to Rick and give can give it to Bruce, it's going to 

be -- it's either going to be an access by keypad, which you 

can deactivate it when the place is closed.  So it's going 

to be highly regulated and highly secure. 

          Thank you. 

          SHWETA PRADHAN:  So since Rick mentioned in quite 

detail about how we're going to secure our location, I'd 

like to just touch upon a little bit on the operational side 

as well.  We're going to be doing everything possible to 

make sure that we prevent diversion.   

          So what we devised is sort of like a draft of a 

customer pledge that we're going to ask all of our customers 

once they purchase our product to sign before they leave or 

exit the store is that for a safe, legal use of cannabis, we 

want to make sure that they certify that they acknowledge 

that they're going to be responsible about the consumption 

of cannabis, that they've just purchased from our retail 

store.   

          They are going to certify that they understand 

they can only open the package and utilize the product at 

home, not out in the public in open spaces, including within 

the Porter Square Remedies; they cannot be consuming it as 

95

soon as they walk out of the store and open the package at 

the parking lot.   

          And we're going to make sure that customers pledge 

that they're going to be abiding by these community norms.  

And if they don't, any further future purchases are going to 

be completely restricted, and that any diversion of product 

is going to be illegal, and will be reported to law 

enforcement immediately.  We will not be compromising with 

this at all. 

          Another aspect I want to touch upon is consumer 

education.  We want to make sure that customers that walk 

into our store, it could be people who are novices, who are 

just starting on this recreational cannabis journey, or 

people who could be a lot more informed about it. 

          Either way, in addition to having a very learned, 

very educated staff we're going to inform our customers, we 

also want to make sure that we hand sort of like a pamphlet, 

a fact sheet about marijuana, so that would be giving 

information about consumption basics -- for example, what 

amount of consumption, of smoking search and product, how 

long would the effect start -- how long after consumption 

would customers start seeing the effect?  What are the

regulations when it comes to driving with having inhaled, 

consumed marijuana?   

          So we want to make sure that we're doing our part 

to educate our customers as best as possible.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Excuse me for interrupting, but if 

you -- you've already gone past the allotment for the 

presentation, and I know you still have some materials to 

cover, but if you could just go through it a little bit more 

quickly, that would be great.   

          SWETHA PRADHAN:  Thank you so much.  So just 

touching upon very quickly on diversity:  On the day of 

opening, we want to make sure that more than half, 51 

percent of our employees are going to be either minorities, 

women or veterans.  We're going to be very mindful of this.  

          We want to make sure we hire as many -- as much as 

possible local residents, and we're going to make every 

effort to hire and contract local businesses and vendors in 

the operation of our business. 

          So this is what the current state of Porter Square 

Remedies' current location looks like.  There, you can see a 

lot of butts and trash everywhere around the area, right 

behind the location.  This is the space in its current

condition.   

          We want to make sure that we are going to be 

working with the city arborist who planned this area to 

beautify the space, make sure it's not as -- make sure it's 

not deserted and completely -- sorry to say, but trashy-

looking as it does right now.   

          And having said that, I want to also state the 

fact that in every business that we've owned in the past and 

are currently operating, we place a lot of significance and 

importance to beautifying the space.  These are just some 

examples of how we have made sure that there are plans, and 

the area is absolutely clean. 

          And as my husband mentioned earlier as well, since 

we have years and years of experience of running a highly 

regulated, alcohol business, we will be making sure that we 

are just as careful, if not more, about securing the space, 

making sure the place doesn't have any loitering and prevent 

diversion. 

          Thank you so much.  So we're going to be opening 

it up to questions, and -- 

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  I want to thank you for your 

time.  A couple of things before questions, to be really

quick.  You should have received a response to the Traffic 

and Parking report that you had received from Traffic and 

Parking.  We accept all the conditions that they recommend 

as part of licensing.  We also are planning on having bike 

storage long-term.   

          We are probably -- out of all the cannabis 

businesses doing business in Cambridge, the closest to rapid 

transit than any other one.  You can get into Porter Square 

right next door to the building or walking across the 

street, and Bluebike -- there is all kinds of short-term 

bike passing. 

          One of the things we're looking to do as part of 

our website to reduce traffic is to put on our website 

people understand that there's no parking in the area; take 

alternative transportation.   

          We also are planning on having a -- for lack of a 

better word of putting it -- a gift card type of business 

where if you can come in and prove that you took public 

transportation or alternative transportation, we'll stamp a 

card you get 10 stamps and we give you a gift certificate to 

an area of business there to help promote other businesses 

there.   

99

          We've also been in contact with the CDD staff with 

regard to their concerns.  We agreed to accept all their 

issues that they want to ensure that we have as part of a 

condition. 

          I believe we addressed most of them right now, but 

we're more than happy to have them as conditions.  As you 

know, you received a letter of support from the President 

and Vice-President in their individual capacity of our 

project from the Porter Square Neighborhood Association. 

          I want to thank you for your time, and I know 

there will be public comment now, and then questions for us.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, that is correct.  This is a 

public hearing, and so, we are going to move now to public 

comment.  Any members of the public who wish to speak, 

should now click the button that says, "Raise hand." If 

you're calling in by phone, you can raise your hand by 

pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board received 

written communications from Ellen Glisker, Jodie Eckelchick 

Ruth Riles and Susan Hunziger [all names phonetic], on 

behalf of the Porter Square Neighborhood Association and 

Sarah Bell.

          Additional written communications received after 

5:00 p.m. yesterday will also be entered into the record.  

So I'll now ask staff to unmute the speakers one at a time.  

Speakers should begin by stating their name and address.  

Staff will then confirm if we can hear you. 

          After that, you'll have up to three minutes to 

speak before I ask you to wrap up.  So right now I will turn 

it over to Jeff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff Roberts.  Thank you to 

the Chair.  I don't see any hands raised among attendees at 

this point, so I'll just ask one more time.  If there are 

attendees at the meeting who would like to speak at this 

time, please push the button that says, "Raise hand" on 

Zoom.  Or, if you're by telephone, you can push *9 on your 

telephone and that will raise your hand.  That's the way 

that you indicate to us that you would like to speak. 

          So I was just giving it a few seconds to see if 

anybody raises their hand.  There's still no hands raised at 

          [Pause]  

this time.   

          [Pause] 

          A hand has been raised at this time, so I will

allow Wakiko Kera to speak.  You can begin by unmuting 

yourself and saying your name and address, please. 

          WAKIKO KERA:  Hi, it's actually Wakiko Kera and 

Cheetah Young (phonetic).  We live at 22 Porter Road, and 

our back porch is adjacent to the parking lot in the rear.  

And my concern is I know that people are not supposed to use 

the products anywhere other than their home.  But what is 

the business going to do to enforce that?   

          You know, my fear is that people will be using it 

in their cars.  And we have two young children that use the 

back porch a lot.  You know, right now there's a lot of 

people that smoke in the parking lot too.  So if you could 

address that, I'd appreciate it.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay, that was the one hand that 

was raised.  I'll just give the last call for anyone else 

that hasn't spoken.  If you would like to speak, please 

start by pushing the, "Raise hand" button so I can see that 

you would like to speak, or press *9 if you're on telephone.  

          I now see -- I'll assume the last speaker at this 

point is Ruth Riles.  If you can unmute yourself, please 

give your name and address.   

          RUTH RILES:  I'm Ruth Riles, and I live at 115

You can proceed, thanks. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  We can hear you fine.  

          RUTH RILES:  I just wanted to assure I cannot say 

his name properly, but the last speaker -- and anyone else 

who might be on the call -- as a neighborhood Association, 

we fully intend to work with the business, if they are 

successful, to make sure that they live up to what we expect 

of them in the neighborhood, which is to protect, you know, 

the neighbors and work with the rest of the businesses in 

the area.  And I do believe they will be very honorable with 

that.   

assist with that. 

     So I just wanted to say we will follow through and 

          WAKIKO KERA:  Would you like me to address the --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That concludes the list of speakers 

at this time, so I'll turn it back over to the Chair, thank 

you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Now, we're going to go 

through Planning Board comments and -- questions, rather, 

and then some of the speaker's questions may be addressed 

during that as well.  So do any members of the Planning

Board have questions for the applicant?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have a question.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Hugh.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Were the people who are at the 

security desk have a monitor that will show what's going on 

in the lot behind the building, so that they can monitor the 

question that was brought up by one of the speakers?   

          RICK NAGLE:  Again, this is Rick Nagle, Security 

Consultant.  Absolutely.  It would be monitored -- that 

camera would be running 24/7, 365.  It will be on [2:37:22 

indiscernible data], it will be saved for -- the laws state 

90 days.  We will keep it there. 

          If for any reason there's any illegal activity, we 

will work closely with the local police or the District 

Attorney's office.  We welcome them to come in, they can 

view our data, and we'll work from there.  But it's -- all 

cameras are working 24/7, 365 and we are going to hold the 

video for a minimum of 90 days.   

          Also, we're going to let customers know that 

they're not allowed to loiter or indulge in any type of 

smoking or edibles while they're -- if we do find out they 

are doing it and it's on camera, they will not be allowed in 

104

our establishment again. 

          One of our plans is to have one -- you can't smoke 

in public or use cannabis in public.  That's part of our 

pledge.  Security will not only monitor the business, but 

also the surrounding area. 

          We also will have a liaison to both the 

Neighborhood Association, the Police Department and the 

city, as well as the community for someone to call if 

there's a problem.  Because we're better off addressing 

issues up front than letting them linger.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Any other questions from 

Board members?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, this is really a question 

for Traffic and Parking.  You know, I've read their memo, 

and I'm a little confused about what can and cannot be done 

in the rear parking lot, and whether this business actually 

has the right to use those two spots for loading and 

unloading.   

          And also, the access to the lot is really pretty 

terrible, and whether they think that Uber and Lyft will

actually be entering and exiting in that area.      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.  Okay.  I believe we have Adam 

from Traffic and Parking.   

          ADAM SHULMAN:  Yes, hi, let me put my video on.  

Thank you, Ted.  Good evening, everyone.  I'm Adam Shulman 

from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department.   

          So yes, the Traffic Department submitted a comment 

letter.  You'll find it fairly similar to many of the other 

cannabis retail store projects that we have seen in 

Cambridge to date. 

          This -- the unique aspects of this project are 

that this one actually does appear to have their own parking 

lot -- at least the site has a parking lot behind it.  And 

they indicated that they have control of two of the spaces.  

So there's about 18 parking spaces in that lot, and the 

property owner has control of two of those spaces.  The 

other spaces are for other businesses in that building, or 

in those attached buildings that the property owner manages. 

          So they definitely have probably a long-term lease 

or a lease or arrangement with the property owner to use two 

of the spaces.  And so, they've indicated that they intend 

to use those spaces, one for probably an employee parking

space, and one for -- probably for pickup, drop-off 

activities and deliveries of the material.  So it becomes 

sort of their other space becomes a bit of a loading space 

for them for deliveries.   

          But they have control of those two spaces. 

          Now, in the presentation we just watched, they 

showed what appeared to be maybe another space that they 

were indicating as a potential drop-off pickup for Ubers, 

Lyfts, and so forth.   

          So I -- so I might have to work with them on 

whether that's a third space, and they have three spaces 

they control, or whether they -- it's not, and it's just an 

area that they want to kind of turn into a loading zone in 

the lot?  Which may be okay, but it's something we would 

need to look at.   

          But the question is -- the question about, well 

Ubers and Lyfts and that kind of activity, will they go into 

the parking lot?  And so, that’s a concern that we raised in 

our comment letter also.  Because we certainly -- like a lot 

of the other cannabis retail stores, this site has a bike 

lane in front of the site, and then travel lanes on Mass 

Ave.

          So we don't want Ubers and Lyfts and any types of 

drop-off, pickup, stopping, in front of the store and 

blocking -- on the bike lane, or blocking the bike lane in 

any way.  And so, that's a common concern of all the other 

ones as well. 

          And so, one of the positive aspects of this 

project is actually they do have a parking lot -- private 

off-street parking lot, and it is feasible that people who 

are doing these Ubers and Lyfts could pull into that parking 

lot and drop off or pick up their passenger in the lot and 

not on the Mass Avenue Street.   

          You know, so whether they'll do that or not, you 

know, that maybe a little bit of signage might help.  A lot 

of information on their website to their customers to sort 

of make it very clear about what's allowed and what's not 

allowed.   

          And hopefully also any type of help they can also 

provide to make sure that their customer -- any potential 

customers of theirs don't stop, drop-off, pickup on Mass Ave 

and in the bike lane where they shouldn't be and educate 

them that they can actually drive into the parking lot, get 

dropped off, and then leave that lot.

          You're right, it's not the best.  It's not -- it's 

a small lot.  Access is through a relatively narrow 

driveway, and it's just an existing condition.   

          And so, if there tend to be a lot of lot of cars 

trying to drop off pickup at any one point in time, that 

again could be a concern.  So that's something that has to 

be carefully monitored and controlled as well. 

          And so, one of the ways that that could be 

potentially controlled is if they're doing appointment-only 

and things of that nature, and that might have some level of 

control as to how many customers might be coming at any one 

time, to not sort of overload that parking lot with people 

driving in to drop people off, and so forth. 

          But I think the notion of this site is directly 

across the street from Porter Square, MBTA stop, there's a 

Commuter Rail stop there, there's good bus access, there's 

Bluebike access.  It's as good a place as Harvard Square or 

Central Square in terms of being very transit-oriented and 

providing good access for people to come by non-automobiles, 

which is what we'd like to see. 

          And so, that's I think -- hopefully that clarified 

or answered your questions.  Or if you have others, let me 

know.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No, that was great, thank you.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Adam.  Does anybody else 

109

have questions for Adam?     

          [Pause]  

          No?  Okay.  Ted, did you have any other questions 

that you wanted to ask?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I have questions about 

the design of the façade, but I was hoping Hugh might be 

taking that on first.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And -- but if not, we can come 

back to that.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, yes.  So is it a question or a 

comment that you have about this is?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, the CDD's memo talked 

about the problems with the façade, which I also have 

problems with.  I mean, it's interesting, but I don't think 

it does very much for the streetscape, but there was 

indication this evening from the architect that that's going 

to be changed.   

          So I don't know if there are any plans we can see

now of what the proposed changes are, and I -- so it's a 

question whether anything new exists for us to look at, I 

guess.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So perhaps Erik could address 

the Urban Design concerns that were laid out and fill us in 

as to whether they're -- he has seen additional, more 

detailed additional information?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Hello, this is Erik Thorkildsen 

again, CDD.  Yes, the things that were mentioned just in the 

presentation and in the images that we saw are new to us 

also.   

          We sort of had the same thoughts that Ted had, in 

terms of can the façade -- the storefront contribute more to 

the street?  It doesn't seem to need to have the level of 

opacity.  It doesn't seem to need it for any level of 

opacity to keep sight lines from the salesfloor. 

          The question about the exit door flinging out into 

the street -- it basically looks like another go-around 

ought to be had on the façade.  I'm not really sure how to 

address the kind of suggestions that were made to how it 

might be changed.  It would be good to see drawings. 

          The drawings in this set are also different in

plan and elevation, so it's -- you know, it's a bit hard to 

interpret.   

          A few thoughts on the site plan also, but that 

might want to be a separate question.  So I think I'll leave 

it at that for now, unless Ted wants -- Ted or Hugh want 

more thoughts to try to make out -- 

          The question of being able to identify the entry 

door and distinguish it from the exit door I think is kind 

of important.  The façade is designed -- current design is 

to really make that a very subtle distinction, rather than 

sort of celebrate it as a kind of gift to the public into 

the street.  It seems an opportunity lost. 

          And keeping in mind in the bigger picture that the 

existing building is pretty undistinguished.  It's currently 

empty, so the site is -- so the project is a great 

opportunity to contribute to the streetscape.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.       

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Hugh, do you have any questions that 

--            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have no questions, no.       

          MARY FLYNN:  No questions.  Okay, all right.

Steve or Niko, questions?                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I have no questions.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Well, then let's 

move on to -- oh, wait.  Before we do that, I do have one 

question.  It wasn't clear to me -- and this is for the 

proponent -- the application talked about the larger 

building.   

          There was reference made to units.  And I wasn't 

clear on that whether they were residential units or office 

units?  Could you just kind of give us an overview of, you 

know, who are the tenants?   

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  On the first floor it's all 

retail.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  On the floors above, there are 

two offices, and above that two residential.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Two residential, okay.  And do those 

residential people have spaces in the back as well?   

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  Yes, they each get two.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And have they been completely 

informed about the proposal? 

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  Yes.

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, okay.  Just while we're on the 

topic of the residents, can you just briefly describe the 

public outreach that you did on this?   

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  We met with a number of City 

Councillors.  We had two community outreach meetings.  We 

had two meetings with the Porter Square Neighborhood 

Association, and we also met with the Agassiz Baldwin Group 

as well.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And were any changes made 

based on -- any comments that were made in those meetings?  

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  If you're looking at the 

property, in one of the photos you'll see to the left of the 

parking lot is property owned by the MBTA, but it's been 

like that for years.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.                  

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  So we agreed with the Porter 

Square Neighborhood Association that we'll work with -- you 

know, we'll contact the MBTA about cleaning that up and 

we'll pay for the cleaning up and the planting of trees and 

work with the city arborist, as well as for the front but 

also that side, because that has been a serious issue for 

the community by the way that's looked for years.

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And can you just clarify the 

status of that spot that was identified for the Uber?  Is it 

something that is secured at this point, or is it under 

discussion?               

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  No, so a couple of things.  We 

have two spots assigned to us.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          MARY JANE WALLNER:  One spot is for employee.  The 

other spot is for loading an unloading, and could also be 

used for purposes or -- are used for Uber and pickup and 

drop-off. 

          As a result of all these discussions, in the other 

businesses located in the area, the property owner put an 

additional location for Uber pickup and drop-off.   

          Our plan is to very much push alternative 

transportation, public transportation to come to the site on 

our website, that there's minimal parking available, and 

that to put signage up to ensure that drop-off and pickup is 

in the parking lot.   

          When you drive out of the parking lot to the left 

or coming in to the right, there are -- what do you call 

them, the yellow things?  There's protection so people can

walk in and out of the parking lot without getting hit by 

cars.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.                 

          WALTER SULLIVAN:  There's metal poles put up.  So 

it does give good access for people to walk in and out of 

the parking lot and not worry.   

          The parking lot is small, but to deal with one of 

the issues, the -- according to the Building Commissioner, 

that parking lot is grandfathered in, although the back of 

it is in the residential district.  It's grandfathered in 

because it's been there for so long, so it could be used for 

commercial use.   

          The parking spaces on the side of the building are 

actually located in the CB -- in the BC District, because 

it's within 100 feet of the street.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that 

clarification.  So as the Board had no other questions at 

this time, left move on to Board discussion.  And why don't 

we start with Hugh, who can give us some thoughts on design, 

I'm sure.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  I was actually rather taken 

with the modernist design or redesign of the storefront.

And I think, you know, Erik has pointed out the couple of 

problems that needed to be resolved and, you know, something 

that we need to be able to see into the waiting area. 

          Although if you notice, there was a rendering they 

presented.  It was a view of the restaurant, their property 

and the H&R Block.  And you couldn't see into either the 

restaurant or H&R Block.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It was just black.  So what you -- 

it's really -- when you're up close as a pedestrian, walking 

down the sidewalk, if you can get a -- yeah, that's the 

bottom photo there.  You really can't see anything much of 

what's going on inside --  

          MARY FLYNN:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- with two adjacent things, but if 

the waiting room is well lit, if the glass is relatively 

clear -- at least the part that's in the -- sort of like the 

entry side --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Maybe one way you could resolve the 

difference between the entry and the exit door is you could 

keep the leaf pattern on the exit door and the upper portion 

117

and have the clear glass into the right of the frame.  That 

would be one technique you might want to consider of 

differentiating that. 

          But if the lobby is bright, if there's some nice 

stuff on the walls that makes it -- attracts the eye, 

whether it's -- you know, artistic or whatever, I think you 

can create a little bit of interest, and that's about all 

the opportunity you have.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I guess that's my comment on the 

exterior.  I think we can continue on -- we can make a 

decision and list these items as things they have to keep 

working with staff.   

          Erik's a tough taskmaster, we can rely upon him 

getting the best outcome that can be achieved for the city.  

He's also a nice guy, but he's --        

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- which doesn't hurt in that kind 

of a job.  The -- you know, this is -- we've seen almost a 

dozen of these types of establishments.  You know, yes, the 

front waiting room is small.  You'll need to have a

reservation only protocol too, so that people don't end up 

queuing outside.  At some point in time, that will probably 

no longer be necessary.  The -- I think the traffic and 

parking conditions address that question. 

          There is an opportunity for queuing inside, 

because there's a stretch of 20 feet or so before you get to 

the point of sale terminals.  So I think it's -- from what 

we've been hearing, we think this is workable, you know. 

          The other thing: I'm very personally impressed 

with the applicant and the variety of businesses that they 

have generated and are operating.   

          I live a couple blocks from the former Riles 

building.  You know, that -- what they've done there is 

really terrific.  They're adding housing, they're restoring 

a historic appearance. 

          And I think that's the norm for these people.  

They go into a place and they make it better.  So I have 

every reason to believe that this new venture of theirs will 

be done to the same standard. 

          As you know, the actual criteria for granting the 

permit are very limited.  It's a -- the city has decided 

this is an appropriate business in this district, and with

the kinds of attention that have been given to it and the 

conditions that have been suggested by the Traffic and 

Parking Department and the Community Development Department, 

I think this can be a successful business. 

          So, you know, I don't really have any criticisms 

to put forward.  I think we can do this.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Steve?    

What are your thoughts?   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  My thoughts, well I'll tell you 

my thoughts.  My thoughts are that this is a great immigrant 

story in America.  This is a great family story about small 

business in America.  Those really affect me, and they're 

totally irrelevant to our application, unfortunately.   

          Unfortunately, we have to deal with the law here, 

and, you know, we're -- you know, looking at the details of 

a little retail establishment that if we're any other retail 

establishment, we wouldn't even be looking at it.  Even if 

it was a liquor store, we wouldn't be looking at it. 

          So nevertheless, you know, that's our 

responsibility to look at it.  And frankly, the only part 

that I'm interested in looking at, the only element that I 

think we as a Board should generally be looking at is the

façade. 

          And ordinarily, we shouldn't even be looking at 

that for retailing.  But, you know, under this law, you 

know, we have that right and perhaps our responsibility. 

          So, you know, I think that the approach that 

they're taking probably would not work in all locations.  I 

think personally that it's an interesting approach that 

can/could/does work in this location, and I would be, you 

know, happy to defer to staff to work out the details of 

that façade. 

          I think that, you know, the Board should give, you 

know, some limited guidance are we okay with that general 

approach, or do we want to see a more conventional approach 

with see-through glass?  I personally don't, you know, feel 

the need for a conventional approach, I like the approach 

that they're taking. 

          But beyond the façade, I don't feel the need for 

this Board to be looking into much more detail.  Great 

family business -- I wish them the best of luck.  I think we 

should give them the go ahead and let the staff to work out 

the remaining details.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Ted?

Any other --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No, I was interested in Hugh's 

comments and Steve's comments, and I'm perfectly willing to 

leave the issue of the façade to be worked out between the 

architect and staff.  You know, I think it's unusual, and 

maybe that's what it should be. 

          I had some concerns that this was very little 

parking, and that it was going to be really dependent upon 

public transportation, but Adam in Traffic and Parking 

seemed to be quite happy with the situation.   

          And when you compare it to Harvard Square and 

Central Square and other places, you know, it is a 

transportation hub, and there are many, many ways of getting 

there.  So I'm perfectly content to go forward, and subject 

to the conditions of Traffic and Parking and CDD and, you 

know, proceed.         

thoughts?                 

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And Niko, what are your 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  I don't really, I'm happy 

to defer about this as well.  I think otherwise everything 

is fine.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  And I agree with

my fellow Board members.  I think the design does need a 

little work, but it is something that can be addressed by 

staff.  And I will admit, seeing the photographs of the 

properties -- the other properties that the applicant owns, 

you know, does give me, you know, reason to believe this 

this façade will be successful.   

          You know, they've done a very nice job of fixing 

up their other properties, and -- you know, and as others 

have said, it's quite the immigrant story and a small 

business owner story. 

          Okay, so it sounds then as though we are ready to 

grant the special permit, if we can make the findings.  So 

in order to grant the permit, the Board would have to 

approve the criteria that are listed in the cannabis retail 

store sections 11.8.   

          There's a section that says, "Complies with zoning 

requirements" which this does, and that has to do with the -

- you know, the distance from other facilities and no 

packaging, et cetera, et cetera.  

          The special permit criteria are the site design 

provides convenient, safe and secure access and egress for 

clients and employees arriving to and leaving from the site,

using all modes of transportation, including drivers, 

pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation uses.   

          The location and design of the use will not 

detract from the sense of activity, with opaque, unwelcoming 

facades at ground floor and retail areas. 

          Loading, refuse and service areas are to be 

designed to be secure and shield from abutting uses.  

Building and site are designed to be compatible with other 

buildings in the area, and to mitigate any negative 

aesthetic impacts, that might result from required security 

measures and restrictions on visibility into the building's 

interior. 

          And the last in that section is the facility will 

provide programs to assist qualifying patients in obtaining 

services in Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana program. 

          I don't think we discussed that specifically, but 

Jeff you can fill me in as to whether we need to clarify 

that particular point.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, this is Jeff Roberts.  I 

think that they did make a statement about that there would 

be sort of a one of the areas would provide service to 

medical patients.

          This is something that the City Council was 

interested in in creating the zoning, but there are also 

state regulations and requirements that come into play.   

          I think some of those might be changing at some 

point, regarding what kinds of services and adult-use or 

retail cannabis store can provide to qualifying medical 

patients.  But they have addressed that in their 

application.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, great.  Thank you.  Okay.  So 

there's those, and then there's the General Special Permit 

Criteria in Section 10.43.  So does the Board feel 

comfortable?  It sounds as though we do, based on what 

you've said.   

          But just to clarify for sure, for the record, is 

everyone comfortable that -- in an agreement that the 

project does meet the special permit criteria in both 

Section 11.8 and --      

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, okay. Yes.  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  There is one thing I would like to 

add as a condition.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That the locus map be corrected.  

Because right now the locus map shows a circle which is 

labeled at 1800 feet, but is actually about 3000 feet, and 

as it currently shows the 1686 Mass Avenue dispensary is 

inside the circle.  So --        

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- they need to correct that 

drawing so that we have in our files the proper drawing at 

the proper scale.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Yes.  Thank you for pointing 

that out, Hugh.  That is important.  Okay.  Let me go back, 

then.  Okay.  So we are able to make the findings, with the 

conditions included in the CDD and TP&T memos.   

          There are also the standard conditions for 

continuing review and certification by staff that the 

conditions are met.  We have the added condition that Hugh 

just mentioned of fixing the locus map.   

          Are there any other suggestions from staff as to 

other things that we should be adding to the motion?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No.  I believe everything is 

covered in the staff reports.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Reports, okay.  All right.  So then, 

126

is there a motion to grant the requested special permits 

with those conditions, based on the Board's finding that the 

applicable special permit criteria are met?  Jeff is going 

to call the roll in a minute.  Please remember to say your 

name, and we'll need a first and a second.  So will someone 

make the motion?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah, Steven Cohen, so moved.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  And is there a second?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Hugh Russell, second.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, Hugh.  Roll call, then, 

Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On the motion, Ted Cohen?      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steve Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Mary Flynn?

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  So that concludes the 

business on our agenda.  Are there any other comments or 

items that staff needs to mention?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  No to the Chair.  I don't have 

anything else, and I do not see anyone else from staff jump 

in so I think we're don't even.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, Board members do you have 

anything else?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No.         

          MARY FLYNN:  No.  Okay.  Well, in that case, the 

meeting is adjourned.  Thank you all very much.
