          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good evening, and 

welcome to the October 27, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board.  My name is Catherine Preston Connolly, and 

I am the Chair. 

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

September 2, 2020.  

                    This meeting is being video and audio 

recorded, and is being streamed live on the City of

Cambridge online meeting portal and on cable television 

Channel 22, within Cambridge.  There will also be a 

transcript of the proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their name before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

          I'll start by asking the Staff to take Board 

member attendance and verify that all members are audible.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Catherine, this is Jeff 

Roberts from Community Development with the most exciting 

part of every meeting.  I'm just going to ask for Planning 

Board members to and can that you're present, and to confirm 

that the meeting is audible to you.    

          Louis Bacci, are you present and is the meeting 

audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Present and audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  H Theodore Cohen,

Department.  Whoever's speaking this evening, could you 

introduce the staff present at the meeting and give the 

update?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Catherine.  Me again --

attendance tonight:  Swaathi Joseph on my staff, who is -- 

as always -- helping to run the meeting.   

          Also with Zoning and Development we have -- I'm 

sorry, I'm just checking the list -- Daniel Messplay is 

present and Liza Paden with the Urban Design Team.  In 

Community Development, Erik Thorkildsen is here, and also 

from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department 

Joseph Barr is present.  And there may be some other staff 

members in attendance who will introduce themselves as they 

come in. 

          And then just moving to the quick update.  Looking 

ahead, next week there is no Planning Board meeting.  

Everyone please vote.   

          On November 10, we'll pick up again with Planning 

Board business, and we will be meeting every week possibly 

until the end of time.   

          We have scheduled hearings on November 10 for the 

Canal District Kendall Planning Unit Development Zoning 

District; this is one the Planning Board has heard before; 

it's been refiled and there will be an update at that 

meeting.   

          The Ordinance Committee is having its hearing on 

8

that November 12. 

          November 17, the Board will have its first public 

hearing on a zoning amendment for the MXD Zoning District.  

This is a proposal that's associated with the multiparty 

plan to move the Eversource, or to try to site the 

Eversource electrical substation in a different location 

than where it's currently anticipated on Fulkerson Street.  

          So that's a hearing that will be at the Ordinance 

Committee -- that's a petition that will be heard at the 

Ordinance Committee on November 19.   

          And then we're still working out the schedule for 

upcoming meetings.   

          But for those of you who have been paying 

attention to City Council, there have been several zoning 

petitions that have been referred over the past month.  So 

we'll be sliding those into the schedule, as well as some 

returning special permit cases; some new special permit 

case, and some other things. 

          So I will just turn it back over to Catherine.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Jeff.

                  Bacci, Jr., Steven A. Cohen, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, and    

                  Corinne Espinoza  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  The next item 

on the agenda is a Preapplication Conference with MIT for 

the Volpe Parcel Planning Unit Development pursuant to 

Sections #13.91.5 and 12.33 of the zoning ordinance.  We'll 

start -- again -- by having CDD Staff summarizing why this 

is before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you. Jeff Roberts one more 

time.  So this item is a Preapplication Conference.  The PUD 

zoning procedures in Article 12 of the zoning ordinance 

allow a developer to request a preapplication conference 

before filing a development proposal, which is the formal 

application for a special permit. 

          And the zoning in this particular zoning district 

requires such a preapplication conference. 

          As described in Article 12, the purpose of the 

preapplication conference is to familiarize both the 

developer and the Planning Board with each other's 

intentions with respect to the PUD.

          The developer's role is to discuss the range of 

options concerning development and inform the Planning Board 

of the development concept. 

          And the Planning Board's role is to familiarize 

the developer with the review process and explain issues 

that should be considered in planning the project.   

          And one -- I will quote one part of the zoning 

that's relevant -- "Any statement made by either the 

Planning Board or the developer concerning potential 

disposition of a special permit application of the final 

form of the development shall not be legally binding." 

          So that's really a way of saying that this is 

meant to be a conversation.  It doesn't reflect any final 

proposals or any kind of binding commitments, it's just an 

opportunity to talk about the proposal and get some thoughts 

out on the table before it becomes a formal review process. 

          And for us on Staff, we haven't prepared any 

written materials on this.  We have had some meetings with 

the development team to talk about this concept on a couple 

of occasions recently, and so the staff who are present are 

also available to answer questions or provide any input as 

the Board may like.  Thanks.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, great.  Then 

we'll next hear from MIT.  I understand Michael Owu from MIT 

Investment Management Company is going to kick off the 

proceedings; is that correct?   

          MICHAEL OWU:  That is correct.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Well, 

then please begin by introducing yourself and any other 

speakers from your team, and then begin your presentation.  

You'll have approximately 30 minutes, unless we decide to 

continue the conversation.   

          MICHAEL OWU:  All right, thank you very many.  And 

Jeff, could you allow us to share a screen, please?  So good 

evening, Madam Chair and members of the Board.  Again, my 

name is Michael Owu, managing Director of Real Estate at the 

MIT Investment Management Company, and I'm leading this 

phase of the Volpe Redevelopment Project. 

          It's a pleasure to be here before the Board for 

this prefiling conference, and we look forward to hearing 

your thoughts and perspectives on the Master Plan. 

          We held our community meeting last Wednesday with 

over 140 attendees.  We also met with residential neighbors 

at 303 Third Street, and our colleagues of the Cambridge

Redevelopment Authority last week, and we are meeting with 

the East Cambridge Planning Team tomorrow. 

          And of course, as Jeff mentioned, we have had many 

meetings with City Staff over the past several weeks, and 

we've got more meetings coming up. 

          So you all know the site, and many of you were 

involved in the early planning phases over the last many 

years, and we thank you for your support getting us to this 

stage.  MIT's goal for this site is to redevelop it as an 

inclusive, diverse, vibrant and welcoming mixed-use 

community, where all users can participate in a shared 

innovation environment. 

          We hope our focus on equity and innovation in this 

development will be an example for all.  This is our agenda 

for today.  I'll let individual speakers introduce 

themselves from the -- when they come up.  And per the 

instructions, we will try to keep this to about 30 minutes. 

          We do have a few of our team members presenting 

this evening, but we have others on the call, who can answer 

any technical questions that might come up.  I'll now turn 

it over to Sarah.     

          SARAH GALLOP:  Thank you, Michael.  I'm Sarah

Gallop from MIT.  Good evening, Planning Board members and 

everyone.  It's wonderful to see you all.  

           As we begin, I think it's important for us to 

acknowledge that we bring this project to you in 

unprecedented times.  The coronavirus and the national 

reckoning around racial justice influenced all of our 

thoughts and actions, including our planning for the Volpe 

Redevelopment. 

          You'll see our steady focus on equity and 

inclusion throughout the presentation, but I'd like to take 

a few moments now to share with you how MIT and the city 

have been working together during COVID to protect our 

shared community. 

          COVID will definitely go down as one of the most 

high-stakes chapters of the Town Gown relationship.  From 

the get-go, the city and MIT knew instinctively that we had 

to fully support one another and maintain daily contact on 

all aspects of the virus. 

          Here are some examples of our collaborations.  The 

image on the bottom left depicts how the MIT community 

banded together through fundraisers, auctions and direct 

contributions to get $65,000 out quickly to local non-

profits that were actively supporting our neighbors. 

          The images on the right are our PPE efforts.  One 

was to get 40,000 face shields fabricated by MIT's Project 

Manus out to Cambridge First Responders, and the other was 

to distribute 900,000 other pieces of PPE to local 

hospitals, emergency responders and non-profits.   

          In other areas, we immediately suspended rent 

indefinitely for our 33 retail tenants.  As a result of that 

support, 32 are now up and running again. 

          We contributed $50,000 to the Mayor's Disaster 

Relief Fund, $250,000 towards the creation of the War 

Memorial homeless shelter, and $250,000 for COVID testing 

for Cambridge residents. 

          For our young Cambridge learners, we developed and 

launched a 10-week K-12 online enrichment program called, 

"Full Steam Ahead" and just recently we delivered nearly 50 

new desks to students who are learning from home. 

          And finally, and MIT neuroscience faculty member 

has been cochairing the city's COVID expert advisory panel 

since March. 

          I tell you all this because I believe our shared 

COVID experience has opened up new doors of understanding

and collaboration between the city and MIT that I think will 

also help us to face future challenges together. 

          But regardless of any silver lining, we're all 

devastated at the loss of 100 Cambridge residents to the 

virus.   

          Moving on to Volpe, amazingly the Volpe Project 

has been supporting the community, even though it hasn't yet 

begun.  This slide shows scenes from three years of Volpe 

block parties -- this year's was virtual, but still fun -- 

and an image of what the new CVS that we're bringing into 

Kendall might look like.  You'll recall that a drugstore was 

the second-most requested item in the Kendall zoning. 

          It also shows a group of participants in one of 

the Job Connector's programs, and Brothers Marketplace at 

One Broadway, which we opened last year.  You'll remember 

that a grocery store was THE most asked for item in the 

Kendall zoning.   

          As part of the Volpe zoning, the City Council 

asked us to open the Job Connector as early as possible.  We 

did open it early, in April 2019, at a terrific location in 

the Port at 792 Main Street.  The Job Connector is a free 

workforce development hub for Cambridge residents, where we

provide a variety of job readiness and career preparedness 

services. 

          We've hosted information technology and 

construction trade training programs, helped to hire 

Cambridge residents at Brothers Marketplace, and because of 

COVID, we've run virtual programs on unemployment benefits. 

          We're about to launch a five-week career pathway 

program for young men jointly with My Brother's Keeper 

beginning in November.  

          The pictures on this slide are of our Job 

Connector's staff doing their thing, creating relationships, 

getting the word out about our programs and coaching 

clients.  As you know, the zoning requires that the Job 

Connector be part of the community center in the Volpe 

project, so we'll have to sort out how that will all work. 

          These next two slides summarize the work that 

we've all been engaged in, as we've imagined the future of 

Kendall Square.   

          This timeline shows the process leading up to the 

approval of our Kendall PUD-5 zoning and development plan.   

The studies, analysis and dialogue that informed our 

collective thinking go back to 2008, when we first started

talking with all of you about Kendall. 

          The city's K-2 planning study in particular was 

instrumental in establishing a forward-looking mixed-use 

framework for the Kendall area. 

          This slide shows the more recent history leading 

up to the approval of the Volpe PUD-7 zoning in 2017.  In a 

similar fashion, city staff, the City Council and the 

Planning Board led the Envisioning process, and the city's 

Volpe Working Group established a clear path forward by 

developing planning and urban design principles for the 

site. 

          So what happens after all that kind of collective 

work?  Here are images of some of the elements of the 

Kendall Square initiative.   

          From the top left, you can see Shy Bird restaurant 

at One Broadway, new retail along Broad Canal Way, the 

graduate student housing building in the heart of Kendall, 

the future MBTA head house, the MIT museum right next to the 

T, a rendering of 165 Main Street, which will include 300 

new residential units. 

          And these are just some of the features of the 

Kendall project.  I want to pause as we look at this

sampling of images, and acknowledge that we all did this 

together -- MIT, City Staff, Planning Board, City Council 

and the community -- and we should be proud of what we've 

accomplished.   

          At our kick off Volpe Community Meeting last week, 

the community center was the most discussed element of the 

proposal.  It's a critical feature of the Volpe 

Redevelopment, because it will bring people together from 

nearby neighbors and broader Cambridge in a positive and 

active environment. 

          In 2017, these were the most popular programming 

ideas for the community center on the slide.  Our first 

follow-up meeting will be dedicated to this topic, so we can 

decide together on the best programming for 2020 and beyond. 

          Finally, I'd like to say a bit about our values, 

as we approach the redevelopment of the Volpe site.  When we 

started, of course, we knew that we didn't want Volpe to be 

a traditional office park.  We'd already learned so much 

from the Kendall Square process about what kind of uses 

truly create community, what welcoming and inviting really 

feels like, and what sorts of amenities and programming 

actually catalyze synergies and collaboration.

          All of you helped us to understand those dynamics.  

          In our planning, we've been relying on all that we 

learned before, but we want to focus even more on equity and 

diversity.  Our affordable housing community center, diverse 

retail really opened open space and the Job Connector can 

all help to move the needle on these fronts.   

          And now the conversation around equity and 

diversity has evolved into a sharper focus on issues related 

to racial equity.  Many of us at MIT are working to 

understand how to become anti-racists; the concept that 

Ibram Kendi is trying to teach the world.  We're engaging in 

seminars, small group discussions, workshops and long-term 

programs.   

lives. 

          We want to learn and understand, and then apply 

those learnings and understandings to the Volpe 

Redevelopment, and indeed to all of our work, and to our 

          As we pursue this work, we've asked Roosevelt 

Smith to rejoin our team.  Roosevelt helped us to discern 

the Job Connector's role and mission in Cambridge, and now 

he's going to help us think through the role and mission of 

the community center, retail, open space, innovation

up meetings later. 

          You'll hear more from Roosevelt about our follow-

          And now I'd like to turn it over to Anthony 

Galluccio, who will provide an overview of the Volpe zoning 

parameters, as well as our community benefit commitments.  

Anthony?   

          ANTHONY GALLUCCIO:  Thank you, and good evening, 

Madam Chair and members of the Board.  And thank you, Sarah.  

First, Sarah, I want to thank you.  I was fortunate to serve 

with Sarah on the COVID Relief Task Force, and I can tell 

you that she was on speed dial for the last six months, and 

her energy is contagious.  

          I also want to thank you, Sarah, for your work 

energizing the Job Connector, which has led to your 

leadership around equity for this project.  Thank you. 

          I'm going to be very brief with respect to the 

zoning overview.  Most of members of the Board approved this 

zoning and participated in it and influenced its literal 

form, so I'm not going to take too much time.  But as a 

refresher, I'll go through a few major elements of the

zoning, as well as some of the commitments.   

          First is the height of the project.  As you'll 

see, north of Monroe Street moving towards Binney Street 

towards the neighborhood, it's a lower height regime.  

Moving south towards Broadway, floor plates are regulated.  

As you go up in height, floor plates must be less than 

15,000.  Above 250 feet, floor plates above 250 cannot 

occupy more than 10 percent, only of the land area.   

          Only one residential goes above 350, and must be 

less than -- excuse me -- only one can go above 300, and 

only one residential can go to 500.  And we don't have that 

in the plan, as you'll hear from David.  Gross floor area 

maximum is 3,250,000.  These are for small exemptions that I 

won't read, but just want to remind folks.   

          One of the major pieces that Sarah talked about in 

all of the Kendall planning going back to Iram and Jeff's 

early work around K2 was requiring a balance of residential.  

          The project requires 40 percent permitted GFA must 

be residential.  20 percent of that is required to be under 

the city's inclusionary.  That means as much as 280 

affordable units out of 1400 total units.   

          Residential phasing:  Obviously a critical piece

that residential has developed along the course of the 

development of the project.  Nonresidential must exceed 60 

percent permitted GFA.  The full completion of 

nonresidential GFA shall not be allowed before substantial 

construction has commenced on all residential buildings.  So 

this is -- this relates to the residential phasing piece. 

          We have a commitment letter as well.  Some of that 

relates to housing.  Many of you will remember the campaign 

that was waged during the Volpe process for MIT to increase 

its graduate student housing and take pressure off the 

Cambridge housing market.  MIT committed to 950 graduate 

student beds.  We also committed to 20 middle-income units 

and 5 percent innovation housing. 

          Open space, when we unveiled the zoning, we got a 

pretty good response, because we were heavy on housing open 

space and retail.  25 percent of the land area will be 

publicly beneficial open space, two acres open space 

permanently guaranteed for public use, 10-foot buffer along 

Lowry walkway, Sixth Street walkway actually doing much 

better than that -- and I'll let Michael and David talk 

about that. 

          And an incentive that a freestanding community

center counts towards publicly beneficial open space 

obviously an incentive to have a stand-alone building there. 

          Active ground floor I've talked about.  This is 

not a surprise.  It comes from all that planning work, 

focuses on frontages along Broadway and Third, and requires 

smaller retail locations which are also independent and 

local.   

          Very quickly, I think I've talked a lot about 

housing.  The community benefits, which are included in the 

zoning and commitment letter, $25.5 million for the 

community center.  I've talked about the open space. 

          The Job Connector, which Sarah talks with such 

excitement about -- far more than what is required has been 

spent to open up that space on Main Street in the Port.  $36 

million in required linkage approximately, and then $8.5 

million for transit improvements and $8.5 million to the 

Community Fund, which -- some of which was used for COVID 

relief.  That's a $10 per square foot requirement on 

commercial square footage in the zoning. 

          You probably remember the push for us to finalize 

Grand Junction Path, which included $8.5 million as well as 

conveyance of rights -- and then various other funds for

arts -- requirements that we continue to use advisory 

councils throughout the project; innovation and 

entrepreneurship, as well as a tax requirement so that we're 

continuing to pay taxes.  The project is currently tax-

exempt, and could mean as much as $23 million dollars 

annually to the city upon buildout. 

          At this time, I want to introduce our Project 

Manager, Michael Owu, to go through further context.   

          MICHAEL OWU:  Thank you, Anthony.  Before we get 

into the Master Plan, quick update on the federal building.  

As many of you recall, as part of the transaction with the 

federal government, we paid $750 million dollars to acquire 

the land, but the first thing that we have to do is build a 

new building for the federal government.   

          So as you can see in the image on the top left, we 

started construction.  We actually just started erection a 

couple weeks ago.  The image on the right shows what it will 

look like when it's completed. 

          One of the features that we're most looking 

forward to is the generous landscape along Fifth Street that 

will feature an art installation by Maya Lin in 

collaboration with Hilderbrand.

          During the zoning process, we presented four site 

options -- some of you may recall.  They were all consistent 

with the approved zoning, with four commercial buildings, 

four residential buildings, and as I mentioned, the 25 

percent open space. 

          The Master Plan that will be presented tonight is 

refinement of example 4.  As you can see in example 1, we 

started out proposing a commercial building at the prime 

location on the corner of Third Street and Broadway.  We 

responded to the strong community desire for open space on 

that corner, which is why we are pursuing Option 4. 

          Throughout the development of the plan, we made 

sure it was consistent with the planning principles that 

came out of the excellent work of the Volpe Working Group.  

In part, we want to make sure the principle of inclusiveness 

guides and informs our overall planning. 

          As you can see in this image, our plan is to break 

up a super block by extending the grid of city streets 

through the site; Fifth Street extending north to Binney 

Street and south to Broadway; Potter Street and Broad Canal 

Way extending west to Lowry Way.   

          On parking, there are 570 parking spaces in the

Volpe site all used by the federal government.  When the 

project is built out, there will be a little under 2200 

parking spaces, almost all of which will be below grade, 

with access on Broadway, Potter Street and Munroe Street.   

          318 of these parking spaces will be used by the 

federal government, and the rest will be shared between the 

new commercial and residential uses.  The overall parking 

ratio of the site will go from the previous 1.4 per thousand 

gross square feet of floor area to about half that; 0.68 per 

thousand. 

          The importance of maintaining tree canopy in the 

city is an issue of which we are acutely aware.  From the 

beginning of the Volpe process, it's been clear that trees 

will be impacted in order to accomplish the goals for the 

site.  We spent months evaluating the trees and trying to 

balance competing needs. 

          On MIT's Volpe development site, we're pleased 

that we can preserve over 90 percent of the street trees 

that border the site, as well as setback nearly 50 feet from 

Lowry Way; significantly more than the 10 feet required by 

zoning, to celebrate and enhance the walkway and ensure the 

continued health for trees along the path.

          However, we will have to remove 132 trees.  We 

have developed a robust planting plan that will add back 

approximately 214 trees for a net increase of 82 trees.   

          The new canopy will be more diverse and resilient 

than what is there today.  This will result in long-term 

benefits in the near future as the trees grow and mature, 

they will far exceed the carbon sequestration, stormwater 

benefit and contribution to air quality in much of the site 

today, as shown in the three graphs at the bottom of this 

slide. 

          In the short term, the slight increase in the 

number of trees: There will be a caliper inch deficit.  To 

address this, we are working with the city and DCR to 

develop a mechanism to add tree canopy, particularly in our 

adjacent neighborhoods. 

          Sustainability has also been an important 

foundational component of our planning.  At the outset, we 

set out to be a leader in sustainability on this site.  We 

are focused on the four areas shown on this slide.   

          In addition, we are designing every building to 

achieve LEED goal rating, raising the entire 14-acre site to 

the 2070 hundred-year flood elevation, and incorporating on-

site renewable energy with solar PV wherever we can. 

          Two of the most exciting highlights of our 

sustainability program are shown on this slide.  First, we 

are committing to zero-emissions residential buildings.  To 

achieve this, all four residential buildings -- 

approximately 1400 units -- will be all electric.  This 

represents one of the largest all electric residential 

projects in the region, with zero onsite emissions from 

fossil fuels. 

          In addition, we've established a pathway for 

getting to all electric commercial buildings, and will 

evaluate each building against this pathway, as it 

approaches Design Review. 

          We're also excited to incorporate an onsite 

blackwater treatment plant to reuse building water, making 

it the largest urban system in the northeast. 

          We'll be applying for a Master Plan special 

permit, and will not be seeking approval for individual 

building designs at this stage.   

          When we come back to the Planning Board for Design 

review, we'll be guided by detailed design guidelines for 

each building and site, similar to those used at Cambridge

Crossing -- building on the work we did with Eric and Iram 

and Councillors Carlone and [46:11 indiscernible proper 

name] because in 2017.   

through the Master Plan.     

          Now I'll turn it over to David, who will walk you 

          DUNCAN MACARTHUR:  Good evening, everyone.  I am 

David Manfredi from Elkus Manfredi Architects.  Our proposal 

for a special permit, as Michael mentioned, is based on 

example 4.  Our criteria for evolution of the four options 

were many, but the most important are these three. 

          Number 1, the location and the configuration of 

open spaces, which together make up a diverse and connected 

network.  Most important is the large park space at Third 

and Broadway.  We're calling this, "Third Street Park." Some 

of our earlier schemes proposed a lab building on this most 

valuable parcel, but this is the option that best connects 

the park space to public ways -- to Broadway and to Third 

Street.  It is the gateway site into Kendall Square, and it 

is the location favored by the neighborhood. 

          Second, criteria number 2 is the connectivity to 

surrounding land use, adjacent open space, and to the 

network of surrounding streets and paths.

22

          And criteria 3 is the positive environmental 

impacts -- the optimal view corridors and the very best 

solar exposure to the biggest park space. 

          It really is quite extraordinary to have this kind 

of planning opportunity in a mature and historic city in the 

neighborhood -- to be able to create significant new parks 

in the Harvard District, and new civic realm that will be 

inclusive gathering space for diverse stakeholders -- for 

neighbors, residents, students, visitors and workers. 

          Third Street Park, you'll see in the lower right-

hand corner, is truly civic space, connected by Broad Canal 

Way and by Wadsworth Street to the Charles River in two 

different directions.   

          The Volpe art line and Fifth Street promenade will 

connect East Cambridge to Kendall Square.  And the Sixth 

Street Walkway will be expanded to create Sixth Street Park.  

          This view looks west along Broad Canal Way and 

Third Street Park on your left.  Broad Canal Way is truly a 

multimodal street where pedestrians and bike are the 

preferred guests, increasing the opportunity for casual 

interactions. 

          Each building has street-level frontage that

houses food and shops, studio space and maker space, music 

and services.  Our goal is to make a destination steeped in 

innovation and creative invention that is a social mixing 

bowl of people, events and activity. 

          The intersection of Fifth and Broadway is the 

crossroads at the center of the site, with four corners of 

active edges and uses that engage pedestrians.  There's food 

and entertainment at street level; workplaces and residences 

above, open space and the community center, which you see 

just to the very edge of the right-hand side. 

          The Fifth Street promenade is the new direct 

connection from Binney to Broadway. 

          This view is looking west on Potter, with 303 

Third on my right.  And Potter is the address for three of 

our residential buildings, appropriate opposite 303.  There 

are no back sides to any of these new blocks, which are 

relatively small in size, enhancing walkability of the 

neighborhood. 

          This massing diagram is just that -- it's a 

diagram that reflects all the dimensional requirements of 

the DUB.  These are not buildings; they're blocks from which 

many architects will work to make architecture.  There are

four commercial buildings in pink, four residential 

buildings in light yellow, and at the center of the 

community building.  The design objective is outstanding 

architecture -- innovative and sustainable and tangibly part 

of Cambridge. 

          The zoning program is fully consistent with the 

PUD without change. And it includes the 60/40 ratio of 

commercial and residential space.   

          And the open space exceeds the required 2.5 acres.  

The anchors of Broad Canal Way are open space, not 

buildings.  The anchors are Third Street Park and Sixth 

Street Park.  The special attractions are the community 

center and the entertain venue, which Kristen will describe.   

          Looking north on Fifth, with the Volpe Center on 

your left, the Volpe Art Lawn is a different kind of park; a 

linear park connecting neighborhood to Kendall Square to the 

Red Line and to the Charles River. 

          Now, Gary Hilderbrand will continue on open space.   

          GARY HILDERBRAND:  Good evening, everyone.  I'm 

Gary Hilderbrand, a Project Landscape Architect, and it's a 

pleasure to be here with you all tonight. 

          I'm excited to explain little bit more detail how

our plan will build regularly scaled city blocks here -- as 

David said, a most unusual opportunity -- with walkable 

streets and modes and squares. 

          It's a distributed, highly connective 

notwithstanding of public realm open space, including the 

two new parks that David has mentioned, which will welcome a 

diverse community throughout.  None of this space will be 

privatized. 

          Every bit of landscape space here is inclusive and 

accessible -- it's all on public ways.  The Lowry Walkway 

expanded with the new park space; Fifth Street completed 

from Binney Street to Broadway with a wide sidewalk and 

promenade; Broad Canal way building in excess East of Third 

Street and now traveling all the way past the community 

center and past Fifth Street, and then connecting via a 

passage to the Sixth Street Extension -- Lowry Walkway, and 

then the MXD parcels further west.   

          And, importantly, a big diagonal that connects 

Binney Street and the USDOT site directly with the corner of 

Third and Broadway.  Good site lines, lots of permeability, 

and great connectivity in this plan. 

          During our rezoning effort, we heard -- as David

has mentioned, from many in the community -- that this was 

the most desirable site for a civic park in Kendall Square.  

We've studied this a lot; we came to the same conclusion.  

This site has the best visibility, the biggest amount of 

daylight of the entire set of parcels. 

          Today it's a fenced in private parking lot, but we 

are going to make it open and expansive and welcoming.  What 

we're showing here in this visualization is not meant to 

convey a specific design proposal; we haven't designed this 

space.  We'll consider a lot of ways to configure it, after 

hearing your advice and community input on program use and 

character.   

          But the sketch does convey that we get to keep 

some of the mature, existing trees on this part of the site 

and plant quite a lot of new ones.  We'll develop some 

broad, connective paths and the diagonal that I mentioned -- 

open lawns, and the design will eventually support all kinds 

of informal work programmed activity. 

          And you can see that we do intend to have a focus 

toward the community center at its northern edge.  And Broad 

Canal Way, as David has described, is really something like 

a shared street that can be closed to traffic, making the 

entire space feel active and making the street feel like 

35

it's in the park. 

          Next? 

          So we have another sizeable public space proposed 

in the Sixth Street Park, which will allow the Lowry walkway 

to feel more expansive and more active, with more than a 

fenced in passage, the way it is today.   

          So the dimensions here provide for a variety of 

community recreation spaces that will really rethink the 

significant draw for residents and workers.  And we'll be 

looking for input on this as well.   

          There's a few ways to configure this -- next slide 

--- with programs like a dog park, maybe a hammock grove; 

certainly some children's play spaces needed in this 

neighborhood.  And the site, as I mentioned, connects 

directly through the passage to Broad Canal Way going 

eastward. 

          And in the next slide, just some other possible 

ways to configure this space in different kinds of program. 

          Next, we're going to share some detail about our 

proposed activation of the entire public realm, and I'll 

turn it over to Kristen.

          KRISTEN KEEFE:  Thank you, Gary.  Good evening to 

the members of the Board.  I'm Kristen Keefe, Associate 

Director of Retail Development at the MITIMCo.  As Anthony 

mentioned earlier, our zoning requires activation, small 

retail, small spaces, but diversity of retail is a value for 

us.  We do it every day. 

          However, it doesn't simply end with building space 

that supports diverse retail; it's about partnering with our 

retailers to ensure success.  We prioritize local concepts 

and minority ownership with lease terms that lower barriers 

to entry and open economic opportunity.   

          And, as Sarah mentioned, in mid March we 

proactively put in place our COVID-19 Retail Rent Relief 

program that suspended rent for all of our retail tenants at 

a time of extreme uncertainty.   

          The ground floor and public realm at Volpe is an 

opportunity to more fully realize the retail vision set 

forth in the Kendall Square initiative to build upon our 

threshold principles of activation that is inclusive, 

innovative, extends hours of operation, supports local and 

independent concepts to create a destination that resonates 

with all members of the Cambridge community.

          Our site plan has been organized to feature three 

key anchors that work together to achieve these goals; a 

network of programmed open spaces, community and cultural 

spaces, and accessible and inventive retail. 

          By activating all sides of each building, we are 

able to create a range of spaces that foster community and 

allow for new and enhanced social and economic 

opportunities.  It also provides the necessary flexibility 

to site complementary uses next to each other for synergy, 

and to support the zoning framework to foster diverse 

retail. 

          This image is looking at the community center and 

its adjacent green space from the west.  One can imagine a 

place for community center users, friends and neighbors to 

come together for recreation, relaxation and recharging.  

The surrounding retail space could have complementary uses 

like ice cream shops, bakeries, pizza shops and the like, in 

effect creating a mini neighborhood hub right in the middle 

of it all. 

          The community center entertainment anchors, 

cultural and arts uses together will allow for a fully 

integrated place with a range of experiences that naturally

bring together a diverse audience. 

          Our open spaces will be designed to accommodate a 

variety of programs -- from daily, passive activities like 

eating lunch or playing a game of chess on a weekday 

afternoon to a weekend farmer's or artisan's market that 

takes advantage of the variety of open spaces to a full-

scale festival that incorporates the retailers, close down 

streets and all of the park spaces as well. 

          Community collaboration is the way to get this 

right, and we look forward to working together to ensure the 

best possible outcome.  Our upcoming charettes are on open 

space, community center program will shape those important 

activation anchors so we can ensure that we create a place 

of belonging and equity. 

          The mix of retail of the future will be inventive 

and familiar, accessible and interesting.  It will offer a 

variety of price points and experiences, while blending the 

innovative and the everyday.   

          Volpe is an incredible opportunity to build upon 

our values of diversity, equity and inclusion.  We have a 

solid track record on this front, as you can see from the 

sampling of some of our existing retail tenants.

          I'm looking forward to using the process to more 

thoroughly engage with minority-owned and local retailers to 

guide us on what they need and to make sure we keep 

inclusion in particular focus.   

          On this effort, I was being working closely with 

Roosevelt, who is up next to talk to you more about our 

community engagement input sessions. 

          ROOSEVELT SMITH:  Thank you, Kristen, and good 

evening Madam Chair and Planning Board members.  My name is 

Roosevelt Smith.  I feel like we're near time, so I'll do my 

best to be brief.   

          I'm an Independent Consultant, typically 

partnering with organizations and initiatives working in 

marginalized communities, helping them to affect change and 

impact towards community-informed outcomes. 

          Through this work, I've had the privilege over 

time working with many Cambridge non-profits and community-

based organizations along the way. 

          As Sarah mentioned earlier, I was first engaged by 

MIT back in 2018 or so to help facilitate community 

engagement and connections, and to provide developmental 

support on the Job Connector, which you've heard is proudly

up and running serving residents.   

          Recently, I was asked to participate more broadly 

on the Volpe Redevelopment Project, assisting to facilitate 

community input conversations and drive continued public 

involvement across all aspects of the project. In doing so, 

we cannot ignore the heightened awareness and public outcry 

against racial injustice and inequity.   

          And I commit personally to partnering with MIT to 

integrate a race equity inclusion lens across this project.  

We realize that every aspect of our project has to be viewed 

through this lens to ensure that innovation and equity 

coexist and be of mutual benefit to all. 

          To accomplish these outcomes and the Redevelopment 

Project's larger goals of belonging, inclusion and 

activation, we will intentionally involve community voices 

of all kinds in a meaningful way to hear their thoughts, 

concerns, aspirations and ideas, and then work hard to 

convert that into executable outcomes for the project. 

          So as a follow up to last week's community event, 

we will schedule a series of community Zoom charettes and 

stakeholder meetings over the next several weeks to get 

additional input and deepen our engagement with community.

We have identified these five areas based on feedback from 

the community.  They include open space design and 

programming, community center programming, retail diversity, 

housing equity, and job equity. 

          I'm looking forward to engaging all in this work, 

and thank you for your time.  Michael?   

          MICHAEL OWU:  Thank you, Roosevelt.  And that 

concludes our presentation.  I think we're close to 30 

minutes.  I'll turn it back to you, Madam Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank you 

so much.  Now we'll turn to questions and comments from 

Board members.  Does someone want to kick us off with any 

questions or comments on what we've heard tonight on the 

plans for this site?     

Hugh.    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I have a question -- this is 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So there are nine buildings on 

the site, and three of them have entrances to parking 

garages, and six do not.  So what is your parking strategy?  

Is it shared underground garages that go on cross streets?   

          MICHAEL OWU:  Yeah, I can take that.  That is 

42

correct.  So there's actually four entrances -- three, one 

on Broadway, two on Potter, one on Munroe.  And the idea is 

that it would be a phased, interconnected garage south of 

Potter.              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Great, thank you.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou, did you have a 

question or comment?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, I have both, actually.  

And I don't know who should field it, but a quick one.  The 

community center stand-alone building, is that a request 

from the city?  I'm having a hard time -- it would be really 

nice to gain that green space the building takes up, and 

makes a really tight pinch point.   

          Just curious where that came from, and is there 

any way we could possibly get that built into another 

building?  It seems like it would be a much, or possibly 

earth sheltered -- you know, something cool, but it seems 

like a lot of real estate to use in a building that could be 

used for more green space in that pinch point.     

          MICHAEL OWU:  Anthony, you want to take this one?     

          ANTHONY GALLUCIO:  Sure.  Thanks, Lou.  And I 

think the good news about this is it's getting people like

you already thinking about the community center, which 

obviously is something that this is a new undertaking for a 

private developer to take on.  The Job Connector is similar 

to actually engage and do the work.   

          Hopefully, this gets sorted out as folks think 

about what they want it to be and who they want it to be 

for.  I mean, we did hear, and we talked a lot about the 

equity conversation, but -- and Corinne has talked about 

this in other meetings, about how folks in the community 

really feel welcome or overpoliced or over -- you know, 

dealing with security and being able to feel ownership over 

a building.   

          And we did hear about that, that -- you know, 

because there are, obviously, advantages to trying to put it 

into a building.  But I think this was something that came 

up to establish ownership by the community, although we want 

-- the community center has always been slated as a place 

where we want to bring different demographics together, 

which happens in places like this.   

          But again, we look forward to the community 

process and seeing how all those things can be accomplished.  

But yeah, it was an incentive to have a freestanding

building.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.  And one question 

-- Mike probably can take this one -- on the Sixth Street 

Park, I think it's a great idea.  Will that allow you to 

keep all those mature oak trees on the Volpe West Lawn, or 

at least most of them it looks like?  I'm just curious.     

          MICHAEL OWU:  No, it won't.  It's not large enough 

or set back far enough to include those.  You know, we 

looked at that extensively, so trying to find the right 

balance, and we ended up focusing really on the trees that 

are right on Lowry Way as the most important things to keep.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay, that's all I have for 

now.    

you, yep.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other comments 

or questions from Board members?  Ted?  So Ted, I recognized 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes, I'm sorry.  I had to 

unmute myself.  I guess I'm still hung up on the concept of 

one spectacular building as an entrance to Cambridge and to 

the Cambridge skyline.   And I'm wondering why you're not 

going up to the 500 feet for the one residential building?    

          MICHAEL OWU:  I'll take that, and maybe David can

join in a little bit.  It does get challenging building 

taller and taller buildings, particularly given the design 

guidelines that do encourage, you know, step backs as you 

get higher, and the efficiency of the building gets really, 

really difficult when you get that high; that's one concern. 

          The second concern is just the Cambridge market 

has not seen a building that large, and there's real 

concerns about our ability to actually absorb that many 

units in a single building at any given point in time.  So 

there are a lot of factors that come into play here.   

          We're showing a building at 382 feet, which would 

be, you know, the tallest and the largest residential 

building in Cambridge.  It's a big bite of the appl.  So we 

are a little concerned about not getting too aggressive with 

that.  And it will be visible from the Boston skyline and 

from the Longfellow Bridge.  I think we can achieve that 

visibility and prominence, without necessarily giving up 500 

feet.   

          David, I don't know if you want to add anything to 

that?  Well, I'll only add that I share Ted's desire for a 

spectacular building.  And I think 382 feet will be 

spectacular in Kendall Square.  And obviously, Michael has 

46

covered all the issues around tallest building in Cambridge 

and the amount of residential product that would be brought 

to the market in one time would significantly surpass 

anything that's been done before.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Corinne?          

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  I have a lot of 

comments, as always.  I'm going to start with the very 

specific question about trees, if we could go to that slide?   

          I wanted someone to please explain those graphs.    

          MICHAEL OWU:  Gary, do you want to take that?    

          GARY HILDERBRAND:  Hi, thanks for the question.  

The graphs are indications of how much carbon uptake happens 

in trees over time; how much trees contribute the management 

of the rainfall and stormwater, and how much they contribute 

to air quality. 

          We have on the site trees that were largely 

planted 60 years ago.  They have taken up a lot of carbon.  

They do a good job of managing stormwater, and they have a 

lot of leaf cover, so they contribute a lot to air quality. 

          But half the trees are poor to fair condition.  

And we would say that nearly all of them are in decline.  So 

as those trees decline, they perform less well.  And over

the years that the project will be built, we will see 

further decline. 

          The new trees in the city sequester as much or 

more carbon, and as they mature, they do a great job of 

senior management because of their growth rate.  And as they 

put on more canopy, of course they also contribute to better 

air quality. 

          The species on site today are -- some are 

threatened, some are invasive, and the species that we're 

proposing to plant are highly resilient and they will be 

well-adapted to the changes we anticipate in turbulence and 

temperatures, as climate change is fast upon us. 

          I hope I answered your question, then?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yeah.  Are the blue lines the 

old trees, and the green lines are the new trees?    

          GARY HILDERBRAND:  Yes.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.    

          GARY HILDERBRAND:  Sorry.  We should have -- I 

should have said that.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  That's okay.  Thank you.  That 

does answer my question.    

          GARY HILDERBRAND:  Great.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.  So I wanted to thank MIT 

first of all for its community response during COVID.  It 

has been notable and noted, and I do trust that it's been 

informative to MIT.   

          Something that I try to communicate often is that 

there is a huge population of people in Cambridge who live 

in deep and abiding economic poverty.  And as the city 

changes, and as income inequality becomes more stark, which 

is a side effect of development, life becomes harder for 

many people in our city, but it doesn't have to be that way.   

          So I appreciate this two-way street of learning 

from each other so that when we build things, we can do a 

good job of preventing further harm to community and 

actually to mitigate harm to community. 

          I want to thank you for centering racial equity 

and justice as a core value.  I want more developers to 

understand that development isn't only impactful because of 

aesthetics and form; that it's community and human-centered; 

when we're literally building and planning the future, we 

should be planning for an anti-racist future for an 

equitable future, for a sustainable future. 

          MIT in this instance has the money and the power

to be truly impactful in this area, so I appreciate that 

that is a core value of this project. 

          Specifically for housing, I want to reiterate 

something you said at this Board a few times, which is that 

we'd like affordable units to be three plus bedrooms or 

family-sized, so when we're thinking about the composition, 

which I know will come further in the future, to please keep 

that in mind. 

          And I wasn't here for the Volpe zoning, but I 

appreciate the residential phasing that's required there, 

and wanted to encourage you to think even if you might push 

even further on that.   

          Housing is an emergency here in Cambridge, and as 

much as it's possible with the construction project 

management, I would love to see housing prioritized, as far 

as when it's up and ready to be occupied. 

          I want to talk a little bit about community 

benefits.  I know that right now is not the right time to 

talk about it, but this is +-a preconference.  But I just 

want in the future for us to talk more about the community 

benefits, continue to learn more information about the 

community center and how it works.

          I understand that there's an endowment so that it 

will continue to be operational, but I'd like to know more 

information about -- you know, will community members be 

able to use things for free there?  Will it cost them any 

money?  I understand we're not at the point for those 

details, but I would want to hear those in the future.   

          And I want to commend everything thatâ€™s happened 

so far, but also push us a little further.  So I was very 

excited when MIT Job Connector came out, especially its 

learning programs.  I was even more excited when they 

partnered with -- when they announced the partnership with 

My Brother's Keeper this week, and then I would say next 

step would be to pay participants.   

          When we don't have enough money, it costs us money 

to do something like take a 12-week class.  It means that 

we're not going to our shift at our other job.  So we really 

need stipends for participants so that they can afford to 

take advantage of some of those longer term programs that 

the MIT Job Connector offers.   

          I want to know more in the future about community 

engagement.  I really appreciate Roosevelt's work in the 

past on other projects, and he's very well respected in this

area.  But I would want to make sure, for example, that the 

retail outreach is equitable.  I'd love more details.   

          I love how we talked about the new neighborhood 

hub, but we really need diverse community input to know what 

that looks like.  For example, will we have another fancy 

ice cream store that costs $6 for an ice cream cone -- a 

kiddie ice cream -- or will we have, you know, giant plates 

of Haitian food and Dominican food and things that I would 

bring home to my family?   

          I am going to actually suggest that you consider 

specifically engaging a robust Focus Group of paid community 

members, ideally from some of the local housing -- our local 

public housingâ€¦ residents at Washington Elms, residents from 

Roosevelt Towers, other local public housing, who can give 

you actual input about what we've lost to development. 

          We can't find a $1 slice of pizza anymore.  We 

can't find some of the things we used to have.  We have an 

opportunity with Volpe to repair some of those things that 

we lost, and to also enjoy what our various cultures have to 

offer.   

          When we talk about community engagement and 

innovation, it's also important to engage communities from

different ethnic racial groups and economic groups right now 

at the beginning.  Because if we're excluding large portions 

of the population, we're missing their brains, their genius, 

their ideas. 

          When we look at things like social innovation, 

social entrepreneurs, and innovators, we have lots of 

support for a certain kind of innovators in Cambridge, but 

not a lot for -- specifically for example black women social 

entrepreneurs, we don't do a good job in Cambridge.  And we 

could now with this. 

          General feedback:  I think that other developers 

should note the prebuild engagement of this project.  This 

is really important, because the impact of development 

doesn't start the day that a new building opens.  It starts 

years before when the fence goes up, when everything's 

blocked off, when streets start getting blocked off.   

          So saying that someone is going to offer community 

benefits on the day something opens means that we've 

suffered years before with no help.   

          So in this instance, it's really something for 

other developers to look towards, because you've done a 

great job with starting that work in the community in the

right timeframe.   

          Again, really appreciate the retail that's 

happened, but also want to encourage you to keep economic 

inequality in mind.  For example, CVS is extremely help to 

everyone in the area.  Shy Bird is absolutely delicious, but 

only very wealthy neighbors can enjoy that restaurant.   

          Lastly, I want to commend the excellent leadership 

and sustainability, just recognizing that you all have 

helped the city with sustainability and this project is 

really exemplary as far as best practices in the building, 

being thoughtful of climate change and as impactful on 

climate change. 

          I do want to see in the future more details about 

how this development interacts with the whole community.  

For example, are you helping us with floodwater and storm 

drainage beyond this site?  I assume the answer is yes, but 

I would like to know more about that that.  That's all, 

thanks.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Corrine.  

Steven Cohen, you have your hand virtually raised.  Would 

you like to offer your comments and questions next?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure.  Just a quick question.

The plans show extensive open space parks and walkways, 

which is very appealing and interesting.  And the renderings 

are wonderful.  But in fact, all of that space is surrounded 

on all four sides ordinarily by very tall buildings.   

          And so, I wonder, what is the real quality of that 

space, and to what extent is that space covered by shadow?  

Every day?  Partial days?  Certain seasons?  Give us a sense 

of the actual quality of that open space.     

          MICHAEL OWU:  David or Gary, do you want to take 

that one?     

          DAVID MANFREDI:  I can start, Gary can join in.  I 

hinted at it when we presented Third Street Park.  You know, 

one of the really determinant factors in locating the 

biggest park space was locating it where it would have the 

best solar orientation.   

          And you get the benefit at the intersection of 

Third and Broadway of not only the acre of land that is part 

of this parcel, but you get the benefit of Third Street and 

you get the benefit of Broadway.   

          So in fact, building to building is something like 

400 feet north- south and 260 feet east-west.  And you get 

the benefit not only of that, but also Galaxy Part.

          So that midday early morning sun will fill that 

park, and sunlight will be in that park into the afternoon, 

and then depending on the time of the year in the summer 

months, of course in the later afternoon and early evening.   

We also have the benefit of these north-south passageways 

that are quite wide.   

          Fifth Street at its very narrowest is 102 feet 

wide.  At the GSA building, it's substantially more than 

that.  So you'll get that midday sun on Fifth Street, and of 

course you'll get the midday sun and afternoon sun on Sixth 

Street, because, again, you're about 100 feet west.     

     You're absolutely right; these are not short buildings, 

they're tall buildings.  They will cast shadows.  And of 

course the typical shadows, or the most serious shadows, 

will be at different times of day, different times of year.  

          But our green spaces, our open spaces, are 

oriented in a way to maximize the benefit of sunlight, make 

them as useable as possible.  Gary?      

          GARY HILDERBRAND:  David, you've covered that 

perfectly.  

shadow studies?    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Eventually I assume we'll see 

56

          GARY HILDERBRAND:  Absolutely.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  But I get the sense of it from 

you.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, Hugh?  Did you 

have another question or comment that you wanted to add?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes, I did.  I was a very strong 

advocate for the site plan Version 1, which had a large, 

kind of central open space that the majority of the 

buildings surrounded.  And so, I was very skeptical about 

this approach.   

          But I've been studying it, and there are some 

remarkable things going on here.   

          One of them is that the larger open spaces are all 

shared with abutting properties.  So instead of having it 

just on the Volpe site, the Volpe shares on the Sixth Street 

walkway, it shares across Broadway and Third Street, and the 

Fifth Street connector, and it shares with the 303 Third 

Street, and it's on the back side of that building.   

          The other thing is that there's a finer grain of 

open space, which David just alluded to in the spacings.  

They're broad streets -- the Broad Canal street is actually 

a pedestrian street.

          And so, things have been designed for the kind of 

activity that's apt to happen -- people walking, people 

going to and fro sitting outside their building, et cetera. 

And every building has spaces on three sides that are like 

this.  There tends to be a fourth side that's a service 

side.  But -- and those are treed.  They're not ignored, but 

there's an incredible richness -- the whole district is open 

space. 

          So I'm really enthusiastic about the way this has 

grown and changed and developed.  And I think -- I suspect 

that Gary is responsible for a lot of this, adding this 

richness to a structure that, you know, needs -- to a place 

that needs richness.   

          And it's going to be the most wonderful district 

in East Cambridge, and possibly the entire city, because of 

the way the open space is being handled.  So that's my 

comment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thanks, Hugh.  Tom, 

you want to chime in?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes, sure.  Thank you.  Amazing 

to see this a few years later.  And I was just -- as I was 

reviewing the slides before the hearing, thinking about --

you know, even though this has only been a few years since 

we last saw it, how much has changed.   

          And we made some assumptions about what the future 

might be a few years ago, and none of us could have 

predicted where we are, but apart from the politics which, 

you know, I don't want to dwell on -- we're all probably 

musing on that way too much these days -- what's 

extraordinary to me is the rate which we now recognize the 

headwinds that we're heading into in terms of climate 

change.   

          And so, this being an open discussion about what 

we might expect or expect to discuss in the future.  I 

wanted to just highlight a few thoughts around some of the 

strategies, which were pretty far-reaching and visionary 

when we first thought of them, but now look ambitious but 

not as ambitious as they were.   

          For instance, LEED Gold as a standard back when we 

discussed this was a reach, and now that is something that 

is relatively common in applications that come before the 

Planning Board.  That's just one such example.   

          But the other thing that's extraordinary -- and 

Hugh touched on this, how the open space is connected to a 

59

district, right?  It connects not only to the open spaces 

within the coherent plan itself, but also reaches beyond to 

establish parks and open space systems -- it's a district.  

This is an amazing opportunity, because this development 

proposal is not one building or even one large complex, it's 

a whole district.   

          And there there's an advantage, especially when 

you're talking about issues of trying to solve issues of 

sustainability.  An example that Michael referenced, of 

course, is the blackwater treatment plant, which I presume 

is gathering effluent from all of the buildings and doing 

something extraordinary for the environment. 

          But it's absolutely true -- I think we understand 

that individual buildings are not going to solve climate 

change, it's going to have to be a district-wide kind of 

solution.  So more of those such ideas where there are 

things that link the Xmas lights of great, beautiful 

architecture together in terms of its service and in terms 

of its carbon footprint. 

          For instance, this district, which is the Volpe 

District, is right within the vicinity of Vicinity, which is 

the power plant that's there.  Maybe there's some way in 

60

which energy systems could be derived from that power plant, 

which could mean a greener future. 

          So that headwind of climate changes and the 

standards are changing.  No one was talking about two years 

ago something called, "embedded carbon" and that's actually 

a new subject here at the Planning Board as well.  But that 

is now becoming something that we're very much focused on as 

responsible designers and developers -- the amount of carbon 

and CO2 that's released in the materials that produce the 

actual buildings. 

          And the importance of that is that you can make 

more of a difference to climate change faster by addressing 

that.  And so, as we come forward with individual proposals, 

I would like MIT in its innovation to help us think through 

how we might take our footprint on the planet to a whole 

'nother level. 

          Obviously, this district sits within an ecosystem.  

It's big enough, it sits in a watershed, right?  And I think 

Gary alluded to that, that there's great ground penetration.  

But there's stuff thatâ€™s the same.   

          There's stuff that we got right, and that we did 

have both eyes open, and together we came up with some

really good standards.  And I have no intention of 

renegotiating them as we go forward.   

          You know, we can all agree that equity -- and 

Corinne very eloquently came up with a lot of practical 

solutions about how to drive issues of equity forward; 

housing and the great things this is going to do for 

housing; the environment I touched on -- economic vitality, 

which was promised at the -- and vitality, which was 

promised at the outset of the presentation.   

          I think that we're not going to compromise on the 

various, very highest quality of design, beauty and 

architecture that we're expecting to come out here.   

          I think we've got it mostly right in Kendall 

Square through some intense discussions. We're not going to 

compromise on that, so you should expect that we have high 

expectations around that. 

          Relative to the open space, one last comment, and 

maybe this brings it back to current events: As I was 

looking at the marvelous images, the dreamlike images of 

what the future might hold there at Maya Lin's space or even 

at the new public park I began to think about -- well, you 

know, on Wednesday I'm going to be out expressing myself, no

matter how the election turns out, one way or the other, 

right?  Expressions of joy or expressions of surprise and 

outrage. 

          And I was looking at those public spaces.  I said, 

"Am I going to be able to protest there?  Am I going to be 

able to express the joy that I am hoping I might feel on 

November 4 in those spaces, or am going to be allowed to be 

raucous?  Am I going to be allowed to maybe express an 

opinion that may not be popular in the rest of the country 

or even in the community?" 

          And that to me is true measure of what civic space 

is, right?  Which -- it allows for the magnificent 

expression of our First Amendment. 

          And so, Maya Lin's art piece is amazing.  I hope 

it's not fragile.  And after all, she is the author of just 

an extraordinary political statement in the War Memorial.  

So she understands more than anything the importance of 

symbol and protest and political expression and public 

space. 

          So that's the conversation I'm going to want to 

get into as we look forward.  And you know, I've got to 

agree with Ted -- one last comment.  I think punctuating the

skyline with a tall building as I run down the Esplanade on 

Boston and Kendall Square would be most welcome.   

          I think our skyline is getting kind of marked as a 

flat, kind of highwater mark.  And I think something taller 

would be really welcome.  So that's where I am.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All 

right.  Any other Board questions or comments, either for 

the applicant or if there are things you especially want 

Staff to be paying attention to as they continue their 

discussions with the applicants?     

          [Pause]  

          Okay.  So this is not a public hearing, but 

comment can be taken at the Board's discretion.  Any members 

of the public who wish to speak should now click the bottom 

that says, "Raise hand."  And if you're calling in by phone, 

you can raise your hand by pressing *9.   

          Any written communications received by the Board 

will be entered into the record, and showing a few people 

who would be interested in being heard on this matter, so 

unless there's any objection from the Board, we will go 

ahead and take some public comment on what we've heard 

tonight.

          I will now ask staff to unmute speakers one at a 

time.  You should begin by saying your name and address, and 

Staff will confirm that we can hear you.  After that, you 

should have up to three minutes to speak before I ask you to 

wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  This is Jeff Roberts from 

Community Development.  Again, I'll facilitate the public 

comment.  So we have a few speakers with hands raised.  The 

first is Christopher Matthews.  And everyone should start by 

giving their own name and address.       

          CHRIS MATTHEWS:  Thanks, Jeff.  Chris Matthews 

from 26 Sixth Street.  Just wanted to speak in support of 

the project, and just share with the Board how gratifying 

the entire process has been; how MITIMCo and the team -- the 

Design team has interacted with us and listened to us, and 

the Third Street Park on the corner of Third and Broadway 

will be a sun-filled and beautiful space for East Cambridge. 

          I did -- you know, I understand that Gary's 

imagery of the landscape is preliminary and it hasn't ben 

designed yet.  But I would say that in Kendall Square we're 

still lacking a real landmark open space that is memorable 

for people across the city.  It is memorable for people who

visit Kendall Square from around the region -- all the 

country, or even internationally.   

          So I do hope that the Third Street Park will 

become a place where people from the neighborhood can bring 

their kids for a picnic on a Saturday lunchtime, when the 

wheelers and dealers in Kendall Square can bring their 

investors to have a quiet chat and secure the money that 

will allow them to cure the next pandemic.  And I do hope 

that it is a great resource for the student, faculty and 

staff at MIT also. 

          So I would just encourage everybody to think about 

what a unique generational opportunity this open space is on 

the corner of Third and Broadway, as an iconic space in 

Kendall Square. 

          And just thank you so much for the conversations 

and the hard work and what I think has the potential to be a 

terrific outcome.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  The next speaker -- I 

apologize if I don't get your name right, you can correct me 

-- Ty Belitti.  You can start.   

          TY BELITI:  That is perfect.  Can you hear me 

okay?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  Please start with your name

          TY BELITTI:  Excellent.  My name is Ty Belitti.  I 

live at 22 Bigelow Street in Cambridge.  And I'm calling in 

support of the Volpe project.  I am the Vice-President of My 

Brother's Keeper in Cambridge, and very fortunate to have 

been raised -- born and raised and still reside in 

Cambridge.   

          As a lifelong Cambridge resident, I spent many 

years in the Port of East Cambridge and the Kendall Square 

community.  As a matter of fact, as a youth, all of my 

friends and I used to play tackle football on the Volpe 

property in the winter after a good snowstorm.   

          When I first heard of the project, I thought, 

"Here we go again, another development on the horizon to 

further change the landscape of the Cambridge I once knew.  

However, I've since come to realize this project is 

different.   

          It's not the construction and the new buildings 

that make it so; it's the people, it's the team of 

professionals tasked with imagining and managing a project 

that makes it different.  Sarah Gallop, Anthony Galluccio,

Michael Owu, Kristen Keefe, Roosevelt Smith, Gary Hildebrand 

and David Manfredi are the brains behind the project and 

they opened my eyes to how development projects should be 

approached in mature and established cities like Cambridge. 

          A few months back, I had the good fortune of 

meeting Sarah Gallop and her team at the Job Connector by 

MIT to discuss an idea of partnering to develop a paid 

career development and skills program for Cambridge 

residents between the ages of 18 and 26.   

          Sarah and her team are extremely professional; 

thoughtful, knowledgeable and have a great sense of the 

community.  We are honored and excited for the opportunity 

to partner and to develop the programming we collectively 

believe will change people's lives. 

          Care and attention to the needs of the community 

are lived values of the Volpe team member Anthony Galluccio, 

a lifelong community advocate, who always answers the call 

of those in need.  Anthony stepped up and helped assist 

Cambridge -- My Brother's Keeper this summer, as we 

facilitated a youth empowerment program for 50 young people 

this summer.   

          This level of community think throughout the Volpe

Development Team -- I was blown away by the project 

presentation last week when I saw the project renderings and 

listened to the thought and consideration that went into the 

design process.  It was clear to me that the planning and 

approach was through the lens of the community, where 

equality and inclusion were a part of the decision-making 

process.   

          From the layout to the physical structures of the 

community center, the Job Connector, retail and open space, 

the team hit the nail on the head, and seems to genuinely 

care about how the Volpe project can enhance the community 

by embracing and inclusive approach. 

          Also mentioned in the project unveiling 

presentation were equity and inclusion community talks with 

the goal of hearing the community and what's important to 

them.   

          A community approach may slow the process a tad, 

but there's something to be said about the integrity of the 

process when the people who live in the community are 

provided the opportunity to lend their voices to such a 

permanent project in which they will be left to navigate 

daily, weekly, monthly and on a yearly basis.

          In conclusion, the Volpe Project presentation made 

a great impression on me.  It's design and layout seamlessly 

stiches together the Port, East Cambridge and Kendall 

Square.  With Kendall Square being the future innovation 

sector of Cambridge, I'm proud to know the Volpe project 

will contribute in an unobtrusive manner, welcoming everyone 

from all communities to live, shop, dine, work and enjoy.   

          Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  And the next speaker is 

Heather Hoffman.  You can start.     

          [Pause]  

          I think you're still muted if you're speaking.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Yep.  No, it just told me I was 

unmuted.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Great.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN:  Are you telling me that the 

robovoice lies?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We can hear you now.   

          HEATHER HOFFMAN: [Laughter] Heather Hoffman, 213 

Hurley Street.  And I am going to use my three minutes to 

speak about the things that I hope you will keep in mind, 

because all of the blowing of horns has already happened, so

I don't have to do that.  If you gave me four, I might blow 

a horn or two. 

          First of all, on the trees.  MIT had its eyes 

opened to the importance of at least treating trees with 

respect, and I appreciate that.  I hope that they will do 

everything they possibly can to keep these trees alive if 

possible, move them if they need to, and treat them with 

respect if they have to cut them down. 

          I hope that this housing will be unique in the 

housing in Kendall Square -- the rental housing -- for being 

aimed at keeping people there; not just the people in the 

subsidized units, and one of the reasons that I like having 

more people in the subsidized units is there are more people 

who might stick around and become our neighbors. 

          MIT should be able to do this; build and maintain 

to keep people, not to make them cycle through 50 to 100 

percent turnover every year. 

          And then the parks.  First of all, I'm going to 

disagree with my dear friend, Chris Matthews.  Kendall 

Square did have an iconic, incredible spot.  It was on the 

roof of the Garage.   

          And now they have decided, unlike your fine

landscape architect, that sunlight just keeps people away.  

And so, they're putting up a very tall building and it's 

going to be so shady that they're putting up AstroTurf.  So 

I'm pleased to have someone who likes sun. 

          But I would point out that we were promised seven 

and a half acres of park.  Not only that, K2 reaffirmed the 

seven and a half acres.  So I am still not forgiving the 

bait and switch.  I'm not happy about that part.  So make 

what you're giving us as spectacular as possible.   

          But remember, we were promised four years in order 

to justify all of the millions of square feet that have 

already been built, we were told seven and a half acres will 

be yours."  And then we were told we were fools for 

believing it.  So make this the equivalent of seven and a 

half acres that we were promised.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  So I will consider this 

the last call.  If anybody would like to speak who hasn't 

spoken yet, please push the, "Raise Hand" button on Zoom, or 

you can push *9 if you're on telephone.  I am not seeing any 

more hands, so I'll turn it back over to the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We can 

turn it back to the Board then.  If there's any further 

72

discussion that we need from the Board, or any final 

comments?  If not, then are we prepared to conclude this 

Preapplication Conference?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I had one final question, 

Catherine.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  What's the anticipated timing of 

going for a PUD approval?     

          MICHAEL OWU:  So the plan is we have some 

additional meetings that we need to conduct, both with the 

community, which will continue for a period of time and -- 

actually those community meetings will probably continue 

indefinitely, because this is a long process; we want to 

make sure that we keep the community engaged throughout. 

          We have additional meetings for the staff.  But 

the hope is within a month or so depending on the feedback 

that we get, we could be submitting an application to the 

Board.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

questions or comments?  If not, is there a motion to 

conclude the Preapplication Conference?

                  Bacci, Jr., Steven A. Cohen, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, and    

                  Corinne Espinoza   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We will 

then move onto the next item on our agenda, which is a 

request for an extension of time for Special Permit case PB 

-319 for the development at 605 Concord Avenue.  Again, we 

will start with CDD Staff summarizing why this is before us.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff, and I'm going to ask 

Liza if she can just give a quick summary, since she has 

most of the information on this case.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          LIZA PADEN:  Hello.  This is Liza Paden, with the 

Community Development Staff.  So the developer for 605

Concord Avenue has requested an extension for an additional 

year to the special permit.  They're very close to getting 

their building permit finished thorough the review.   

          As you can imagine, COVID has slowed them down a 

little bit, and as their letter pointed out, they have been 

allowing the Carewell Health Clinic to stage people waiting 

for various tests, including the COVID test, to use the 

parking lot, which is the new development site. 

          So they're requesting a 12-month extension.  They 

don't expect to have to use it, but these are uncertain 

times.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thanks, Liza.  

We have Phil Terzis here representing the permittee, who is 

present and can answer any questions about this request.  Do 

Board members have any questions about the requested 

extension? Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.  It was the same question 

I asked recently of another applicant for an extension.  

Given the Governor's emergency proclamation, is it really 

necessary to extend the time, or is it automatically 

extended by virtue of that order?  

          PHIL TERZIS:  That's -- this is Phil Terzis from

Acorn Holdings, the developer.  It's unclear to us whether 

that actually applies to special permits or not.  I believe 

it applies to building permits, but I don't know if it 

applies to special permits.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I guess Jeff or Staff, has the 

city taken any position on this?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff Roberts.  Not that I'm 

aware of.  I don't believe we've sought a formal opinion on 

this, but I think as a -- you know, usually as a matter of 

course with these kinds of emergency orders or other kind of 

state laws, we usually try to -- you know, follow the normal 

procedures as best we can, just to be sure.  But if the 

Board wants to, we could try to seek some clarification on 

that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Are there other 

questions, either for the applicant or for the permitee 

requester or for staff at this time?  Yeah, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I think we have to make a 

followed that there's been diligent efforts to proceed, and 

if the applicant can tell us what they have done to date,

understanding obviously the pandemic came and stopped 

things.   

          But if we could get a brief explanation of what's 

happened, I think the special permit was granted three or 

four years ago and there have been other extensions granted 

previously.  So I'd sort of like to know what has actually 

been happening. 

          And I will say I have seen people lined up on the 

parking lot waiting to go into the health facility.  So I 

know that's true.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.   

          PHIL TERZIS:  We have had some delays due to the 

COVID-19 crisis.  The -- we also have two other projects 

under construction; one at the St. James Church at 1991 Mass 

Ave, and also at 77 New Street in Cambridge.  So both of 

those projects experienced a shutdown for what ended up 

being more like four months, just because we had to 

remobilize the contractor. 

          So there's been sort of a lot of turmoil in our 

construction projects, and we felt at this point that it's 

better for us to kind of chew and swallow what we've already 

started at St. James Church and at 77 New Street before we

embark on construction of 605 Concord.   

          Both of those projects that are under construction 

we expect to be finished in December and January.  So after 

that point, we'll be I think in a much better position to 

begin construction on 605 Concord. 

          And we've gotten all of our approvals -- all of 

our department approvals at 605 Concord.  With the exception 

of ISD, it's ready for its final review at ISD.  So I think 

we're pretty close to having a building permit.   

          So we're hoping that relatively quickly after we 

get the building permit, we can start construction and 

hopefully find another way to deal with the COVID -- the 

lines of COVID patients being tested at our Carewell 

facility. 

          So that's kind of where we stand right now.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions or 

comments from Board members?  All right.  Then is there a 

motion to grant the requested extension?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  This is Steve -- so moved.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there a second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Louie, second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We'll 

take a roll call vote.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Roll call on granting the requested

extension.  Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's all members voting in favor.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, thank you very many.  We 

appreciate it greatly.

additional comments from Staff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I don't have any comments, except 

just a reminder everybody to vote, and that we don't have a 

meeting next week.  See if anybody else from Staff want to 

jump in with any updates or any other comments?  Not hearing 

any, so I think we're all set.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any last-

minute comments from Board members?  If not, then the 

meeting is adjourned.  Thank you everyone.
