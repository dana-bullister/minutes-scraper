include new or existing staff? Is the Mobility Mentor position full- or part-time? 

o  CBAC would like additional detail on how much of budget is directed to Lead Org. It currently seems like it 

could be weighted too heavily to Lead Org 

• 

If the Mobility Mentor is new to organization and responsible for engagement of partners and service 
providers, how will relationships be built (quickly)?

holistic approach which focuses on empowering families – including stabilization work through CEOC 
effort to more clearly address all Top Tier Needs 
co-location of services 
already working together and with community partnerships 
training for community partners, families, landlords 
intake form, focus on working with families over long-term 
a lot of participants, and not a cohort model 
o  How does partnership plan to identify/define/track participants and measure results over time for those 

served through the partnership? How long will participants be eligible to receive services? 

•  How does partnership intend to address behavioral health, including substance abuse (which is not explicitly 

mentioned)? 
o  Also, what does partnership mean by “mental health”? It is evident in logic model, but not in narrative. 

How will it be addressed and by who? 

• 

The plan seems to provide families with relief, but does not appear to be transforming and, given that poverty 
is an isolating experience and that networks of support are important, where/how might social networks be 
developed/integrated? Where does sustainable change happen?  

 
Port Arise Institute - Community Art Center (Lead Organization)

Discussion: 
• 
• 
•  organizations have a strong record of working together – their focus on building leadership capacity plays to 

focus on community as a whole – community engagement and empowerment and how to sustain change 
ideas of wealth creation and asset-building are very important 

• 
• 
• 

strengths of each organization 
clear thinking on financial stability side – focus on entrepreneurship 
a lot of input from community and staff 
the Plan really addressed questions and concerns from CBAC dating back to Planning Grant Application: 
o 
increased size of cohort since Planning Grant proposal and adding to size of cohorts in Years 2 and 3 
o 
recruitment of partner organizations to address housing 
innovative approach 

• 
•  How can partnership beef up connection to services around housing stability and mental health? 
o  Plan addresses training of service providers, but what will service providers be doing? 
o  How will partnership support asset-building among participants? 
o  How many participants are in public housing and how might the Partnership respond to their 

realities/interests/needs? 

• 
• 

• 

it seems that service delivery capacities are almost identical for each partner 
This is an ambitious proposal. How can partnership focus on what is attainable within three years while 
maintaining longer-term vision? 
It seems like there are a lot of pieces to manage. How will partnership manage all of this?

o  The Lead Org seems to have the biggest lift. How will CAC manage it? 
o  How much will hinge on Port Community Liaison role? How feasible is this given relatively low salary? 
o 
The model seems to be doing a lot that advances systems change and outcomes beyond family-level, yet it 
does not show up in logic model. Please make this more explicit. 

concern about coaching for 45 people in Year 3

•  How will the transition of new ED at MFNH impact partnership/model?

Discussion: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  What changes did partnership make in response to CBAC feedback to the Planning Grant proposal and during 

strong mental health focus, including case manager for each organization – entry point around mental health 
long history of organizations working together, and the model builds on organizational strengths 
defining a model that will span much of the city geographically 
reaching families where they are, making services accessible 
family engagement and input throughout 
focus on children 
adopting a resilience-fostering model 
budget recognizes the need for additional capacity during Year 1 

the Progress Report Check-in? 
o  Housing Stability and Financial Security do not seem to be sufficiently addressed. How will these needs be 
addressed so that the partnership is equipped to respond to family needs effectively and in a timely 
fashion? How will families who have needs in these areas access the necessary services that might 
contribute to greater housing stability and financial security? 

•  Aside from training, it appears that case managers work independently and much of the implementation is 

siloed within each organization and focused on individual attachments with children and families. Where does 
overarching coordination live? How does this approach address/promote systems change? 
o  The case manager role seems to require a skill set that includes specialization in child therapy, 

adult/family therapy, and case management. How feasible is it to find people with expertise in all three 
for each organization? 

CBAC would like additional detail about the dual generation model: 
o  Beyond counseling for children and their caregiver(s), how do families get connected to supports that lead 

to generational change? 

re: budget: 
o  There are questions about capacity and role of Lead Organization. The equal split across organizations 

seems to minimize the significance of the Lead Organization’s responsibilities for overarching 
coordination, data collection, and financial management. 

o  Beyond training, there appears to be a limited amount of resources allocated to the provision of services 

related to housing stability and financial security. 

o  How confident is partnership about raising $50k/organization for Years 2 & 3? What if that does not 

happen? 

•  How does the partnership plan to collect and track data given that different approaches could be applied in 
each organization? With the absence of a cohort model, how does partnership plan to identify/define/track 
participants and measure results over time for those served through the partnership? 
o  How many children and families will be served? The Outputs in the logic model suggest 10-30 and 5-10. Is 

that number per year, or over the three years?

CBAC observations and considerations across partnerships/moving forward:  

• 

• 
• 

• 

Each  partnership  provides  different  way  to  address  Top  Tier  Needs  and  different  entry  points  for 
participants  
$750k seems like a relatively small amount of money given all that partnerships are proposing to do  
there remain pieces in each plan that are not concretely worked out in all aspects – Year 1 may be more 
experimental  
To  what  degree  is  there  recognition  of  the  wait  time  to  access  mental  health  services?  What  are  the 
potential implications of this for participants/partnerships? 

•  What does CBAC mean by innovation? Innovative for what/where/whom?  
• 

re: timing of grant agreements – i.e., if they start on March 1, is year one 4 months? 16 months? What is 
end date? What is potential for no-cost extension at the end?
