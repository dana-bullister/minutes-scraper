          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So welcome to the March 17, 

2020 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My name is 

Louis Bacci, and I'm the Acting Chair for tonight's meeting.  

We'll begin with an explanation by Staff of the format for 

tonight's meeting.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  My name is Jeff 

Roberts, the Director of Zoning and Development for the 

city.  This meeting is being held virtually, due to the 

state-wide emergency actions limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, an in accordance with 

Governor Charles D. Baker's Executive Order of March 

12,2020, amending the Open Meeting Law.

City of Cambridge website, and on cable television Channel 

22 within Cambridge.   

          All materials to be discussed are available 

online, and linked to the agenda page for this meeting on 

the Open Meeting portal.   

          Because Planning Board members are participating 

remotely by telephone, all members must identify themselves 

before speaking, and all votes must be taken by roll call.   

          For this meeting, the Board will only be 

conducting matters of General Business, and so, no public 

testimony will be taken.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Next, we'll record the 

attendance for tonight's meeting.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So to get the attendance for 

tonight's meeting, I'm going to go in order and ask every 

Planning Board member on the line if we are audible to you, 

and we will indicate if you are audible to us.  So H 

Theodore Cohen, are we audible to you?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  Am I audible to you?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes, you are audible to us.  Steven 

Cohen, are we audible to you?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes, you are.

          Corinne, just a note because you missed the 

introduction.  Because all the Planning Board members are 

participating remotely, all members must identify themselves 

before speaking, and all votes will be taken by roll call.   

          So we just recorded the attendance, and there are 

seven Planning Board members present.  There are six present 

remotely.  Lou Bacci is present in person as the Acting 

Chair, and Associate Member Corinne Espinoza is also present 

on the line.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The first item on the agenda 

is an Update from Community Development Department Staff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, that's me again.  Just 

an update beyond the update on today's meeting format.  We 

do have additional meetings of the Planning Board scheduled.  

          As we noted at the last meeting, March 24 we have 

public hearings scheduled for 1686 Mass Ave, a continued 

hearing on an application for a cannabis retail proposal, 

and a new public hearing -- not a public hearing, a new 

application, 727 Mass Ave in Central Square.   

          We also have scheduled as an item of General 

Business a preapplication conference for the Cambridgeside 

PUD Development.

          On March 31, we had planned a cancellation, but we 

have the intent tonight and are recommending that the items 

on today's agenda be moved to March 31.  So we expect that 

there will be items from today's agenda on that meeting. 

          And on April 7, we have scheduled a public hearing 

on the Affordable Housing Overlay Petition.   

          Just a note that for everything on our agenda, 

it's obviously an evolving situation.  We may find on a day 

to day basis that we are in a better position finding ways 

to reschedule certain items of business, and as we continue 

to work with the technology for holding these meetings 

remotely. 

          We will be updating Planning Board members, and we 

will be updating the web page with any information, as it 

develops.  So that will conclude the update for today.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Do any members have 

questions?  Please say your name. 

          The next item on the agenda is the adoption of 

meeting minutes.  Have we received any transcripts?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We have received a transcript for 

the February 25, 2020 meeting, and that is a certified 

transcript from our stenographer.   

8

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Does the Board have any 

questions?  Please say your name.  Is there a motion to 

approve the transcripts as the minutes for the February 25, 

2020 meeting?  If so, please say your name.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steve Cohen, so moved.

motion.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So to approve the February 25,2020
