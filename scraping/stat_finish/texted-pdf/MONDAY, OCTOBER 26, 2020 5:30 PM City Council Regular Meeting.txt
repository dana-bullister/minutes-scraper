To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $921,062 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund, Emergency Communications Extraordinary Expenditures account to procure a new 
Records Management System (RMS). 
 
The RMS is managed by the Public Safety Information Technology (PSIT) Division of the 
Emergency Communications Department.  Funds will be used to purchase a new Police RMS to 
replace the current system which has been in place since 1996.   The new RMS will better align 
with the long-term operational needs of the Police Department and will enhance reporting and 
investigation capabilities as well as increase accountability, compliance and transparency by 
capturing valuable data regarding officer’s day to day activities in the community. 
 
In support of the city and Police Department’s mission of improved transparency, the proposed 
RMS will include a Procedural Justice module that will enable the department to automate 
statistical analysis of motor vehicle/field stops and behavioral crisis reporting, and provide police 
leadership and the public an opportunity to view the data in near real-time.  Eventually, the 
system will afford the opportunity of statistical analysis of use of force reporting as well.  
 
The new RMS will allow the Police Department to maintain core values of the department, 
utilize a more intuitive system to increase productivity, provide transparency on actions in the 
community, demonstrate impartiality in decision making, and create further opportunities for 
community engagement. 
 
The Police Department will also continue efforts to enhance accountability, ensure department 
compliance with policies and identify training opportunities on trends in the community and for 
those officers needing additional resources or support.

COUNCILLOR CARLONE 
 
WHEREAS: 

City of Cambridge 

O-2 
FIRST IN COUNCIL 
June 22, 2020 

 

 

The City of Cambridge publicly acknowledges we are facing a climate change crisis 
due to increasing dangers of fossil fuels impacting public health and quality of life; and 
 
The intent of Article 22.000 of Cambridge’s Zoning Code is “to promote 
environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient design and development practices in 
new construction and renovation of buildings in the city”; and 
 
The city has set goals for different building types to meet the highest standards for 
environmentally sustainable design in the coming years; and 
 
Costs for different forms of clean energy are equal to or less than fossil fuels; and 
 
Cambridge set a building standard for utilizing clean energy in their non-zero buildings 
to minimize adverse environmental impacts and as examples for private industry and 
all public facilities design to replicate; and 
 
It is of utmost importance that new and renovated projects seriously explore the 
environmental and likely cost advantages of using alternative and renewable energy 
resources during the design development of their projects; now therefore 
 
Under 22.20 Green Building Requirements, the following will be added as Section 
22.25.1 (c) (6): 

an assessment of renewable energy systems that do not consume fossil fuels on-site (to 
include solar photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source 
heat pumps, district energy and geothermal systems, and/or similar systems) that 
examines technical feasibility to meet the projected HVAC and domestic hot water 
demands of the building based on the information provided in 22.25.1(c)(2), and cost 
of installation, the cost of maintenance and operation of the renewable energy system 
and its components, and the amount of any greenhouse gas emissions by source (other 
than from a public utility or municipal lighting plant), taking into account incentives 
provided in 22.25.1(c)(5), and other federal, state and local incentives available to the 
developer, building owner and tenants, all compared to code-compliant energy systems 
that consume fossil fuels on-site and any energy system (other than from a public 
utility or municipal lighting plant) that consumes fossil fuels to be constructed or 
expanded off-site to provide energy to the building. The assessment and any review by 
the CDD as to the assessment shall be made available to the City and to the public and 
shall be part of the Planning Board special permit application submission and any 
hearings before the Planning Board.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more

October 19, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
This is in response to Policy Order Number O-13, of October 5, 2020, which requests that the 
City Manager work with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department and the City 
Solicitor with regard to a draft Truck Safety Ordinance which “would provide requirements for 
safety improvements made to trucks owned by companies which have contracts with the City.”  
 
After consultation with the Law Department and the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 
Department, as well as the Department of Public Works, the Police Department, the Purchasing 
Department and the Community Development Department, I am forwarding a Truck Safety 
Ordinance that contains the measures that could be taken to improve the safety of large trucks 
utilized by City vendors, particularly in relation to the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.  Similar 
to the ordinance in Boston, the attached ordinance requires side guards and other safety measures 
with respect to trucks operated by vendors contracting with the City.  
 
 

 

Very truly yours,

City Manager

Petition.pdf; St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church.pdf; Rush Memorial AME Zion

Dear Councilor Simmons,

I am writing in response to your Monday October 19, 2020 City Council meeting where you exercised your 
Charter Right regarding Cambridge Brands outreach to the neighboring churches and 907 Main Street.

At the hearing on October 19, you stated that you were specifically concerned about notifications to three 
churches and the hotel at 907 Main, all of which are somewhat removed from our operations and curb 
cuts. Even though the three churches and hotel are outside of the area for which the curb cut permit process 
requires a support form, we have reached out to them and requested their input based on your statements.

Cambridge Brands has a long standing relationship with the following churches:

The Korean Methodist Church of Boston

• Union Baptist Church
•
• Rush Memorial AME Zion Church
•

St. Matthew A.M.E Church/ St. Paul A.M.E. Church

Cambridge Brands has provided Sunday parking for the various church services as well as events the churches 
hold during the weekday evenings.
We have met with them going back to 2017, 2019 and 2020 to keep them abreast of our building plan and 
have letters of support for our building project as well as our curb cuts. I have gotten emails from three 
Pastors indicating support of our curb cut.

Regarding 907 Main Street, Mr. Patrick Barrett has attended at least two community meetings in which we 
presented our building plan and I presented him a packet of information regarding the curb cut after you 
referenced it in the City Council Meeting.

I would appreciate if you would email or call so I can discuss your concerns prior to the next City Council 
Meeting on October 26, 2020.

As a longstanding member of the Cambridge Community we have worked to maintain a positive relationship 
with our neighbors and have met all the objectives outlined by the Cambridge Planning, Zoning and Central 
Square Advisory Boards throughout this process with overwhelming support of our project.

Dear City Councilors,

Allan Sadun <aesadun@alum.mit.edu>
Monday, October 26, 2020 9:47 AM
City Council; Clerk
Concerns about PO #4

(This letter reflects my personal views - I haven't talked about the issue with others.)

I'm glad to see you're moving forward with steps to draft a municipal ordinance to improve trust in government 
integrity, and I understand that the draft ordinance proposed tonight is a draft which will require feedback from the 
Ordinance Committee and the City Solicitor. However I have a number of concerns about the current drafted form.

1. The definition of "seeking financial assistance from the city" seems like it would include relief payments from a 
disaster fund if they are in excess of $50,000. Many small business owners in Cambridge are politically engaged, and 
prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, made contributions in the 2019 campaign. If this ordinance had been enacted last year, 
they likely still would have made those contributions, not anticipating the pandemic and their need for aid. This 
ordinance would cut off the amount of aid they are entitled to, through no fault of their own. (Also, a nitpick: how would 
you deal with a $30K aid payment followed by another $30K aid payment a month later?)

2. There is no distinction between spot zoning and district zoning in this ordinance. It is not at all clear to me what 
happens under this draft if someone files a zoning amendment which applies to a neighborhood or city's worth of 
parcels. Does the ban on campaign donations apply to every property owner in the district? Just the person who files the 
petition? Most citizens who file citizens' petitions are politically active and have made political contributions in the past
year - is the intent of this ordinance to kill the citizen's petition process, and insist that any zoning changes be introduced 
by City Councilors instead? Wouldn't that enhance, rather than detract from, the perception that the City Councilors are 
working with applicants behind closed doors?

(Another way this kills the citizen's petition process: most citizens who file petitions are much less up-to-date on their 
municipal regulations than big developers are, and probably don't restrict their donations "just in case I want to file a 
petition next year". This ordinance would catch them by surprise!)

3. The definition of "zoning change enhancing permittee's value" is unfair, as it only considers upzonings. Downzonings 
are, whether accurately or inaccurately, often perceived by their proponents as "enhancing the value" of their street. 
The sponsors of this order are concerned about the perception that wealthy developers buy political influence to build 
buildings in Cambridge, but I am just as concerned about the perception that wealthy homeowners buy political 
influence to keep buildings away. This order should, if it is to apply to district zoning, also apply to applications for 
conservation districts and downzoning petitions.

I get that the authors of this ordinance had in mind the idea of a big development corporation giving money to 
Councilors in exchange for approval of a particular building. I would support an ordinance limited to that case. But as 
written, it applies to much more than that. There are so many ways that the politics in Cambridge are asymmetric -
thanks to the zoning process, the historic conservation process, the way public meetings are conducted, and many other 
factors, it is much easier to stop development than to create development. This ordinance as written is yet another 
asymmetric ratchet, like the filibuster, privileging obstructionist forces even when they are in the minority. Please fix it 
as you move forward.

Thank you,

 To Whom It May Concern: 

The Governing Board of First Parish in Cambridge (Unitarian Universalist) is 
writing to express our support of Blue Enterprise’s application to locate a 
recreational cannabis shop at 57 John F Kennedy Street. 

We support Blue Enterprise’s application because the project represents an 
opportunity for a Black business owner to create jobs for people who were 
unjustly impacted by the racist drug laws of the 1990s.This was well 
described  by author Michelle Alexander in 
Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness
 (2012).  We also want to make 
​
note that Harvard Square has minimal Black-owned businesses and the Blue 
Enterprise endeavour would be a step towards making Harvard Square more 
representative of the Cambridge community. 

The New Jim Crow: Mass 

We support the application despite also sharing concerns about the 
proliferation of commodified addictive substances in our lives.  In accordance 
with our congregation’s equity commitments, like Ibram X. Kendi well 
 (2019) we consider whether this 
 How to Be an Antiracist,
described in
​
enterprise is racist or antiracist.  Does it contribute to racial inequity or racial 
equity?   We believe supporting this business would move Cambridge toward 
racial equity, and that the certain positive impacts to community outweigh the 
possible negative ones. Therefore, we send this letter as a statement of 
support.

An Open Letter to City Officials and the Cambridge Community regarding Cambridge and Cookies: A 
Partnership for equity in Cannabis 

October 22, 2020 

To Whom It May Concern: 

Please consider this a letter of strong personal support for Cambridge and Cookies: A Partnership in 
Equity in Cannabis.  I am writing this letter independent of my role as the Lead Minister of First Parish in 
Cambridge and rather as an African American leader in the Harvard Square neighborhood who is 
publicly committed to equity and inclusion in the square and in Cambridge at large.  The First Parish in 
Cambridge board will offer a separate response to this project on behalf of the church. 

The Cambridge and Cookies partnership project is designed as part of a larger movement in the growing 
cannabis industry to “take restorative steps to address historical inequities” that have 
disproportionately impacted black and brown communities.  As you are aware, this has been codified 
and affirmed by the City of Cambridge and court rulings that defended amendment to the Cambridge 
city code to prioritize minority opportunities with cannabis businesses1 2. 

The relevant passage (5.50.040) from Cambridge ordinance 1409 amended to the municipal code reads: 

5.50.040 Permitting Preferences for Priority Applicants The City shall issue a Cannabis Business 
Permit pursuant to this Chapter only to Priority Applicants. For the first two years after the 
Effective Date of this Chapter as stated in section 5.50.100 below, the City shall issue a Cannabis 
Business Permit to operate a Cannabis Retail Store only to Group A Priority Applicants who are 
Economic Empowerment Applicants certified as such by the Commonwealth's Cannabis Control 
Commission.3 

Cambridge is to be applauded for this concrete action on a policy level. 

However, in addition to policy, the work of equity also requires public will.  Too often, the efforts to 
create actual equity for people of color have been historically bogged down by technical exceptions or 
personal conflicts that have little or nothing to do with the overarching goal of righting the wrongs of 
historical systemic racism that have been built into our public practices.  Racial covenants, 
miscegenation laws, NIMBY*-ism around affordable housing and the draconian crime bills of the 1960’s 
through the 1990’s are just a few examples of some of these past wrongs.  Today, there are whole 
communities (among them Cambridge black communities) that are still working to recover from the 
worst effects of these.  The Cookies partnership for equity represents both a step in the right direction 
and an opportunity to write a new narrative , define a new relationship between Harvard Square and 
local black business and demonstrate what equity driven goals of social justice can look like. 

This letter is not from the congregation I serve.  However, as a professional, I am proud to represent the 
oldest faith institution in Harvard Square.  As an ordained Unitarian Universalist minister, I take very

seriously the moral and ethical life of my congregation, the surrounding immediate area and Cambridge 
at large.  My work regularly intersects with clergy, the police, local and state government as well as 
business leaders.  More importantly, my work intersects with a cross section of Cambridge that is both 
young, middle aged and elderly, wealthy and unhoused, black, brown and white, immigrant, native and 
indigenous and refugee.  I would not support any effort that I believed would be harmful to any of these 
communities. 

On a personal level, I experience the direct impact that a lack of black and people of color businesses in 
Harvard Square has on people of color who come from around the world to this community as students 
and visitors.  Like me, their reaction is one of surprise at the stark absence of people of color.  I have had 
it said to me by more than one black student new to the area that coming to Harvard Square was like 
coming to a foreign country when they realized how segregated it feels. 

I am also weighing in on this project because I am well aware of various anxieties about cannabis in the 
public square.  As a faith leader, I understand the social, ethical and religious objections to the fact that 
cannabis is legal in our communities at all.  I must respect those positions.  However, I am also aware of 
the historical ways in which black businesses have been hindered by narratives about corruption and 
respectability.  Although I don’t believe it is anyone’s overt intent to paint the partners in this project in 
this lens, as a black leader in the Square, I am willing to raise this issue to assure that any open 
community conversation about the presence of black business of any kind in Harvard Square does not at 
any time or in any way conflate those pursuits with criminal, illicit or irresponsible behavior. 

Surely with the incredible minds and hearts in this community, Cambridge can work with the project 
team to create a retail experience that acts on the values of equity, justice and inclusion that the 
Cambridge community says they want while contributing to the aesthetic, cultural and economic vitality 
of our city.  As a job incubator alone, this project is unique in a city that struggles to employ people of 
color in general but more specifically formerly incarcerated and unhoused people.  Cambridge can 
actively and intentionally demonstrate a real commitment to equity by exploring all of the options to 
realize this project.  What is more, Cambridge can model what it means to pave the way for black and 
people of color business to be a welcome and common addition to the Square as opposed to an 
exception. 

In the end, this project holds more than just the promise of redemption for those adversely impacted by 
some of the worst policies of our country.  It holds the promise of redemption for Harvard Square where 
it has for too long been out of reach to black entrepreneurs.  This project holds the promise for future 
people of color led businesses to be part of the Harvard Square community.  How this project is 
embraced or rejected will reverberate for many years to come and I trust that Cambridge City leadership 
will do the right thing and work with the partnership to realize the Cambridge and Cookies equity 
partnership. 

Thank you, 

Rev. Adam Lawrence Dyer

Council Orders #4 and #6

To members of the Cambridge City Council,

 

I writing to express my strong support for council orders #4 and #6. To me it is obvious that 
people seeking contracts or special permits or zoning changes from the city should not be 
allowed to make campaign contributions to council members. It’s far too close to ‘buying 
votes’.
I also support prohibiting evictions during the pandemic – if necessary via a city program of 
subsidies to poor residents in arrears.

Please don't destroy public comment -- reject Unfinished Business #5

[ I signed up for public comment, but filled out the form twice because the first time I didn't realize I was going to speak.
I hope that's not too confusing. I wish to speak. ]

Madam Mayor and members of the Council:

The Proposed change to Rule 24(C)(1)(a) would limit public comment at City Council meetings to two minutes at all 
times, unconditionally, except in the unlikely event that there are less than 20 people signed up. It gives no discretion to 
the Chair.

At a time of unprecedented attacks on our democracy and unimaginable constraints on public particiation in 
government, the City Council ought not be taking steps to reduce citizen access to government.

Even extremely prepared commenters currently have trouble fitting their comments into 3 minutes. That’s less time 
than is generally given by other cities and towns in Massachusetts, most of which do not limit speakers to items on the 
Council agenda. Cambridge is uniquely restrictive and mired in red tape.

Furthermore, most commenters are not extremely well-prepared. They’re not professionals, they’re citizens.  Most are 
regular people who have been told about an issue on the agenda and are learning as they go. Many are first-time 
listeners AND first-time callers, who have not and cannot be expected to read the rules in advance.

This proposal needs further study. At the very least, it should be held off until the Council finishes studying the future of
public comment after the pandemic. If a Council Committee is not already thinking about how that works, and how to 
integrate the increased access that Zoom provides after regular public meetings can resume, a committee should be 
charged to do so. And it should look at time limits.

It is your job to listen to what the public says. Don’t make that listening process a bad joke of an authoritarian 
government, like elections in Russia.

Please refer Unfinished Business #5 back to Committee for further study, and do not adopt this narrowing restriction on 
public speech.
Thank you.

Support of policy orders

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors,

I am writing to support the following policy orders:

Policy order #5 which seeks to ban tear gas use by police in Cambridge.

Policy order #6  which asks the city administration to request large property managers to reduce actions leading to 
eviction court proceedings.

Policy order #4 which proposes specific steps for campaign finance reform. I realize this kind of order has been 
controversial in the past. In 2020, it is time for all Cambridge elected officials to commit to finance reform.

Thank you for your attention. 

Sincerely,
Kathy Watkins

Comments for Housing Committee Meeting, 10/28

I just wanted to email to comment, in advance of this meeting, to reiterate my strong view that it is so important during 
this time that the most vulnerable among us do not end up on the streets. We must bear the horrible economic 
burdens of this pandemic collectively, and not shift this burden onto the most vulnerable, as it is so often is, and 
preventing evictions, both at the notice to quit and execution stages, is a large piece of this. This can take a number of 
forms, many of which are already being taken by the council/city: the existing city-wide moratorium on the enforcement 
of evictions, expanded strategies to support renters and small property owners at risk of eviction, continued efforts to 
inform tenants of their rights and provide access to legal resources, etc.

On top of these steps, I encourage two additional steps:
(1) I think the city should think seriously about tenants that are displaced from other nearby cities, and whether there 
are steps that Cambridge can take to help with rapid rehousing. From my work helping to provide RAFT rental 
assistance through the last few months and especially over the last week, I can testify that many notices to quit have 
already been served, some executions of eviction as well, and if not a tsunami, we are certainly facing a continued wave 
of evictions across the Boston area. I hope Cambridge might be able to do its part to help lessen the effects of this.
(2) I encourage the city to think seriously about the long-term viability of many of the efforts already 
implemented/being considered; we would do well to have much stronger tenant protections as the default, not a 
temporary emergency solution.

I also want to use this opportunity to reiterate that, in addition to preventing evictions, I believe that we must continue 
to recognize that rent burdenship and homelessness are political choices that we collectively make and maintain, and 
we need to have the political will to not continue to treat these as anywhere near the status quo. Strong tenant 
protections are a large step in this direction.

Public Comment 10.26.2020: Support for POR 2020 #242, POR 2020 #240

I just wanted to email to register my support for POR 2020 #242. Until eviction sealing is made the law of the land (or of 
the state), even no-fault evictions can be a mark on a potential tenant's record that makes it unduly hard for them in the 
future to find a place to live. I applaud the continued efforts to prevent as many evictions as possible – and I encourage 
the city to think seriously about potentially making a number of these efforts and programs long-term. We would do 
well to have much stronger tenant protections as the default, not a temporary emergency solution. Finally, I just 
wanted to echo what I've written in the past: that in all of policy choices right now, I believe that we must continue to 
recognize that rent burdenship and homelessness are political choices that we collectively make and maintain, and we 
need to have the political will to not continue to treat these as anywhere near the status quo.

Second, I wanted to register my support for POR 2020 #240. I look forward to the discussion around this, and see no 
reason why it shouldn't be forwarded to discussion in the ordinance committee. I imagine the particulars might be 
interesting to work out, but the truth that we all know is that up and down politics, money, sometimes through the 
proxy of "who you know" but also in its raw form, is a controlling interest in our country. We would do well to take 
steps to get money out of politics, and this seems like a productive step towards this.

Thank you so much,
Kavish Gandhi, 115 Hampshire St #4

Public Comment, Ordinance Committee Real Estate Transfer Fee Petition

I wanted to register my support for the real estate transfer fee home rule petition. This seems to me a relatively 
common-sense way to raise additional money to support affordable housing, targeting the upper portion of house sales 
(though I imagine that the specific threshold might be up for debate, which is beyond the scope of my knowledge). My 
only additional comment would be to ask if there would potentially be a way to increase the tax for situations in which a 
seller is engaging in speculation – perhaps to define this precisely, if a seller sells a house within say two years of buying, 
and sells it for above a certain threshold amount. In that case, I would hope that the city could impose a higher transfer 
fee, and wonder if this could be included in this home rule petition.

Finally, as in prior cases, I also want to use this opportunity to reiterate that, in addition to preventing evictions, I believe 
that we must continue to recognize that rent burdenship and homelessness are political choices that we collectively 
make and maintain, and we need to have the political will to not continue to treat these as anywhere near the status 
quo. At least within the current market strictures, targeting high-value real estate transactions and using that money to 
produce more affordable housing is perhaps a step in that direction.

SUPPORT PO #4

I am writing in SUPPORT OF PO #4, PROHIBITING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS FROM PEOPLE DOING BUSINESS 
WITH THE CITY.
Since nothing came from a previous affirmative vote and, given the development pressures the city is under, it makes 
sense that those
businesses don't try and sway councillors with contributions.

The look of impropriety goes far beyond councilors supporting certain projects and developers getting rewarded for it.
We see certain activist councilors aline themselves with lobbyists and special interest groups who also benefit from these 
connections.
Not only have we seen it in re-zoning which benefits developers who produce exorbitant market rate housing with token 
inclusionary
(which many don't qualify for), we see erosion of protocol and interference with homeowner rights being championed by 
certain city officials.
I may also add that in promoting their businesses, the Cannibis Industry should be included in the monitoring of donations.
Unfortunately, many of these groups have PACs now which camouflage direct donations that is even harder to track.

But I think PO #4 is a step in the right direction even if it is asking the council in part to basically police itself. We need 
more than a reduction in
donations. I would like to see a hard number limit to begin with. A hand-slap is not good enough.

Cambridge Brands Curb Cut APP 2020 #41
10-26 -20 City Council  Cambridge Brands Curb Cut remarks.docx; Community 
Engagement.pptx

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Esteemed City Council Members;

Attached for your review are my remarks which will be read at the city council meeting this evening. I have also attached 
a list of Cambridge Brands’ community outreach and organizations it has supported over the years and will continue to 
support. 

I cannot tell you how many times I have heard the question “Why are you still making candy in Cambridge wouldn’t it be 
easier and less expensive to move out of the Cambridge?”. And the simple answer is Tootsie Roll is committed to the 
City of Cambridge and its employees or we would not be investing $25,000,000 in this building addition. As a 30 year 
employee of Tootsie Roll, I am continually amazed at their loyalty and commitment to helping to develop their 
employees and see them succeed.

As a long standing responsible member of this community we hope you vote favorably on our curb cut request at this 
evening’s meeting.

Respectfully Submitted;
Paula Yetman
Plant Manager
Cambridge Brands Inc.

I come before you seeking approval for the proposed curb cuts on Main and State streets associated 
with our building addition. 

We embarked in 2017 on the approval process for our modest 5 story addition which is needed to allow 
for the replacement of our primary and secondary electrical switchgear and loading docks. At each step 
of this process we have engaged with city departments receiving widespread support and approval for 
our project from: 

We held multiple neighborhood outreach meetings and pre covid face to face visits with area businesses 
to make sure all of our neighbors were aware of our plans. The curb cuts currently before you were 
always shown on those plans.  

We have a positive relationship with the neighboring churches including: 

All of whom we allow to use our parking lots on weekends free of charge and for special events.

Since last Monday’s meeting we have confirmed that our project has the full support of the churches, 
and I have written documentation of that.  I also reached out to Patrick Barrett proprietor of 907 Main

City Council; Clerk
10/26/20 -Policy Order #4, prohibiting campaign donations from people doing business 
with the city

Dear Councillors,
I encourage you to enact restrictions on donations to Councillors (and any organizations they are affiliated with) from 
people/entities doing business with the City. Too often the voice of the residents, and what's in the best long-term 
interest of the community, are sacrificed in favor of powerful business interests that wield political power to advance a 
self-serving vote. This is not in the best interests of the City as a whole in the long run. It also undermines the people's 
trust and confidence in their government and elected officials.
Thank-you for tackling this problem.
Peter

Members of the 

Would you please pass the following to the Cambridge City Council as a communication at its next meeting.

RE: 1. SECRET Late Motion on I90 was outrageous.
2. Members of the public commenting at meetings should be visible to viewers of the meeting.

Gentlemen / Ladies:

The following stems from my view of this evening's meeting.

1. SECRET Late Motion on I90 was outrageous.

A late motion concerning I90 was passed IN SECRET at the very end of the meeting. .

The only discussion I heard was that McGovern was added. Although something was very rapidly said IN COMBINATION with non 
controversial motions. The mention corrected reference to I95 to I90.

This is distressingly consistent with the ongoing pattern of SECRECY of City Council actions on the Charles River and HIGHLY 
IMPROPER.

2. Members of the public commenting at meetings should be visible to viewers of the meeting.

In watching tonight’s meeting, I am amazed as to the inferior handling of public comments from the way that the Massachusetts 
Department of Transportation does it.

What is happening is that the members of the City Council are participating on ZOOM and are visible to the voters as talking.  

The public is not allowed to be seen by people watching the meeting. Public comments are limited to voice only.

This is in striking difference from procedures in state hearings concerning various matters before the Department of Transportation, in 
which ALL participants participate through ZOOM.

Because of the pandemic, the public is not allowed to participate in the meeting physically, but MassDOT is allowing all people who 
want to comment to be seen through ZOOM technology at appropriate times.

I would think that the public should be given the courtesy of being seen as the public speaks as has been the procedure as long as city 
council meetings have been publicized.

The technology to show public speakers is no more complicated than the current procedures which only allow members of the public 
to be heard, but not be seen.

Please give the public speaking the same courtesy when speaking as is granted to members of the City Council.

Please allow those members of the public to be seen through ZOOM unless the public speaker objects. I very seriously doubt that 
there will be objections.

Dear City Councillors: 

Sheli Wortis <sheliwortis@comcast.net>
Monday, October 26, 2020 3:50 PM
City Council; Clerk
support for Policy orders on tonight's agenda

I write in support of Policy Order 4 (#240) which seeks to move to the City Solicitor and then the 
Ordinance Committee discussion and recommendations for possible actions that will reduce or 
eliminate campaign donations from donors seeking contracts, special permits, up-zoning, acquisition 
of real estate, or financial assistance. By supporting this Policy Order the City Council will be taking a 
positive step towards creating a more equitable election process. Taking big money out of politics 
increases the likelihood that qualified candidates of all social and economic backgrounds may run for 
office and that voters choices will be based on candidates’ qualifications and experience. 

I also support Policy Order 6 (#242) which urges the Housing Committee to act quickly to reduce or 
eliminate eviction filings by housing providers during this Covid 19 pandemic. While this will not 
resolve the housing affordability crisis, no one should be threatened with the loss of housing during 
this difficult period. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Sheli Wortis

As a resident of Cambridge, I am writing to ask that you support the policy order (#241) to ban the use of tear gas. If a 
chemical agent is banned by international law in warfare, it should absolutely be banned from use against civilians.

That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Community

every opportunity to access any future City funding should it be made available, and to

and typically rented out by groups of people to safely shuttle them between bars and 
other establishments for special occasions – have recently been spotted driving and in 
out of the Cambridge Crossing area; and  
 
In normal times, utilizing such buses would be legitimate ventures, yet these vehicles 
have been spotted packing in large groups of people who are often unmasked, not 
practicing social distancing, and potentially helping to spread Covid-19 throughout the 
Cambridge community; and  
 

their friends, and celebrate special occasions, we are continually reminded by our 
public health officials and by our governor that our community must remain vigilant in 
practicing good hygiene, social distancing whenever possible, and wearing of masks to 
prevent a wider outbreak of the Covid-19 illness, and utilizing the services of party 
buses at this time would appear to be jeopardizing the City’s efforts to contain this 
outbreak; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to raise this issue with the 
appropriate representatives of the Cambridge Crossing buildings, and with the 
appropriate representatives of the Governor’s Office, to ensure that these businesses 
are not in violation of any current statewide Covid-19 protocols; and be it further

of this article if it were an initial contract. 
(x)  The 
any

the  award  of  the  item,  or  for  the  duration  of  the  term  of  any  contract,  whichever  is 
longer.

that an applicant made a material misstatement on the mandatory disclosure form or if 
the  applicant  fails  to  comply  with  the  provisions  above.  If  a  contract  is  awarded,  it 
shall be a material breach of the terms of any contract where an applicant which is a 
party to such contract made any contribution in violation of this article. For all other 
violations, the applicant shall be fined for each violation of this article in accordance 
with section xxxx The enforcing authority shall be the ethics commission or auditor. 
 
 - Refund of contribution.

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
COUNCILLOR NOLAN 
MAYOR SIDDIQUI 
 
WHEREAS: 

The use of tear gas in warfare has been prohibited by international law since the 1925 
Geneva Protocol banned its use along with other chemical weapons; and 

 
Tear gas continues to be used against civilians in the United States, including as 
recently as this year against protesters in Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C.; 
and 
 
Exposure to tear gas can cause immediate chemical burns, allergic reactions, and 
respiratory failure in people with preexisting respiratory conditions like as asthma and 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) according to the American Lung 
Association; and 
 
According to the Centers for Disease Control, long-term effects of tear gas can include 
glaucoma, cataracts, and breathing problems such as asthma; and 

 
Tear gas is not included in the Cambridge Police Department’s list of Approved Less-
Than-Lethal weapons in its current Policy & Procedures document; and 
 
The Cambridge Police Department has not utilized tear gas in any capacity over the 
past 30 years, the Cambridge Police Department’s administration specifically prohibits 
the use of tear gas, Police Commissioner Branville Bard worked to ensure that all tear 
gas in the department was disposed of upon his taking the role as Police 
Commissioner, and the City Council wishes to do everything in its power to ensure 
that tear gas is never utilized by the Police Department in the future; and 
 
While the Cambridge Police Department’s Policies and Procedures currently prohibit 
the use of tear gas, it was previously used on Cambridge residents and others 
protesting for peace and racial justice, with documented instances of its use at least in 
1970 and 1972 
 
As civilians continue to be tear gassed at protests for racial justice around the country, 
the Cambridge City Council should seek to codify in law the City’s prohibition on the 
use of this chemical weapon to ensure the permanency of current policy in Cambridge 
and to demonstrate a model for other municipalities; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to work with the Solicitor to draft 
Ordinance language to prohibit the use of tear gas in Cambridge; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

Possessing any record of an eviction filing can present a serious barrier to a  
potential tenant’s success in securing housing; and 
 
Regardless of fault, outcome, or underlying basis for a court filing, the fact a  
potential tenant was a party in an eviction or housing case may give a property  
owner reason to reject the tenant’s application; and 
 
There should be alternate opportunities for resolution within the eviction  
process before an eviction filing; and 
 
Facilitated discussions between property owners and tenants can reduce evictions and 
lead to solutions that are beneficial for both parties, particularly when combined with 
wraparound supports such as housing and financial counseling; and 
 
One of the recommendations from the Tenant Displacement Task Force was for the 
City to facilitate a partnership between its major housing provider entities, such as 
CHA, Just A Start, Homeowner’s Rehab, and other management companies serving 
Cambridge renters, with the goal of reducing the number of actions taken against 
tenants that result in eviction-related court filings; and 
 
In cases when a housing entity must take legal action against a tenant, it is most often 
on account of non-payment of rent and does not result in a physical eviction but any 
eviction-associated court filing, regardless of outcome, can be a long-term liability for 
a renter and may prevent a tenant from securing necessary housing in the future; and 
 
The Cambridge Housing Authority has already started an Eviction Project, looking at 
how the entity can reduce filings for non-payment of rent; and 
 
 
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is potential for many unavoidable  
eviction filings; and 
 
The City must work with all its major housing providers and reduce the number  
of actions filed; now therefore be it 
 
That this policy order be referred to the Housing Committee for discussion on  
ways to engage our major housing providers in reducing or eliminating eviction  
filings during the public health crisis.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The Allston Multimodal I-90 Project, managed by MassDOT, will transform road, 
railway, pathway, parkland, and shoreline of the Charles River; and 
 
The Project will create a new neighborhood across the river from Cambridge and has 
the potential to provide great benefits, though it will increase traffic and noise for 
Cambridge during construction; and 
 
The City Council on October 5, 2020, unanimously supported a policy order urging 
Secretary Pollack to consider a lane reduction and an at-grade design; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  MassDOT has presented three alternatives for the narrow area between Boston 

University and the river known as the “throat”; and 
 
Cambridge previously supported the “Hybrid” alternative that would rebuild Soldiers 
Field Road on a viaduct but withdrew its support when MassDOT said the Hybrid 
would require building a “temporary” bridge far out into the Charles River to hold 
Soldiers Field Road and the Paul Dudley White Pathway for the 8-10 years of 
construction – a completely unacceptable intrusion; and 
 
One of the three alternatives is the All-At-Grade Alternative which will align the 
Massachusetts Turnpike, Soldiers Field Road, the Worcester commuter rail line, the 
Grand Junction railroad, and the Paul Dudley White Path all at ground level; and 
 

Packet Pg. 274

WHEREAS: 

The All-At-Grade Alternative provides: 

6.7

●  For a quieter Cambridge and Magazine Beach Park (the 17-acre park across 
from “the throat,” Cambridge’s second largest park). Trucks will no longer 
need to jake break as they go up and down the elevated turnpike; 

●  A rebuilt Grand Junction bridge over Soldiers Field Road that will make 

possible future transit and safe pathway for walkers and bikers on the Grand 
Junction tracks from the new West Station to the river pathways and across the 
river to Kendall Square and beyond; 

●  A wider, safer, Paul Dudley White pathway for walkers and bikers, many of 

whom are going to or from Cambridge; 

●  Connections for walkers and bikers between neighborhoods and the river, 

including a generous ped/bike bridge from the Boston University area across 
the roads and railways to the river;  

●  Opportunities for future air rights development over the highways, whether of 

buildings, parkland, or other public use; 

●  Maximum flexibility to adjust the layout of roads, rails, and parkland to 

changes in commuting technology and patterns as increased use of public 
transport in the future lessens the need for asphalt; 

●  more opportunities for creative planting and other environmentally favorable 

●  vastly lower long-term maintenance and rebuilding costs than a rebuilt 

design solutions; and 

Turnpike viaduct; and  

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
 
The All-At-Grade Alternative has recently been revised and improved to be the only 
alternative that, for the first time, includes the restoration and recreation of a natural 
river shoreline, one of Cambridge’s priorities for over five years; and 
 
The lanes of Soldiers Field Road in the All-At-Grade Alternative are shown by 
MassDOT as wider than now exist for this parkway, resulting in a small but significant 
intrusion of the roadway into the edge of the river; and 
 

 
RESOLVED: 

 
WHEREAS:  MassDOT has set a deadline of October 30, 2020, for public comment on which of the 
three alternatives shouldbe identified as the Preferred Alternative in the next phase of 
state and federal environmental process; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record in full support of the All-At-Grade Alternative as 
the Preferred Alternative in the next phase of state and federal environmental process 
and in urging MassDOT to further revise the All-At-Grade Alternative to narrow 
Soldiers Field road lanes to existing parkway standards and make other roadway 
modifications to maximize space for parkland and pathways in the throat area and to 
avoid intrusion into the Charles River; and be it further 
 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to send a suitably engrossed copy of 
this Resolution to Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack on behalf of the entire 
City Council.

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR

          Mayor 
 

 
To: 

From:  

Date:   

 

Cambridge City Council 

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor 

October 22, 2020 

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
At the School Committee’s last Regular Meeting on October 20th, Superintendent Salim gave 
this presentation to provide an update on enrollment, staffing, FY21 costs, and scenario planning. 
As of October 15th, 55% (1,579) eligible students are enrolled in the in-person instruction model 
and FY21 COVID-19 costs are estimated to be about $17.1 million. CPSD estimates requesting 
an additional $13.0 million from the City. As we plan for “Phase 3” I want to make sure that we 
properly engage our many stakeholders and particularly the families of our most vulnerable 
scholars.  

As you all know, CPSD has established three metrics for monitoring the level of COVID-19 
spread. Two of the three metrics must exceed their threshold in order for school buildings to 
close. The District’s current wastewater metric has a threshold of <100 viral genomes/mL in the 
wastewater at the MWRA sewage treatment plant. MWRA has reported that the 7-day average of 
the virus measured in the wastewater hit 100 viral genomes/mL as of October 19th. The other two 
metrics remain comfortably below their thresholds. I am looking forward to the launch of our 
City’s pilot program for wastewater testing in Cambridge as it will inform and help to refine 
CPSD’s monitoring.  
 
I am continuing conversations with CRLS and the City about the feasibility of a small pilot for 
supervised remote learning spaces for students in grades 6-8, in partnership with local nonprofit 
organizations. If we are able to make this possible, we will be prioritizing students with the greatest 
need and adhere to all of the guidelines in the CPS COVID-19 Safety and Facilities Manual. I will 
provide all updates as they are available.  
 
I have been participating in CRLS’s #HerVote club meetings and events, supporting their projects 
including #HerVote (in partnership with the Radcliffe Institute) to help continue shaping the way 
we understand women’s role in our democratic processes. I encourage you all to also download
