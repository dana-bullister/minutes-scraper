To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I  am  hereby  requesting  the  appropriation  of  $9,277,190  from  Free  Cash  to  the  General  Fund 
School Department Salaries and Wages account ($7,446,360), General Fund School Department 
Other Ordinary Maintenance account ($1,781,455), and General Fund School Department Travel 
and Training account ($49,375), to fund additional costs associated with the reopening of schools 
with  health  and  safety  mitigations  related  to  COVID-19.    The  School  Committee  Order  is 
attached. 
 
Re-opening schools during the COVID-19 global pandemic has required substantial investments 
in health and safety mitigations, as well as additional staff, technology and instructional supports. 
In total, the estimated costs related to preparing and operating the City’s schools for the 2020-21 
school year is $16.3 million.  The School Department has identified approximately $7 million to 
fund  these  costs:    $5.4  million  in  federal  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security 
(CARES)  Act  funding  and  other  grants;  and  $1.6  million  in  reallocated  FY21  General  Fund 
budget line items. In order to finance the balance of the estimated costs, an additional $9,277,190 
is needed.   
 
Additional costs ($16.3M total) include: 
•  Health & Safety Expenses ($5.4 million) - including Personal Protective Equipment for staff 
and students; additional sinks for hand washing in school buildings; improvements related to 
the ventilation systems including air scrubbers with HEPA filters, box fans, window repairs, 
an engineering study and a planned project to implement the recommendations of the 
engineering study; on-site COVID-19 testing for staff two times per week; 

 
•  Additional School-based Staff ($6.5 million) - in order to support social distancing of 6 feet 

within classrooms and to address additional special education service requirements;  

1.2

 

 

Packet Pg. 39

1.2

• 

Instructional Supports ($1.9 million) - including the Extended Learning Time program at the 
M.L. King School and Fletcher Maynard Academy; instructional materials sent home to 
students who are learning remotely; expanded summer programming; funding for planning 
time for teachers and paraprofessionals working in-person; 

 
•  Technology ($1.3 million) - Including additional Chromebooks (to ensure that every student 
has one); additional and expanded software licenses to support remote learning; system 
upgrades; Hot Spots for families; additional technology staff to support expanded technology 
and data needs; 

 
•  Planning & Engagement ($688K) - including educator Collaboratives; task force and 

working groups; school planning; principal and summer work; 

 
•  School Lunch Program ($470K) - The USDA has issued a waiver that allows the district to 
offer free meals to all students, not just those who qualify for Free/Reduced lunch.  The 
additional costs in this category primarily reflect the estimated lost revenue from paid 
lunches. In addition, the Department has purchased additional equipment, including carts for 
transporting meals to classrooms and tablets for meal tracking during distribution.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I hereby request that the City Council move to Executive Session to discuss the purchase, exchange, lease or 
value of real property as discussion in an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating 
position of the public body.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing to ask for your approval to allow members of adjudicatory boards and commissions 
such as the Planning Board, the Board of Zoning Appeal, the Historical Commission, the 
Conservation Commission and the License Commission, among other adjudicatory bodies, to 
vote on a matter before the adjudicatory body of which they are a member if the board member 
has missed one of the sessions regarding the matter at issue. 
 
Chapter 39, Section 23D of the Massachusetts General Laws, known as the “Mullin Rule” (see 
attached statutory language), provides that members of municipal boards or commissions who 
are absent from no more than one session of an adjudicatory hearing may still act on the matter at 
a future session, provided that the municipality accepts this section of the law and that the absent 
member reviews a transcript or video or audio recording of the hearing and certifies that they 
have done so. This statute is known as the Mullin Rule because it overturns in part a court case 
which had provided that only members present at all sessions of an adjudicatory hearing on a 
particular matter are eligible to vote on that matter.  Mullin v. Planning Board of Brewster, 17 
Mass.App.Ct. 139 (1983). 
 
On a number of past occasions, hearing sessions have needed to be postponed on short notice 
due to a member’s unanticipated absence for illness or other reasons, causing inconvenience to 
members of the public and applicants. Acceptance of the Mullin Rule for adjudicatory boards 
and commissions in Cambridge would help to forestall some of these issues in the future.  
Therefore, I am hereby requesting that the City Council accept the provisions of G.L. c.39, 
§23D. 
 
I look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have.

TITLE VII. CITIES, TOWNS AND DISTRICTS 

CHAPTER 39. MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT 

Section 23D: Adjudicatory hearings; attendance by municipal board, committee and commission 
members; voting disqualification 

Section 23D. (a) Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, upon municipal 
acceptance of this section for 1 or more types of adjudicatory hearings, a member of any 
municipal board, committee or commission when holding an adjudicatory hearing shall not be 
disqualified from voting in the matter solely due to that member's absence from no more than a 
single session of the hearing at which testimony or other evidence is received. Before any such 
vote, the member shall certify in writing that he has examined all evidence received at the missed 
session, which evidence shall include an audio or video recording of the missed session or a 
transcript thereof. The written certification shall be part of the record of the hearing. Nothing in 
this section shall change, replace, negate or otherwise supersede applicable quorum 
requirements. 

(b) By ordinance or by-law, a city or town may adopt minimum additional requirements for 
attendance at scheduled board, committee, and commission hearings under this section.

The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced opportunities for residents to get fresh air and 
spend time outdoors while safely socially distancing; and 
 
This can be even more challenging for the many Cambridge residents, including lower-
income residents, who do not have access to yards or private outdoor space; and 
 
Spending time outdoors has been proven to improve mental and physical health and 
has been deemed a lower-risk activity during the pandemic; and 

 
The Cambridge City Council passed a policy order in April that led to Riverbend Park 
being opened on Memorial Drive on both Saturdays and Sundays, which has provided 
an opportunity for residents to spend time outside while safely social distancing; and 
 
Riverbend Park, which is owned and operated by Massachusetts Department of 
Conservation and Recreation (DCR) is currently scheduled to be open on Memorial 
Drive through Sunday, November 29, 2020; and 
 
Keeping Riverbend Park open beyond November 29 would provide a much-needed 
opportunity for residents to spend safe, socially distant time outdoors as the colder 
weather begins to make some other activities more challenging; now therefore be it 

 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to work with the Massachusetts 
Department of Conservation and Recreation to explore the feasibility of keeping 
Riverbend Park open beyond November 29; and be it further 
 
That the city confer with DCR and advocate for extending Riverbend Park the length 
of Memorial Drive; and further be it 
 
That the City or DCR collect data on residents’ usage of Riverbend Park to better 
inform future decisions regarding its status; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council by November 23, 2020.

WHEREAS: 

Citywide, Cambridge businesses, the Cambridge Public Health Department and 
Cambridge Public Schools have implemented protective measures and strategies to 
prevent the transmission of COVID-19 throughout the community; and 
 
Though these protective measures have kept Cambridge COVID-19 positivity rates 
lower than neighboring cities, Cambridge’s positive cases do continue to increase 
daily; and 
 
Epidemiologists recommend targeted interventions to stop the spread of COVID-19 to 
keep schools open; and 
 
Epidemiologists recommend closing bars, casinos and gyms, and other non-essential 
business activities to stop the spread of COVID-19 as a way to keep schools open; and 
 
Research suggests a strong correlation between indoor activities and the rise of 
COVID-19 community spread; and 
 
Indoor activities are contributing to the rise in cases in Cambridge, getting our metrics 
dangerously close to closing schools and resuming remote only learning again; and 
 

and prioritize our scholars and their educations as we navigate through the next phase 
of the public health crisis; and 
 
Our efforts must be part of a regional response in order to not unfairly penalize 
Cambridge restaurants and small businesses; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Metro Mayors’ Association to temporarily 
restrict high risk indoor activities, such as indoor dining and gyms, and be it further 
 
That the City Manager, Community Development Department, the Economic 
Development Division, the Assessing Department and other relevant City Departments 
organize a relief program to assist and financially support businesses affected by these 
temporary closures. 
 
That the City Manager and all relative Departments, begin meeting immediately with 
the business community and the Covid-19 Expert Advisory Panel to discuss what 
interventions can be universally implemented to make indoor business activities safer. 

 
WHEREAS:  We must take action to stop the spread of COVID-19 in order to keep our schools open

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS  
  

Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives in General Court 

assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:  

 
SECTION 1.  
  

Beginning in the year 2019, notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, 

the City of Cambridge may offer early voting for municipal elections. 

The City of Cambridge may elect to allow any qualified voter, as defined in section 1 of 

chapter 51 of the General Laws, to cast a ballot for any biennial municipal election during the 

early voting period.  

The City of Cambridge’s Election Commission may promulgate regulations to implement 

this act not inconsistent with section 25B of chapter 54 of the General Laws and with other 

election laws applicable in the City of Cambridge, including those governing proportional 

representation voting.  Such regulations may include, but are not limited to, a process for 

establishing early voting locations, dates, staffing, and a process for applying for, receiving, 

separating, compiling, recording, and securing early voter ballots. Each early voting site shall be 

accessible to persons with disabilities.  

 

 SECTION 2.   EFFECTIVE DATE  
  

the City Council of said City, but not otherwise. 

This act shall take full effect upon its acceptance and appropriation by majority vote of

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The City Council and the Department of Public Works are working on lasting 
amendments to the Tree Protection Ordinance based on the detailed findings of the 
Urban Master Plan Task Force; and 
 
The discussion has been advanced out of the Health & Environment Committee into 
the Ordinance Committee, but the next hearing cannot be scheduled until draft 
ordinance language is available, and ordination is unlikely before the current 
language’s expiration date of December 31, 2020; and 
 
Despite significant delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential that there 
is no gap between the expiration of the current regulations and the commencing of the 
new ones; and 
 
Cambridge’s tree canopy has declined by nearly 20% over the course of the last 
decade, with the most severe impacts felt in the most vulnerable neighborhoods; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the following amendments to the Tree Protection Ordinance be adopted to extend 
the temporary prohibition on tree cutting permits until February 28, 2021. 
 

Packet Pg. 79

 

8.66.055 - Procedure for Other Significant Tree Removals. 

 

2.7

For any significant tree removal not subject to Section 8.66.050, a permit will be 
required from the City Arborist. In all cases, the City Arborist shall keep a record of 
the type and size of tree removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the tree 
documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractor(s) involved, and the name 
and address of the property owner. No such permits will be issued until February 28, 
2021 December 31, 2020 or sooner by further amendment to this section, except for 
emergency circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects undertaken 
pursuant to State or Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, or where a 
tree poses significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or for dead or 
dangerous trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the removal of 
certain significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree canopy. Any 
tree removed in violation of this section, prior to February 28, 2021 December 31, 
2020, shall require a payment into the tree replacement fund as per Section 8.66.070 
according to a schedule as follows: Ten percent (10%) of the replacement value for 
property owners who qualify for the City of Cambridge residential real property tax 
exemption, no fee for property owners that receive established forms of financial 
assistance, and the full replacement cost in all other circumstances. The value to be 
paid into the tree replacement fund shall be equivalent to the cost of purchasing, 
planting, watering and maintaining said Replacement Trees for a period of not less 
than five years. 

ORDERED 

That the city manager communicate this extension to the residents and property owners 
of the City of Cambridge as done previously.

Re: Policy Order on Charter Right No. 2

Going through my numerous Conservation emails while I have a few spare minutes (still in CA with my daughter and 
grandson). This letter you wrote is so good--just to the point--Lets just hope these Councillors won't be bullied and find 
enough of their integrity to follow the law.

Dear Councilors, City Manager,City Clerk, and CHC Executive Director:

I realize that many of you are now supporting inclusion of renters in all matters concerning the proposed 
Conservation District. Please note, no one was opposed to renters receiving notice. However, it was solely 
renters who disrupted the planned meetings and arrived with an agenda to do just that. I also note, the enabling 
statute for creation of the conservation district mandates notice to owners solely. This has a very solid and long 
legal historry based on property law that spans two hundred years. It is based on the 5th Amendment; the 10th 
Amendment; the 14th Amendment and US Supreme Court construing the property rights. It has everything to 
do with ownership. You may not like it but it is the law. Renters have no involved property rights. Solely the 
owners have to abide by the conservation district regulations. Also, as explained in the case law, renters can 
just walk away if they do not like the outcome. Not so with owners.  

I do not have time for a long exposition but trust me, I am a lawyer of 30 years who attended Yale Law School 
and clerked on the US Ct. of Appeals. All the proponents ever did was follow the law. In fact, they were more 
considerate than mandated. They hand delivered notices throughout the designated area on their own time and 
at their own expense.  

This needs to be evaluated at least by City Solicitor. This is so unfair to the proponents of the Conservation 
District and the Cambridge HIstoric Commission.  

Respectfully,
Maire Elena Saccoccio, Esquire

Dear Councilors,

The Alliance wants to state its support for the recommendation for the Broadband RFP which 
were made by Upgrade Cambridge, see below.

The Cambridge Residents Alliance is dismayed to hear that the city still has not produced 
a municipal broadband RFP, after many efforts by the Council over these past months.  I agree 
with the Committee Chair, Patty Nolan, that the Council should draft an RFP based on the 2017 
draft RFP.

We also want to reiterate the urgency of addressing the digital divide, which requires separate

Among the recommendations from Healey’s office were calls to improve how the state and its

more than 350 municipalities report on patient race, ethnicity and other demographic 
characteristics to identify disparities, reduce patient cost-sharing so underserved patients can get 
the services they need and address the divide in digital access among patients by increasing the 
availability of free and low-cost internet."

Re: Policy Order on Charter Right No. 2

I think the issue is being considered at least. I say that because no meetings scheduled since then. It is a heavy lift for 
Glowa to rule against us.

This city has gone nuts though. No skin off their back to be sued. The city gets to pay outside council out of our taxes. No 
official is ever liable.

Dear Councilors, City Manager,City Clerk, and CHC Executive Director:

I realize that many of you are now supporting inclusion of renters in all matters concerning the 
proposed Conservation District. Please note, no one was opposed to renters receiving 
notice. However, it was solely renters who disrupted the planned meetings and arrived with an 
agenda to do just that. I also note, the enabling statute for creation of the conservation district 
mandates notice to owners solely. This has a very solid and long legal historry based on property 
law that spans two hundred years. It is based on the 5th Amendment; the 10th Amendment; the 
14th Amendment and US Supreme Court construing the property rights. It has everything to do 
with ownership. You may not like it but it is the law. Renters have no involved property 
rights. Solely the owners have to abide by the conservation district regulations. Also, as 
explained in the case law, renters can just walk away if they do not like the outcome. Not so 
with owners.  

I do not have time for a long exposition but trust me, I am a lawyer of 30 years who attended 
Yale Law School and clerked on the US Ct. of Appeals. All the proponents ever did was follow 
the law. In fact, they were more considerate than mandated. They hand delivered notices 
throughout the designated area on their own time and at their own expense.  

This needs to be evaluated at least by City Solicitor. This is so unfair to the proponents of the 
Conservation District and the Cambridge HIstoric Commission.

City Council; City Manager; City Clerk
FW: Potential Closure

Dear City Manager, Mayor Siddiqui, and Honorable City Council:

I write to you in order to express my grave concern to a late policy order brought by Mayor Siddiqui, Councilor 

Allana Mallon, and further amended by Councilor Quinton Zondervan attempting to immediately shutter all indoor 
business activities in Cambridge.
I am in opposition to closing any business but particularly restaurants and hospitality for the following reasons.

1. The transmission studies for indoor activities do not take into consideration masking, social distancing, 
UV light and copper lined HEPA air filtration systems, plexiglass, deep cleaning protocols, and other 
measures currently employed at my place of work but also in many other businesses. 

2. Restaurants provide the only real social gathering spots in the city. 
3. With no Federal Stimulus currently on the table or in the foreseeable future many businesses will not 

4.

survive this next closure. Additionally the Council has not defined the length of the closure. Despite this 
course of action, we still receive tax bills, licensing fees, with next to zero financial support. 
Lastly Cambridge’s infection rate is currently .32% our cases have risen from 4-5 in the Summer to 44, 
48, &23 over the past couple of days. We should be the envy of the nation with metrics like this and in 
fact if the Country had the same metrics the entire US would be fully open for business. 

The immediate road ahead in the restaurant and hospitality business is, at best, next to impossible. It will become even 
more so if we collectively place the risk and burden onto this one group of people the Council feel is expendable. 
Hospitality is the lifeblood of this City. 
I ask the Council, our City Manager and Governor Baker to allow us to stay open responsibly in order to meet the needs 
of the community and all of our stakeholders – including all of our employees and suppliers.
Thank you.

Sincerely,

Norman W. MacLeod
President

Re: Please take action immediately to prioritize schools
Petition to Prioritize Schools - Select Comments.pdf

Dear Mayor, City Manager, Health Commissioner, and City Council Members:

I am writing to update you about the letter below, which I posted yesterday on change .org, 
here: http://chng.it/cCgpk6Bq

As of this writing, the letter has 239 co-signers. The number of people signing continues to grow.

As you consider our plea, please keep in mind the importance of creating financial relief for the 
businesses and workers who would be impacted by any kind of closure.

We are aware at this point that schools are likely to close. We ask that you prioritize schools when planning re-
opening, so that schools are first to open, last to close.

As one co-signer notes: ""Education is a greater priority than in-restaurant dining."

Also, please communicate early, often, and with transparency about how community spread is 
occurring in our community and the methods used to track spread: Ensure that your decisions and 
actions are informed by evidence.

As one co-signer notes: I'm signing because in-person learning has been a lifeline for my two daughters, 
and having to return to remote learning full-time would have significant negative impact on their health 
and well-being. Activities such as indoor dining increases the risk of COVID spread, as demonstrated by 
the recent COVID cluster at BWH, which was due in large part to indoor staff dining."

Choosing to not act is itself both a choice and an act--with very real consequences that affect lives.

As one co-signer notes: "I’m an essential worker and my children need in person school to continue. If 
schools close, I will consider leaving my work to care/supervise them. This can be prevented if 
nonessential businesses are closed to curb rising covid19 rates."

We urge you to act soon and to prioritize schools in your decision-making.

Sincerely,

Ashley Williams

November 18, 2020

Dear Mayor, City Manager, and City Council Member for Area Nine:

I am sharing with you a letter (below) that I posted today on change.org, here: http://chng.it/cCgpk6Bq. As of 
this writing, this letter is actively accruing signatures in an ongoing manner.

Please accept my gratitude for your service to our community during this difficult time. I am writing to plead 
that you prioritize the preservation and/or expansion of in-person learning by partially closing (and 
offering relief to) non-essential businesses known to contribute to the spread of COVID, in order to stave off 
a rise in cases that would result in school closures, which is fast approaching and will not cease unless action 
is taken now.

I listened with great interest to the November 16 meeting, and am writing now to implore you to take 
immediate action – as had been proposed at that meeting – to “close indoor dining, gyms, casinos and other 
non-essential indoor activities as soon as possible . . . and organize a small business and restaurant relief 
program that will assist during this second shutdown.” Please also see the Mayor's Policy Order.

Delaying action with another meeting is not the way to respond in a pandemic. You are not kicking the can 
down the road on a street lighting project, or a neighborhood renaming, or a new bike lane.

Allow me to remind you what hangs in the balance:

The city's children. Well over a thousand kids throughout Cambridge came back to life, like plants watered 
after a long dry spell, when they returned to in-person instruction last month; many more kids are still waiting 
for their turn. Please understand that relegating our kids to indefinite “remote learning”--notwithstanding the 
notable, worthy, and commendable efforts of our educators--undermines our children's ability to grow, 
flourish, and sustain their emotional, mental, and physical health.  

It is critical to take action now to address the outbreak in order to keep schools open. In-
Our economy.
person instruction has direct effects on our economy. For example, in order to actively participate in our 
economy, working parents rely on children remaining in school. Moving all students to remote learning 
adversely affects our economy.

Social Inequity. Students currently attending in-person are doing so thanks to the efforts of many people. 
Many of these students depend on in-person school for more than academics. In-person public education 
offers mental health benefits, social benefits, social-emotional learning and more. These students depend on 
in-person schooling for structure, safety, services, social support, and so much more. By not prioritizing 
school over recreational activities such as indoor dining, you deepen social inequality.

Human lives. You are endangering the health of essential (and non-essential) workers who are reporting to 
work because they have to, and who are exposing themselves and their families to infection. And by enabling 
the spread of this disease through your failure to act, you are imperiling those of us who are most vulnerable 
to the vicious assault of this virus.

Our future. Without our health and our children, it is hard to imagine a future at all, let alone one which we 
would aspire to experience. We understand and acknowledge that there are no easy answers here. The 
absence of a federal (or state) response, inclusive of relief for hospitality, retail, and other businesses that rely 
on in-person interaction with customers to exist, let alone thrive, makes the decision to place Cambridge in a

modified lockdown heart-wrenching. But that is why we implore you to BOTH partially shut down these 
businesses for now, AND establish an emergency relief fund to sustain as many of them – and their 
employees – as long as possible through this pandemic winter that confronts us all. Please call upon us to 
assist, especially with the latter effort. Can we raise funds? Can we come up with creative outdoor 
marketplaces? Can we donate resources to assist the people and businesses most in need of support? Are 
there community projects that can be deferred in the interest of dedicating resources to getting all of us 
through this difficult season? Regarding shutting down business, you can take action that is less drastic and 
more feasible. You are empowered to partially shut down the types of businesses where we and science and 
health experts all know transmission is most likely to occur: Limit restaurants and bars to take-out and delivery 
only. Keep businesses where people keep their masks on, like stores and hair salons, open, with reduced 
occupancy limits.  

3.6.a

The longer you wait to take these needed actions, the more lives you imperil; the more light will fade from our 
children’s eyes; the darker the winter will loom.

For these reasons, I ask you to take action immediately--before the next scheduled meeting--to prioritize the 
preservation and/or expansion of in-person public education in all of the decisions you make on behalf of our 
city.

I will update you as signatures accrue. http://chng.it/cCgpk6Bq

Thank you for your service and attention.

"I’m an essential worker and my children need in person school

to continue. If schools close, I will consider leaving my work

to care/supervise them. This can be prevented if nonessential

businesses are closed to curb rising covid19 rates."

"I'm signing because in-person learning has been a lifeline for

my two daughters, and having to return to remote learning

full-time would have signiﬁcant negative impact on their health

and well-being. Activities such as indoor dining increases the risk

of COVID spread, as demonstrated by the recent COVID cluster at
BWH, which was due in large part to indoor staff dining."

We miss the Sullivan Chamber tables

Remote access has in some ways made it easier for more people to take part in City Council meetings, but it has made 
some things harder. Transparency in governance is something we should strive for, and meeting the bare requirements 
of the public meeting law should not satisfy us. Back when we still met in person, the City Clerk's office did an excellent 
job getting copies of late resolutions, late policy orders, proposed amendments and other materials that didn't make it 
into the agenda to the public by putting copies on the tables outside and inside the Sullivan Chamber, depending on 
whether they were available before or after the start of the meeting.

As our isolation drags on, Councillors and the Clerk circulate these items among themselves, and the public is left in the 
cold. The late policy order from the last meeting is the most recent, and possibly the most consequential, example of 
items put before the Council for a vote that not a single member of the public has seen. We're lucky if you remember to 
read parts of it to us. You need to come up with a means of replacing the Sullivan Chamber tables that will work with our 
new system because the current blackout does not serve us well.

City Council
City Clerk; DePasquale, Louie
Re. Members of Adjudicating Boards being allowed to miss a meeting (Charter Righted 
Nov. 16)

Honorably Cambridge City Councillors, 

I write to you about the communication transmitted from Mr. DePasquali requesting an allowance of members of 
adjudicatory board and commissions to vote on a matter before the body of which they have missed one of the sessions. 
This was granted a Charter Right by Quinton Zondervan. I spoke with several adjudicating body members in the interim. 
Here is what I learned. 

• Most meetings of the Planning Board, CHC and BZA are decided the same night due in part to the extensive staff 

reviews prior to the meeting so this rarely is a factor. 

• On the quorum issue raised at last week’s meeting – the adjudicating body  would still need 5 votes to decide so 

•

•

this would NOT help alleviate that problem.
According to G.L. Chapter 39, Section 23D “Before any such vote, the member shall certify in writing that he 
has examined all evidence received at the missed session, which evidence shall include an audio or video 
recording of the missed session or a transcript thereof.”
Consistent with and amplifying on this part of the Ma. law AND for greater professionalism and transparency –
for any project presented before an adjudicating board that includes visual materials – these meetings should be 
required to be video-taped or a zoom-recorded so that the members of the adjudicating body can see the 
materials presented. A written transcript is simply not enough.

AND ***For reasons of transparency, equity, and better government, these same tape-recordings or  zoom-recordings 
should be made available to the public on the appropriate Cambridge City website when then are made available to the 
adjudicating body members. 

I am grateful to Councillor Zondervan for providing us another week to examine this issue more closely. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Cordially,
Suzanne Preston Blier

Dear Cambridge City Councilors, 

We write with respect to Policy Order 4. This is our position on the matter: 

1)    We agree that it is incredibly important that neighborhood associations are inclusive and 

representative of their neighborhoods. We believe that the work of building a thriving, bonded, inclusive, 

and diverse community association is both challenging and critical. It’s especially important today, since 

we know that the primary factor in resilience after a disaster is the connectedness of a community. We see 

this in action as we face COVID together; Cambridge’s neighborhoods are providing both emotional 

support as well as tangible support from volunteers while neighbors are homebound. It’s imperative that 

all of our neighbors feel welcome to participate in and benefit from the work of neighborhood 

associations. This is an ongoing goal for the Cambridgeport Neighborhood Association, and there is still 

plenty of work for us to do. We are committed to continuing to improve, and we embrace productive 

conversations that will help us do better.   

2) Please remove the specific references to East Cambridge and past events from the Policy Order. By 

focusing on one event, they distract from the systemic issues that we all must tackle together. 

3)   Members have voiced concern that language in the Policy Order amounts to a form of government 

overreach. Our commitment is to welcome the City as a partner in our diversity, equity, and inclusion 

work while simultaneously retaining our full autonomy as an independent nonprofit organization.  

4) As a small group of volunteers, we know that additional time, money, and/or expertise from the city 

would help us make progress much more efficiently than the progress we can make on our own. We want 

to have a real conversation with the City about how we could work together, and we have a list of ideas 

that we’re eager to share. We would embrace a partnership focused on sharing information, resources, and 

best practices.  

  

Sincerely, 

The Board of the Cambridgeport Neighborhood Association

comment on motion to shut down small businesses: for the official record

I write to register my objection to the motion to shut down all indoor activities in Cambridge. The cost to small 
businesses and their employees would be devastating. The most vulnerable members of our community, those who 
work in restaurants and small businesses, some of whom are now only working part time, some who are 
undocumented, and many who are without health insurance, will find themselves homeless and food insecure. As 
someone who has lived in Cambridge for over 30 years, I have come to appreciate the important role small businesses 
and restaurants have in creating and sustaining the diverse and vibrant culture of Cambridge. Closing them will have 
disastrous consequences for the most vulnerable members of our community, and for the community at large.
We owe these members of our community our solidarity and support, including a moratorium on their rent and other 
critical relief efforts. They need places to live and food to feed their children. 
Please include my statement in the official record.
Patricia Illingworth

My Public Comments for 11/19 Hearing with WMBE's
city_of_boston_rfp.disparitystudy_10-09-17 (2).pdf

Dear Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon and City Councillors

Re: 11/19 Cambridge City Council Committee hearing on opportunities for MWBEs and historically 
disadvantaged businesses

I write to you as a Cambridge business owner of 25 years, member of Cambridge Local First, Harvard Square 
Business, Central Square Business Association and Sustainable Business Network, and the Black Economic 
Development Council (BECMA). I am also the facilitator for the newly formed Cambridge-Somerville Black 
Business Network, a program of Port based nonprofit, Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts.

First, I would like to share that I appreciate Pardis Saffari and the Economic Development Department for their 
unwavering support of small business in Cambridge. Thank you Vice Mayor Mallon and City Councillors for 
addressing this issue. I think this is a good start, but just the beginning. 

I wanted to share that there it was very challenging for our Cambridge MWBE’s, especially the Back owned 
businesses that I work with to sign up for this hearing. The link was advertised to businesses that people can 
sign up starting last Friday. That link was not available until a day before the hearing. Additionally, I do not 
think we had enough time to review the presentation the City prepared as well as enough time to 
inform and gain participation from WMBE business owners. Evidence of that is the fact that I 
personally recruited every single speaker for the public comments portion of the meeting. There was 
not enough time and proper outreach to WMBE’s. I suggest we have another hearing and provide ample time 
for outreach and review as well as fixing the logistical issues and offer the meeting in the evening so it is easy 
for MWBE’s to be heard.

In reviewing the presentation document prepared by the Economic Development Department, it was not clear 
to me how many MWBE’s the city is trading with and how it is being tracked. Also, on page 8 of the City’s 
presentation, the City referenced the Cambridge Minority Business Enterprise Program (CMBE). Is this 
program only for construction projects? It appears that way, so I am wondering about goals for non-
construction business owners.

We need goals and benchmarks for facilitating opportunities for MBE’s and we need it tracked and reported 
regularly. From what I can see, there are no set goals beyond the CMBE for construction. If there are no goals, 
how do we hold the city accountable for supporting MWBE’s? We also need regular reporting out to the 
community of how the city is doing in contracting with MWBE’s.

The initiatives outlined in the City’s presentation are a good start, but they hardly scratch the surface in 
supporting MWBE’s. If we are to tackle addressing the wealth gap in minority communities, we should be 
setting bolder initiatives with measurements and greater accountability.

A note about the 30B restrictions can be addressed with a Disparity Study which will give the City the data and 
the legal justification to set procurement goals for non-construction businesses. Boston is currently in the 
process of completing their study.

It is great to certify MWBE’s, but does the city know how many Cambridge businesses will benefit for the 
State’s certification program? We need to look at the needs of the WMBE ecosystem. From what we have

gleaned from our work with the Cambridge-Somerville Black Business Network, many of them are self-
employed. Do you understand the universe of business owners? Retailers, food makers, gig workers, livery 
transportation companies, seasonal caterers, and self-employed. 

Priority Action List for City of Cambridge, Presented at the MWBE Hearing 11/19 at 2pm

1. We Need Data - We need to know the percentage of contracts the city trades with MWBEs. The State 
of MA and City of Boston collect those numbers. How are we to know the progress of the City unless 
we have a way to measure it? We request that the City conduct a Disparity Study (see attached copy 
of Boston’s RFP for their Disparity Study) to access the following:

3.11.a

a.   the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified Minority and 
Women-owned Business Enterprises (“MWBEs”) and their actual utilization as contractors and 
subcontractors on City contracts;
b.   the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified female and 
minority workers and their actual hours of employment on City construction projects and on 
large City-assisted construction projects;
c.   the procurement of Construction, Professional Services (including Finance, Architecture and 
Engineering), Standard Services, and Goods for the City;
d.   the subcontracting practices of prime contractors/vendors who do business with the City 
and other related agencies;
e.   minority and women-owned business participation in the private sector; and
f.
contracts and female and minority workers on City construction projects and large City-assisted 
construction projects are legally sound, and, if so, what specific remedies may be use.

  whether race-and gender-conscious remedies concerning the use of MWBEs on City 

2. Go beyond the Diversity Directory - The Diversity Directory is good to have, but 
how is the city using it? Are there any goals for trading with MWBE’s?
3. Understand Why Black businesses are Leaving Cambridge - We need to know 
why Black businesses close and move out of Cambridge.
4. Develop Stronger Mandates for Affordable Rentals for Dormant 
Commercial Spaces- We need to deal with the land bankers. Why are commercial 
rents so high in Cambridge when we have so many empty storefronts? If the 
commercial property remains vacant for a certain period of time, how about having 
those landlords offer low or free space to MWBE’s while empty or they pay city taxes for 
the equivalent that could be collected if rented?
5. Update the Zoning Table of Uses - They are antiquated and have not been updated 
for decades. They are impeding the growth of many entrepreneurs, especially retail and 
food makers
6. Increase the Number of Black owned Restaurants, Liquor License holders, and
Retailers in Cambridge - There are less than 5 black owned restaurants out of over 
475( pre-pandemic) restaurants in Cambridge and only 2 black owned full liquor 
licensee holders, and one is owned by a social club
7. Address Lack of Diversity of Businesses in our Squares - High traffic areas are 
untouchable for Black business owners
8. Increase Capacity of Commercial Kitchen Space in Cambridge -
Support permitted Residential Kitchens, offer commercial kitchen space for food 
makers, and seasonal caterers--many of whom are women and minority owned 
businesses or self employed workers. There are very few places local food makers can 
go in Cambridge to start a food business--they have to go to Boston or Somerville for 
this support

9. Provide More Pop-up and Market Spaces - Since commercial rents are 
unaffordable, we need to use city property (or private property) for flea markets, pop up 
spaces for entrepreneurs in high traffic areas--not a side street with no traffic
10. Offer Access to Low Tech Incubator Space - There are spaces and places for 
high tech and biotech. How about supporting low tech?
11. Offer a “Bow Market” Concept in Cambridge - We need small 
business community spaces with shared resources.

2. Proposal Information, Process and Conditions 

1. Introduction 
 

The City of  Boston (the  “City”),  acting through  the Chief of Economic  Development  (the  “Official”), 
requests proposals from qualified contractors to assist the City in designing and conducting a Disparity 
Study  or  Studies.  The  project  will  proceed  in  two  phases.  In  Phase  I,  the  consultant  will  conduct  a 
Utilization  Scan  to  identify  data  sources  relevant  to  the  overall  study.  Based  on  these  findings,  the 
consultant will advise the City on designing a disparity study to address one or more of the following areas 
of focus: 

a) the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified Minority and Women-
owned  Business  Enterprises  (“MWBEs”)  and  their  actual  utilization  as  contractors  and 
subcontractors on City contracts;  

b) the extent to which a disparity exists between the availability of qualified female and minority 
workers and their actual hours of employment on City construction projects and on large City-
assisted construction projects;  

c) the procurement of Construction, Professional Services (including Finance, Architecture and 
Engineering), Standard Services, and Goods for the City;  

d) the subcontracting practices of prime contractors/vendors who do business with the City and 
other related agencies;  

e) minority and women-owned business participation in the private sector; and 

f) whether race-and gender-conscious remedies concerning the use of MWBEs on City contracts 
and female and minority workers on City construction projects and large City-assisted construction 
projects are legally sound, and, if so, what specific remedies may be used.

At the conclusion of Phase I, the City will determine in its sole discretion whether to proceed with Phase 
II. 

If the City decides to proceed within Phase II, a disparity study will be conducted according to the design 
and area of focus chosen by the City upon conclusion of Phase I.  

The City will procure these services pursuant to M.G. L. Chapter 30B, section 6.   

Any supplemental instructions, amendments, or changes to the RFP shall be in the form of written addenda 
to  this  RFP.  If  issued,  such  addenda  shall  be  emailed  to  all  firms  on  record  as  having  downloaded  or 
otherwise received the RFP.  Such addenda, if any, will be sent no later than five (5) days prior to the 
deadline for the submission of proposals. 

Failure of any Offeror to acknowledge receipt of any such addenda shall not relieve such Offeror from 
any obligation under the proposal as submitted. At the time of the opening of proposals, each Offeror 
shall  be  conclusively  presumed  to  have  received  and  understood  all  RFP  documents,  including  all 
addenda, and the failure of any Offeror to examine any form, instrument, or other document which is part 
of the RFP shall in no way relieve such Offeror from any obligation arising under law from the submission 
of a proposal.   

2. Submittal Process for Proposals 

The complete RFP response involves a number of subsections, but the two main sections are a Technical 
Proposal and a Price Proposal.   

In the  Technical  Proposal,  the  Offeror presents  its  experience and approach in  response to  the project 
requirements set out in this RFP.  The Technical Proposal will be in large part based on the response to 
the Scope of Services in Section 4.1 and will include all information requested in the RFP except for prices 
or costs. 

The Price Proposal must be submitted separately from the Technical Proposal pursuant to statute. 
This is critically important. The Evaluator or Evaluation Committee will complete its evaluation of the 
Technical Proposals prior to reviewing the Price Proposals. 
  
Offerors  must  submit  proposals  by  delivery  of  two  (2)  separate  sealed  envelopes,  one  containing  the 
Technical Proposal and the other containing the Price Proposal.  Under no circumstance shall any price 
information be included with a Technical Proposal.  The inclusion of a Price Proposal or other pricing 
information in the same envelope as a Technical Proposal may result in the immediate disqualification of 
the RFP response. 

All proposals must be received no later than 12:00 pm (noon) on Friday, November 3, 2017. NOTE: 
Technical or Price Proposals or any parts thereof received by the Official after the time and date stated 
above will be rejected as non-responsive to the RFP. Delivery of proposals to any office or location other 
than the location specified below will not constitute receipt by the City. It is the sole responsibility of 
Offerors to ensure that Technical and Price Proposals are received at the proper location, prior to the stated 
deadline.  Offerors should plan accordingly for timely delivery. Faxed or emailed proposals will not be 
accepted.

Any subcontractors and outside associates or consultants required by the Offeror in connection with the

Proposal Evaluation and Acceptance  

5. 
 

Proposals remain sealed until such time as designated for opening.  

Technical proposals will be opened in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and date specified. 
A register of proposals, with the name of each Offeror and the number of modifications to the proposal, 
if any, will be available for public inspection following the opening of Technical Proposals. However, the 
contents of the proposals shall remain confidential until the completion of the City’s evaluations, or until 
the time for acceptance specified in the RFP, whichever is earlier. Thereafter, all proposals will be public 
records. Do not submit any confidential information as part of your proposal. 

An  Evaluator  or  Evaluation  Committee  appointed  by  the  Official  shall  be  provided  with  Technical 
Proposals in closed session. The Evaluator or Committee will examine each proposal to determine whether 
it meets all of the proposal submission requirements. A “responsive” proposal is one that contains all of 
the forms and information, and offers all of the equipment, supplies, or services requested in the RFP. A 
“responsible” proposal is one that demonstrates the capability, integrity, and reliability of the Offeror to 
perform under the contract to be awarded. Any proposal which fails to include all of the information 
or documentation specified in the proposal submission requirements is non-responsive and may be 
rejected. 

The Evaluator or Evaluation Committee may contact client references to assess the Offeror’s performance 
and responsibility, and to assess and validate the client’s satisfaction with the Offeror’s services. The City 
reserves the right to contact additional references or otherwise investigate Offeror’s performance in past 
projects to further assess its responsiveness and responsibility.  

Based upon the results of the evaluation, the City may in its discretion, identify individual Offerors to 
participate in onsite presentations and interviews. Such Offerors will be notified in advance in writing of 
the date and time for presentations and interviews, if any.  

The  Evaluator  or  Evaluation  Committee  will  evaluate  the  Offeror’s  responses  as  they  relate  to  the 
requirements  of  the  RFP.   The  Evaluator  or  Committee  will  evaluate  the  proposals  and  make 
recommendations to the Official. 

The  Official  will  open  and  evaluate  the  Price  Proposals  so  as  to  avoid  disclosure  to  the  individuals 
evaluating the technical/non-price proposals until such evaluations are complete.

obligation  to,  any  undisclosed  person,  firm  or  corporation;  that  no  other  undisclosed  person,  firm  or 
corporation has any interest in the contract; that no officer, agent or employee of the City is financially 
interested  in  the  contract;  that  the  Offeror  is  fully  informed  in  regard  to  all  provisions  of  the  contract 
documents, including, without limitation, the specifications and drawings, if any; the time for performance 
and the provisions with respect to liquidated damages, bonds and insurance, if any.  

9. Offeror Qualifications

Each proposal received will be reviewed to determine if the proposal meets submission requirements and 
Minimum Criteria as presented in Appendix C.  If a proposal meets these requirements, then the Evaluator 
or  Evaluation  Committee  will  evaluate  the  technical  proposal,  applying  the  Comparative  Evaluation 
criteria. 

For a proposal to be considered, an Offeror must unconditionally check a “Yes” response to each question 
set forth in the Minimum Criteria. 

3.11.b

2. 

Comparative Evaluation Criteria 

Only  proposals  determined  to  meet  all  Minimum  Evaluation  Criteria  and  to  be  otherwise  legally 
responsive shall be evaluated pursuant to the Comparative Evaluation Criteria set forth in this section.  An 
Evaluator or Evaluation Committee shall prepare written evaluations for each proposal. The Evaluator or 
Evaluation  Committee  shall  assign  a  rating  of  “highly  advantageous”,  “advantageous”,  or  “not 
advantageous” to each criterion.   
  
The City will apply the Comparative Evaluation Criteria to assist in deciding which  proposal to select 
from  among  those  that  meet  the  Minimum  Evaluation  Criteria.   A  Rating  for  each  criterion  will  be 
assigned on the basis of the documentation, and if applicable, the presentation provided by the Offeror. 
The comparative evaluation will assist the City in evaluation of each Offeror’s overall qualifications.  All 
comparative evaluation ratings will be determined by the City’s Evaluator or Evaluation Committee. 

The Evaluator or Evaluation Committee will not see the Price Proposals until after Technical Evaluations 
are complete. 

The evaluation will use a rating scale of “highly advantageous”, “advantageous” and “not advantageous.” 
The City will undertake an evaluation of each Offeror’s technical capabilities.   

In summary, the evaluation criteria are:  

  Completeness, Quality and Clarity of Proposal 
  Project Plan 
  Functional Experience 
  Municipal Experience 
  Timing  
  Staffing  
  References 

Additional detail around each investment area is provided below.

1. Price Proposal Instructions 
 

Each Offeror shall submit a Price Proposal (See Appendix B: Price Proposal).  

The Price Proposal asks for details concerning the components of the pricing that goes into each Offeror’s 
overall proposal. Understanding the level of effort and cost for the deliverables enables the City to better 
understand the structure of the proposed work.  

The Price Proposal requires the use of Appendix B to present a detailed cost breakdown.  

1.  Based upon an informed reading of the RFP and the Offeror’s expertise, we ask that the Offeror 
determine the amount of effort it will take to complete the services and deliverables described in the 
Scope of Services, Section 4.1 and 4.2 and 4.2. Enter the total estimated hours and hourly labor cost 
per position for these services and deliverables in columns A, B and C.  The estimated hours and 
hourly rates are for informational purposes and do not make the project a time and materials project. 
The total shall be the total fixed price. The fixed price includes all travel and incidental expenses—
no travel reimbursement or reimbursement of expenses is available under this RFP.   

 
2. 
The selected Offeror shall be available for additional consulting services directly related to this RFP, at 
the  City’s  sole  discretion,  at  the  hourly  rates  provided  in  response  to  this  RFP,  and  pursuant  to  a  contract 
amendment, additional statement of work, or purchase order, as applicable and as permitted by law.  If there are 
additional  positions  and  hourly  rates  that  are  applicable  to  such  work,  Offeror  may  include  such  additional 
information in the price proposal, columns D and E. 

The total cost that is quoted in this Proposal will be considered a best and final offer.

About ECPT to City Council.docx

Enclosed please find my letter about Policy Order POR 2020 #275.
not like the fact that the ECPT is mentioned
in this order. What happened was between two people on a
public email page. I think most people did not know this happened until 
it was in the papers. That's how I found out
about it. Do not condemn the whole ECPT group for the actions of one 
person who apologize for what he said.

I do

Dear City Council Members 
 
This is I response to your Policy Order POR 2020 #275 
 
I read with great concern the articles about the East Cambridge Planning Team 
in the papers.  It seems that both parties were on a group email.  What was said was 
between these two people.  The City should not be involved in this.   The ECPT should 
not be involved in this.   It is between the two individuals.   They have to settle this 
together. Before the ECPT gets a bad name because two people did not like what one wrote 
about the other has nothing to do with the ECPT.   My question to you is if a Council member 
or a member on the City Payroll makes a comment that someone does not like, is the whole 
city responsible for this person.   Will the city make a formal – city wide – apology to the 
person who was insulted.  I doubt it.  I think it is a disgrace that the City is getting involved 
and putting blame on the whole ECPT. 
 
 
I do not like the way the ECPT is being dragged into this.  I hope this letter will help 
those of you who do not know anything about the ECPT understand something about 
the group as a whole. 
 
I am a second generation member of this organization.   It was originally called 
The East Cambridge Stabilization Group.  My Father was a member of this group 
back in the 60-70’s.  When he passed I went to a few meetings and have been a member 
ever since some time in 1979. 
 
Yes the members do not always agree with one another.  Yes someone might say  something 
that is not appropriate  at the time.   We have always been able to settle our differences among 
our selves without getting the city involved.    We always agreed to disagree. 
 
The group email that has been set-up by the ECPT is supposed to be about helping and 
discussing what is happening in the area.  It is not to attack one another.   I did see a comment 
once that I felt was inappropriate and replied to the person who wrote it.   He apologized and 
that was the end of it.   It did not make the papers or go viral on any web site. 
 
The East Cambridge Planning Team is a group of residence of East Cambridge.  The area  
 is the Railroad tracks to the West, the Charles River to the East, Broadway to the

South and the City line to the North.  Any resident 18 year or older can come done and give 
their option on any topic on the agenda.  It does not matter if you rent or own a house.  No one 
ask if you rent or own where you live. 
 
When you start in a new group, most people feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes I still feel 
uncomfortable at these meeting being one of the oldest member in age and time.  For the most 
part the  members are respectful.  Yes things can get hot and heavy at meeting when people 
do not give others a chance to get heard.  The ECPT is not just for those who have lived 
in the area all their lives or for many years.   It is for all residents who are concerned in 
 issues going on in the area.   Some members left because they felt they were not welcomed. 
I tried to make everyone feel welcomed as most member do. If someone does not agree with 
your options, it does not mean you are not welcome.  I would have been out a long time ago. 
I do not agree with some decisions.   I make my feelings heard.   If the letter from the ECPT 
Is not what I feel about a project, I have the right to write my own letter saying what I feel. 
For the record I do write my letter. 
 
The ECPT has always welcomed people from other parts of the city and from other Cities 
to come down to our meetings. The ECPT has always asked members of The City Council 
 down to our meetings.  Some members have been down to see how we work with the 
Developers and their lawyers.   These members of the City Council that came down to the 
meetings got  the info about a project direct from the members of the ECPT.  Many projects 
have gone on in this part of the City.  Many options are out there.   Did I agree with all of them 
no.  Did I say I did not like them – yes.   Was I not welcomed by the ECPT or the Developers in 
following meetings no.   We welcome all people down to the meetings and listen to all 
comments. 
 
Thank you for reading this 
 
Sincerely

Dear Members of the City Council

Jason Alves <baecamb@gmail.com>
Monday, November 23, 2020 10:44 AM
City Council; City Clerk
Charter Right 3

By now you have heard from more small business owners directly than probably at any point in your terms as 
councillors. No one can express better than they can the damage a closure that lacks State or Federal aid will bring. I 
won’t belabor the point. We cannot shut down on our own. There are many complexities, and our businesses will need a 
bailout no municipality can provide, not even Cambridge.

I do want to take the moment to highlight another troubling aspect of the last week, and something we need your help 
to fix. It’s a situation we find ourselves in too often. Please stop pitting business realities against other community 
interests. This time its businesses vs kids going to school.  The responsibility for creating dialog that puts us in these 
situations lies squarely on the shoulders of this council. This isn’t the only example.

I have the utmost respect for the 9 seats that you occupy and how challenging your roles have become during the 
pandemic. Right now, we need balance. We need thoughtful policy that brings us all along. We need support and 
predictability. Instead this has created chaos and a notion that all we care about is making money. Trust me, money is 
not being made. This is survival. You need to stop making us the enemy. Business owners are community members. The 
chasm you have created between yourself and many of our members since the bike lane conversation is deep, very 
deep. You hit them when they were down and didn’t defend them when they were vilified. You could have, but you 
chose not to. Now when I ask them to reach out to the council, they think it's “completely pointless”. You have lost 
them, and this is the sequel.

Regain their trust. Withdraw this policy order and let the City Manager and our public health department continue to 
drive the policies that have produced successful results for the city. Let’s continue to find ways to work together and 
support programs that lift up the business community, like the homeless meals program, outdoor dining enhancements, 
the reduction of fees, patio heater reimbursements, new grants, low interest loans, bulk purchasing, and multiple 
targeted campaigns. Let’s continue to increase access to testing. The list of accomplishments is greater than in other 
communities. Let’s build on it.

Let’s continue to encourage safe operations of all of our small businesses and if more resources are needed, let’s help 
find them. Business owners are as concerned for the safety of others as you are. They have invested money they don’t 
have in order to adapt to new rules, to make their spaces safer. I speak with them every day. They need to be open, they 
don’t have a choice. There is no state or federal plan to allow a closure. They have bills and debt to pay and need you to 
understand that and not cause strain with other constituencies. They need you to work with the City Manager to help 
get independent business owners to the other side of the pandemic as intact as possible.

As always, I'm available to discuss what I see happening in the business community if you are interested. Thank you.

Policy Order 4

Policy Order 4.

I write to oppose this policy order.

order to participate.

This order creates a bar of acceptability over which neighborhood groups, but no others, must jump in 

It inserts a standard of purity in representation when such standards are hardly reflected in the City’s 

many branches, boards, commissions, agencies, task forces, and more importantly its contracts.

While it lets our checks and balances of governance off the hook for their own due diligence, it seeks to 

imposes an “equitable access” to its residents’ group by requiring their participants to be confined into a box 
that may or may not fit them, 

And let me tell you boxes are always small and leave people disenfranchised.

If we were to operate under the requirement of accurate representation even in volunteer organizations 
I wonder how many churches, charities, minority advocacy groups, or cultural identity organizations would feel 
such a standard can be met in order for them to matter as a community engagement group.

People have the freedom to participate in any group that does not violate laws, even and especially 
when it comes to discrimination. Not all groups have a welcoming environment even when operating under 
such laws, and we can only try to see their actions in context.

I stopped attending Catholic churches, except for those turning into condos, because of their virulent 

campaign against my legal dignity directly conflicted with my own safety, but I would never question their right 
to assemble, pray, and perhaps redeem their own. I would still judge them on the face value of their beliefs in 
relation to mine, hoping that, even if not diverse in their formation, they could be as accepting of the diversity of 
our public experience.

I am indeed baffled that you do not value rights I do the most, our First Amendment rights to freedom of 

speech and freedom to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances. 

In regards to the comment that is the stated excuse for this order, if we need to acknowledge 

homophobia, an actionable act under our constitution, a full and fair review should be offered instead of twitter 
gossip resembling the rambles of other twitter legislators and administrators, bringing such degradation of 
public discourse into this chamber. Who is really being alienated?

Reflect carefully at the standard you want to cast onto other people, as we are all people at the end of 

the day. These purity and perfection tests, I am here to bear witness, I have been failing since birth, and 
proudly will fail over and over in my quest to be a better person.

Good for you all to be able to claim such highly polished ground from whose slope not to slip. 

Withdraw this order. Posturing Tokenism in policing is within the repertoire of fascist strategy.

Good luck and good night!

PO 4

Charles Franklin <cjfman@gmail.com>
Friday, November 20, 2020 4:02 PM
City Council; Clerk
You know what it is

I know I haven't commented in a while, even about things that are important to me, but this has been blowing up my 
inbox and directly addresses organizations in which I'm a part of. So here I am.

I'm on the board in an official capacity of two neighborhood associations and one in an unofficial capacity, and the 
current discourse about neighborhood groups personally offends me.

The Inmans Square Neighborhood Association mainly focuses on disseminating information to neighbors. Although we 
haven't held any meetings since covid started, the board still meets online to address community issues and concerns 
raised by our members and to send out emails. We have no requirements or dues to become a voting member. We 
reach out to as many people as we can, including actively postering in low income buildings. I haven't been on the 
Cambridge Residents Alliance board very long, but I can affirm that we work to support what we believe are progressive 
policies for the benefit of all in our community. The Area 4 Coalision doesn't exist in a formal capacity, but a small team 
of leaders including myself have been working all year to get internet vouchers to in need families.

I don't think the city council should be involving itself in a conflict between two private citizens even though it was on a 
public email list. The council certainly shouldn't be shaming or calling out a single individual. Yes it still counts if you 
don't say the person's name. Everyone knows who it is or can google it. That person resigned in shame from the ECPT, so 
the other members shouldn't be implicated at all. Although the 'Ordered' section of PO-4 is reasonable, some of the 
'where as' and 'resolved' clauses seem to place blame on neighborhood organizations for things they have no control 
over. 'Where as' number seven appears to implicate the ECPT as a whole for the actions of a rogue member and doesn't 
make it clear that the member resigned nor does it say that the other ECPT leaders condemned that person's comments. 
If this were a news article, it would seriously lack journalistic integrity as it doesn't include comments from those named 
nor does it say that you reached out to them. 'Where as' nine suggests that the city does empower biggited groups and 
that the neighborhood associations are among them. No, 'where as' clause 2 and the first half of six don't make the rest 
of it better. I don't object to 'where as 8' or the two 'resolved' clauses, but the only reason why they're there is because 
of 'where as' clause 7.

Please clean this up. Outright removing 'where as' clause 7 would probably be good enough to eliminate most criticisms. 
Take out 'where as' 9 and there'd be no legitimate criticisms left. I really like the 'ordered clause'. It's well thought out
and good. Don't cloud the goal or, to use your words, alienate those who would otherwise support this PO.

On The Table 4
Also yes please. We are so close to a final solution. Don't let the tree cutters have time to do their dirty work.

Charter rights 2 and 3 and all other POs
Yes please

Re Policy Order re Nhood Groups…

Dear City Councilors,

Catherine Zusy <cathzusy@gmail.com>
Sunday, November 22, 2020 10:20 AM
City Council
City Clerk
Please withdraw the policy order re nhood groups…

Please withdraw the policy order re nhood groups. Of course neighborhood groups and everyone else need to be 
inclusive and civil, but do we really need a policy order scolding neighborhood associations, and the East Cambridge 
Planning Team in particular, because one very antagonized board member misspoke? My heart goes out to the East 
Cambridge Planning Team, which is a model for all neighborhood organizations. They have done such outstanding work 
advocating for themselves as they endure an onslaught of never ending development.

Have you visited East Cambridge lately? The neighborhood is full of trucks and noise all week long as building after 
building is erected and all their open spaces are being built upon. The ECPT needs support, not to be reprimanded. And 
so do our neighborhood groups.

Please withdraw your policy order 0-4. It does more harm than good. All of us must strive to do and be better.

City Council; City Manager; Clerk
Opposition to Policy Order No. 4, City Council mtg. 11- 23 -2020

The proposed Policy Order is offensive to all neighborhood groups whose purpose it is to operate independently 
and outside of political control.

Aside from what appears to be a veiled attack on the First Amendment rights of Cambridge neighborhood residents, the 
Order is based on misinformation, in part resulting from an unfortunate interchange between two individuals.

And that is my point: Whatever you have been told or believe to be a monumental incident perpetrated by the East 
Cambridge Planning Team is totally wrong. The Council seems to have misplaced blame for insensitive comments made 
by a single individual to another (for which the former individual apologized) onto a whole neighborhood group. And I 
believe the fact that the ECPT, by going the extra mile and issuing an apology simply because the offending individual 
was a member, further confused your interpretation of where responsibility lies.  

Another point that must be made, particularly about the East Cambridge Planning Team: As far as ECPT members 
being 'representative' of the neighborhood, as long as I can remember, anyone who lives in our neighborhood 
is welcome to join. Any appearance of a lack of diversity might just be the existing characterization of all 
interested residents. I am a second generation member of ECPT. My mother was one of the founding 
members of what was formerly known as the East Cambridge Stabilization Committee back in the early 70's. I 
can tell you that all views and opinions are welcome. Of course there are sometimes disagreements among the 
members, but often airing and discussing opposing points of view help to build a stronger final consensus.

Neighborhood groups need to operate uncensored to secure our neighborhood against large developers who 
seek only profit. Big companies have unlimited funds to promote their wishes, while the residents have only 
their voices. Don't silence them.

Respectfully,

Audrey A Cunningham
49 Gore Street

Support for late policy order #10 related to indoor dining

Hello Mayor Siddiqui, other City Council members, and City Manager DePasquale, I am writing to express my support for 
the late policy order #10 related to closing indoor dining, gyms, and casinos in an effort to slow transmission in our 
community. I am very concerned about the growing number of cases in our community in recent weeks. I 
appreciate everything the city is doing to prevent the spread, most importantly expanding testing and offering testing in 
public schools to teachers and symptomatic learners.

The reason I support this measure is that testing alone seems to be insufficient to stop the spread.I am deeply 
concerned about the suffering and death that could arise if you dont take more aggressive measures to slow the spread 
in our city. I also worry about the 1500 children who will soon be forced to switch back from in-person to online learning 
when schools close. It seems too late to prevent school closure at this point, but I hope that more aggressive mitigation 
measures can bring children back to school quicker/ minimize the length of the closure, as they can return as cases go 
down again. (My child is one of the children who has benefited immensely from in-person learning.)  

I know this is an issue of critical importance to many Cambridge residents. This is a petition that other community 
members and I worked on this summer to encourage the same policy. It received over 600 signatures. 
http://chng.it/9HjrHhzB. This is a petition that another neighbor started recently, again to promote the same policy 
http://chng.it/SgmG7RNZXz. It has received over 200 signatures.

I appreciate the extreme damage this could cause to local businesses if they were to have to temporarily close; and I 
appreciate that you are in an amazingly hard position due to lack of federal and state support. There is no easy solution 
here. But I hope you choose saving lives and preventing suffering and supporting the emotional, social, and educational 
development of our city's youth. I hope for national relief for local businesses in the new year.

Thank you for reading and be well,
Amanda

Dear Cambridge City Council, 

Blier, Suzanne <blier@fas.harvard.edu>
Monday, November 23, 2020 11:59 AM
City Council
City Clerk; Chuck Hinds
Dos and Don'ts before Cambridge City Council today (and so new facts on the Crowe 
affair)

I feel a need to offer a few Dos and Don’ts with respect to today’s City Council agenda since the level of dysfunctionality 
seems to be reaching a high pitch. Increasingly we are seeing decisions that seem to be as much about political 
gamesmanship as about viable policy. A few examples for today’s upcoming meeting make the point clear. 

•

•

•

•

•

Please DO open Memorial Drive to walkers and bicyclists week-ends – the whole way.

o Let everyone enjoy this area. This is NOT about East Cambridge versus West Cambridge or about 

walkers/bicyclists versus vehicles but about Council doing the best for its residents no matter where 
they live or wish to enjoy their weekends. 

Please DO NOT pit restaurants against schools in addressing COVID. 

o We are in a crisis. Act responsibly. Don’t push false equivalencies. 

Please DO make videos (zoom recordings) of governing committee meetings (Planning Board, Cambridge 
Historical Commission, BZA) 

o Make these available to committee members – and the public – especially if you plan to allow 

committee members to miss one meeting that may have critical visual materials.

Please DO NOT get involved in the Arts Council decision-making. 

o Cambridge has Plan E for a reason (separation of powers). 
o Those of us who participated in the Women’s memorial decision spent hours on it. 
o The winner, selected fairly and democratically, was Azra Akšamija, a Sarajevo born artist. If a problem 
exists with the “pool” of initial candidates, the Arts Council can fix it the next time – after consulting 
with some of us who are professionals and have lots of contacts. We and our professional organizations 
do it for free. You do NOT need to pay for a consultant. 

o Backtracking on a democratically selected decision is a VERY bad look, and leaves a bad taste, no matter 

what the political reasons. 

Please DO stop attacking neighborhood groups who are acting within our first amendment rights to meet and 
engage in public issues and are working incredibly hard to help the city.

o Learn the facts: Mr. Crowe, the individual maligned in the ECPT “affair” had posted his photo on Etsy 

(the public sales site) posing in the garments he made for sale; this public photo was then posted on the 
ECPT list serve inappropriately and with an inappropriate comment.

o However, your one-sided Policy Order on this leaves out this fact and that Mr. Crowe frequently attacks 

others who oppose his radical views. 

o Although it was inappropriate to post Crowe’s  publicity photo on the ECPT list serve (or to comment on 
personal matters in that context), Mr. Crowe then went on to publish the same and other similar photos 
of himself (and the attire he sells) on twitter and in the Cambridge Chronicle article, monetizing this 
situation. 

o I don’t care about what anyone does for a living, or what they wear, or whom they love, but to politicize 
this with a Policy Order attacking the neighborhood group in question is deeply disturbing because ECPT 
did EXACTLY the right thing. 

o I know what happened because my discussion of the difference between Conservation Districts and 

Historic Districts immediately preceded the post with the photo of Mr. Crowe. It happened on Sunday,

October 18, 2020 at 8:23 PM on a discussion titled “Historic District vs. Conservation District.” I was 
responding (as an architectural historian and a resident of a Conservation District) to ABC affiliate Justin 
Saif because he was confused by how such districts work and how architectural preservation is done. 

o The very next post after mine was from ABC spokesman Dan Eisner rightly upset with the attack on 

Crowe. 

o The following post was by an ECPT Board member equally concerned. He wrote ”When one starts off 

segregating by race, gender and age, as the neighborhood keeps getting painted as ‘White Old Men,’ it is 
easy to slip down many slopes. Career and Body Shaming have no real place in these conversations, or 
any conversation in a public realm, really. We should all take a look at our tones, we are not just 
neighbors, but people who share in the neighborhood, as such we should respect one another. if what 
we do behind our home facades is not dangerous or illegal, it is immoral to judge publicly.”

o Ilan Levy, V.P. of ECPT next commented: “First apologies for the late reaction, but let us be clear, these 

type of personal attack have no place on this list.
posted.
I, talking for myself, condemn in strongest possible the terms the content that was 
propagated. Whatever our views it’s inadmissible for us to use such tactics, it’s debasing to each of us 
and to our East Cambridge community as a whole.  I, personally, extend my sincere apologies to 
Mr Crowe.  As the Vice President of ECPT, i will also make sure we take the necessary steps to insure this 
will not happen again.”

It was plain wrong for Chris to write what he 

o Shortly after, formal apologies were made by both the individual and by ECPT to Mr. Crowe and the list 
serve itself was changed from a discussion format to announcements only. This is precisely how such 
matters should be handled.

o What happened next is just plain wrong. Two ABC affiliated Councillors appear to have approached the 

Cambridge Chronicle to run an article on the matter (with lengthy quotes from both), along with another 
ABC affiliate, Joe Aiello. Meanwhile a Policy Order was being circulated among Councillors (on this same 
matter) one that would be submitted on Thursday to Council. Three of the four sponsors are ABC-slate 
Councillors. The aim seems to have been to rile up public support against ECPT and neighborhood 
groups more generally even before Council met on this. 

o Aren’t Open Meeting laws supposed to preclude this kind of politicization effort? 
o Note - a similar thing happened a few weeks ago with Robin Crowe’s deeply fallacious op-ed in the 

Cambridge Chronicle on Conservation Districts. This too was published just prior to a Policy Order 
submitted to Council by some of the same ABC Councillors citing the same Crowe source and in support 
of this fallacious report.

o Why are ABC and its Council affiliates attacking ECPT in this way? Why are they attacking now 
and  over this matter as well as the proposed East Cambridge Conservation District? It is hard 
NOT to see this as linked to the huge financial impacts of developers on this part of the city and 
the effective role that ECPT has played in trying to bring a bit of sanity to all the development 
that is happening around them. 

o Further exacerbating this problem, today’s P.O. (#4)  seeks not only to malign ECPT but also to 

go far beyond this in seeking to control ALL of the city’s diverse voluntary neighborhood groups 
by insisting that we send in demographic data which we do not keep (and probably should not 
keep). This same P.O. is insisting that those people who come to our meetings with disruptive 
aims and radicalized views should be allowed to derail the critical work we have before us.

o Let’s try to remember we are a democracy. 
o The leaders of Cambridge’s many neighborhood groups have, this weekend, spent cumulatively 
hundreds of hours writing and rewriting drafts of a shared letter and getting our  Boards or 
decision making bodies to approve it - reediting this in turn sometimes as each group came in. 
You will be receiving this letter from us shortly. That is how democracy works, and several of 
the groups who did not join us in this effort  simply ran out of time to bring together their 
boards to read and comment on the letter in such a rushed manner. We as leaders hold our 
offices as elected officials and this is best practices of how a democracy works.

Dear City Councilors,

Allan Sadun <aesadun@alum.mit.edu>
Monday, November 23, 2020 2:33 PM
City Council; Clerk
Neighborhood associations deserve scrutiny

I can't make tonight's meeting, but I want to express my support for policy order #4.

First off, without getting into the questions of neighborhood association policy: A disgusting incident occurred, in a 
public way, to a prominent voice in the Cambridge community. This is the kind of thing that Council expresses 
resolutions about, and it deserves to be discussed at a committee hearing - even if the outcome of that committee 
hearing is just discussion, that discussion matters. If the Council fails to condemn this kind of behavior, it amounts to the
Council saying "yeah that's just life, we accept homophobia in our public discourse". On this basis alone, PO4 should be 
passed.

Second off, while there's plenty of time to talk details later, the outcome of that committee hearing should be more 
than just discussion. The fact that the ECPT board member felt he could say what he said, frankly, speaks to a mindset of 
entitlement. We have set up a system in this city where certain community members get to act like their opinions 
matter more than other people's, by virtue of their entrenched positions in quasi-public, unaccountable groups like the 
ECPT. They get to be treated as important people, without any obligation to actually earn that importance through 
listening to and facilitating the diverse viewpoints of the neighborhoods they represent. It is no wonder that these 
people react in an ugly way when that entitlement is challenged.

As a leader in a community group myself, I am very aware of the ease and temptation of letting your group simply be a 
mouthpiece for your own opinions, and the challenges in making sure groups help truly make people more engaged and 
empowered. Despite their imperfections, I believe that community groups deserve to be a part of Cambridge politics. 
But I wonder if "CDD officially gives deference to these groups and recommends them on their webpage" is maybe going 
too far.

Thank you,

In favor of P.O. 5.4 re: Neighborhood Associations

I am in favor of voting to approve P.O. 5.4 concerning neighborhood associations. In particular, I fully support 
the ORDERED section, which includes wording that City hosts a meeting to “ensure equitable access to 
neighborhood organization” and “create rules and regulations that ensure greater diversity.” Great idea. To 
help expedite how this would be accomplished, the following is a questionnaire I put together to fill out when 
interviewing neighborhood association candidates as follows:

Y

N

Race
Sex
Religion
Sexual preference
Gender identity 
Home ownership status
Old, white, greedy - or -
Young, hip, underpaid
Want to walk to work
View on renters (good or bad?)
Value of our architectural heritage
Membership in other organizations
National origin
Vote consistently with ABC
Can recognize when you are being conned
Or are you the mark?

Regards.

Some might say that having the City extend its jurisdiction over private citizens and their volunteer 
associations is in clear violation of our 1st Amendment rights. This sounds very implausible. I say, go for it.

Dear Mayor and Councilors,

City Council
Clerk
Residents Alliance letter to Council re PO #4

I am writing for Cambridge Residents Alliance to express our concern regarding PO #4.  The comment of one ECPT board 
member on the ECPT listserve was very offensive and inappropriate.  However, the board member apologized and 
resigned, and the group changed its email practices to allow only posts approved by the leadership, meaning that it is no 
longer a discussion list.  We believe this incident was a very rare instance of seriously inappropriate behavior, and the 
response to it was appropriate.  Therefore we do not think the policy order is needed, and we do not think it should 
pass.

Neighborhood groups work hard as volunteers to engage with developers and city staff to try to improve our city.  The 
policy order brings government into the workings of resident groups.  Neighborhood groups should not have 
government interference or they cease to be relevant.  The Council should not vote to create government mechanisms 
that oversee or interfere in resident groups. 

We all want resident groups to be as diverse and representative as possible, and we think neighborhood groups do work 
toward that goal.

We ask you not to vote in favor of this policy order.

Sincerely,

Lee Farris, President
Cambridge Residents Alliance

Dear Cambridge City Councillors, 
 

We, the governing bodies and leaders of the Cambridge Neighborhood Groups listed below, 
write to voice our shared concerns with Policy Order 4. 

This policy order sadly is taking a one-sided view of one situation in one neighborhood group 
and extrapolating from it. We as neighborhood groups have long underscored the importance of 
having inclusive, representative neighborhood associations. We believe that neighborhood 
associations are a vital part of city life and have a meaningful role as independent organizations 
that build community and advocate for the neighborhoods.  We realize that our neighborhood 
associations themselves do not always reflect the demographics of the communities they serve, 
but as in the past, remain committed to demographic diversity. That said, we hope you 
recognize that diversity and inclusion will not appear only because of changes to rules and 
regulations, as suggested in this order. This is ongoing work for everyone, and we are small 
grassroots organizations run by volunteers. 

The references to any neighborhood group, including ECPT, in the policy order are 
inappropriate; they distract from the larger issues here. ECPT is the oldest neighborhood 
association in the city, and in our observation, it has been fairly and thoughtfully run, including 
during the recent events, which are now being mischaracterized. The ECPT board member who 
made the offending comment has apologized and resigned, the board has apologized, and 
ECPT has taken further action to calm this down, including changing its list serve from a 
discussion group to an announcement only platform. All references to the East Cambridge 
Planning Team and/or this one specific incident should be deleted from the policy order. 

Most leaders of neighborhood groups have no way to provide the City with demographics. Our 
work is often on-line and we may never see some of the individuals. We don't know where they 
live, their ethnicities, or whether they own or rent. We do not think our members would take 
kindly to us asking for those details. 

Our meetings are open to all; in fact, we beg folks to come. We spread information far and wide, 
try to let folks know what is happening and allow them to comment on those happenings. Some 
of us don't even have a formal way to sign a letter saying our membership stands for this or 
that. True, we sometimes take an unscientific poll, and many speak up, but at the end of the day 
any authority our leaders have garnered comes from being seen as honest brokers. We do not 
claim to represent anyone but ourselves, although we do our best to think of the interests of all 
of our neighbors. 

All of our neighborhood groups would love to attract a wider range of membership, more non-
white members, more renters, but we cannot force anyone to be interested in what we do or 
make the time for it. Alas, it is left to those of us who show up to do this largely thankless work 
to improve our neighborhoods, provide a platform for discussion, and help in larger and smaller 
ways to make the city more livable.

We hope that you recognize the hundreds of hours of volunteer time it takes to run 
neighborhood associations, and that the City will recognize our intention to be positive and 
productive partners in the enormous project of community building. We ask that this 
conversation stay focused on the work of building exemplary neighborhood associations. 

While we may ask for the City's help on occasion, it is important that we be independent of the 
City, as we sometimes represent our members against them. We act in the best traditions of our 
First Amendment right to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress of 
grievances. It is problematic that the policy order claims the City has the right to tell us 
specifically how to do so. We want to come to this conversation as independent city bodies, not 
combatants. 

The governing bodies (Boards and/or Executive Committees) of each of our Neighborhood 
Groups each have voted to support this letter. We and other neighborhood groups may also be 
writing to you separate letters of concern. 

 

 

Cordially, 

Association of Cambridge Neighborhoods

comments tonight - 11/23

Since we were cut off at 2min vs 3min. Please find my remarks below. Thanks so much!

Good evening councilors

My name is Luis Mejias of 18 Plymouth Street on the border of Wellington-Harrington and East Cambridge, and I 
would like to express my support again of Policy Order #267 and #270.

I strongly encourage the Council to approve working with DCR to keep Riverbend Park open beyond November 
29th. As I mentioned last week, I wish the policy order went further to encourage expanding Riverbend Park south 
and east of Western Avenue all the way to the Longfellow Bridge and on to the Charles River Dam. I was 
encouraged by the vote on the amendment last week to do so, but was extremely dismayed by the request for quote 
unquote robust process to study it.

We’ve seen this playbook before: something we know would be good urban policy is subject to a robust process that 
is designed to fail change. Look at the shared streets program, which was supposed to be a pilot but which got 
mired in an obscure, dysfunctional process that led to what seems an administrative decision to pull the plug. I 
attended the public meetings about shared streets, and most of the comments expressed by the public appeared 
supportive or had concerns that could be easily addressed without scrapping the program entirely.

Exactly what is the goal of a robust process to implement a weekend closure of Memorial Drive south and east of 
Western Avenue? The purpose is to squash to the idea so that people traveling through Cambridge in private cars 
are given priority over residents who want to walk or ride a bike socially distant from others.

We also heard last week concern about people being outside maskless, particularly young people. Are we really 
going to not provide an amenity to the community by deflecting to a non-issue. Where is evidence of COVID spread 
outdoors? Why the mention of young people? This age-ist attitude is detrimental to our discourse, and I urge the 
council to reject this conjecture .

I mentioned last week that it’s fundamentally unfair that the shared street program was effectively eliminated before 
expansion into east Cambridge, the Port, Wellington Harrington. Why are we being excluded? Why does north and 
west Cambridge get to enjoy Riverbend Park, while my south and east side of the city remains cut off from the 
riverfront by a 4 lane highway? I urge the council to pass the resolution and work with DCR to close Memorial Drive 
on weekends. There’s even enough room to close 1/2 of it and greatly increase the space for pedestrians and 
bicycle riders. COVID presents an opportunity to do this as a pilot, miring it down with process is not smart.

Finally, on policy order 270 - I strongly encourage the city to shut down indoor activities. It’s appalling that 
we’re being told we can’t be with family this week, but you can go sit in a restaurant and share air with 
strangers. I’ve expressed my support for our restaurants and retail in the past with robust outdoor options, but in 
this wave it makes no sense to continue non-essential indoor activities. Every day is a lost day to prevent the 
spread of COVID. Our priority should be our children - schools should be the last to close and first to open. Not 
restaurants and gyms and salons. Why aren’t our children our priority?

Thank you.

Comments on Policy Order #4

Speaking on Policy Order #4

As a long-term resident of Cambridge and a board member of the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood 
Association for over 20 years, I have learned to value the difficult and time-consuming work that this 
and similar neighborhood associations do to benefit the quality of life for residents of this City. 
Cambridge is a truly unique city, that includes significant history, valuable architecture, a diverse and 
wonderfully complex population, and citizens who are willing to spend countless hours and effort to 
have it develop in a manner that will preserve and enhance, for all its residents, those things that 
make it such a wonderful place to live.

This policy order should be relegated to the trash without further ado. What makes the neighborhood 
associations valuable is their independence from the City. Every association is open to ANY resident 
who wishes to join and participate. In Mid-Cambridge we have almost 600 members, most of whom 
do not actively participate on a regular basis, but value the time and effort we few contribute and they 
know they can bring up ANY issues of concern. We have on occasion had heated discussion, but I 
don’t believe ANYBODY has felt attacked or diminished or unwelcome.

One injustice by one member of one association (that, by the way, was dealt with promptly and 
commendably) does not begin to justify the attempt to stifle free speech by any other organization or 
person in this City.

It would be a real loss to this community if we begin to regulate neighborhood participation in any 
form. 

The City Council has many serious issues to resolve and this kind of distraction (among other recent 
ones) is doing a grave disservice to the citizens you represent.

Policy Order #4 Statement

Perez, Lori

From:

Councilmembers,

----

The below text is what I said at Council tonight.

- When participating in a group, using one's personal associations as a reason to attack them is a cruel and 
inappropriate behavior -- but one that is not uncommon in neighborhood mailing lists. I have repeatedly been maligned 
by because of my employer--including by board members of neighborhood groups. 

- I have participated in online community discussions for more than 25 years. I have been involved in communities with 
hundreds, or even thousands of people, and no community compares in the slightest way to the toxicity of groups in 
local politics in Cambridge.

- This is not specific to a single group. Board members of at least 3 different neighborhood associations have 
commented on my personal life in public in ways that have made me feel attacked and unsafe. I have been forced to 
avoid participation in groups, fearing for my personal safety as a result of these attacks.

While Policy Order #4 is *triggered* by one incident, the reality is that this is a widespread and common behavior in 
Cambridge politics.

I have spoken of these fears before: I have sent emails to Councillors written in tears, fearful of the attacks against me 
from board members of multiple neighborhood associations. And while I acknowledge that these realities are not the 
responsibility of the Council or the City Administration, I do believe that when these groups are given an official role in 
city affairs as they haveI will never truly feel enfranchised in being allowed to share my opinions more broadly.

I am scared to participate in city politics because I fear retribution from board members of neighborhood groups, who 
will use my personal life as a weapon against me and my family. I fear this because it has happened.

I will also say that I have seen this can be better. The Cambridgeport mailing list, with newer board members putting 
inclusion as a priority, has become more welcoming and inviting. The board have taken steps to reform and truly taken 
steps to create a welcoming community. I want to strongly support Rebecca Bowie's comments earlier this evening, 
because I think that the work she has helped spearhead can be a model for the city.

Please support Policy Order #4 tonight.

Thanks,
Chris

[Clerk/Council]   Public Testimony on Policy Order 4 - Council Meeting Monday

201123 Policy Order 4 FED   testimony.docx

Attached is a transcript of my comments this evening at the Cambridge City Council Meeting 
regarding Policy Order 4.

I would also like to register my dismay that with the entire body of public commenters and all other 
interested Cambridge residents tuned in to the session via Zoom, that the Council decided to shut us 
all off to go into executive session with no indication how or when we might sign back on to 
observe the actions of the Council following executive session.
If you can send me that 
information I can at least inform some interested parties in time for us to fulfill the Council's 
duty to its public under the Open Meeting Law.

Thank you-

Monday 11/23/20 Cambridge City Council Meeting - Public Comment  

 

 

 

Fritz Donovan – 42 Irving Street, Cambridge 02138 MA 

Madam Chair, Councilors – 

Policy Order 4 should not exist.   By the end of this evening, if there is any common 
sense in Cambridge, Policy Order 4 will not exist. 

It claims to be based on one outrageously offensive comment made by one board 
member of one neighborhood organization which quickly resulted in the board member 
apologizing and resigning from the board, and the board making a formal apology to 
the offended person.  That is how democracy works. 

But as a result of those events, we have before us Policy Order 4 which proposes that 
the City of Cambridge establish rules and regulations governing all Cambridge 
neighborhood organizations’ board membership, codes of conduct, policies and 
practices, and prevention of “elevating certain groups and voices over others.”   That is 
NOT how democracy works. 

We are a nation of laws, the foundation of which is the United States Constitution.  
Cambridge has laws based on that Constitution.  Nowhere in those laws is there a 
provision that the Cambridge City Council can dictate Cambridge neighborhood 
organizations’ board membership, codes of conduct, policies and practices, or 
prevention of “elevating certain groups and voices over others” to any extent other than 
provided in the U.S. Constitution. 

Policy Order 4 is wrapped in the language of civil rights in an effort to cloak its reality 
as an outrageous over-reach power grab.  But that description is an understatement; it 
is an insult to every Cambridge Neighborhood organization, to every resident of 
Cambridge, and to the U.S. Constitution. 

The original offense this Policy Order claims to be based on resulted in the offending 
board member’s resignation, apology and formal apology by the board.   Withdrawal of 
this offending Policy Order will not result in quite such drastic punishment, but a formal 
apology would be a good start.

RESOLVED: 

On November 18, 2020, Cambridge Representative Katherine Clark was elected as the 
next Assistant Speaker of the House; and 
 
Representative Clark will go on to become the first Democratic woman, since House 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, to rise so high in the chamber, an impressive accomplishment 
and a signifying moment in the social progress of our country; and  
 
According to the Boston Globe: “Clark’s knack for building support among House 
Democrats has reportedly earned her the nickname ‘the silent assassin,’ and her win on 
Wednesday could put her on track to rise further in the future”; and 
 
Representative Clark has always been a strong advocate and champion for the residents 
of Cambridge, MA, and continues to represent her district proudly in the House; and be 
it 
 
That this City Council go on record extending its congratulations to Representative 
Katherine Clark on her new position as Assistant Speaker of the House; and be it 
further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of 
this resolution to the Representative Katherine Clark on behalf of the entire City

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The City of Cambridge is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion in all of its 
departments, and addressing issues through an equity lens; and 
 
Racial bias and structural racism within the Arts have created a long, devastating 
history of wrongfully blocking artists of color from accessing funding opportunities 
within their communities; and 
 
As the City continues to support and fund the Arts in a meaningful way, we must 
deeply study where racial bias and institutional racism permeates our practices, and 
evaluate how those biases and structures determine funding outcomes; and 
 
Other municipalities, including Boston, Indianapolis, Sacramento, and Ontario, have 
performed or will perform Equity Audits of their Arts Council policies and procedures 
to determine where structural racism exists, and pathways to rectify the historical and 
current exclusion of artists of color by creating stronger, more inclusive access to 
engagement and funding opportunities; and 
 
Hiring a consultant to conduct an equity audit is one of the final recommendations 
from the Mayor’s Arts Task Force, which states: “Intentionally examining our 
practices and laying the right groundwork will benefit the whole City, by adding 
vibrant, diverse art to our public art collection, and by increasing well-funded arts 
opportunities for a more representative artist community”; and  
 
As the recent selection process for the 19th Amendment Centennial Public Art project 
was impacted by institutional, racial bias, performing such an equity audit in 
Cambridge would help ensure future selection processes embody Cambridge’s 
commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and that Cambridge is a welcoming 
place for all artists; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to explore the feasibility of hiring a 
consultant to perform an Equity Audit on the Cambridge Arts Council, and to report 
back to the City Council by January 4th, 2021.

WHEREAS: 

Beginning in 2019, the City of Cambridge began internal deliberations on how to 
properly commemorate the August 2020 centennial anniversary of the passage of the 
19th Amendment, which enshrined the right of women to vote in this country’s 
elections; and   
 
Even before the Covid-19 pandemic dictated that the City’s efforts would largely focus 
upon the establishment of a public arts display as a centerpiece of this commemoration, 
this was an idea that was rapidly gaining currency by the Fall of 2019; and   
 

 
WHEREAS:  While a process was initiated to find a suitable artist to bring forth ideas on what this 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

public arts display might ultimately look like, it has concurrently been recognized that 
an additional public arts display underscoring the fact that for women of color, the 
rights enshrined in the 19th Amendment, which are rightfully being recognized for their 
centennial anniversary this year, for the most part excluded women of color, who were 
forced to wait an additional 45 years for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to ensure that 
they, too, had a full voice in their democracy; and   
 
In establishing a separate public arts display to draw attention to the fact that women of 
color were largely denied the right to vote until 1965, the City of Cambridge will once 
again show how communities can celebrate our history, in all its complexity, as both a 
way of better understanding our past and of engaging us all to think more critically 
about how we can work to build a better, more inclusive future; now therefore be it   
 
That the City Council formally go on record in asking the City Manager to work with 
the appropriate City Staff in formulating an RFP for a public arts project that will 
acknowledge the unfinished work of the 19th Amendment, the importance of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, and how the two pieces of legislation ultimately 
complemented one another in helping to shape a more perfect union, and that the City 
Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on this matter in 
a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

Over  the  course  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  and  economic  crisis,  the  City  has  taken 
measures  to  assist  local  businesses  in  weathering  the  worst  of  the  storm,  including 
establishing  funds  to  help  businesses  pay  their  staffs,  their  rent,  and  other  critical 
operating expenses as these businesses have been temporarily shuttered or operating at 
reduced capacity; and   
 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:  While  these  measures  have  helped  many  local  businesses,  there  have  been  concerns 
raised  that  these  measures  have  not  been  reaching  and  not  being  applied  to  all 
businesses equally, and that Black and Brown-owned businesses have been particularly 
hit hard by the financial impact of this pandemic; and   
 
The fact that Black and Brown-owned businesses have been among those hardest hit, 
and among those least likely to access financial and other forms of assistance, during 
this crisis has been in keeping with the broader experience these local businesses have 
had as part of the local economy, and the pandemic has laid bare the need for the City 
to conduct a greater level of engagement with representatives of the Black and Brown-
owned business community to ensure that these entities are not only better positioned 
to  survive  the  Covid-19  era,  but  will  be  poised  to  thrive  more  generally  as  the  City 
looks to the future; now therefore be it   
 
That  the  City  Manager  be  and  hereby  is  requested  to  work  with  the  Community 
Development  Department  and  other  pertinent  City  staff  to  establish  a  Black  and 
Brown-Owned  Business  Taskforce,  to  be  focused  upon  strengthening  the  City’s 
outreach efforts, information-sharing, assistance mechanisms, and overall relationship 
with  local  Black  and  Brown-owned  businesses,  and  to  establish  a  rolling  set  of 
recommendations  designed  to  ensure  the  City  spares  no  effort  in  assisting  these 
businesses; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS:  Many of these groups are recognized by the City of Cambridge as the de facto voice of 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has many community and neighborhood organizations 
formed to discuss and advocate for issues that impact their neighborhood and the city 
as a whole; and  
 
These groups provide effective ways for residents to have a voice in the shaping of 
their neighborhood and the larger Cambridge community; and 
 
These groups are often formed and run by volunteers which have various abilities to 
promote, advocate, and forward their positions in aggregate for City planning 
purposes; and 
 
These groups often have membership and boards that struggle to represent the diverse 
demographics of their neighborhood and city at large; and 
 

neighborhoods, and many city boards and agencies seek their input for planning 
purposes, and yet the groups may not fully represent the broad spectrum of the 
neighborhood; and 
 
These groups are important and vital and deserve appreciation for trying to represent 
residents and amplify the voice of regular people all on a volunteer basis, and yet 
at times, these groups can unintentionally alienate certain voices and residents can feel 
uncomfortable taking part in meetings or in online conversations; and  
 
As recently as a few weeks ago, a board member of the East Cambridge 
Planning Team (ECPT) directed homophobic and sexually harassing comments at a 
resident on a public neighborhood email group after that resident wrote an op-ed 
opposed to an ECPT policy position; and 
 
No resident should ever have to expose themselves to bigotry and intimidation based 
on who they are in order to participate in community life; and 
 
The City of Cambridge has a duty not to empower groups or individuals who

RESOLVED: 

 
ORDERED: 

That the Cambridge City Council believes in the dignity of all people and their right to 
respect, and equality of opportunity and participation in civic life free of abuse, and 
values the strength that comes with difference and the positive contribution that 
diversity brings to our city; and be it further  
 
That we condemn homophobic bullying and intimidation anywhere in the city, and we 
encourage all neighborhood groups and organizations to enact policies to prevent and 
sanction such abusive behavior that serves the opposite goal of these groups and 
organizations by alienating; now therefore be it  
 
That the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning Committee of the City Council host a 
meeting to discuss ways to strengthen community bonds and ensure equitable access to 
neighborhood organizations which could include, but not be limited to:  
   

·  How the City of Cambridge can support neighborhood organizations 
and other community groups to create rules and regulations that ensure 
greater diversity and representation on boards and in membership of 
these groups and formal codes of conduct to ensure that these groups 
create safe and supportive environments for all participants   

· Ensure that the City is not systemically elevating certain groups and 
voices over others in what should be equal community discussions and 
governing processes  

· Developing policies and practices to allow members of neighborhood 
organizations to formally file complaints and grievances and seek 
assistance from the City when discriminatory incidents take place.

WHEREAS: 

On July 27th, 2020, the Council unanimously passed a Policy Order asking the Mayor 
to call a Special Meeting for the Collins Center for Public Management to present to 
the Council on the process of charter review; and 
 
That Special Meeting took place on September 23rd, 2020, and after a detailed 
presentation on the charter review, the Council had additional questions for the Collins 
Center staff and wanted more information about the different paths that the City could 
take to review its charter; and 
 
The City of Cambridge, which adopted the Plan E Charter in 1940, has not once held a 
formal review process to consider revisions, making it one of the only municipalities in 
Massachusetts to go 80 years without reviewing its most important legal document; 
and 
 
Chapter 43B, Section 2, in General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
states: “Every city and town shall have the power to adopt or revise its charter or to 
amend its existing charter in accordance with procedures prescribed by [Chapter 
43B]”; and 
 
Somerville recently launched a charter review process, starting with the Council voting 
to appropriate funds to contract a technical expert to guide their work; and 
 
The City Council expressed interest in furthering its understanding of how a process of 
charter revision, review and or change would work, and the Collins Center drafted a 
four-step proposal that would include procuring and presenting Cambridge-specific 
information to the Council to better inform Councilors of the options and strategies 
available; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to appropriate the funds necessary to 
procure the work of the Collins Center as outlined in their submitted proposal.

The Honorable Sumbul Siddiqui  
Mayor 
City of Cambridge

November 5, 2020 
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui: 
 
The  Edward  J.  Collins,  Jr.  Center  for  Public  Management  is  pleased  to  present  this  proposal  to  the 
Cambridge City Council for an assessment of Cambridge’s options for a charter review. 
 
The Center was established in 2008 in the McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies to 
further  the  public  service  mission  of  the  University  of  Massachusetts  Boston.  The  Center  provides 
technical assistance  to municipalities, school  districts,  regional governments, and  state agencies  on all 
aspects of public management.  
 
The Center is a Massachusetts state government entity. Consequently, the laws of the Commonwealth do 
not require the City and the University to engage in a statutory procurement process before executing a 
contract.  
 
Please review the proposal that follows, and let us know if you have any questions. Thank you for your 
consideration. 
 
Sincerely, 

 
 
 

Michael Ward 
Director 
Edward J. Collins, Jr. Center for Public Management

PROPOSAL TO THE CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL 
FOR ASSESSMENT OF CAMBRIDGE’S OPTIONS FOR CHARTER REVIEW  

 
 
1.   Overview 
 
On  September  23,  2020,  at  the  request  of  the  City  Council,  the  Collins  Center  charter  project  team 
presented at  a  special Council meeting  on  charters and charter processes. Cambridge is  one of only a 
dozen or so Massachusetts municipalities to still retain a Plan form of government, and one of only two 
remaining  cities  with  a  Plan  E.  The  City  has  had  this  Plan  E  charter  since  1940,  and,  to  the  Center’s 
knowledge, it has been never been the subject of a formal review. Best practices suggest that a charter 
should be reviewed once every ten years. (Most charters enacted in the last 30 years include a 10-year 
review.) 
 
Following the Center’s presentation, the Council has requested further information about what different 
charters and forms of government could look like in Cambridge and what charter review pathways might 
make the most sense. 
 
 
2. 
 
This proposal includes the following deliverables: 

Proposed Deliverables and Workplan  

1.  A  memo  presenting  major  options  of  form  of  government  available  to  Cambridge  and  the  key 

differences between them; 

2.  A memo summarizing the Cambridge City Council’s feedback regarding the current charter and 

form of government, and providing options for pathways the Council could take; and  

3.  (if requested) A presentation of the memos to the City Council.  

 
In order to complete the noted deliverables, the project team proposes the following workplan: 
 
Step 1: Draft first memo 
 
The  project  team  will  draft  a  memo  to  the  Council  presenting  major  options  of  form  of  government 
available to Cambridge and the key differences between them. 
 
Step 2: Interviews with City Councilors 
 
The project team will interview each City Councilor individually. These interviews will be an opportunity 
for the project team to answer any questions from Councilors about the memo, or charters generally, 
and to obtain the perspectives of Councilors on the potential need for and possible scope of a review of 
Cambridge’s charter. 
 
Step 3: Draft second memo 
 
The  project  team  will  draft  a  memo  that  compiles  the  feedback  received  during  the  interviews  and 
provides recommendations for whether a charter review makes sense for the City at that this particular

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
On  Thursday,  November  12th,  the  School  Committee  was  joined  by  Dr.  Danielle  Allen  (Harvard 
University), Dr. Mauricio Santillana (Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School), and 
Dr. Alisa Khan (Boston Children’s Hospital) for a Special Meeting to engage families and educators 
of color in a conversation about the updated metrics recommended by CPS’s scientific advisors, which 
was tabled by Member Wilson at the November 5th Special Meeting.  
 
After  a  long  discussion  with  community  members  of  color  (including  representatives  from  the 
Educators  of  Color  Coalition  (EOCC),  Cambridge  Families  of  Color  Coalition  (CFCC), 
Cambridge Special Education Parent Advisory Council (SE-PAC), My Brother’s Keeper Cambridge, 
and  Cambridge  NAACP)  the  School  Committee  voted  to  adopt  the  recommendations.  We  are 
continuing  to  plan  for  all  scenarios  and  engaging  with  community  members  to  improve  our 
communication. 
 
We continued this conversation with community stakeholders at a Roundtable Meeting on Wednesday, 
November 18th, with a focus on ways that the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities 
of color may be factored more explicitly into the metrics. I am glad that we are having these discussions, 
in  order  to  take  a  more  holistic  approach  to  community  health,  informed  by  the  many  different 
perspectives of our families and educators. 
 
On  Tuesday,  November  17th,  the  School  Committee  held  a Regular  Meeting,  where  we  received 
a COVID-19 update from the Superintendent (please see highlighted slides below) and had a robust 
conversation  about  School  Committee  Member  Ethics  stemming  from  a  motion  filed  by  the 
Governance Subcommittee (item #20-278 on the agenda), before Member Fantini exercised his charter 
right to table the vote and further discussion.

The CPS COVID-19 Dashboard has been updated to include the number of confirmed positive cases 
as well as the rates of CPS staff participation in the surveillance testing program. And in addition, CPS 
and  CPHD  are  collaborating  to  streamline  the  data  workflow  between  agencies  and  websites—the 
City’s Data Center now includes metrics used by CPS. 
 
In  the  event  that  a  temporary  shift  to  fully  remote  learning  is  required,  as  determined  by  the  CPS 
COVID-19 metrics, families can expect to see: 
 

•  Notification via email, as well as by phone for in-person learners 
•  At least 2 days’ notice before the shift takes place 
•  Remote learning schedules and login information from their school 
•  Phone  calls  from  OSS  case  managers  to  discuss  expectations  and  support  for  students  with 

special needs 

•  A remote meal plan similar to last spring 
•  A school closure of at least 1 week, with in-person education resuming only after two or more 

metrics remain below the thresholds for 7 consecutive days 

 
After  an  amazing  pilot  of  the  Local  Parks  Program  this  fall,  I’m  excited  to  announce  that  this 
winter, my Office and the WorkForce Program are continuing our partnership with Elevate Youth 
to launch a virtual program for 4th, 5th, and 6th grade CPS students to stay connected and engage with 
interactive activities and challenges.  
 

•  Our goal is to promote outdoor education, movement, and wellness in the students we serve, 

while maintaining social connection through weekly check-ins.  

•  The fun, project-based curriculum will begin the week after Thanksgiving and will run until at 

least mid-February. 

•  Weekly themes will include: learning about wildlife in our neighborhoods, cooking and eating 
new and interesting foods, participating in group yoga and exercise classes, learning tips and 
tricks to get outside in the winter months, and much more! 

•  There will also be an opportunity to join free in-person outings during the weekends (e.g. 

hiking, skating, cross-country skiing), state and local health restrictions permitting 

 
We want our students to get active, get some fresh air, and spend time off their screens this winter. 
Please encourage to any interested families you know to fill out an application ASAP. 
 
Our upcoming meetings are as follows: 

•  Thursday, November 19th, 2020 

o  Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee | 7:30 PM 

▪  Discussing  safety  policies  and  the  health  metrics  to  ensure  they  reflect  the 
disproportionate risk of COVID-19 to some communities and as part of the plan 
for more students to return into the classrooms
