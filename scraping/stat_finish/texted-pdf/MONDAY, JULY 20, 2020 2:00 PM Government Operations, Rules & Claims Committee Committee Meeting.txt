  Government Operations rules and clams committee will meet to continue the discussion on the City 

Manager’s contract extension 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons called the meeting to order to continue the discussion on the city 
manager's contract extension, and she opened the floor to public comment. 
 
Samuel Gebru, 812 Memorial Drive, spoke in support of the city manager’s contract renewal. He has 
worked with Mr. DePasquale in various capacities throughout the years and really thoroughly enjoyed the 
experiences with him and his staff. He said that Mr. DePasquale is a strategic steward of our city's 
resources. 
 
Kim Courtney stated that the city of Cambridge is corrupt. She said that this corruption permeates not 
only the city manager's office, but also the city solicitor's office, the license Commission, the zoning 
board, and more. She said that it’s time for the City Council to stop enabling the institutional corruption 
that exists in the government, remove the city manager, and bring democracy back to the city.  
 
Judy Johnson, 55 Antrim Street in Cambridge, stated that the city manager's whole term has been to 
garner more power and control for his position and to diminish the role of the city council. The city 
manager’s personal agenda is not in tune with the stated goals of the city council. He should be replaced 
as soon as possible.  
 
Xavier Dietrich, co-owner of Upper West, stated that it is time to hold Mr. DePasquale accountable for 
his actions and perhaps most importantly for his inactions. He stated that many departments under the 
City Manager’s supervision have improperly revoked permits. He urged the council to end Mr. 
DePasquale’s contract as soon as possible.

Hector Acevedo, 125 Portland Street, stated that he supports extending the contract of the city manager. 
He stated that Mr. DePasquale is very active in the community, working with non-profits and supporting 
community organizations. He stated that no one loves the city more than Mr. DePasquale. 
 
Henry Wortis, 106 Berkshire Street in Cambridge, stated that the City Council should select a manager 
with the best strategy to achieve these goals. He stated that allowing the requested extension is a good 
idea because it will give the council time to formulate a process to select the next City Manager. 
 
Louise Parker, 1 Warwick Park, has many concerns about Mr. DePasquale’s job performance. She said 
she is most concerned with the manager's refusal to conduct a broadband feasibility study, requests for 
inventory of city owned property. The fact that the manager is unaccountable to the public and has 
unilateral power to ignore the will of democratically elected officials is concerning. She supports the 
renewal of the city manager's contract for a single year in order to conduct a thorough, formal, and open 
evaluation of the manager based on city council stated goals. She wants the City Council to conduct a 
national City Manager search.  
 
Christopher Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said that he has been surprised by 
the lack of visibility into the city manager’s responsiveness to city council policy orders, priorities, 
reports and goals. He is concerned by the lack of a formal evaluation of the City Manager’s performance. 
He stated that, nevertheless, changing the city manager during the pandemic is not the best path. 
 
Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk Street, president of the Cambridge Residents Alliance, asked that the council 
extend the manager’s contract for one year only. She asked that the Council decide on a process to 
evaluate the manager and that the council begin that evaluation as soon as possible. She asked that the 
council establish a process and timing for starting a nationwide city manager search and hiring process. 
At public meetings of the Cambridge resonance Alliance, many members of the public expressed 
dissatisfaction with the lack of the evaluation of the manager by the Council and the lack of response to 
certain policy orders. 
 
Theresa Hamacher, 95 Raymond Street, supports extending the city manager’s contract by just one year, 
in order to conduct a search. She encouraged the council to re-examine the duties and responsibilities of 
the City Manager position. 
 
Jennifer Lin, 32 Oakland Street, encouraged the Council to revise how the city considers the city 
manager. She is concerned to find that some policy orders and legal requirements were not being met by 
the current city manager. She supports renewing this contract for a single year in order to conduct a 
thorough public review of the city manager. She said we may also want to reconsider whether or not such 
an important official should remain unelected.  
 
Ilan Levy, 148 Spring Street, spoke in support of changing the city government to remove the unelected 
city manager, and to create an elected leadership position. 
 
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, encouraged the council to select a new city manager. At most, she 
supports extending the current contract for one year.

Robert Winters, 366 Broadway, spoke in support of a multi-year contract extension for Mr. DePasquale. 
Mr. DePasquale has the right qualities of empathy, and a take-charge management style, which is exactly 
what the city needs. 
 
Kit Haines, 6 Florence Street in Cambridge, asked the council not to extend this contract. She stated that 
she is very disappointed by not being allowed to leave the house. Not the City Manager’s job to determine 
if shared streets are safe, but to implement the city council's vote. 
 
Teni Lavoie, 20 Locust Street, spoke in support renewing the existing contract. Always felt the Mr. 
DePasquale listened and never made decisions in a vacuum.

Councillor Simmons asked her colleagues to remember that is critical to move this process forward in 
these tumultuous times. She recognized that some councillors are concerned about the lack of a formal 
performance review, but that should not delay this process. She moved that the committee recommend 
to the full city council a policy order to extend the city manager's contract for a period of 24 
months.  
 
Councillor Simmons explained that this extension will allow the council time to formulate a thoughtful 
and transparent process to search for the next city manager. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern stated that no matter who served as city manager, no one will be entirely 
happy with every decision that person makes. He briefly described the process and effort that went into 
the last City Manager search. He said that s year is not enough time to find a new city manager. 
Councillor McGovern stated that he supported a national search after the proposed extension by 
Councillor Simmons. He supports the two-year extension proposed by Councillor Simmons.

In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Simmons explained that she met with 
the City Manager pursuant to the vote of the committee. She confirmed that the manager is looking for a 
24-month extension, not a full contract. 
 
Councillor Zondervan agreed that it may take more than one year to find a new city manager, but he still 
would prefer a one-year contract renewal. If the council does not find a new manager within that year, 
then it could consider an additional year extension. He moved to amend Councillor Simmons’s motion 
to recommend a 12-month extension from the end of the current contract, with an option to renew 
for an additional 12 months upon mutual agreement. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that in general, this form of government is not working for 
Cambridge, and he believes that the most powerful position in Cambridge government should be an 
elected mayor. He stated that the city manager’s role should be to carry out the will of the city council 
when it comes to policy. There have been a number of occasions where the council has put forth a policy 
order that has either not been implemented or been slow to be implemented. He stated that he could not 
support a contract extension until there has been a performance evaluation of the current city manager.  
 
Councillor Tim Toomey stated that he supported the two-year contract extension for the city manager. He 
stated that the selection of a new city manager is a long and involved process. He stated that the city 
manager has done a good job in responding to the council’s priorities. Councillor Toomey stated that the 
manager has done a good job in responding to COVID-19, and he wanted Mr. DePasquale’s continued 
leadership through this crisis. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan stated that the council should evaluate the performance of the city manager 
prior to an extension. She believes the city council should have a full discussion of the role and the goals 
of the city manager. Councillor Nolan stated that she was concerned that certain policy orders have not 
been responded to by the city manager. She stated that she could support a one-year extension, but not 
more, only because the nation is in the midst of the pandemic. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone spoke in support of completing a review of the city manager’s job 
performance. He stated that he is concerned that certain policy orders have not received a response. He 
was specifically concerned that the council has not received a list of their city-owned property, which the 
council voted to receive. He is concerned about the lack of infrastructure planning. Councillor Carlone 
stated that he is inclined to vote for an extension, but that he also wanted his concerns addressed.  
 
Councillor McGovern stated that the manager deserves better than a year-to-year contract. He stated that 
he was concerned that a year-to-year contract would have a negative impact on the pool of potential 
candidates. He expressed concerns about when a one-year contract would begin and end. Councillor 
McGovern stated that COVID-19 will impact the pool of candidates at least in the short term. He supports 
the two-year extension but could not support a one-year extension based on what he knew of the process. 
 
Mayor Siddiqui stated that she has worked very closely with the City Manager over the course of the 
pandemic. She has seen a lot of good things from him, as well as some areas that need improvement. The

mayor stated that she would be supportive of a 12-month extension, beginning January 2021, and then a 
mutually agreed-upon extension if needed. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan stated that he believed that the extension would begin on January 2021. 
He stated that a one-year extension would give the council 18 months to find a new city manager. He 
encouraged the council to have a comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the city manager. He felt 
that a new city manager is required for a new vision for Cambridge. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that he would support a one-year extension, with the possibility of an 
additional one-year extension.  
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that she supported Councillor Zondervan’s amendment. She stated that a one-
year extension would give the Council 18 months to find a new city manager. She stated that she would 
not support a 24-month extension. 
 
Councillor Toomey moved suspend the rules to 
extend the meeting for 10 minutes 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
  
 
Councillor McGovern suggested a motion to give the chair the authority to have a discussion with the 
City Manager about whether he would prefer a 1-year or a 2-year extension. 
 
Councillor Toomey stated that, pursuant to the contract, if the city intends to continue Mr. DePasquale’s 
employment beyond January 2021, it shall give written notice to Mr. DePasquale on or before September 
14, 2020 and initiate negotiations for a successor employment contract, which shall become effective 
January 9, 2021. 
 
 
Councillor McGovern moved to suspend the 
rules to extend the meeting to 4:30 PM 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan

Councillor Simmons explained that her motion will provide the council more flexibility to enter into a 
contract extension that could be up to two years or less.
