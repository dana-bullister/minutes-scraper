To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting a I am hereby requesting a transfer of $15,000 from the General Fund 
Reserves Other Ordinary Maintenance account to the General Fund Women’s Commission Other 
Ordinary Maintenance account to pay for costs associated with expanded efforts on the Mapping 
Feminist Cambridge: Inman Square and the Mapping Feminist Cambridge: Central Square 
projects.   
 
The Mapping Feminist Cambridge projects, first launched in the summer of 2019, highlight the 
rich feminist history in Cambridge from the 1970s-1990s. 
 
The popular projects will expand to include self-guided historical walking tours of Central 
Square in order to help facilitate foot traffic for small businesses that remain open.   
Collaboration with existing community groups, such as Cambridge Black Trailblazers, and the 
History Project, will also be enhanced in order to include oral history audio and video clips as 
part of the walking tours of both Inman and Central Squares.   There will also be an adapted 
guide aimed at middle and high school age youth and those involved virtually with city-run after 
school programs as well as the expansion of a deck of playing cards highlighting Cambridge 
women who have contributed to our communities.  These projects will be designed to be 
undertaken and enjoyed while social distancing. Downloadable guides of Mapping Feminist 
Cambridge: Inman Square and Mapping Feminist Cambridge: Central Square will both be 
expanded as well.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am pleased to announce the appointment of the Cambridge Advisory Committee on City Art, 
Memorials and Markers. This Committee, as requested in Awaiting Report Item Number 19-
74, will review public monuments, memorials, and markers throughout Cambridge “to determine 
whether any of these commemorate those who were linked to the slave trade or engaged in other 
similarly shameful acts, (and) to determine which individuals - particularly women, people of 
color, and those from other historically marginalized communities - should be newly 
recognized.”  
 
The Council Order recommended that the Committee “review and borrow” from the template 
that New York City <https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/monuments/downloads/pdf/mac-monuments-
report.pdf> recently established for a similar effort to review, assess, and update their own public 
monuments, memorials, and public art.  
 
In summary, we expect the work of the Committee to:  
(1) develop recommendations to the City Manager and City Council on how the City should 
address City-owned monuments and markers,  
(2) develop procedures for review and assessment of those which may be viewed as inconsistent 
with the values of Cambridge, by which we mean a just City that prioritizes anti-racism, equity, 
diversity, and inclusion, and  
(3) make recommendations for how to determine which individuals or events might be newly 
recognized with a monument/public art, memorial or marker. 
 
Cambridge Advisory Committee on City Art, Monuments and Markers:  

•  E. Denise Simmons, City Councillor and Chair of the Civic Unity Committee 
•  Greggy Bazile, Artist/Muralist, Senior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, interested 

in Architecture and Public spaces, Cambridge resident

The work of this Committee will involve developing criteria and frameworks for evaluating

Meetings of the Committee will be open to the Public and held virtually on Zoom. We also 
expect there to be additional public feedback opportunities to better understand, in particular, 
what and whom residents would like to see represented in future memorials and public art.  The 
work will commence in January and is expected to take 6 months.

Re:        City Council Order #4 of November 16, 2020 – Translators on Election Day 

The City Council has requested that City Manager “confer with the Law Department and Election 
Commission on providing interpreters…at future elections and report back on this matter to the City 
Council by January 25, 2021”.  

The Cambridge Election Commission is committed to making sure every legally entitled voter has the 
opportunity to vote. As a City, we strive to make information accessible to all of our voters, including 
voters that may speak or read languages other than English.  

The Election Commission has provided bilingual poll workers at some of the polling locations on Election 
Day who are available to assist voters that may speak or read languages other than English. The Wardens 
and Clerks at other polling locations are instructed to call those individuals if a voter needs assistance. 
The bilingual poll workers are fluent in Spanish, Farsi, Portuguese and Haitian Creole. Bilingual staff at 
the Election Commission also provide Spanish and Haitian Creole interpretation over the phone. 

The City of Cambridge has 11 Wards, 34 Precincts and 30 polling places. Due to the number of precincts 
and/or polling places it could be a challenge to have an interpreter at each precinct or each polling place 
who is fluent in more than one language such as Spanish, Amharic, Bengali, Haitian Creole, Chinese, 
Portuguese, and American Sign Language. Challenges include: 

•  Determining which languages are necessary at each polling location – the Election Commission 

does not have data on which languages are spoken by voters in each precinct; 

•  Recruiting and hiring a sufficient number of people who speak each language to cover all 

necessary locations;

•  Providing additional training for interpreters above and beyond the election worker trainings 

already provided; and 

•  Providing space at each polling location for interpreters, especially if some precincts would 

require multiple interpreters to cover multiple languages. This would be especially challenging if 
social distancing requirements are still in place in future elections.  

In response to the number of polling locations and the variety of languages spoken in Cambridge, the 
Executive Director of the Election Commission is investigating the option of telephone interpreting 
services. The poll workers would call the service and provide the voter with instant access to over-the-
phone interpreters. These services can provide a wide range of languages to the number of polling 
locations designated in the City as needed. We anticipate having a plan for interpreters in place for 
upcoming elections.

WHEREAS: 

Envision Cambridge includes the following goals: 
  

∙        Shared  Community  Prosperity:  Provide  opportunities  for  Cambridge 
residents of all educational backgrounds and skill levels to access jobs 
that pay a living wage in Cambridge and the surrounding region so that 
they can share in the city’s prosperity 

 
∙        Equity  and  Fairness:  Support  efforts  to  erase  racial  and  gender 

disparities in economic opportunity; and 

  
WHEREAS:  On March 26, 2018, the City Council passed a policy order asking that the City 

  

“…compile and publish an inventory of all City-owned vacant buildings and 
lots with the City’s plans for them,” and having not received a response on this, 
the City Council passed a policy order requesting an update on this process on 
November 16, 2020;  
 
Receiving the City’s response on this matter could be of particular benefit to the 
Port neighborhood, where momentum has been growing for establishing a 
museum of Cambridge’s history, and a number of other projects that could 
reinvigorate the area have likewise been percolating; and 
  
In addition to breathing new life into the Port neighborhood by providing a 
neighborhood/community anchor, the activation of properties such as 105 
Windsor Street would present a clear occasion to create economic opportunities 
for Black and brown community members in the Port neighborhood and 
elsewhere; now therefore be it 
  
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to provide a report on the 
condition of the building at 105 Windsor Street and cost estimates of any repairs 
needed; and be it further 
  
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to issue recommendations to 
the City Council on how to develop 105 Windsor Street and any other 
underused properties based on an inclusive public process centered in the Port 
neighborhood.  
 
These recommendations should be focused on creating economic opportunity in 
the neighborhood, and they should be part of a larger, more comprehensive

Awaiting Report 20-12 dated February 10, 2020 regarding feasibility of adding bike 
parking rings to parking meters. 

KHALIL MOGASSABI 
Deputy Director 
Chief Planner 

Date:   December 2, 2020 

 

 
 

 
      
This response addresses the request to examine the feasibility of adding bike parking rings to 
automobile parking meter poles in order to increase the availability of bike parking without 
having to add stand-alone bike parking infrastructure. 
 
The demand for bike parking continues to rise as the city grows and more people are 
choosing to bike. The City of Cambridge allocates funds in its capital budget to install up to 
150 new post and ring bike racks each year, in addition to providing some larger bike shelters 
at public facilities and providing seasonal bike parking corrals in priority locations in place of 
car parking spots. The racks and corrals are placed in places of high demand for bike parking, 
such as in the city’s main squares, along retail corridors and near educational facilities and 
high-density housing districts. Racks are also installed upon request from residents or 
business owners. New development projects are required to provide bike parking on their 
property not only for employees but also short-term visitor parking, which adds significant 
numbers of new bike parking spaces throughout the city each year. In combination, these 
different approaches to increase the availability of bike parking in the city each year are 
intended to address the growing demand. 
 
We recommend not adding bike parking rings to active automobile parking meter poles for 
several reasons. First, meters are placed closer to the curb than the typical standard for bike 
racks. This could mean, if one or more bikes are parked at a rack, that vehicles would end up 
being parked further away from the curb, intruding into bike or travel lanes and reducing 
overall travel safety. In addition, accessing the meters to empty the coin compartment and 
service the meters could become more difficult. A larger bike, a badly parked bike, or a 
tipped over bike would impede the collection of coins or maintenance of the parking 
meter. However, there are some “orphaned” meter poles where curbside parking has been 
removed to install bike lanes for other reasons.  These poles might be good candidates for 
attaching rings as they do not affect how cars would park or coin collection/meter 
servicing.  These empty poles will be examined and bike parking rings, or replacement racks, 
installed where feasible and where demand exists.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am forwarding for your consideration a Home Rule Petition seeking special legislation from the 
Legislature which would authorize the City of Cambridge to provide police, fire and other 
emergency services (“Emergency Services”) to portions of the Cambridge Crossing project that 
are partially located in the cities of Boston and Somerville, with one such property wholly 
located within Somerville. As you know, Cambridge Crossing is a large mixed-use project 
situated on over 45 acres of land located in the cities of Cambridge, Boston and Somerville, and 
containing residential, office, laboratory and retail uses (the “Project”). Portions of the Project 
are not accessible by streets located in either Boston or Somerville and are only accessible by 
emergency responders by streets located in the City of Cambridge.  
 
The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts generally prohibit municipalities from 
providing emergency services to properties located outside of their municipal boundaries.  While 
there are certain exceptions for instances of mutual aid, the municipality in which a specific 
parcel of real estate is located is generally responsible for the provision of police, fire and other 
emergency services to such parcels and the buildings located on the parcels and the occupants of 
those buildings.   
 
In addition, Massachusetts law prevents municipalities from assessing taxes or other municipal 
charges against properties not situated within its municipal boundaries.  Therefore, the special 
legislation that is enclosed here also would authorize the City to impose fees on the owner of any 
parcel located within the Project for the provision of these Emergency Services.

AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO PROVIDE POLICE, FIRE, 
EMERGENCY AND OTHER MUNICIPAL SERVICES TO CERTAIN PROPERTIES IN 
THE CITY OF SOMERVILLE AND THE CITY OF BOSTON. 

Notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, the City of Cambridge is 

 
hereby authorized to provide police, fire and other services and the City of Somerville and the 
City of Boston are authorized to acquiesce in the delegation of such services to the City of 
Cambridge relative to the certain identified portions of the City of Somerville and the City of 
Boston and to take such other actions as are provided for in this Act. 

 

SECTION 1.  FINDINGS AND PURPOSE  

WHEREAS, Cambridge Crossing (also known as North Point) is a mixed-use, smart 

 
growth master plan development containing 20 separate and distinct building parcels and 
comprised of approximately 45.37 acres of land, situated in the Cities of Cambridge, Boston and 
Somerville (the “Development”) or (“Cambridge Crossing”); and 

WHEREAS, the majority of the Development, (approximately 38.77 acres), is situated in 

the City of Cambridge, with the balance of the land located in the City of Boston, (1.29 acres), 
and the City of Somerville, (5.28 acres), with the majority of the buildings constructed or to be 
constructed (with the exception of one building which is wholly situated in the City of 
Somerville) to be located in whole or in part in the City of Cambridge (collectively, the 
“Serviced Parcels”, and each individually, a “Serviced Parcel”); and 

WHEREAS, emergency access to the Serviced Parcels is only feasible by public ways 

situated in the City of Cambridge and the City of Cambridge will be providing the water, sewer 
and other municipal services to the entirety of Cambridge Crossing and neither the City of 
Boston nor the City of Somerville will be providing those municipal services to Cambridge 
Crossing; and 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of a Memorandum of Agreement between the City of 

Cambridge and the current owner of the Cambridge Crossing, the roadway network and 
municipal infrastructure being (or to be) constructed therein by the current owner, will be 
conveyed to the City of Cambridge and become part of the City of Cambridge municipal system; 
and 

WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston each desire to enter into 
agreements with one another to have the City of Cambridge (i) provide police, fire and other 
emergency services, including but not limited to, emergency communication and ambulance 
services (“Emergency Services”), and (ii) offer and provide such other municipal services to the 
Serviced Parcels as may be reasonably required and/or requested from time to time as a result of 
the Serviced Parcels being accessible solely from roadways situated in the City of Cambridge 
and the utilities owned, or to be owned, by the City of Cambridge located therein, including, 
without limitation, the provision of water, storm sewer and sanitary sewer (and the ability to 
charge normal and customary fees associated therewith) and services provided by the fire 
department (such services, “Other Municipal Services”); and

WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston agree that having 

Cambridge provide the above services to the entirety of Cambridge Crossing will enable 
increased efficiency in, and the expeditious delivery of, public safety responses; and 

WHEREAS, the Cities of Cambridge, Somerville and Boston agree that the City of 
Cambridge requires the authority to assess any unpaid fees for Emergency Services to a Serviced 
Parcel. Specifically, the Cities seek authority to allow the City of Cambridge to (a) assess any 
unpaid fees for these services that are attributable to (i) a Serviced Parcel situated partially in the 
City of Cambridge to the real estate tax bills of such Serviced Parcel issued by the City of 
Cambridge and (ii) the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of Somerville against tax 
parcels located in the City of Cambridge containing only the common open space areas of 
Cambridge Crossing, but not any tax parcels containing occupiable buildings (collectively, the 
“CX Open Space Parcels”), and to issue a real estate tax bill to such assessing parcel(s), and (b) 
make such assessments, pursuant to its assessment and collection authority contained in Chapters 
59 and 60 of the Massachusetts General Laws. 

 
THEREFORE, the purposes of this Act are to: 
 
1.  authorize the City of Cambridge (a) to provide Emergency Services within the 
Serviced Parcels as if such parcels were entirely situated within the City of 
Cambridge; (b) to make assessments against any Serviced Parcel to reimburse the 
City of Cambridge for the provision of such services to such Serviced Parcel, against 
only the portion of such Serviced Parcel situated in the City of Cambridge; (c) to 
make assessments against the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of 
Somerville to reimburse the City of Cambridge for the provisions of such services to 
such Serviced Parcel, against one or more of the CX Open Space Parcels; (d) to 
collect and enforce, including, without limitation, the rights to pursue takings for non-
payment of such assessments allocable to (i) a Serviced Parcel, against the owner of 
such Serviced Parcel, or (ii) in the event of the Serviced Parcel situated entirely 
within the City of Somerville, against the owner(s) of the CX Open Space Parcels; 
and (d) to offer and provide the Other Municipal Services as if the same were situated 
entirety within the City of Cambridge; and 

2.  authorize the City of Somerville and the City of Boston to delegate the Emergency 
Services and Other Municipal Services related to the Serviced Parcels to the City of 
Cambridge. 

SECTION 2.  The City of Cambridge is hereby authorized to provide the Emergency 

Services to the Serviced Parcels, specifically including, but not limited to, authorizing 
Cambridge Police Officers with full arrest powers, as if those parcels were wholly located in the 
City of Cambridge. 

SECTION 3.  The City of Cambridge shall have the right to provide such Other 
Municipal Services as are reasonably necessary to be provided to the Serviced Parcels and as are 
otherwise agreed to with any other municipality in which a particular Serviced Parcel may be 
located.

SECTION 4.  The City of Cambridge, the City of Somerville and the City of Boston are 
each hereby authorized to enter into agreements with one another, to the extent such Cities deem 
such agreements to be necessary and/or convenient, concerning Cambridge’s provision of 
Emergency Services and, to the extent applicable, Other Municipal Services to the Serviced 
Parcels, upon such terms and conditions as the Cities may agree.  In the event that the Cities fail 
to or have not entered into an agreement and the provision of Emergency Services or Other 
Municipal Services are required by a Serviced Parcel, the City of Cambridge shall be permitted 
to provide the services in connection with specific Serviced Parcels. 

SECTION 5.  The City of Cambridge shall have the authority to charge fees to the owner 
of a Serviced Parcel relative to the provision of Emergency Services or Other Municipal Services 
provided and allocable to such Serviced Parcel (“Assessments”).  

SECTION 6.  The City of Cambridge shall have the right (a) to assess and collect such 

assessments against each of the Serviced Parcels in such amounts as will be set forth in the 
agreement identified in Section 5 above, in a manner consistent with the manner in which it 
assesses real estate taxes in the City of Cambridge under M.G.L. c. 59, and (b) to enforce the 
collection of such amounts in the same manner in which it is entitled to enforce the collection of 
real estate tax assessments pursuant to M.G.L. c. 59 and c. 60, including, without limitation, the 
rights of the City of Cambridge to pursue takings for any unpaid amounts and foreclose on such 
takings pursuant to the provisions of M.G.L. c. 60, § 53.  The City of Cambridge shall (i) with 
regard to the Serviced Parcels situated partially in the City of Cambridge, make such assessments 
against the City of Cambridge tax parcel(s) containing a portion(s) of such Serviced Parcel; and 
(ii) with regard to the Serviced Parcel situated entirely in the City of Somerville, make 
assessments against one or more of the City of Cambridge tax parcels containing the CX Open 
Space Parcels.  Any and all such assessments have the force and effect of real estate tax 
assessments made under the provisions of M.G.L. c. 59 and c. 60.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it 

Packet Pg. 65

 
ORDERED: 

 
That section 2.119.020(D) of the Ordinances of the City of Cambridge be 

2.5

amended to read as follows: 

D. 

"Domestic partnership" means the entity formed 
by  two  or  more  persons  who  meet  the 
following  criteria  and  jointly  file  a  registration 
statement proclaiming that:  

1.

The owner of land to be affected by this petition hereby petitions the City Council of the City of 
Cambridge to amend the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance and the Cambridge Zoning Map, both as most 
recently amended, as follows: 
Add a new Section 13.200 to Article 13.000 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge as set 
forth in the attached document. 
Amend the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge to add a new PUD-CDK District overlaying that certain 
area (which includes parcels and portions of private ways) labeled as “PUD-CDK” on the attached map 
entitled “PUD-CDK Plan”.

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 
Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use 
district that is comprised of high quality general and technical office and 
laboratory  uses  with  diverse  active  commercial  retail  and  community 
uses; to promote and enhance the existing open space network within and 
surrounding  the  district  through  the  public  open  space  connections 
among  Termeer  Square,  the  plaza  abutting  the  Broad  Canal,  the  Broad 
Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street; and to provide unique community 
benefits through community arts and public gathering spaces. The PUD-
CDK District creates incentives to (A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and 
culture  facility  within  the  district  that  will  further  diversify  the  mix  of 
uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade 
utility and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station 
on Third Street to enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street 
and provide an attractive connector corridor between the district and the 
East  Cambridge  neighborhood.  The  parcel  on  which  the  existing  gas 
regulator/transfer  station  is  located  is  referred  to  herein  as  the  “Gas 
Transfer Station Parcel”. 
PUD-CDK Special Permit 
Eligible  Development  Parcel.  To  further  the  purpose  of  this  Section 
13.200,  an  applicant  may  submit  a  Development  Proposal  and  obtain  a 
special permit from the Planning Board approving a Final Development 
Plan  for  a  Development  Parcel  located  within  the  PUD-CDK  District 
that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK special permit, consists of 
at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the foregoing, the Final 
Development  Plan  for  a  currently  vacant  or  undeveloped  Development 
Parcel  under  this  PUD-CDK  overlay  zoning  shall  include  an  Arts  and 
Culture Center, as further provided in Section 13.204.1(b) below. 
PUD-CDK  Special  Permit  Approval.  The  Planning  Board  may  grant  a 
PUD-CDK  special  permit  approving  a  Final  Development  Plan  for  a 
Development  Parcel  upon  finding  that  the  Final  Development  Plan  is 
consistent  with  the  criteria  set  forth  below,  and  all  other  criteria 
applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought.

above  and  otherwise  in  approximate  proportion  to  the  Permitted  New 
Gross Floor Area of the approved new structure. 

(c) Permitted New Gross Floor Area. Any planned Development 
Parcel  within  the  PUD-CDK  District  that  is  currently  vacant  or 
undeveloped  shall  be  permitted  to  have  a  maximum  of  420,000  square 
feet  of  Gross  Floor  Area  in  the  aggregate,  excluding  any  Gross  Floor 
Area for the Arts and Culture Center as described in Section 13.204.1(b) 
above.  However,  the  Planning  Board,  in  its  review  of  a  special  permit 
application  under  this  Section  13.204.1(c),  may  allow  a  planned 
development  within  the  PUD-CDK  District  to  have  a  maximum  of 
525,000 square feet of new Gross Floor Area, excluding any Gross Floor 
Area for the Arts and Culture Center as described in Section 13.204.1(b) 
above,  if  the  proposed  development  project  will  abut  and/or  have 
frontage along at least 75 linear feet of Third Street. 
Residential  Density:  There  shall  be  no  required  minimum  lot  area  for 
Dwelling Units in the PUD-CDK District. 
Maximum Building Height: The maximum height of any building within 
the PUD- CDK District shall be 250 feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
if (A) the Planning Board allows more than 420,000 square feet of Gross 
Floor  Area  under  Section  13.204.1(c)  above  and  (B)  the  Development 
Parcel will have frontage on Third Street, the portion of the building that 
is within 10 feet of the property line directly abutting Third Street shall 
have a height not to exceed 85 feet. 
Other  Dimensional  Requirements:  There  shall  be  no minimum  lot area, 
no  minimum  lot  width,  no  minimum  frontage,  and  no  minimum  front, 
side  or  rear  yard  requirements  for  the  Development  Parcel  or  any  lot 
within  the  PUD-CDK  District.  There  shall  be  no  minimum  building 
setbacks  or  other  minimum  or  maximum  building  dimensional 
requirements other than as provided by this Section 13.204. 
Open Space: Any Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK District 
shall demonstrate that, following completion of such development, there 
shall  be  not  less  than  twenty  percent  (20%)  open  space  as  defined  in 
Article  2.000  and  Section  5.22  in  the  PUD-CDK  District  except  as 
modified below. 
The Planning Board, through its approval of  a Final Development Plan, 
shall  make  a  finding  that  there  is  no  net-loss  of  open  space  already 
existing within the PUD-CDK District (other than within any previously 
undeveloped or vacant Development Parcel). 
Open space, whether already existing within the PUD-CDK District or to 
be  constructed  by  the  developer  or  its  affiliate,  shall  include,  without 
limitation,  the  following:  parks;  plazas;  lawns;  landscaped  areas 
substantially  open  to  the  sky;  playgrounds;  balconies;  roofs  developed 
for recreational or leisure usage; pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks,

arcades,  loggias,  and  gallerias  as  specified  by  the  Planning  Board;  and 
such  other  areas  or  spaces  determined,  or  approved,  by  the  Planning 
Board to be open space. 
Perimeter  and  Transition:  Any  part  of  the  perimeter  of  a  PUD  which 
fronts on an existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed 
as to complement and harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to 
scale,  density,  setback,  bulk,  height,  landscaping,  and  screening. 
Development  in  the  PUD-CDK  District  should  provide  integrated 
pedestrian  circulation  systems,  particularly  strong  linkages  between  the 
Broad Canal and Kendall Square. 

Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the 
off-street  Parking  and  Loading  Requirements  set  forth  in  Article 6.000, 
except as modified by this Section 13.205. 
Parking: 
Minimum  Parking.  There  shall  be  no  minimum  parking  requirements 
within the PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in 
approving  a  Final  Development  Plan  may  specify  a  minimum  parking 
requirement  based  on  review  and  analysis  of  Transportation  Impact 
Studies  and  other  relevant  information  on  parking  demand  provided  in 
application documents, and with the guidance of City agencies. 
Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a Development Parcel 
within the PUD-CDK District shall be limited by applying the rates set 
forth  below  to  each  use  within  a  Development  Parcel  subject  to  PUD-
CDK and taking the summation of the result for all uses. For any use not 
listed below, the maximum parking ratio set forth in Article 6.000, to the 
extent  provided,  shall  apply.  Exceeding  the  maximum  allowed  parking 
shall  require  a  waiver  of  maximum  parking  required  under  the  general 
provisions of Article 6.000. 
i. 

Maximum  of  0.8  spaces  per  1,000  square  feet  of  Gross  Floor 
Area for office and laboratory uses. 
Maximum  of  0.5  spaces  per  1,000  square  feet  of  Gross  Floor 
Area for retail space. 

ii. 

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall  make  a  finding  that  that  the  Final  Development  Plan  provides 
adequate parking for the proposed uses and that the Final Development 
Plan  does  not  substantially  increase  net-new  off-street  parking  spaces 
within the PUD-CDK District. 
The  parking  requirements  of  this  Section  13.205.2  may  be  satisfied  (a) 
anywhere  in  the  PUD-CDK  District,  or  if  located  outside  of  the  PUD-
CDK District, within 2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in 
part  by  an  easement,  lease  agreement,  occupancy  agreement, license  or 
other  comparable  legal  instrument  between  the  developer  and  the  City, 
other  public  entity  or  private  owner  or  consortium  for  use  of  parking 
spaces in the public or shared parking facilities within said area. 
Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  Article  6.000,  this  Zoning 
Ordinance  shall  not  restrict the  management  and  assignment  of  parking 
spaces  in  a  way  that  will  most  efficiently  utilize  the  existing  and 
proposed parking spaces to serve all approved uses.

Bicycle  Parking:  Bicycle  parking  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with 
Section  6.100  of  this  Zoning  Ordinance,  provided  that,  in  accordance 
with  Section  6.108,  any  of  the  requirements  in  Section  6.100  may  be 
modified  by  the  Planning  Board  through  its  approval  of  a  Final 
Development Plan. 
Special  Requirements,  Standards,  and  Provisions  Applicable  to 
Development  Authorized  by  the  Planning  Board  in  the  PUD-CDK 
District. 
Relationship  to  PUD-3.  The  previously  issued  PUD-3  special  permit(s) 
shall  remain  valid  and  in  full  force  and  effect  for,  and  govern  with 
respect  to,  all  remaining  land  of  the  PUD-3  District  outside  of  a 
Development  Parcel,  including  without  limitation  with  respect  to  a 
rebuilding due to casualty, provided that the terms of such PUD-3 special 
permit(s) shall be applied to such remaining land without regard to any 
rights granted to a Development Parcel pursuant to a PUD-CDK special 
permit. For the avoidance of doubt and subject to this Section 13.206.1, 
the Planning Board shall administer the applicable PUD special permits 
in  accordance  with  the  applicable  PUD  overlay  zoning  provision  that 
govern such special permits (e.g., PUD-3 or PUD-CDK, as the case may 
be). 
Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit to a Development 
Parcel shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-
3 special permit to that Development Parcel, and the PUD-CDK zoning 
shall govern with respect to such additional rights. A PUD-CDK special 
permit  application  may  request  that  the  Planning  Board  simultaneously 
issue  a  minor  amendment  to  any  special  permit  under  PUD-3  covering 
such  Development  Parcel,  including  to  establish  that  the  Development 
Parcel is no longer subject to such special permit, so long as such minor 
amendment  does  not  alter  the  remainder  of  the  development  that  is 
subject to such special permit under PUD-3. 
To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more  special  permit(s),  site  plan  approval(s)  and/or  variance(s)  issued 
prior  to  the  issuance  date  of  a  PUD-CDK  special  permit  granted 
hereunder and the provisions of such existing approval(s) conflict or are 
inconsistent  with  the  PUD-CDK  special  permit,  the  provisions  of  the 
PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 
Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District 
shall comply with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 
22.20 of this Zoning Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain 
documentation showing how the development at an aggregate level will 
comply with the requirements of Section 22.20. The conditions of a PUD 
special  permit  shall  set  forth  procedures  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
Section 22.20. 
The  Sustainability  and  Resiliency  Plan  component  of  a  Development 
Proposal shall describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will 
incorporate  a  comprehensive  design  approach  and  incorporate  the  best 
practices  for  meeting  sustainability  as  outlined  in  the  City’s  Net  Zero 
Action  Plan,  Climate  Change  Preparedness  and  Resilience  Plan,  and 
other sustainability plans and guidelines promulgated by the City at the 

2.6

Packet Pg. 80

time  the  Development  Proposal  is  submitted.  The  conditions  of  a  PUD 
special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be reviewed as 
part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within  an  approved  Final  Development  Plan.  At  a  minimum,  buildings 
shall incorporate best practices in the following areas: 

2.6

to 

the  potential 

the  extent  practicable, 

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve 
reduce 
building  energy  and, 
carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new building within 
the  PUD-CDK  District  will  evaluate 
for 
implementation  of  net  zero  ready  measures  and  on-site  energy 
generation  (which  may  include  rooftop  solar  pv)  within  the 
PUD-CDK  District  in  the  context  of  ownership,  economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  analysis  for  such  new  building  and 
will implement energy efficiency mitigation for such building to 
achieve  the  maximum  energy  reductions  possible  identified  in 
such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial 
building  shall  include  a  study,  prepared  by  the  developer, 
considering the feasibility of connecting the proposed building to 
the existing district steam system, if available. 
(b)  Urban  Site  and  Landscaping;  Water  Management.  The 
developer  of  a  new  building  must  explore  opportunities  for 
potable  water  use  reductions  and  the  ability  to  enhance 
indigenous plantings in and around the development site. 
(c)  Cool  Roofs.  All  new  buildings  approved  in  the  PUD-CDK 
District  must  employ  Functional  Green  Roofs  (as  such  term  is 
defined in Article 22.000 of this Zoning Ordinance), high-albedo 
“white” roofs, or a functionally equivalent roofing system. 
(d)  Monitoring.  All  new  buildings  in  the  PUD-CDK  District 
shall  be  required  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the 
Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance, Chapter 
8.67 of the Municipal Code. 
(e) Healthy Living and Working.  All new buildings in the PUD-
CDK  District  shall  provide  people  with  access  to  daylight  and 
enhance  the  visual  and thermal  comfort  of  people  living  within 
the PUD-CDK District. 
(f) Transportation. A Final Development Plan within the PUD-
CDK District shall encourage multimodal transportation, provide 
facilities  for  cyclists  and  provide  an  infrastructure  to  support 
alternative energy vehicles. 
(g)  Flood  Resiliency.  All  new  buildings  must  incorporate  the 
City  of  Cambridge’s  most  up-to-date  standards  to  address 
projected future flooding impacts. 
(h) Site Cooling Strategies. A Final Development Plan within the 
PUD-CDK  District  shall  incorporate  measures  to  reduce  urban 
heat  island  effects  and  identify  interior  and  exterior  spaces  in 
designated locations to act as cooling areas. 

Letter  of  Commitment.  The  Letter  of  Commitment  date  ____________ 
13.206.3

Re: Re-Submission of Zoning Amendment Petition 

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance 
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey, 
and Zondervan: 

On behalf of BMR-Third LLC, a subsidiary of BioMed Realty, L.P., we are pleased to re-

submit for your review the enclosed rezoning petition for a proposed amendment to the Zoning 
Ordinance and the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, which, upon adoption, would result in 
a new Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) District CDK. As you know, on March 11, 2020 we 
submitted the enclosed rezoning petition to the City Clerk, and the City Council referred the 
rezoning petition to the Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee at the March 16, 2020 
City Council meeting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Planning Board cancelled its 
meetings for the months of April, May and early June, and has since re-commenced remote 
meetings on June 16, 2020. Accordingly, in July we re-submitted the PUD-CDK rezoning 
petition but due to certain scheduling constraints we are re-submitting the enclosed rezoning 
petition. The enclosed rezoning petition is exactly the same as the March and July petitions other 
than any revised dates or references to this re-submission, as the case may be. 

As you know, we have worked closely with the City to see to the stewardship of what is 

now branded as Canal District Kendall (formerly Kendall Square and Cambridge Research Park) 
since completing the acquisition of the former Lyme Properties portfolio in 2007. Specific 
stewardship projects include ongoing improvements to the public realm (including renovation of 
the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the introduction of public art, improvements to the ice

skating rink and boat launch, a commitment to local retail, and the on-going redevelopment and 
dedication of Termeer Square) and the development of 450 Kendall Street. We now come to you 
with what we hope is the final step in finishing what Lyme Properties started in 1999 by 
realizing on the longstanding goal of having a significant arts and culture facility in the 
neighborhood. At the same time, we hope to replace the Eversource gas facility located along 
Third Street to make way for an iconic architectural building that enhances the public realm and 
the connections among surrounding open spaces. As you will see in the enclosed proposed 
Zoning Map amendment, the new overlay district covers the portion of the Canal District 
Kendall that was originally developed as Kendall Square plus the Eversource site (referred to 
here as the gas transfer station site, or “GTS Site,” for ease of reference). 

A. Background. We submit this petition after soliciting extensive public feedback 

through community open houses, surveys, deeply engaging with the arts community, and other 
means to determine what type of arts and culture facility the City wants to see at 585 Third 
Street, the former Constellation Center site (also known as “Parcel C”). As you know, 
Constellation acquired the site in 2002 and spent over 15 years trying to raise the capital for a 
theater complex at the location. In the interim, the rest of the area within the proposed PUD-
CDK has been improved to now include approximately 757,970 square feet of office and 
laboratory space, 75,500 square feet of retail and restaurant uses, and 465 residential units. 
Unfortunately, a standalone theater proved not to be economically viable on Parcel C. We 
acquired Parcel C in 2018, and have subsequently entered into an option agreement with 
Eversource that creates the possibility of combining Parcel C with the abutting GTS Site. The 
finite duration of the option agreement and the unique ability to  relocate the GTS in 
coordination with a development spanning both parcels makes this a one-in-a-generation 
opportunity. We continue to work diligently on establishing a new location for the GTS facility, 
and are nearer than ever to achieving our goal, but have not yet completed that effort. 

We and our affiliates are the owners of abutting first class laboratory facilities that serve 
as key locations for companies like Takeda, Alnylam, and Eli Lilly; the success of development 
on Parcel C was and is highly important to us and our shareholders. As majority owners in the 
association that manages the public realm of the Canal District Kendall, the public realm is also 
essential to us and to our tenants – both biotech and retailers alike. We are convinced that we can 
make a significant impact with an arts and culture facility in a way that fits into the 
neighborhood, is attractive to a diverse set of Cambridge residents and visitors, enhances the 
public realm, is economically viable, and otherwise furthers the development goals of the 
community, while being within the guidelines of our mission as a real estate investment 
company focusing on high quality life sciences space. 

B.  Summary of Petition. Our zoning petition memorializes the previously approved and 

constructed density at each site within the proposed PUD-CDK, and allows for additional 
development on Parcel C and the GTS Site to achieve the project concept described below. The 
proposed amendment permits a mixed use development project that is a new building containing 
an arts, culture, and public space component that complements the existing 465 apartments and 
commercial space, and, as noted above, creates incentives for incorporating the GTS Site by 
allowing for greater bulk and height, and public realm amenities, if the GTS Site is included. The 
height and floor area, under a scenario where the GTS facility is removed from Third Street,

would be 250 feet and up to 550,000 gross square feet, respectively. The proposed amendment 
does not grant further development potential to the existing buildings constructed within PUD-
CDK. 

C. Project Concept. Since acquiring Parcel C, we have worked tirelessly with our 
consultant team to unlock the full potential of the site. The renderings enclosed show the fruits of 
our labor. To accommodate the building and concepts shown, the proposed PUD-CDK allows us 
to combine Parcel C with the GTS Site and construct mixed use laboratory and office above 
approximately 40,000 square feet of arts, culture, and public space, all in a striking 21st-century 
building consistent with existing and other proposed building heights in the vicinity. This 
building will significantly enhance the open spaces surrounding it, and will help strengthen the 
pedestrian corridor that ties together Termeer Square to the north, the Broad Canal and Broad 
Canal Way retail to the south, and the future Volpe Center project to the west (across Third 
Street).  All of this can be done in a manner that meets the sustainability practices of modern 
construction and caters to a community as economically and culturally diverse as Cambridge. 

Compare the renderings of our proposed project to the existing condition, also shown in 

the enclosed renderings. Parcel C is the “missing tooth” in the Canal District Kendall, and the 
location of the GTS Site (the last remnant of an industrial zone on Third Street) exacerbates the 
problem from an urban planning perspective. We believe that the project facilitated by the 
enclosed rezoning is a massive improvement, and a welcome addition, to the Cambridge 
pedestrian environment. 

We note that we have every intention of including the GTS Site in our proposed project. 
Although the ability to move the GTS facilities is not entirely within our control, we have been 
working continuously with Eversource and others to reach agreements that are necessary for the 
exercise of our option to acquire the GTS Site and move its facilities to a non-residential 
location. However, some details remain to be worked out and, out of an abundance of caution, 
we have drafted the petition allowing for the possibility that the project might not include the 
GTS Site by providing for a more limited scope of improvements utilizing only Parcel C to 
advance the vision of a community arts facility on the ground floor of a mixed use building. 
While not our preference because its impact would be less transformative and enriching for the 
neighborhood, we believe it is a viable alternative project. 

D. Benefits. Our preferred proposed project, utilizing the GTS Site, will result in many 

benefits for the East Cambridge community, and the community close to PUD-CKD in 
particular. Those benefits, many of which will be memorialized in a commitment letter to be 
submitted to City Council, have an approximate value of at least Sixty Million Dollars 
($60,000,000), and include the following: 

 A commitment to use reasonable efforts to relocate the existing utility facilities 

from the GTS Site to a non-residential location. 

 An arts and culture component of 30,000 square feet, inclusive of a 250-300 seat 
state-of-the-art theater, if the GTS Site is included (and, in any event, arts and 
culture space of at least 15,000 square feet).
10,000 square feet of indoor all-season public space.

Practical  measures to support  a diverse,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  operatine
model  for the arts and culture component.
No new parking.
Use of best practices  for meeting  sustainability goals in areas  such  as energ).
emissions, water,  materials,  urban site reuse,  and landscaping.
No new  gas connection.

Our proposal  is the end result  of many  community  meetings  and public  presentations

with neighbors,  neighborhood  stakeholders, and with stakeholders  at City Hall, including  three
open  houses, multiple  meetings with an Arts Advisory Committee  comprised  of community  arts
advocates,  a public  survey,  and solicitations for public  comment  on presentation  boards  that we
displayed  at our open houses.  Key takeaways from  the public  process  included a focus on the
need for flexible performing  arts spaces  for small  and larger  productions,  community  arts  spaces
(such  as classrooms for leaming art and exhibit space),  public gathering  spaces  available  across
all four  seasons,  and relocating  the GTS facility away from  Third Street.  Our proposed zoning
overlay  text and map encourages  achievement  of these goals, with the publicly  accessible
facilities  within  and commanding  the lower  levels  of a unique  and beautiful  commercial  building
that will provide over an acre of new  landscaped  area (indoors and outdoors),  subject  to further
detailed  review by the Planning  Board  under the contemplated  special  permit process.

We  are excited to work with you in the formal  review process  for the zoning amendment
and again  upon  submission  of an application for a PUD-CDK  special  permit.  We  are committed
to East  Cambridge  and to doing all that we can to make Canal District Kendall  a shining  example
of the best of mixed-use  transit-oriented  development  for the 21st century.

Very truly  yours,

-THIRD  LLC

13.201

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 

Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use district that is 
comprised of high quality general and technical office and labs with diverse active 
commercial and community uses (including retail and restaurant uses, and arts and 
cultural uses), all of which promote, create corridors among, and enhance the existing 
open space network within and surrounding the district, and provide benefits to the 
surrounding community through community arts and publicly accessible interior 
gathering space. In particular, the district facilitates strengthening the public open 
space connections among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the 
Broad Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street. The PUD-CDK District creates incentives to 
(A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and culture facility that will further diversify the 
mix of uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade utility 
and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station on Third Street to 
enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street and provide an attractive 
connector corridor between the district and the East Cambridge neighborhood. The 
parcel on which the existing gas regulator/transfer station is located is referred to 
herein as the “Gas Transfer Station Parcel”. 

13.202

PUD-CDK Special Permit

13.202.1 Eligible Development Parcel. To further the purpose of this Section 13.200, an 

applicant may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the 
Planning Board approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel 
located within the PUD-CDK District that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK 
special permit, consists of at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the 
foregoing, the Final Development Plan for a currently vacant or undeveloped 
Development Parcel under this PUD-CDK overlay zoning shall include either an Arts 
and Culture Center or Community Arts Facility, as further provided in Section 
13.204.1(b) below. 

13.202.2 PUD-CDK Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-CDK 

special permit approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel upon 
finding that the Final Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, 
and all other criteria applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought. 

13.202.3 PUD-CDK Special Permit Requirements. Within the Development Parcel the 
locations of the open spaces, the quantities of proposed land uses, the building 
envelope, and heights shall be indicated in sufficient detail that the Planning Board 
can reasonably assess the impact of the PUD-CDK special permit and its general 
consistency with the PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 13.202.4 
below. At a minimum, a Development Proposal and subsequent Final Development 
Plan must contain the following components:  

(a) Site Development Plan: describing how the Development Parcel is divided 
into use areas and their development characteristics, including potential uses and 
Gross Floor Area.

(a) If Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires a 
Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, such Community Arts 
Facility or Arts and Culture Center (i) takes into consideration the orientation of the 
uses, location of building entrances, pedestrian connectivity between such uses and 
adjacent open space areas, and the ability of such uses to promote diversity and serve 
all residents of the City of Cambridge; and (ii) creates a facility available for the 
neighborhood that supports or promotes small arts or theater organizations, 
independent artists, art co-working opportunities, or partnerships among the 
foregoing and the local community. Furthermore, the developer of such Community 
Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center shall have demonstrated a commitment to 
establishing an arts and culture operational plan for space within the new building 
that will be made available for teaching, learning, rehearsing, or idea exchange.

Development Parcel does not include the Gas Transfer Station Parcel. 

(f) The developer shall have demonstrated a commitment to seeking solutions to 

relocate applicable above-grade utility infrastructure on the Gas Transfer Station

CDK to a condominium property regime. A violation of one or more conditions of a 
PUD-CDK special permit by one condominium unit owner (or its occupant) shall not 
be deemed to be a violation by another condominium unit owner (or its occupant). 

13.202.6 Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. A violation, with respect to an 

individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any 
provision of this Section 13.200 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any 
other individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel. A 
PUD-CDK special permit may specify that certain modifications to the Final 
Development Plan do not alter the concept of the PUD and such modifications shall 
be considered minor amendments under Section 12.37 of this Zoning Ordinance 
subject only to written approval of the Planning Board if the developer demonstrates 
that such modification(s): (i) constitute a reallocation or reconfiguration of Gross 
Floor Area among uses in the Final Development Plan or otherwise allowed in the 
PUD-CDK District, (ii) do not require a new type of zoning relief (other than the 
categories of relief previously granted for the proposed development project, whether 
by existing PUD special permits or otherwise), and (iii) maintain the same percentage 
of Minimum Open Space as approved by the PUD-CDK special permit. 

13.202.7 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a development proposal for a 

Development Parcel, the developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD 
Pre-Application Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site 
arrangement, building massing, and public space arrangement, as well as general 
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the Planning Board to 
provide the developer informal feedback prior to preparing the Final Development 
Plan materials. As set forth in Section 12.33.2 of this Zoning Ordinance, any 
statement made by the Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application 
Conference shall not be legally binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3 of this 
Zoning Ordinance, the developer shall present graphic and written materials as 
needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development alternatives.

open space in the PUD-CDK District and open space to the west of Third Street. In 
addition to the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its review of a special permit 
application under this Section 13.204.3, may except from the calculation of the height 
of buildings and structures in the PUD-CDK District chimneys, water towers, air 
conditioning equipment, ventilators, and other necessary features appurtenant to 
buildings which are otherwise typically carried above roofs and are not used for 
human occupancy, including mechanical floors within a building where for functional 
or aesthetic reasons such equipment, structures, or features are on above-grade levels 
of the building other than the roof level or above. 

13.204.4 Other Dimensional Requirements: There shall be no minimum lot area, no minimum 
lot width, no minimum frontage, and no minimum front, side or rear yard

demonstrate that, following completion of such development, there shall be not less 
than fifteen percent (15%) open space as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 in 
the PUD-CDK District except as modified below.  

13.204.5.1

13.204.5.2

The Planning Board, in its review of any special permit application for a 
development containing a Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, 
may consider indoor or covered pedestrian ways, decks, arcades, loggias, and 
gallerias appurtenant to the Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center, 
even if located on a different Development Parcel in the PUD-CDK District, to be 
open space provided that the same is publicly accessible during normal business 
hours. The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall make a finding that there is no net-loss of open space already existing within 
the PUD-CDK District (other than within any previously undeveloped or vacant 
Development Parcel). 

Open space, whether already existing within the PUD-CDK District or to be 
constructed by the developer or its affiliate, shall include, without limitation, the 
following: parks; plazas; lawns; landscaped areas substantially open to the sky; 
playgrounds; balconies; roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage; 
pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified 
by the Planning Board; and such other areas or spaces determined, or approved, 
by the Planning Board to be open space.   

13.204.6 Perimeter and Transition: Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an 
existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and 
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, 
height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-CDK District should 
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages 
between the Broad Canal and Kendall Square.

13.205

Parking and Loading Requirements.

13.205.1 Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the off-street 

Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as modified by 
this Section 13.205. 

13.205.2 Parking:  

13.205.2.1 Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements within the 
PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in approving a Final 
Development Plan may specify a minimum parking requirement based on review 
and analysis of Transportation Assessments and other relevant information on 
parking demand provided in application documents, and with the guidance of City 
agencies.  

13.205.2.2

13.205.2.3

13.205.2.4

13.205.2.5

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, shall 
make a finding that that the Final Development Plan provides adequate parking 
for the proposed uses and that the Final Development Plan does not substantially 
increase net-new off-street parking spaces within the PUD-CDK District. 

The parking requirements of this Section 13.205.2 may be satisfied (a) anywhere 
in the PUD-CDK District, or if located outside of the PUD-CDK District, within 
2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in part by an easement, lease 
agreement, occupancy agreement, license or other comparable legal instrument 
between the developer and the City, other public entity or private owner or 
consortium for use of parking spaces in the public or shared parking facilities 
within said area. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 6.000, this Zoning Ordinance 
shall not restrict the management and assignment of parking spaces in a way that 
will most efficiently utilize the existing and proposed parking spaces to serve all 
approved uses. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 19.20, the Planning Board 
may permit the Developer to substitute a Transportation Assessment in form and 
substance acceptable to the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department if the 
Planning Board otherwise determines that the materials submitted with the Final 
Development Plan adequately describe the impacts of traffic and parking on the 
area surrounding the Development Parcel.  

13.205.3 Loading: The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may 
waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities 
within the PUD-CDK District, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across 
various uses within the PUD-CDK District or the adjacent PUD-3 District. 

13.205.4 Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100 
of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the 
requirements in Section 6.100 may be modified by the Planning Board through its 
approval of a Final Development Plan.

13.206

Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to Development 
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK District.

13.206.1 Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s) shall remain 

13.206.2 Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District shall comply 

valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, all development 
projects constructed pursuant thereto and existing prior to the enactment date of this 
Section 13.200 for the PUD-CDK District, including without limitation with respect 
to rebuilding due to casualty. Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit 
shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-3 special permit, 
and the PUD-CDK zoning shall govern with respect to such additional rights, except 
however any rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit shall 
automatically supersede any undeveloped rights for the applicable development 
parcel as provided for under the PUD-3 zoning. Such undeveloped rights, and any 
associated outstanding obligations with respect to such rights, under a previously 
issued PUD-3 special permit shall be deemed automatically extinguished as of the 
date that the subsequent PUD-CDK special permit becomes valid and effective, and 
such automatic extinguishment shall be deemed to be a minor amendment of such 
previously issued special permit under PUD-3 under Section 12.37.2 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to the 
issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted hereunder and the provisions of 
such existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the PUD-CDK special 
permit, the provisions of the PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 

with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain documentation showing how the 
development at an aggregate level will comply with the requirements of Section 
22.20. The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the 
requirements of Section 22.20.  

The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development Proposal shall 
describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will incorporate a 
comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best practices for meeting 
sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero Action Plan, Climate Change 
Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and other sustainability plans and guidelines 
promulgated by the City at the time the Development Proposal is submitted. The 
conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be 
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall 
incorporate best practices in the following areas:  

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve building energy 
and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new 
building within the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for implementation 
of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may include rooftop 
solar pv) within the PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse gas 
emissions analysis for such new building and will implement energy efficiency

most up-to-date standards to address projected future flooding impacts.  

(h) Site Cooling Strategies. A Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK 
District shall incorporate measures to reduce urban heat island effects and identify 
interior and exterior spaces in designated locations to act as cooling areas. 

13.206.3 Letter of Commitment. The Letter of Commitment dated _________ by 

____________ is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the Cambridge 
Zoning Ordinance and shall be binding upon __________ and its successors and 
assigns. To the extent the provisions of the Letter of Commitment are inconsistent

Public Comments for City Council Meeting  
By Nicola Williams, 8 Brewer Street, Cambridge, MA 02138 
 
 
POR 2020 #287  
Supporting Food Pantries & Closing the SNAP Gap  
Many people do not realize the food insecurity does exist in Cambridge and with the high rates 
of unemployment and the lack of affordable grocery stores, this is an important legislation to 
support.  
 
Managers communication #1 Homebridge program  
Glad to see support, but it not nearly enough if we want to address economic inequities in 
Cambridge. We need to revamp it to allow for people to pass along the property to their family 
and build real equity, otherwise it is really just a rental program. 
 
APP 2020 #46. A Zoning Petition  
I write in full support of Green Roofs in Cambridge. As a signer of the petition, I fully support 
the petition APP 2020 #46 led by Cambridge Mothers Out Front. 
 
As an environmentalist and board member of Cambridge based Sustainable Business Network 
of MA, which focuses on supporting local, green and fair economies. I Chair the Local Food 
Committee and we work with local farmers, urban farmers, and program partners in issues 
relating to food insecurity and food access as well as supporting good environmental policies. It 
is time for an intentionally strong policy for Green Roofs in Cambridge. Developers and City 
funded projects should have significant incentives to offer green roofs and solar and Biosolar 
panels to ensure that these projects contribute to the health and wellbeing of our environment 
and community. 
 
We need to be very careful about sharing truthful statements and not misguiding the public 
regarding renters bearing most of the cost for this Green Roofs Initiative. Some of the 
commenters were sharing that ill-informed and deceptive narrative. Everyone would bear the 
costs and not just renters for achieving environmental justice. Climate justice is having a 
healthy community to live in for ALL CAMBRIDGE RESIDENTS. Green Roofs and Biosolar roofs 
will be able to contribute to that.  We are ALL responsible for climate change costs. African 
Americans are more apt to suffer from asthma than any other ethnic group. Also, there should 
be equitable access to trees and healthier environment. Any opportunity to promote a 
healthier climate will result in climate and environmental Justice.

The City environmental incentives for development projects should not by default be 
exclusively money from the project petitioners. It is easy to skip this important obligation if it is 
not mandated somehow. We should be embracing and encouraging City staff and 
builders/developers to incorporate these environmental incentives as sound business practice. I 
hope all of you will agree with me, support this project, and move it along to the City's 
Ordinance Committee. 
 
Thanks for your consideration and care of the environmental health of the Cambridge 
community. 
 
RE: Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund for small businesses, Policy Order #2 (POR 2020 #286) 
As the Facilitator of the Cambridge Somerville Black Business Network, board member of 
Sustainable Business Network of MA, Advisory member of Cambridge Local First, and member 
of Harvard Square and Central Square Business Associations and Cambridge Local First as well 
as advocate on a nationally level for supporting small businesses during the COVID crisis, I fully 
support this order.  
 
Now more than ever, our businesses need the City's support as we embark on a worse wave 
than we had in the spring. A second round of city grants for our businesses will make a 
difference, especially in light of the fact that the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) for 
self-employed, solopreneurs, and independent contractors are about to run out on 
December 26th and our restaurants are hanging on by their fingernails. Thank you. Councilors 
Simmons, McGovern, & Toomey for sponsoring this order.

Fwd: 100% Affordable Housing and Parking

Dear Director Barr
As I wrote to you on OCt 13, City's stated goal is to reduce car ownership (target set in 2014 was about 0.8 cars per 
household by end of this year, a reduction of the ratio of cars owned by 15 percent from 1990 levels 
(https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/18/cambridge-wanted-big-drop-car-ownership-that-hasn-exactly-
happened/sBu3TbWIBQLi5Nlo00L6AM/story.html)). This article reported that “In terms of the trend, we are on the 
right track, but we’re not going to get that target,” said Iram Farooq, Cambridge’s assistant city manager for 
community development.  
Do you have any more recent assessment on how the City is doing in achieving this goal?
Thank you for your attention to this matter,
Respectfully your,
Young Kim

Dear Honorable Mayor, Councillors, and Director Barr,

I trust you and all your loved ones are safe and healthy during this unprecedented pandemic. I want to thank you for 
your leadership in keeping all the Cantabrigians safe during these trying times.

Now that the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Amendment (the Amendment) has been adopted, I would like to bring 
to your attention a golden opportunity to prove (or disprove as case may be) couple of the arguments the proponents of 
the Amendment used in justifying no/limited parking spaces at these 100% affordable housing developments 
(developments):
1) tenants of these developments will be relying on public transit as they will be near public transit hubs such as Porter 
Square
2) City's stated goal is to reduce car ownership (target set in 2014 was about 0.8 cars per household by end of this year, 
a reduction of the ratio of cars owned by 15 percent from 1990 levels 
(https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/18/cambridge-wanted-big-drop-car-ownership-that-hasn-exactly-

These arguments have also been used for large development projects in requesting special permits to waive the parking 
requirements.

It came to my attention that 78 Porter Road, which to my best knowledge is a 100% affordable development, is currently 
undergoing renovation and is empty. I am writing to urge you to conduct a comprehensive, around the clock parking 
study during different days of a week for Porter Road/Regent Street loop while 78 Porter Road is empty and repeat the 
study once the renovation is completed and the building is fully occupied to measure the true impact of 100% affordable 
housing with no parking spaces. Matter of fact, this would establish a parking requirement baseline for any large new 
development near public transit. Opportunities like this will be very hard to come by and I beg the City and 
Capstone/Hope to take advantage to prove that indeed one parking space/dwelling unit is no longer necessary.

Re: Volpe Site 

[Parks] are what make City life at all bearable. What do we live for? Is it to work all day, eight hours, 
ten hours, twelve hours or fourteen hours and confine ourselves to the narrow streets of the city without ever 
seeing the beauties of nature? Do we want an incessant round of work, cut off from pure air, and from the 
light of heaven? Such work and such confinement should not be the main things of life: it is the church, the 
college, the schoolyard, and open space and the public park, which will alone make the city life tolerable to 
our successors.

Cambridge, MA 02139

Dear Cambridge Planning Board:

We are very concerned that MIT’s proposed plan for Volpe does not provide the big open 2.5 acre park that East 
Cambridge requires. This part of the City has the least open space and fewest trees of any neighborhood in the City, 
while hosting the City’s densest population—50,000 in 2020 and a projected 70,000 in 2030.

The Volpe site is East Cambridge’s one opportunity to get an urban commons and all finalists of the City’s 2015 Kendall 
Square Open Space competition showcased this opportunity. The 2001 East Cambridge Planning Study called for 7.5 
acres of useable, flexible open space at the site—and that was before anyone could imagine its current wave of 
development.

MIT has reduced this urban common to a one-acre park on Third Street. This is completely unsatisfactory. Currently, East 
Cambridge has 2.67 acres of open space per 1000 residents, 30% of the National Recreation and Parks Association’s 
standard metric. This neighborhood has the least amount of open space per resident in the City. (Under financial duress, 
the City sold off the neighborhood’s one-half mile long riverside park in 1950. Landscape architect Charles Eliot had 
envisioned it as the “jewel” of the Cambridge Park System.)

If the City allows MIT to fill the Volpe site with buildings, as planned, it will be selling its soul. One can’t add a population 
of 20,000 to a site that already has a deficit of open space to begin with without providing more open space—“breathing 
places,” “places of light, air and ornament,” as our 19th century forebears described parks. For where will the people 
go?

No amount of frosting on the cake will substitute for a 2.5 acre park at the Volpe site. Humans require fresh air, trees, 
and access to light and nature.

Thank you.

Re: Jerry's Pond todaay 

To Planning Board, Cambridge City Council,

As a resident of Cambridge, I believe that my city has a responsibility to preserve and protect our environment for the present and future. The 
preservation of Jerry’s Pond is a true test of Cambridge’s commitment to preservation-BUT-beyond that,  it is a true test and model of its 
commitment to public housing.

Cambridge has shown its investment and advocacy for the creation of open space in general. This is a test of its willingness to invest in open spaces 
in general-but in particular, to invest  in an area that houses 4,000+ folks living in public housing.The restoration of Jerry's Landing is a model of 
what this city stands for and it's time to prove it.

This is a project that is worth fighting for. I am willing as a citizen of this remarkable city, to do whatever possible to see this project through.

Turn Jerry's Pond into an Urban Wild!

Dear Neighborhood and Longterm Planning Committee,

Please support the Friends of Jerry’s Pond in advocating for the transformation of Jerry’s Pond from a brownfield site to an urban wild.

My heart goes out to the 4,000 residents of affordable housing close by, the highest concentration in the City, because they have so little 
access to nature. The restoration of Jerry’s Pond is the obvious answer—it is right there.

The City must write the zoning for the Alewife plan now. This will turn the plan into zoning ordinance, ensuring that Jerry’s Pond becomes a
space useable by the public. It will also require developers to create open space in the Quadrangle.

For the sake of the residents of Fresh Pond Towers, Jefferson Park Apartments, and the new residents of Just-a-Start’s complex (coming 
soon), along with the trees, plants and blue herons at the pond, please prioritize this project.

The reparation of this poisoned land is a matter of social and environmental justice, too.

As we add future development, the City must plan for our residents’ open space needs. We all need green refuges to retreat to, where we can 
connect with nature and ourselves, “breathing places,” as they were called in the 19th century.

Volpe Site

344 Broadway, 3rd Floor

email: planningboardcomment@cambridgema.gov

Dear Cambridge Planning Board:

We are very concerned that MIT’s proposed plan for Volpe does not provide the big open 2.5 acre park that 
East Cambridge requires. This part of the City has the least open space and fewest trees of any neighborhood 
in the City, while hosting the City’s densest population—50,000 in 2020 and a projected 70,000 in 2030.

 The Volpe site is East Cambridge’s one opportunity to get an urban commons and all finalists of the 

•
City’s 2015 Kendall Square Open Space competition showcased this opportunity. The 2001 East 
Cambridge Planning Study called for 7.5 acres of useable, flexible open space at the site—and that 
was before anyone could imagine its current wave of development.

MIT has reduced this urban common to a one-acre park on Third Street. This is completely unsatisfactory. 
Currently, East Cambridge has 2.67 acres of open space per 1000 residents, 30% of the National Recreation 
and Parks Association’s standard metric. This neighborhood has the least amount of open space per resident 
in the City. (Under financial duress, the City sold off the neighborhood’s one-half mile long riverside park in

No amount of frosting on the cake will substitute for a 2.5 acre park at the Volpe site. Humans require fresh air, 
trees, and access to light and nature.

Jerry's Pond 

To : The Cambridge City Council’s
Neighborhood and Long Term Planning Committee

Perez, Lori

From:
Sent:

Subject:

Dear Councillors,

The need for open space and recreation facilities for our existing and growing Cambridge population is essential for a healthy 
community. If nothing else this pandemic demonstrates how vital it is to provide open space for our population.

Jerry’s Pond, and its surrounding land, an approximately 9-acre water and land resource should be added to and integrated with 
Russell/Samp/Comeau fields, as a passive, accessible natural reservation and be acquired or gifted from IQHQ, the new owner. It 
would serve over 4,000 low and moderate income residents of North Cambridge in the Rindge Towers, Jefferson Park and other 
affordable housing projects along Rindge Ave. who are disproportionately foreign born, minority and low income . In addition it could 
also provide open space for the heavily underserved population of over 2,000 residents  living in over 1,200 apartments newly built 
across the Parkway on Cambridge Park Drive.

This can be accomplished, as the new owner /developer will be seeking approval for the development of a highly encumbered site 
(under an Activity Use Limitation and Cambridge Asbestos Ordinance and with major climate mitigation and wetland attributes) on the 
property.. The transfer of the Jerry’s Pond area and the restoration of the pond should be a component of any development rights 
permitted on this site. This can be accomplished in several ways. The City can designate the Jerry’s Pond area as a special district in 
the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance which would allow the developer to use any development rights that are now associated with the 
Jerry’s Pond area to other parts of their development. Alternatively, the developer can contribute the land and the cost of its restoration 
to the City, to the DCR or to a land trust (such as Trust for Public Land or Trustees of the Reservations) for the significant value and 
good will that a charitable contribution would provide them. These models have been successfully used in East Cambridge and in 
Cambridgeport as well as other cities and towns across the country. 

This is an opportunity that should not be missed . I urge you to encourage the Community Development Department to present a 
program to the council of land use controls that will include the incentives and devices which the new owner of the Jerry’s Pond site can 
avail  themselves of to insure that this nine acre site is restored to public use as a much needed public open space.

Respectfully,

O. Robert Simha

Request for traffic count at Mass Ave and Walden intersection

Dear Councilors Carlone and Nolan,

Traffic concerns at the Mass Ave and Walden intersection have been a major issue at the Planning Board and Board of 
Zoning Appeal hearing on 2072 Mass Ave Comprehensive Permit.

Therefore, I respectfully request that you introduce a policy order to conduct traffic count at this very busy intersection, 
preferably in time for the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department to submit a report by 1/7/2021 BZA special 
meeting. Furthermore, I like to request that TP&T formulate a guidance on extrapolating COVID-19 traffic data to non-
COVID traffic estimates as unfortunately my public information request revealed no prior record of Pre-COVID data.

Thank you for your consideration,

Respectfully,
Young Kim

40b Affordable Housing Development Process Improvement

After Dec 10, 2020 Board of Zoning Appeal hearing on the 2072 Mass Ave Comprehensive Permit application, I read 
Stowe's Red Acre Road Parcel Activities (an affordable housing development) Timeline report (https://www.stow-
ma.gov/sites/g/files/vyhlif1286/f/uploads/article_54_red_acre_design_funds.pdf) by Stow Municipal Affordable 
Housing Trust (SMAHT) presented at Stowe's Annual Town Meeting this year. I also read the MA Department of Housing 
& Community Development Department's Site Approval Letter dated Dec. 10, 2020, the same day as the BZA meeting on 
this case.

According to the Site Approval letter, the approval "create a presumption of fundability under 760 CMR 56.04 and 
permits CC HRE 2072 Mass Ave Trust LLC (the "Applicant") to apply to the Cambridge Zoning Board of Appeals (sic) for a 
comprehensive permit."

This is my first involvement in a comprehensive permit case and I am dismayed at how the Applicant ignored 
all the procedures and is rushing this process through, with implicit or explicit approval from the CIty and its 
agencies.
this opportunity to update the 40b Affordable Housing Development process with a checklist of steps, 
documents required with deadlines, and criterion to move to the next step from the inception to issuance 
of Certificate of Occupancy.

I am not writing this letter to rehash all the broken procedural steps, but rather to implore you to take 

In other words, this checklist is to serve as a complete history of the development.

The Stow SMAHT Timeline showed a major step that was skipped and must be included in the checklist, 
namely "Community Engagement and Communication" by applicant in conjunction with the Housing Division of the 
Community Development Department to present "(v)isualization of development options" to the neighbors of the 
planned site giving them an opportunity to voice their concerns well before the applicant proceeds with the design of 
the development. And from then on, the community should have been involved at every step of the way. The checklist 
must require a comprehensive permit application to be submitted only after obtaining the site approval letter from the 
State. And all application material and supplemental material, if any, must be submitted well in advance of the Planning 
Board and BZA hearings to allow the board members and the public ample time to review them. Furthermore, the 
supplemental material must clearly identify changes from the original.  

Thank you for your consideration. I would greatly appreciate your acknowledgement of receipt of this email an looking 
forward to hearing from you favorably,

Respectfully your,
Young Kim

Comment in support of Policy Order 1

Dear members of the City Council,

I hope you are doing well. My name is Will MacArthur and I live at 18 Shea Rd in North Cambridge. I 
am writing today to express my strong support for Policy Order O-1. Restrictive zoning has long been a tool of 
racial and socioeconomic exclusion in Cambridge — neighborhoods in Cambridge that are predominantly 
zoned Residence A have far fewer residents of color and far fewer low-income families than the city as a whole 
— and I am glad that the order acknowledges this legacy and seeks to address it. I also appreciated that the 
order cited Minneapolis’s recent zoning reform; Minneapolis’s plan will be especially effective because it also 
includes eliminating off-street parking minimums, and I hope that the NLTP and Housing committees will 
consider doing the same in their joint meeting. Thank you to Councillors Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, McGovern, 
and Simmons for initiating this important conversation, and thank you for the opportunity to comment.

Best wishes,
Will MacArthur

Plan to open schools

Dear School Committee and City Council:

We are extremely concerned about the current state of the Cambridge Public schools and its ability to 
effectively address the needs of students and families as we continue to endure this pandemic.

Currently there appears to be no plan nor even a process to accomodate more in-person learning opportunities 
for our students., There is not one single item addressing this situation on either the School Committee or the 
City Council's agenda this week. The recent Round Table with the Upper and High school leadership teams 
seemed to indicate that they have yet to even begin to address this issue, despite a target set by the District to 
accommodate more students by February 8, 2021.

We have heard the testimony of many local experts about the emotional damage they are seeing in our 
children from school closures and our parents and families are shouldering this entire burden and stress.

Cambridge Public Schools have expert guidance and planning for effective safe protocols and the full financial 
support from the City Manager.

We have empty buildings and space all over the city, strong community partners, and countless numbers of 
resident volunteers ready to help—yet these resources have not yet even been engaged in this emergency.

It is good that the Superintendent and the School Committee are conducting "listening sessions", but these 
need to translate into more than talk. In the summer, numerous surveys showed that the majority of parents 
supported in-person school. Likewise, at these listening sessions, the overwhelming majority of parents have 
been dissatisfied with remote schooling. These findings need to translate into actions to expand in-person 
schooling to as many children as possible, as soon as possible.

It's extremely frustrating to constantly have to write, speak, and advocate for the needs of our students to have 
access to something that is their fundamental right, and to plead with city leaders to effectively do the work that 
they were elected to do.

The current situation of the Cambridge Public schools should be an all-hands-on-deck priority, and we need to 
see some transparency, meaningful action, and better communication from our entire city until our public 
education system is working effectively and our children are no longer bearing the brunt of this pandemic.

All Hands on Deck for Cambridge Public Schools

accommodate more students by February 8, 2021.

The current situation of the Cambridge Public schools should be an all-hands-on-deck priority, and parents 
need to see meaningful actions and weekly updates by email until our public education system is working 
effectively and our children are no longer bearing the strain of this pandemic.

We have heard the testimony of many local experts about the emotional damage they are seeing in our 
children from school closures, and our parents and families are shouldering this tremendous burden and 
stress.

Cambridge Public Schools have expert guidance and planning for effective safe protocols and the full financial 
support from the City Manager.

We have empty buildings and space all over the city, strong community partners, and countless numbers of 
resident volunteers ready to help—yet these resources have not yet even been engaged in this emergency.

access to something that is their fundamental right, and to plead with city leaders to effectively do the work that 
they were elected to do.

We look forward to seeing more concrete, actionable planning for our school district.

Please include this in the record of the city council meeting of 12/14/20, regarding the Windsor st property charter right.

Begin forwarded message:

From: Gerald Bergman <geraldebergman@gmail.com>
Date: December 13, 2020 at 3:11:43 PM EST
To: citycouncil@cambridgema.gov
Cc: cambridgecitycouncil@cambridge.gov
Subject: Windsor street and other properties - city council meeting 12/14/20

Port residents have advocated for more than four years for the reuse of 105 Windsor Street. This has 
been just one of the parcels that have been brought to the attention of the Council over the past several 
years. Of course, the Cherry St lot is another of the parcels. More recently (two years) we have 
advocated for a reuse of the multi-family residential building on Main Street across from the boutique 
hotel (once held and land banked by MIT). Of course, the loss of twelve (12) three bedroom apartments 
to make way for the gentrifying boutique hotel cannot be overcome.

Other documents from the CRA indicate a planning process and an initial expenditure of money by the 
CRA regarding 105 Windsor St. Just what initial planning has been carried out, and who was involved 
and to what degree, should be made public.

All of the above: years of neglect of properties, exclusive and secret planning and the expenditure of 
money, and continued lack of transparency by all public and quasi-public entities just underlines the 
reasonable mistrust felt by the community of the Port.

All relevant information and documentation, past and currently ongoing, regarding all vacant and/or 
underutilized properties in the Port neighborhood should see the light of day.

Thanks for your consideration. I wait to hear from the Council and the City administration regarding 
these properties.

neighborhood.	  	  The	  CRA	  staff	  has	  offered	  to	  facilitate	  a	  community	  planning	  process	  for	  this	  public	  
resource	  in	  collaboration	  with	  the	  City	  and	  neighborhood	  stakeholders.	  To	  inform	  a	  conceptual	  
redevelopment	  program,	  the	  CRA	  has	  begun	  conducting	  due	  diligence	  to	  determine	  the	  physical	  needs	  of	  
the	  building	  and	  to	  quantify	  the	  potential	  costs	  of	  rehabilitation	  and	  operation.	  	  	  
	  
Background	  
The	  building	  is	  a	  three-­‐story	  structure	  of	  approximately	  12,800	  gross	  square	  feet,	  located	  on	  a	  10,000	  
square	  foot	  parcel	  at	  the	  intersection	  of	  Windsor	  Street	  and	  School	  Street	  in	  the	  Port	  neighborhood.	  	  The	  
brick	  structure	  was	  built	  in	  1868	  as	  the	  City’s	  Boardman	  School.	  It	  was	  one	  of	  the	  first	  brick	  school	  buildings	  
in	  the	  City,	  and	  is	  the	  only	  surviving	  structure	  of	  its	  class.	  	  It	  was	  converted	  into	  a	  recreation	  center	  in	  1940	  
and	  housed	  a	  social	  services	  office	  and	  a	  branch	  library.	  	  It	  was	  converted	  into	  a	  health	  clinic	  in	  1972	  and	  
was	  renovated	  in	  1985.	  	  
	  
The	  City	  leased	  the	  Property	  to	  the	  Cambridge	  Health	  Alliance	  (CHA)	  in	  1997	  as	  part	  of	  a	  Master	  Lease,	  
covering	  numerous	  properties	  in	  Cambridge.	  As	  of	  today,	  the	  Property	  remains	  subject	  to	  the	  Master	  Lease	  
but	  is	  currently	  vacant.	  	  The	  Property	  requires	  a	  moderate	  level	  of	  investment	  to	  be	  usable,	  including	  
universal	  accessibility	  upgrades,	  updated	  heating	  and	  cooling	  systems,	  a	  new	  roof,	  and	  other	  basic	  
improvements,	  as	  described	  below.	  The	  Property	  is	  currently	  zoned	  Residences	  C-­‐1.	  	  	  	  	  
	  
Planning	  Process	  
As	  an	  outcome	  of	  the	  CRA’s	  2014	  strategic	  planning	  process,	  the	  CRA	  has	  explored	  projects	  where	  the	  
CRA’s	  unique	  real	  estate	  development	  capacity	  and	  statutory	  authority	  might	  be	  of	  use	  in	  meeting	  the	  
City’s	  community	  development	  objectives.	  	  In	  2016,	  the	  City	  and	  the	  CRA	  initiated	  discussions	  regarding	  
potential	  strategies	  to	  utilize	  the	  Property	  as	  a	  non-­‐profit	  community	  center.	  	  The	  Property’s	  future	  use	  has	  
evolved	  from	  community	  conversations	  facilitated	  by	  the	  Community	  Development	  Department	  (CDD)	  
regarding	  the	  Cherry	  Street	  lot	  as	  well	  as	  ongoing	  conversations	  with	  community	  stakeholders	  about	  local	  
resources	  and	  services	  needs	  in	  the	  Port	  neighborhood.	  Initial	  concepts	  that	  have	  been	  discussed	  include	  
community	  programs	  related	  to	  food	  security,	  community-­‐support	  services,	  economic	  development	  
opportunities,	  and	  potential	  synergies	  between	  these	  services.	  	  An	  example	  of	  programs	  overlapping	  to	  
meet	  multiple	  areas	  of	  need	  would	  be	  a	  community	  kitchen	  linked	  with	  a	  food	  pantry,	  meal	  programs	  and	  
local	  entrepreneurship	  training.	  	  The	  recently	  completed	  Community	  Needs	  Assessment	  Report	  reinforces

the	  potential	  for	  a	  facility	  to	  host	  these	  types	  of	  uses	  in	  the	  Port.	  As	  the	  historical	  uses	  of	  the	  Property	  have	  
been	  community	  use,	  the	  CRA	  and	  the	  City	  hope	  to	  revitalize	  the	  building	  to	  again	  function	  as	  an	  asset	  to	  
the	  neighborhood.	  	  	  
	  
Initial	  Property	  Assessment	  
The	  CRA	  has	  conducted	  some	  pre-­‐development	  analysis	  of	  the	  Property	  by	  reviewing	  the	  Master	  Lease	  
with	  the	  CHA,	  conducting	  a	  full	  building	  survey,	  and	  enlisting	  the	  services	  of	  a	  construction	  cost	  estimator	  
to	  analyze	  the	  potential	  capital	  investment	  needs	  of	  the	  building.	  The	  CRA’s	  proposed	  planning	  process	  to	  
establish	  the	  future	  use	  of	  the	  building	  would	  be	  supported	  by	  these	  technical	  assessments.	  	  	  
	  
The	  CRA	  contracted	  with	  Daedalus	  Projects,	  Inc.	  for	  cost	  estimator	  services	  to	  provide	  a	  concept	  outline	  of	  
capital	  needs	  required	  to	  rehabilitate	  the	  property.	  The	  estimate	  assumes	  the	  building	  is	  renovated	  in	  its	  
current	  format	  as	  an	  office	  with	  full	  accessibility	  upgrades,	  replacing	  all	  building	  systems,	  exterior	  
renovations,	  and	  a	  basic	  interior	  fit-­‐out.	  	  	  These	  basic	  improvements	  are	  estimated	  to	  require	  two	  million	  
and	  fifty	  thousand	  dollars	  ($2,050,000)	  of	  capital	  investment.	  	  Fit-­‐out	  requirements	  with	  specialty	  
equipment	  or	  significant	  building	  modifications	  would	  be	  additional	  costs.	  	  Design	  services	  and	  other	  soft	  
costs	  are	  not	  part	  of	  this	  estimate.	  	  The	  full	  summary	  of	  this	  initial	  assessment	  is	  documented	  in	  the	  
attached	  report.	  The	  CRA	  also	  hired	  Vanesse	  Hangen	  Brustlin	  Inc.	  to	  conduct	  a	  land	  survey	  of	  the	  parcel	  and	  
Existing	  Conditions	  Survey	  Inc.	  to	  perform	  internal	  measurements	  of	  the	  building	  to	  develop	  “as-­‐built”	  
construction	  drawings	  for	  future	  design	  work.	  	  	  
	  
Using	  some	  basic	  assumptions	  regarding	  non-­‐profit	  programming,	  the	  CRA	  has	  compiled	  some	  financial	  
models	  for	  the	  operational	  costs	  and	  limited	  revenue	  sources,	  to	  test	  the	  feasibility	  of	  alternative	  
revitalizations	  strategies.	  This	  initial	  analysis	  shows	  that	  with	  rents	  in	  the	  range	  of	  $15	  to	  $25	  per	  square	  
foot,	  the	  building	  can	  likely	  support	  most	  of	  its	  operating	  costs.	  However,	  below-­‐market	  rents	  cannot	  
support	  significant	  debt	  to	  pay	  off	  capital	  investment.	  The	  capital	  needed	  to	  rehabilitate	  the	  property,	  as	  
described	  above,	  would	  depend	  on	  sources	  outside	  the	  potential	  rent	  revenue	  of	  the	  building	  itself.	  The	  
building	  is	  eligible	  for	  listing	  on	  the	  National	  Register	  of	  Historic	  Places,	  which	  could	  make	  it	  eligible	  for	  
historic	  tax	  credits	  and	  a	  potential	  candidate	  for	  historic	  preservation	  funding	  under	  the	  Community	  
Preservation	  Act.	  	  Future	  financial	  analysis	  should	  explore	  a	  mix	  of	  potential	  capital	  funding	  sources	  
including	  the	  City’s	  general	  fund,	  CRA	  revenue	  from	  MXD	  development,	  state	  and	  federal	  tax	  credits,	  
Community	  Preservation	  Act	  funds,	  and	  local	  foundation	  support.	  
	  

Initial	  Redevelopment	  Strategy	  
The	  CRA	  staff	  hopes	  to	  continue	  to	  explore	  with	  the	  City	  how	  best	  to	  implement	  this	  project	  to	  benefit	  the	  
Port	  community.	  	  Under	  Chapter	  121B	  of	  the	  Massachusetts	  General	  Laws,	  the	  CRA	  has	  the	  ability	  to	  
purchase	  or	  lease	  any	  property	  necessary	  or	  reasonably	  required	  to	  carry	  out	  redevelopment.	  While	  the	  
details	  of	  the	  specific	  development	  strategy	  and	  requisite	  CRA	  plan	  framework	  would	  need	  to	  be	  explored,	  
it	  appears	  that	  the	  CRA	  could	  be	  well	  positioned	  to	  help	  revitalize	  this	  building	  to	  deliver	  a	  valuable	  
neighborhood	  resource	  to	  meet	  needs	  and/or	  expand	  resources	  identified	  by	  the	  various	  non-­‐profits	  in	  this	  
area	  of	  the	  City.	  In	  addition	  to	  technical	  assistance	  and	  real	  estate	  transactional	  tools,	  the	  CRA	  Board	  may	  
also	  consider	  providing	  capital	  and/or	  operational	  resources	  toward	  the	  project’s	  implementation.	  	  The	  
CRA	  staff	  looks	  forward	  to	  continued	  collaboration	  with	  the	  City	  and	  community	  partners	  on	  this	  initiative.

Property). In the fall of 2016 the CRA began technical analysis of the property and also started to 
organize a focused planning effort regarding the future use of the building as a form of non-profit 
office / service center. Preliminary exploration findings have proven that a number of capital repairs 
and improvements are needed to maintain the integrity of the building.  
 
This past summer the CRA submitted an application for Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds 
toward the preservation of the Property through building envelop restoration.  The submission was 
approved for $255,000. The CPA mandates that a percentage of funding go towards affordable 
housing, open space and historical restoration.  The CRA understands that the Port community would 
like a thorough community planning process to provide context for the programming the future uses 
for the Property to best serve the neighborhood.  
 
The CRA has proposed to invest the CPA granted funds towards exterior restoration of this historical 
building in 2018, as a separate project ahead of the interior renovations.  As CPA funds are not eligible 
to be used for the design phase of this project the CRA will need to commit resources to the design 
and other soft costs of the Project.  The CRA staff has continued to have discussions with the 
representatives from non-profit organizations serving the Port as well as City staff regarding how it can 
best assist with the planning process for interior improvements and programming.  
 
Project Details: 

In 2016, the CRA requested that Daedalus Projects, Inc. (DPI) draft a summary detailing the cost for 
repairs and improvements to the envelope of the building. These estimated totals were used in the 
formal request to the City for the CPA funds that will be used invested into the restoration project. 
Listed below are costs for repairs and site improvements needed to be completed to the exterior of 
105 Windsor Street:

Prior to construction beginning, a hazardous material and existing conditions survey will be done to 
identify the critical improvements required.  The CRA will need to seek a design team through a 
Designer Selection process to produce accurate construction documents for the three major 
components of the building envelope improvements (roof, exterior masonry, and window) and 
additional site work that the budget allows. 

Consulting Services Scope: 

The CRA currently has DPI contracted as a “House Doctor” building engineering consultant. The CRA 
Board requested that any services performed under this scope above 10,000 be brought before the 
Board for approval.  As a consultant on this first phase of the restoration project, staff proposes to 
utilize DPI to provide construction project management services to the CRA. The Scope of Services 
(Attachment A) that DPI would provide is summarized below: 
 

1.  Pre-Development Services 

-  Assist in evaluating and reviewing project schedule, 
-  Develop a preliminary project budget, and 
-  Review design documents and offer recommendations. 

 

2.  Review Designer Selection RFQ

-  Review bids and make recommendation for award of contract. 

3.  Cost Estimates 

-  A project budged will be provided based on preliminary estimated costs, and 
-  Budget tracking throughout the entirety of the project. 

DPI has proposed a contract not to exceed $20,000. All services will be invoiced on an hourly basis. 
The rates for the Daedalus staff will be Principal at $150/hour and the Project Manager at $125/hour. 
 
Community Planning: 
 
Although an exact scope or process structure for the Port neighborhood and 105 Windsor planning 
processes has not been worked out, staff anticipates that a portion of the 2018 planning consultant line 
item could be used for this community planning effort.  Staff will continue to engage with the community 
leaders and the City about this concept and hope to return to the Board early next year with a more 
specific proposal.

Reopen the schools: on behalf of Cambridge parents

Dear School Committee and City Council:

We are extremely concerned about the current state of the Cambridge Public schools and its ability to effectively address the needs of 
students and families as we continue to endure this pandemic.

Currently there appears to be no plan nor even a process to accomodate more in-person learning opportunities for our students., There is 
not one single item addressing this situation on either the School Committee or the City Council's agenda this week. The recent Round Table 
with the Upper and High school leadership teams seemed to indicate that they have yet to even begin to address this issue, despite a target 
set by the District to accommodate more students by February 8, 2021.

We request an actionable plan to reopen the schools for grades 4-12 by Feb. 8, finalized no later than January 25, two weeks before 
school starts. And we need updates at every school and city council meeting before then.

We have heard the testimony of many local experts about the emotional damage they are seeing in our children from school closures and our 
parents and families are shouldering this entire burden and stress.

Cambridge Public Schools have expert guidance and planning for effective safe protocols and the full financial support from the City 
Manager.

We have empty buildings and space all over the city, strong community partners, and countless numbers of resident volunteers ready to 
help—yet these resources have not yet even been engaged in this emergency.

It is good that the Superintendent and the School Committee are conducting "listening sessions", but these need to translate into more than 
talk. In the summer, numerous surveys showed that the majority of parents supported in-person school. Likewise, at these listening 
sessions, the overwhelming majority of parents have been dissatisfied with remote schooling. These findings need to translate into actions to 
expand in-person schooling to as many children as possible, as soon as possible.

It's extremely frustrating to constantly have to write, speak, and advocate for the needs of our students to have access to something that is 
their fundamental right, and to plead with city leaders to effectively do the work that they were elected to do.

The current situation of the Cambridge Public schools should be an all-hands-on-deck priority, and we need to see some transparency, 
meaningful action, and better communication from our entire city until our public education system is working effectively and our children 
are no longer bearing the brunt of this pandemic.

Sincerely,

Elinor Actipis

In favor of Cambridge public school reopening

Hello,
I am writing to encourage the city to reopen schools as soon as possible and to revise metrics in accordance with Dr. 
Danielle Allen’s recommendations to consider teachers as essential workers. As a pediatrician, health services 
researcher, woman of color, and parent of 2 Cambridge public school students (JK and 1st grade at Tobin), I believe that 
schools are essential for our children’s mental, physical, and psychological well-being. I have seen professionally and 
personally the effects of the pandemic and school closures on what I consider a public health crisis regarding our 
children’s mental health. I am concerned about rising inequities that school closures are perpetuating in individuals from 
underrepresented or disadvantaged races, ethnicities, language, incomes, and other backgrounds. I am concerned that 
school closures are perpetuating a digital divide, nutritional disparities, household stress, depression, bullying, suicidal 
ideation, unsafe online practices, domestic violence and child abuse, and will impact long term educational attainment 
for our most vulnerable children. 

Our family was struggling immensely when the schools were closed in-person. We are now doing well since the schools 
reopened and with the help of mental health professionals, additional childcare, flexible workplaces, and household 
help, all of which require time, money, coordination, access, and other resources. I fear for the many families who do 
not have these privileges and ask the city do all it can to reopen the schools for all. I believe that schools can and should 
open safely and that we need to prioritize children. I believe we can do so in a way that ensures safety of teachers and 
other school personnel. I encourage the city to do everything in its power to reopen schools and mitigate this pediatric 
public health crisis. 

Thank you,

Dear City Councilors,

Allan Sadun <aesadun@alum.mit.edu>
Monday, December 14, 2020 3:48 PM
City Council; Clerk
Yes, let's end exclusionary zoning [PO #1]

Below are my planned remarks for tonight in support of Policy Order #1. I want to express my gratitude and appreciation 
for the sponsors for bringing it forward.

From the beginning of zoning approximately 100 years ago, it has been impossible to talk about zoning without talking 
about socio-economic exclusion. In 1918, Frederick Law Olmstead, arguing in favor of zoning, said new housing must 
take into account "the habits of the people", which he said were "more or less coincident with racial divisions", and 
argued against "intermingl[ing] houses for people who do not readily intermingle with each other". When the Lochner-
era Supreme Court allowed the use of zoning its modern form, they described apartment houses as "parasites". And 
while proponents of zoning restrictions in Cambridge have repeatedly denied that this is their intent, it has always been 
the case, and continues to be the case to this day, that the most strictly downzoned parts of Cambridge are the whitest. 
You can read more about this in Will MacArthur's excellent report on the history of zoning in Cambridge.

The most obvious and pernicious form of exclusionary zoning is the apartment ban, by which I mean zoning which 
prevents the building of new multifamily housing such as fourplexes, townhouses, and triple-deckers. Apartment bans 
can be written in a number of different ways. Sometimes an apartment ban takes the form of a literal prohibition on 
multifamily housing. Sometimes an apartment ban takes the form of a minimum lot size, a minimum lot size per 
dwelling unit, or dimensional standards like setback and height limits that make building out a lot impossible. Sometimes 
it takes the form of a requirement to provide parking. Usually, it is a few of these "paper walls" all at once; you can learn
more about the details in Amy Dain's excellent report on the current state of zoning for multifamily housing in Greater 
Boston.

But no matter how it is implemented, whenever the effect of a zoning restriction is to prevent the construction of 
multifamily housing, the effect of that zoning restriction is to keep out minorities and the working class. 

Apartment bans are how the rich keep the poor "out of sight and out of mind" in Cambridge, and I am so excited to see 
the City Council begin the work of ending them. Ensuring that missing middle multifamily housing is viable on every lot 
in the city is critical to ensuring that every human being is welcome on every street. It's time to end the concept of a 
"millionaire's row". So thank you, once again, and I look forward to participating in this conversation as it moves 
forward.

Reopen the elementary schools

I'm the parent of a 5th grader and two 2nd graders at the Baldwin School. All three have not set foot in their school in 
nine months. They ask when they'll be able to return and I now tell them very honestly that there is no concrete plan to 
bring them back. They ask why and I tell them honestly that I don't understand what the district has been doing for 
nearly a year. The younger ones have started to forget what their school looks like. We are trying to figure out whether 
we can afford to move to another school district or pay for private schooling. We are stunned to be in this situation, as 
we'd always seen the Cambridge public schools as dependable and a source of great joy. That's no longer the case.

I don't know what more to say. The district appears not to take seriously the mountain of evidence that suggests 
elementary schoolers have little risk of infection or of spreading the virus. I've seen no acknowledgement that CPSD has 
placed all of the physical, mental, economic and educational risks onto parents and children themselves. I have 
completely lost faith in this School Committee and City Council given how poorly our children's welfare has been 
handled. The superintendent has been particularly poor at addressing the damage this is doing to families and children. 
Particularly frustrating is my sense that many teachers want to return to the classroom but are allowing the most 
negative voices control the conversation.

I'm exhausted by it all and can't believe we're basically the only place on earth that has failed to keep schools open. I 
really thought Cambridge would be better. There's still a chance to salvage this school year. Open the elementary 
schools by requiring masks of everyone and making sure rooms are well ventilated. WIth those two measures, dropping 
the 6' distancing minimum won't be risky and all children can return to school if their parents want them to. No more 
discussions or investigations are needed. It's time to get this done.

Girl Scout Troop 82030 in Cambridge is made up of CPS fifth and sixth graders who 
are helping address the COVID-19 pandemic in Cambridge by expanding access to 
masks and promoting mask use; and 
 
As part of their Bronze Award Project, an award given to troops that make a positive 
impact on their community, these Girl Scouts worked with Cambridge Volunteer 
Clearinghouse and the Mask Cambridge Initiative to string stoppers for 1,500 masks, 
to be distributed to low-income residents who may otherwise find it difficult to access 
this protective equipment; and  
 
They also created a “Wear A Mask” outreach and education campaign, meant to 
demonstrate how wearing a mask can be fun, how reusable masks are better for the 
environment, and how wearing masks will make a huge difference in keeping others 
safe while reducing transmission; and  
 
At a time when so many of our community members are struggling amid a global 
pandemic, it is heartening to see our young residents step up to fill in resource gaps for 
their low-income neighbors, educate others on public health guidelines, and embody 
what it means to be engaged and active in their community; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record thanking Girl Scouts Emi, Maia S., Catherine, 
Saras, Maia C., Lila, Carmen, and Judy, as well as troop co-leaders Christine Pilcavage 
and Diane Fisk Johnson of Troop 82030 for their hard work in promoting mask use 
and access; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of 
this resolution to Girl Scout Troop 82030 on behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 

The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has impacted every American’s life in one way or 
another, leading to a historic loss of jobs while also exposing pre-existing issues in 
local, state and federal economic systems; and 
 
Prior to the pandemic, nearly 40% of Americans could not afford a single $400 
emergency, and rising income inequality is compounded by an ever-growing racial 
wealth divide; and 
 
Research has shown a growing racial wealth gap, with the median white worker 
making 28% more on average than a Black worker, and 35% more than the median 
Latinx worker in the last quarter of 2019. The median wealth of white families is more 
than $100,000 while the median wealth of black families is approximately $10,000; 
and 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these wealth gaps across race and gender, 
disproportionally affecting people of color; and 
 
In order to address these inequalities, a coalition of Mayors across the country – from 
Oakland, CA to Gainseville, FL – have committed to advocating in favor of cash-based 
guaranteed income policies; and 
 
Cambridge has also signed onto the Mayor’s for a Guaranteed Income Pledge and is 
actively working with community partners to pilot a universal basic income program in 
Cambridge in early 2021; and 
 
Ongoing, direct cash payments will put real money in the pockets of people across the 
country and increase spending in our communities; and  
 
These regular payments have shown to be more effective than unemployment benefits 
for families of color. The data show that another direct payment would increase Native 
American, Latinx/Hispanic, and Black family income by 4.1%, 3.9%, and 3.6% 
respectively, compared to 2% of household income for white families; and

RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

Providing an income floor that would support families during this economic and public 
health crisis will benefit those individuals receiving ongoing cash assistance and the 
community at large; now therefore be it  
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record supporting the efforts of the Mayor’s 
for A Guaranteed Income and supports ongoing, direct cash payments throughout the 
pandemic and until our economy recovers; and be it further 
 
That the Cambridge City Council urges President-elect Biden, Speaker Pelosi and 
Leader McConnell to develop an ongoing federal guaranteed income that provides an 
income floor for all Americans.

WHEREAS:  

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

WHEREAS: 

The control of the spread of SARS CoV-2 is accomplished by the prevention of 
transmission from infected individuals to others, and since March of 2020, the methods 
used have relied on the nearly universal adoption of mask use, physical distancing, 
hand and surface hygiene, limiting indoor and in-person activity, and quarantining 
those who may have been exposed; and 
 
These measures have been largely successful in our community, due to the successful 
partnership with businesses which have complied with distancing and limiting group 
size and capacity, mask use requirements, hygienic practices, air quality 
improvements, contact tracing programs, quarantine pay, installation of barriers, 
testing of staff for infection, all at the businesses expense and largely by their own 
initiative to implement “best practices” that go above and beyond state and local 
guidelines: and 
 
Fear, uncertainty, unpredictable changes to guidelines and sudden decisions about 
closures create a needlessly stressful climate, and that is taking a toll on the 
community’s resolve to soldier on with the behaviors that current interventions rely on 
to be effective; and 
 
The City of Cambridge is in the global epicenter of biological and data sciences and 
academic institutions who benefit from access to the enormous progress and cutting 
edge tools that have been developed by dedicated and hard-working scientists, 
academics and experts, and should endeavor to extend the benefit and access to the 
citizenry and workforce; and 
 
The prolonged prohibitions on in-person interaction cause damage and danger to the 
health and well-being of the population, but newly available and emerging testing 
strategies and devices that provide fast, frequent test results with confirmatory tests 
will guarantee that disease prevalence can be reduced and remain low enough to safely 
allow for the most burdensome restrictions to be relaxed; and 
 
A vaccine is here, but does not deliver  a “Hollywood ending” in which immunity is 
instantly conferred population wide like a balloon drop, therefore the latest most 
advanced testing program is urgently needed to rapidly improve the safety of in-person 
interaction until such time that widespread immunity is ultimately achieved; now 
therefore be it 
 

RESOLVED:   The City must provide support for individuals and businesses to facilitate the most 

impactful testing procedures and risk profile segregation strategies; and be it further

programs, communicate with businesses about these programs, ascertain what 
businesses need to quickly deploy these programs to as many people as possible, and

Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Co-Chair 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Co-Chair 
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon 
Councillor Marc McGovern 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan 
 
The Housing Committee held a public hearing on Thursday, October 22, 2020 at 5:30 p.m. in the Sullivan 
Chamber to receive an update from the Community Development Department and the Affordable 
Housing Trust Fund on potential changes made to the eligibility preferences for the Inclusionary Housing 
Program.  
 
Present at the hearing were Councillor Simmons, Naomie Stephen, Neal Alpert, and Paula M. Crane, 
Deputy City Clerk. 
 

Participating in the hearing via Zoom were Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor 
McGovern, Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Nolan, Mayor Siddiqui, Chris Cotter, Housing Director, 
Justine Cabrera, Justine Cabrera, Senior Manager for Inclusionary Housing, Linda Prosnitz, Housing 
Project Planner, Community Development Department (CDD), Maura Pensak, Housing Liaison to the 
City Manager, Michael Johnston, Executive Director, Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA), Nancy 
Glowa, City Solicitor , Tina Alu, Executive Director, CEOC, Anthony Wilson, City Clerk, Bo Fuji, 
Heather Hoffman, James Williamson, and John Hawkinson. 
 
Councillor Simmons read the Governor’s Order relating to Zoom participation. Councillor Simmons 
requested the Deputy City Clerk call the roll to indicate a quorum for the hearing and that the hearing was 
clearly audible to Zoom participants. 
 
The roll was called and resulted as follows: 
 
PRESENT: 

Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor 
McGovern 
 
Councillor Zondervan 
 

 
ABSENT: 
 
A quorum was present. 
 
Councillor Simmons read from a prepared written opening statement (ATTACHMENT A). She then 
invited Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler for his opening remarks.  
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that Cambridge is facing an affordable housing crisis. He said that 
there are parts that must be addressed via state and federal funding. He said that Inclusionary Housing

preferences are under the control of the City Council, that this is a tangible step that can be taken on the 
local level, and that he is excited to hear this evening’s presentation.  
 
Councillor Simmons noted that the Housing Committee received a communication from Kavish Gandhi 
and asked that this communication be made part of the permanent record of the hearing.  
 
Councillor Simmons opened the hearing to Public Comment. 
 
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, stated that she is glad to see this issue getting some attention. She 
said that she wondered whether an additional item could be considered: she said that she knows numerous 
people who live in Inclusionary units who have wanted to take in a homeless person (people whom they 
already know) to live with them, but have been prevented from doing so because of the existing rules. She 
said that this would be a more efficient use of the housing that we have available, and she hopes that the 
City Council considers changing the rules to allow this, if it is found to be legal to do so. She said this 
change in the rules could help some people to not be homeless.  
 
James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, stated that he did not have any comment prior to viewing the 
presentation by CDD. 
  
Councillor Simmons stated that Public Comment will remain open until 6:00 p.m. 
 
Councillor Simmons invited Chris Cotter to introduce the City team for this hearing. He stated that 
Justine Cabrera and Linda Prosnitz from the Community Development Department were joining in on 
tonight’s meeting, as well as Maura Pensak, the Housing Liaison to the City Manager, and City Solicitor 
Nancy Glowa. He said that they are all happy to continue the conversation. He said that his department 
has spent a long time working on the Inclusionary recommendations with the Affordable Housing Trust, 
and they are pleased to present these recommendations to the Housing Committee tonight and to receive 
feedback. Mr. Cotter said that when thinking about potentially changing preferences, we unavoidably 
advantage some and disadvantage others. He said it is a very challenging thing to do. He said that his 
team has been able to talk and work with feedback they’ve been given in order to revise these 
preferences. He said that the Affordable Housing Trust was building off of what they had previously 
heard from the City Council. Mr. Cotter gave an overview of a PowerPoint presentation titled 
Inclusionary Housing Resident Selection Preferences. (ATTACHMENT B).  
 
As Mr. Cotter wrapped up his presentation, he said that he looks forward to getting comments and 
feedback on this during and following this hearing. He said that the next steps would be for his team to 
put this material into draft standards and procedures for resident selection. He said this would then be 
looked at by the Law Department. He said that they want to expand the documentation requirements for 
residents, that there would be a revised and updated document explaining how we define what a resident 
is and what the City would accept for documentation, and that the CDD has heard from staff, from 
residents, and from the Council that they want to give applicants more choices and opportunities to 
confirm their residency. He said they will put this document together in such a way that is consistent with 
the Ordinance, and then this would be put into a draft form for Public Comment. That Public Comment 
period would need to be at least 30 days, it would be shared with all applicants, with residents, with 
building managers, and with anyone with a stake in the program to solicit their feedback. Following that 
process, the Trust would then review that feedback, process through it into a final draft, which would then 
become effective in changing the preference system.  
 
Councillor Simmons thanked Mr. Cotter and then asked about the “Next Steps” slide of the presentation. 
She asked if the draft recommendations go to the Affordable Housing Trust, then to the Law Department, 
and then back to the Housing Committee before going to the City Council? She said it was not quite clear

to her. Chris Cotter said that there is no formal role for the Affordable Housing Trust in adopting any of 
these changes under the Inclusionary Ordinance. He said that under the Ordinance, it is the Community 
Development Department that has the authority to make these changes, with policy input from the City 
Council. He said that the CDD would draft standards and procedures for the Inclusionary Program, they 
would then put them out for Public Comment for 30 days; following that, the CDD would adapt based on 
the feedback they received, and then the CDD would issue final standards and procedures. He said that 
the next steps are for the Community Development Department to draft, in consultation with the Law 
Department, the document to ensure that it is being responsive to the requested changes, while adhering to 
the law. Mr. Cotter said that the Community Development Department certainly could come back and 
present these proposed final draft changes to the Housing Committee if that is requested. He said that the 
CDD understands the desire for this process to move forward quickly, and that it would likely take at least 
a couple of months. He said that we are currently talking about the general policy approach, but there are 
many details that need to be ironed out as it related to “residents.” Councillor Simmons concurred that it 
would be a good idea to have the CDD come back and present this to the Housing Committee at least one 
more time prior to finalizing it.  
 
Councillor McGovern made a motion to close Public Comment.  
 
The roll was called and resulted as follows: 
 
YEAS: 

Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor 
McGovern and Councillor Zondervan

and Public Comment was closed.  
 
Councillor McGovern asked Mr. Cotter to discuss Slide #3, “Number of Applicants.” He asked, of the 
2,322 applicants who are classified as non-resident/non-worker, if we know how many formerly resided 
in Cambridge. Mr. Cotter replied that there is no way to know that, as it is not criteria included in our 
applications. Councillor McGovern said that to get a true sense of the list, in terms of which applicants 
have Cambridge ties, his preference would be to see someone who formerly lived in Cambridge and had 
to move out because of rising rents now have the ability to come back to Cambridge. Regarding the list 
that has the breakdown by unit – which is based on the total of 3,243 applicants – Councillor McGovern 
asked if we know how many of the 921 Cambridge applicants want a 1 bedroom, or a 2 bedroom? Mr. 
Cotter said that we know for the 683 applicants – of those, we have roughly 100 applicants in the 1 
bedroom pool, with the balance evenly split between the 2 and 3 bedroom pool. Councillor McGovern 
said that this is important, because this makes it look like the majority of applicants want a 1 or 2 
bedroom, but if just broken down by Cambridge residents, that may not actually be the case. Mr. Cotter 
responded by saying that in some ways, what’s more readily available can actually drive the applicants, 
using the example that we know 3 bedroom units in this program are rare, and thus we do not see as many 
people applying for 3 bedroom units (because many would-be applicants realize how challenging it would 
be to obtain a 3 bedroom unit and therefore they do not apply for the program).  
 
Councillor McGovern said that, for the Cambridge residents out of that pool of 683 applicants, 100 are 
waiting for a 1 bedroom and the rest are waiting for either a 2 bedroom or a 3 bedroom, and that is a 
different breakdown than what is shown on Slide 3. Councillor McGovern said that on this slide, it looks 
like most applicants are waiting for 1 bedroom units. Mr. Cotter said that this reflects the fact that the 
program is able to serve 1 bedroom applicants more quickly, and we don’t typically get to the non-
Cambridge residents. He said that the program sees the most unmet demand in family sized units. 
Councillor McGovern said that he really wants to prioritize the program for people who are in Cambridge

and have been here, as opposed to applicants with no previous ties to Cambridge and who may never have 
set foot in Cambridge.  
 
In regards to the emergency designation based around homelessness, Councillor McGovern has had to say 
to people who are unhoused and are couch surfing that they must spend a couple nights in a shelter so 
they can qualify as being homeless. He said that it is awful to tell someone that this is what they must do. 
He asked if we have thought about the couch-surfing issue, and is there a way to include those people as 
emergency homeless applicants? Mr. Cotter said that as we think about changes and developing more 
details, the Trust has talked about trying to be more expansive in terms of how homeless applicants are 
looked at. He said that the concern is that it becomes an easy threshold to meet, if we simply take people 
at their word that they’ve been couch surfing, and then everyone now meets this emergency criteria. He 
said that the Trust has talked about looking at expanding the types of resources that they rely on to 
confirm that someone is homeless, such as looking at if they’re working with a service provider, or with a 
social worker.  
 
Councillor McGovern said that he does still worry about the “cliff effect” where someone living in an 
Inclusionary unit has the opportunity to get a raise at work, and if they accept the raise they make just 
enough money to now be just over income, and they no longer qualify for the Inclusionary Housing 
program, but they don’t make enough money to rent a non-subsidized unit, nor enough to buy a unit. He 
asked if there is any way to address that issue, and is it as big an issue as he believes it is. Mr. Cotter said 
that the CDD does see this from time to time, but it is not an overwhelming issue to the extent that it is 
brought to the CDD’s attention. He said that for the home ownership program, there is no ceiling in terms 
of income eligibility once a person has signed on to the program and has purchased a unit. In terms of the 
Inclusionary Rental program, he said that there is a built in cushion in the ordinance for a tenant to remain 
eligible, and to the extent that an Inclusionary tenant’s income extends over 100 percent AMI, which has 
happened on occasion, then CDD works with those people to look at their options, and they have had 
success on a case-by-case basis. Councillor McGovern said that it is important to let people know about 
this, as there may be many cases where it doesn’t reach the attention of the CDD because tenants facing 
that raise that places them just above the income threshold ultimately decide not to take the job, for fear of 
jeopardizing their housing.  
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that, in terms of feedback, he agreed with Councillor McGovern’s 
points in needing to expand how we define homelessness and the documentation that is accepted. He said 
that we must explore giving additional weight to emergency housing needs. He said that we must prevent 
more people from getting priced out of Cambridge. We should also make sure we are increasing 
information to applicants and current participants, and we also need to increase the information to 
applicants about income changes they may experience during their wait. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked how the CDD looks at preferences from other affordable housing 
providers in Cambridge, and how changing the Inclusionary preferences can be done to possibly meet the 
needs that are not being met by those other housing providers. For example, he cited that military veterans 
are given the same weighted preference at the Cambridge Housing Authority whether they come from 
Cambridge or whether they applied from out of state; if the veterans preference is already being addressed 
by the CHA, he asked if there might be other preferences that we could be addressing here. Mr. Cotter 
confirmed that some of the emergency criteria is more in line with what the CHA has in their criteria, but 
the CDD has kept some things that CHA does not have. He said the big difference is the preference for 
families with children, and this is not a typical preference that is seen. Mr. Cotter said that, by and large, 
our preference system is about as complex as one will find; in the CHA, you either get local preference or 
you don’t, but in the Inclusionary program there is a graduated approach that is pretty complicated. 
 

Packet Pg. 250

7.1

Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked if there is a way to have a preference for people that grew up in 
affordable housing. Mr. Cotter responded that it is something that has been discussed. He said that most 
residency preferences are either live in or work in the community. He said that moving away from this 
could begin to create questions of fair housing. The advice the CDD has had is to not have preferences 
that require some duration of time, or time limited preference, or something that looks back very far into a 
person’s housing history. He said that the CDD is now looking to include provisions that would include 
former residents. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that he would like to think about changes where, if you have a family 
member or friend that you can stay with, but if you grew up in affordable housing and cannot go back to 
your family, it should be addressed. He said that he would be happy to follow up on this thread at a later 
time.  
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that this is a complex problem, and we clearly have a huge need for 
emergency housing. He stated that one of the things that he is seeing are cases where someone who was a 
Cambridge resident 4-5 years ago is now homeless, and how do we better address the needs of these 
people. Mr. Cotter said that in cases of someone who is homeless and whose last permanent address was 
in Cambridge, they would get the benefit of the preference. Councilor Zondervan said that he would 
appreciate an early look at some of the more detailed definitions of “resident” and of “homeless” that 
CDD comes up with. In terms of the point system for emergency housing, Councilor Zondervan said that 
he appreciates the effort into looking into this. He asked if it reasonable to try to increase the weight of 
the homeless preference, in some way. Mr. Cotter responded that the CDD is happy to get the feedback 
on the weighing of the various points, and they want to hear from the City Council on what the priorities 
were. In terms of emergency housing, they have tried to allow the emergency need to surpass the 
preference for veterans and families with children. He said that the question is more about the residency. 
With applicants that are homeless, he said that they try to look at the whole picture. Councillor Zondervan 
said that he appreciates the difficulty of the challenge.  
 
With regards to better serving those with Cambridge ties who are currently homeless, Councillor 
Zondervan mused that there may be a way to better align the CDD’s criteria with the criteria utilized by 
the local shelters to confirm someone as being a Cambridge resident.  
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that there are people in emergency situations that could be affected by potential 
changes. Regarding the list that was shown by Mr. Cotter, she said it would be helpful to have it broken 
out by bedroom type and by Cambridge residents versus non-residents. In terms of recently displaced 
former residents, she asked what documentation is going to be needed? Mr. Cotter said that they try to be 
flexible, and they might look at a past lease, a past utility bill, and a range of other options. Vice Mayor 
Mallon asked if the CDD had any idea what additional documentation may be considered in proving 
residency. Mr. Cotter said that they are in the process of discussing how they might expand residency 
documentation, and they are trying to give people more choices in documentation. He said that they might 
consider weighting different documents to provide greater flexibility. He said that CDD has been looking 
to other housing programs and other cities to look at different models, and this is still being developed. 
Vice Mayor Mallon thanked Mr. Cotter for this work so far, and she looks forward to the next part of this 
process.  
 
Mayor Siddiqui said that this has come a long way since June of 2019, and many suggestions of the City 
Council have been incorporated. She said that, with regards to documentation to homelessness, many 
families who are couch surfing are in touch with City departments, such as the Mayor’s Office or the 
Multi Service Center, and she suggests that perhaps we broaden the scope to include people that have 
worked been working with City departments or agencies as proof of homelessness.

Councillor Simmons asked Mr. Cotter, regarding Slide 7: when the CDD is looking at former residents 
who met residency requirements at time of application, are we speaking to those who hold a mobile 
voucher? Mr. Cotter said yes and no. He said that the CDD had recommended, in the last meeting, to 
preserve residency status of any applicant in the program as long as they have an active application. This 
means that if someone lived in Cambridge when they applied to the program, they then are forced out of 
the City, and then their name reaches to the top of the list, they will be still be treated as a Cambridge 
resident because they were a resident at the time of applying. Mr. Cotter said that this is the change that 
CDD thinks will most dramatically affect resident applicants. He said that the second piece involves 
Cambridge residents who are issued a voucher, cannot find a unit in Cambridge, and secure a unit outside 
the City in order to keep their voucher active. Mr. Cotter that the new change being recommended is that 
these people, who have been displaced from Cambridge, would be able to apply for an Inclusionary Unit 
for up to one year after leaving Cambridge and they will still be treated as Cambridge residents, and this 
will be a big boost to giving these people the opportunity to move back to the City.  
 
Councillor Simmons said that she was happy to see the new veteran status. In terms of emergency need, 
she asked where domestic violence survivors fall in these criteria. Mr. Cotter said that on page 10, victims 
of domestic violence are listed. He said that the CDD wants to have the appropriate definitions in place, 
but they have allowed some flexibility for applicants to meet the criteria.  
 
Regarding time-limited transitional housing, Councillor Simmons asked if this housing wouldn’t 
necessarily have to be in Cambridge. Mr. Cotter said that someone living outside of Cambridge would get 
that preference, but would not necessarily get the residency preference. He said that CDD would look at 
the address of the person prior to entering transitional housing. Councillor Simmons said that some 
victims of domestic violence have their address embargoed for safety purposes, and we would not want 
this to be an impediment to their getting housed. Mr. Cotter said that this is something that can be looked 
at when planning out how to establish criteria for that preference.  
 
Councillor Simmons then asked Mike Johnston or Maura Pensak for comments. 
 
Maura Pensak stated that she does not have anything to add, but that she appreciates the work of CDD 
and she appreciates expanding emergency and residency requirements, and recognizing the need of folks 
with children over the age of six having high priority. She looks forward to the next steps of this process.  
 
Mike Johnston stated that Mr. Cotter and his staff have done a great job, he thinks this is a great piece of 
work, and he looks forward to seeing it put in place. 
 
Councillor Simmons thanked Mr. Cotter and his staff, she said that this has been a long time getting to 
this place and she wants this issue to be expedited. She invited the Housing Committee members to put 
into writing any additional questions that they may have and she will have this material forwarded to Mr. 
Cotter.  
 
Councillor Simmons summarized her understanding that Mr. Cotter will now take recommendations and 
thoughts from the Housing Committee and work to update the guidelines, there will then be a 30 day 
period of Public Comment, then this will be brought back to the Housing Committee. She said that having 
a written timeline submitted to the committee would be helpful. Mr. Cotter confirmed that the next steps 
are to take what has been presented tonight and develop draft standards and procedures. He said he will 
share that with the City Council, and the schedule will include a 30 day public review comment process. 
He said that we will want to comply with the ordinance, and this will be mapped out. Councillor 
Simmons asked that Mr. Cotter get a timeline for the standards and procedures and then sit with the 
Housing Committee Co-Chairs to ensure that it fits with the trajectory. She said she would like to receive 

Packet Pg. 252

7.1

a timeline and then work through and get back to the committee, and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
concurred.  
 
Councillor Simmons thanked the Committee, she said she is excited to move the process forward, and she 
is committed to working as expeditiously as possible to move this along.  
 
Councillor Simmons and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler thanked all those present for their attendance. 
 
On a motion by Vice Mayor Mallon to adjourn the hearing, the roll was called and resulted as follows:

Public Safety Committee will conduct a public hearing on the Surveillance Technology Impact 
Reports and annual reports on ShotSpotter, BRIC, and COPLINK, and other outstanding 
surveillance annual reports, time permitting 
 
Councillor Zondervan called the meeting to order. He opened the floor to a presentation from the 
Cambridge Police Department (CPD) on Shotspotter. 
 
Police Commissioner Bard explained that Shotspotter is a gunshot detection system designed to be an 
ever vigilant reporting ear. He stated that across the country residents have become so immune to this 
type of gunshot that incidents go unreported and that criminals count on this indifference and become 
emboldened in such environments. He explained that gunshot detection systems provide a perpetual 
reporting to local law enforcement of these incidents and that he provided a lengthy diagram as to how the 
actual technology works. He explained that: the technology consists of 12 microphones condensed into a 
1.1 square mile area and that CPD has no listening capabilities. The company’s headquarters are in 
California. When gunshots occur, they are picked up by microphones, analyzed by algorithm, and the 
numerical address is sent to the local police department, along with a brief audio clip of the gunshot. 
In response to a question by Councillor Zondervan, the Commissioner stated that after receiving an alert 
from ShotSpotter, ECC emergency communications dispatches patrol units, and they go to the numerical 
address and attempt to locate the source of gunfire or gunshot victims. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about the availability of any data on how often 
police are able to recover evidence of actual gunfire, how often gunshot victims are encountered,  and 
how often shooters were apprehend as a result of ShotSpotter activation, the Commissioner stated that 
they can provide that evidence and that they frequently recover evidence of a shooting after a ShotSpotter 
alert. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked where ShotSpotter is deployed in Cambridge and if shots can be 
detected from anywhere in Cambridge, or only if they're in a certain section of a neighborhood or part of 
the city. The Commissioner replied that prior to the installation of the system, a detailed analysis was 
done as to the areas of where gunshots were most concentrated.  Based on that analysis, the microphones 
were placed in a 1.1 square mile radius area. He said that he has not publicly stated the exact locations of 
the microphones for security reasons.

7.2

October 7, 2020 

Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked about the analysis and how many gunshots led to it being deployed in 
this area? The Commissioner responded that the number has remained largely the same and that there has 
been no statistical reason to ask for relocation of the equipment and that he wasn't a member of the 
(Police) department at the time of (ShotSpotter’s) installation. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked about false positives with ShotSpotter in Cambridge. Commissioner  
Bard replied that there are occasions where heavy loading equipment during construction will trigger an 
alert, and certain heavy categories of fireworks also will trigger an alert, but that it's a very small 
percentage of the time that (Shotspotter) generates a false alert. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that while the Commissioner did not want to disclose the exact locations of 
the microphones, it's well known that Shotspotter is installed in the Port neighborhood in Cambridge and 
he asked why we deployed that technology only in that particular neighborhood? Commissioner Bard 
responded that it was based on an analysis of where gunshots were most prevalent in the city. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Zondervan, Commissioner Bard stated that the Port area 
continues to be where the most persistent episodes of gunfire occurred, but that didn’t necessarily mean 
that Shotspotter is not effective because there are times when gunshots would have gone undetected if not 
for the presence of the ShotSpotter technology. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Mallon, Commissioner Bard stated that Shotspotter is not meant 
to be a deterrent but a tool to assist law enforcement in understanding the prevalence of gunfire.  He 
added that he believed that some activists had concerns about ShotSpotter recording conversations.  He 
stated that it is not unreasonable at all to expect that when an incident of gunfire occurs, and that 
Shotspotter begins recording, that it would also pick up hollering and other noises that can also be made 
at the same time that the gunfire occurs. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked about how many shots that ShotSpotter did not detect.  He stated that 
Fall River, Massachusetts stopped using it because it missed about 50% of the shots fired. Commissioner 
Bard stated that he was not aware of any instances in Cambridge when ShotSpotter did not detect 
gunshots that it would have been expected to detect. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that ShotSpotter raises racial equity and privacy concerns. He stated that 
Shotspotter is not a tool to proactively reduce crime, it merely identifies gunshots. In terms of the 
surveillance, he mentioned a case in New Bedford where some of the snippets of conversation that were 
picked up, were ultimately used as part of the conviction.  
 
Commissioner Bard responded that individuals discharging a firearm in a public way is a grave public 
safety concern and as far as he is aware Shotspotter is not capable of listening into homes.  
 
In response to questions from Councillor McGovern, Commissioner Bard stated that Shotspotter allowed 
the Police Department to detect gun shots that might otherwise go undetected.  He stated that some 
ShotSpotter responses lead to the police finding an injured person.  Commissioner Bard stated that 
ShotSpotter identifies the number of shots fired. 
 
Councillor McGovern stated he was interested in receiving data about the threshold number of gun shots 
to then decide to install ShotSpotter in a neighborhood. 
 
Saul Tannenbaum, 16 Cottage Street, expressed concern about Shotspotter.  He stated that the system is a 
failure based on the original promises.

Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Chair - Councillor Zondervan 
 
 
Commissioner Bard stated that the police department does conduct test firing to ensure that the system 
works and that the neighborhood is notified of these events.  He stated that Cambridge is not immune to 
gun violence.  In 2018, the Council ordered the police department to form a task force because of the 
gunfire. He stated that there are many instances of gunfire that the police department only became aware 
of because of Shotspotter. 
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about deploying Shotspotter citywide, Commissioner 
Bard stated that he did not believe that there would be widespread support for citywide deployment of 
Shotspotter. He stated that he was not opposed to citywide deployment, but he was not sure that there has 
been a need to cover the entire city.  
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about the purpose of the conversation about 
Shotspotter, Councillor Zondervan stated that the committee was examining the need and usefulness of 
the Shotspotter technology.  He stated that the committee could vote to approve the STIR or recommend 
that the Police Department stop using Shotspotter. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that the committee should specifically ask for the data that it is interested in 
reviewing. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone about facts regarding the efficacy of Shotspotter, 
Councillor Zondervan stated that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 10,000 ShotSpotter alerts translated in to 
roughly 170 arrests, but in San Francisco, Shot spotter alerts translated into only two arrests and it is 
unclear how ShotSpotter has affected Chicago's clearance rate.  
 
Councillor Carlone stated that he understands that Shotspotter can report gunshots that might otherwise 
go unreported. He stated that he is not opposed to deploying the technology citywide. He stated that he 
would like to receive input from the ACLU at some point. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that he would like to have more data about this technology’s 
effectiveness. He recognized the potential privacy concerns raised by this data. He wanted to know how 
specific the location data is for where a gunshot occurred as reported by Shotspotter.   
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he believed that the Commissioner stated that Shotspotter is not meant 
to be a crime deterrent.  It is meant to reduce police response times, to help with investigations and 
rendering aid to injured persons.  He encouraged the committee to specifically ask for data that the 
committee is interested in reviewing.   
 
In response to a request by Councillor Zondervan, James Mulcahy, Legal Advisor to the Police 
Department explained the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC) omega dashboard to the 
committee.  He stated that the BRIC is a crime intelligence platform that allows participating agencies to 
analyze what types of crimes are occurring and where they are occurring.  The police department submits 
certain incident and arrest reports to the platform. The police department does not submit confidential

information, which includes domestic violence, juvenile and sexual assault victim information. He 
explained that the Omega dashboard allows participating agencies to plot where incidents were occurring 
geographically. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan if the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
Agency (ICE) has access to this information Attorney Mulcahy stated he did not know and that access is 
determined by the BRIC. 
 
In response to a question by Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about the agencies comprising the BRIC,  
Commissioner Bard stated that as far as he knew the members consisted of the Metropolitan Boston 
Transit Authority, the city of Boston, other Transportation Agencies, Metro fire, Port Authority, and other 
cities and agencies. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Attorney Mulcahy stated that the department 
will contact the BRIC to find out who is allowed to access the Omega dashboard. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about the specificity of BRIC data, 
Commissioner Bard stated that certain identifying information is uploaded but some information is 
redacted. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler expressed concern about federal immigration agencies having access to 
BRIC data. 
 
Councillor Mallon confirmed with Commissioner Bard that the Omega dashboard has a minimal impact 
on privacy. He stated that the dashboard analyzes, and maps incidents reported by participating agencies.  
This allows different jurisdictions to work together to solve crimes. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about analysis performed by the Omega Dashboard, 
Attorney Mulcahy explained that the dashboard allowed users to break-down information by type, 
location and time. 
 
Commissioner Bard and Councillor Zondervan had a discussion about whether the analysis performed by 
users of the dashboard is new information that can be submitted to BRIC through the dashboard.Attorney 
Mulcahy explained that users run queries that at not necessarily reports and that the results of those 
queries are not re-uploaded to the system. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about surveillance technology acquired by the 
BRIC, Attorney Mulcahy explained that there is a difference between the Omega Dashboard, which is a 
technology used by the Department and the BRIC which is an entity separate from Cambridge.  
Councillor Zondervan stated that he was interested in the type of surveillance data utilized by the police 
department through its participation in the BRIC. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler and Vice -Mayor Mallon, Attorney Mulcahy 
and Commissioner Bard explained that the BRIC pulls data directly from the departments records 
management system, limited by certain predetermined rules and protecting confidentiality as explained 
earlier. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Mulcahy stated that the police department does 
not have a gang database.

At the request of Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Mulcahy provided an overview of COPLINK.  He explained 
that COPLINK operated much the same way as BRIC, except that COPLINK is a statewide database.  
Participating agencies submit incident or arrest data, motor vehicle crash data or citation data to 
COPLINK. Similarly, to BRIC, COPLINK has a feature that allows users to parse data by location, type 
and time to find patterns. This data has been helpful when determining when to issue firearm licenses to 
individuals requesting them. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Commissioner Bard stated that COPLINK is 
provided by a private entity. Mr. Mulcahy stated that COPLINK works with public safety agencies 
nationwide, but Cambridge only accesses data provided by agencies in Massachusetts. The Commissioner 
did not know if the data was available to federal agencies. He further stated that the service is provided 
through a federal agency. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he would like information about COPLINK’s data retention policy. 
 
Councillor Mallon stated that she did have concerns about the links between COPLINK and federal 
immigrations agencies.  She stated that she would like to have a larger conversation about this with the 
ACLU.  Commissioner Bard stated the police department shares the concerns about for the immigrant 
community and would not knowingly put them in jeopardy. Councillor Carlone shared those concerns. 
 
Councillor Zondervan moved to send the following policy order to the city council: 
 
“The City Manager and Police Department are hereby requested to provide data on Shotspotter, BRIC and 
Coplink to the City Council including: Shotspotter (broken down by year): number of gunshots reported 
through ShotSpotter, average response time, resulting arrests, resulting gunshot victims treated, number 
of gunshots reported by people across the city, number of gunshots reported by people in the ShotSpotter 
area, gunshots reported by people but not by ShotSpotter in the ShotSpotter area, data retention policies. 
BRIC: Federal agencies that have access to BRIC information, data retention policies; COPLINK: Federal 
agencies that have access to COPLINK information, data retention policies; and any other information 
that may be deemed helpful and informative to the Council in executing its duties with regard to the 
Surveillance Ordinance.” 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler moved to amend the proposed policy order to add:  Data on difference 
in response times between shots reported by Shotspotter and shots reported by humans and data on 
location pinpoint accuracy.

Cambridge City Council 

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor 

December 10, 2020 

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
The Cambridge Public Schools began a temporary shift to remote learning for all students on Thursday, 
December 10th, amid rising COVID-19 cases, after having surpassed two of the three thresholds we set in 
partnership with our scientific advisors. This shift to remote learning will continue for at least one week 
(until December 16th) as two or more of the metrics must remain below their thresholds for 7 consecutive 
days in order for in-person learning to resume. All reopening decisions based on the metrics will be made 
in consultation with the Cambridge Public Health Department. While school buildings, including central 
offices, will be closed to students, they will remain open for staff and for those who need to pick up supplies. 
Remote lunch pickups will continue at 12:00 PM at each school and families are welcome to pick up lunch 
at any school building. 
 
The School Committee’s next Regular Meeting will be on Tuesday, December 15th at 6:00 PM. I want to 
highlight that we will be voting on the  approval of CRLS’s Winter Sports Season for Swimming, Diving, 
and Basketball and that I have submitted a motion (#20-309) with Members Fantini and Wilson to request 
a report on our Dual Enrollment program as we plan to build out our own Early College program at CRLS. 
I look forward to the progress we will make on this front in the coming months. 
 
On Saturday, December 12th, I am co-hosting a Clothing Drive outside CRLS from 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM 
with the Thrifting Project, one of our Glocal Challenge teams this year. All donations will be benefitting 
The Spot.  
 
If families are not already receiving text message updates from CPS, they are able to opt into the service 
by sending “Y” or “Yes” to 67587 to be alerted about important announcements, snow days, surveys, and 
other important updates. The most recent updates from CPS include the launching of a new family feedback 
survey that will be open until December 17th, as well as the new Family Feedback Sessions, which began 
on Tuesday, December 8th. The Family Feedback Sessions will be held through Thursday, December 17th 
and are hosted by Robin Harris, the CPS Director of Family Engagement, and are accessible via Zoom at 
this link. Please click this link for the full schedule.
