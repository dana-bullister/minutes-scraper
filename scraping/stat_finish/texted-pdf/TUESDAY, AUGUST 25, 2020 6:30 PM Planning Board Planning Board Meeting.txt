          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good evening and 

welcome to the August 25, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge 

Planning Board.  My name is Catherine Preston Connolly and I 

am the Chair.  This meeting is being held remotely, due to 

the statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charlie Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, which was 

amended on July 30, 2020.  

          This meeting is being video and audio recorded, 

and is being streamed live on the City of Cambridge online 

meeting portal and on cable television Channel 22, within

proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

Members of the public will be kept on mute until it is time 

for public comment, and I will give instructions for public 

comment at that time, and you can also find instructions on 

the city's webpage for remote Planning Board meetings.  

     I will start by asking the Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, this is Jeff Roberts 

from Community Development.  Just do a quick roll call.   

          Louis Bacci, are you present and is the meeting

        CONSTANTINE ALEXANDER:  So the first item on our 

agenda tonight is an update from the Community Development 

Department.  Please also introduce any Staff present at the 

meeting.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks to the Chair.  This is Jeff 

Roberts again, Director of Zoning and Development in the 

Community Development Department.  Also at the meeting, as 

always on my team working the slides is Swaathi Joseph.  

Also in the Community Development Department we have Khalil 

Mogassabi, the Deputy Director and Chief Planner.  We have 

Erik Thorkildsen, Urban Designer with Community Development.   

          From the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department we have Joseph Barr and Adam Shulman are present;  

and we also have with the Department of Public Works Kathy 

Watkins and Cara Felice (phonetic); and that is it for City 

Staff that are present.

          Just shifting to a quick update, today we have one 

main item of business.  It's a continued hearing from back 

in the before times. 

          And after tonight's meeting there is no meeting 

next week, it's primary Election Day -- please vote if you 

havenâ€™t already.   

          And we pick up meetings again on September 8, when 

we have a public hearing on a cannabis retail store proposal 

at 200 Monsignor O'Brien Highway, followed by a hearing on a 

zoning petition in the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest Overlay 

District.  This is similar to a petition that the Planning 

Board heard last year and had several comments on.  This is 

a revised version of that petition. 

          On September 15, we have a public hearing on 

another zoning petition, which is called the "Canal District 

Kendall PUD Zoning District." It's a petition by BioMed 

Realty. 

          And on September 22, we have another scheduled 

public hearing on the zoning petition.  This one is called 

the, "Francis Donovan et al. Zoning Petition," which 

proposes some amendments to Residence A1 and A2 zoning 

districts.   

8

          We are at this point anticipating that September 

29 would be a week off.  We're not scheduling any hearings 

at this time, and we'll pick up meetings with some 

additional public hearings in October, which I'll tell you 

more about when we get there. 

          And then the one last schedule item, tomorrow 

August 26 the Ordinance Committee is having its hearing on 

the Fossil Fuel Zoning Petition.  The Planning Board heard 

that and gave a positive recommendation last week. 

          At this point, I have not received a schedule for 

hearings on the three zoning petitions that I mentioned that 

will be heard in September, but when I know more about that, 

I'll let you know.  I'll turn it back over to the Chair now.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Do any 

Board members have questions for Jeff?     

          [Pause] Okay.   

                    * * * * *  

(6:37 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Louis J. Bacci, Mary T. Flynn, Hugh     

                  Russell, Tom Sieniewicz

will move on to the next item on the agenda, which is a 

continued public hearing on Planning Board Special Permit, 

case PB #359, an application by The Davis Companies to 

construct a new building with 144,175 square feet of gross 

floor area for technical office use.   

          And as usual, we will begin with CDD Staff 

summarizing procedurally why this is before us. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Chair -- Jeff 

Roberts again, real quick.   

          This is a continuation of a case first heard on 

Feb 25, 2020.  It is seeking a project review, special 

permit for construction of greater than 50,000 square feet, 

and it's also seeking special permits for various 

modifications allowed under the Alewife Overlay Districts. 

          And the Board's action on this case is to grant or 

deny the requested special permits.  The criteria for 

granting those special permits have been provided to the 

Board.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Okay.  The 

lead presenter for the proponent is James Rafferty.  Before 

we start, let the records show that there are only six 

Planning Board members present for this hearing, and an 

affirmative vote of five members will be necessary to grant 

the special permit. 

          Is the applicant prepared to proceed with six 

10

          CHRIS CHANDOR:  This is Chris Chandor for The 

Davis Companies.  I hope Jim's out there somewhere, but yes, 

members?    

we are.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, I can see Jim, 

but I do not hear him.  Jim, can you unmute yourself and 

let's see if we have audio for you?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Okay.  I'm sorry, I thought I was 

unmuted -- the Board -- I know one of the appealing aspects 

of the meeting this way is the Chair has a mute button.   

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Perhaps that had already been 

employed by you, Madam Chair.  It was on my end, so.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So just 

to reiterate, you're prepared to proceed with just six 

members?    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you.  We had been earlier 

informed that there were six members, and the applicant is 

prepared to go forward with six members.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Okay, 

thank you.  So if you could start by introducing the project 

team and then begin your presentation.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you.  Good evening, Madam 

Chair and members of the Board.  My name is James Rafferty.  

I used to see a lot more of you.  Today, I note, is six 

months since the last time this matter was before the Board, 

but I'm an attorney with offices located at 907 

Massachusetts Avenue, and I represent The Davis Companies, 

the applicant of this case. 

          Present tonight is Brian Fallon, The President of 

The Davis Companies; Chris Leary (phonetic), a Vice-

President -- excuse me, Chris Chandor, C-h-a-n-d-o-r, he's a 

Vice-President of the company.  Gretchen McGill is also 

present from the Davis Companies, and she is also a Vice-

          The project team, the architectural team is 

Jacobs.  Tonight, Chris Leary and Brian Cook from Jacobs are 

          And the traffic engineer from BHB is Lorenzo 

Dantas, D-a-n-t-a-s, and Mr. Dantas is also present to 

President.

          So our goal tonight is to take a few minutes and 

refresh your memory about who we are and why we are here.  

The Staff memo from CDD, as usual, does a very effective job 

in identifying the criteria in which we're seeking to obtain 

the special permits needed to build this structure.   

          I can tell you that we have been able to spend a 

great deal of time with City Staff, both the Design Staff at 

CDD as well as the Traffic and Parking Staff, working out 

issues that were unresolved from the last hearing.  We do 

have the benefit of reviewing the videotape, and of course 

being able to examine our notes. 

          So tonight's presentation is organized around 

identifying those issues that the Board asked us to look at 

and showing our responses to them.  All of these changes 

have occurred with active engagement with CDD. 

          And in the case of the traffic Department 

similarly, we reached consensus on a number of issues around 

the parking supply that we'll be able to share with you. 

          Tonight is really, we believe, an opportunity for 

this project to become the -- really setting the template 

for what development might look like or should look like in 

this new Alewife Overlay District-1.  And I say that 

13

because, as the Board is aware, the district is going 

through some changes.   

          The Envision Alewife plan, which we are guided by 

in our decision-making and design decisions, has not yet 

been incorporated into the zoning ordinance.  So we've been 

treading a fine line between the Concord Avenue study 

guidelines that are embodied in the ordinance and what we're 

trying to achieve here from a design perspective. 

          You may not recall, but six months ago as we were 

leaving, members went out of their way to compliment the 

team for what they had done.  And it's my job, of course, as 

their advocate, to remind you how pleased you were with this 

project and the accolades you gave all of the efforts here 

to create this building. 

          Credit also goes to the staff, because the 

building -candidly- didn't look this good when we started.  

It was a building more typical of what you see out in the 

Smith Place area today.  It was a building surrounded by 

surface parking, and it was a reasonable attempt to build a 

modest, straightforward building. 

          The applicant here has really demonstrated a 

commitment to this district in terms of the capital it's 

14

prepared to invest.  

          And as the months have gone on, and the economic 

challenges have become even more than we might have 

anticipated, there has been some concern on the part of the 

applicant that the marketplace needs to be accepting of this 

building.  This is very much a pioneer building. 

          And because The Davis Companies owns a significant 

number of buildings in this area -- directly across the 

street for instance, at 10 Wilson Road, Board members have 

had an opportunity to go out to the site recently -- you'll 

see that there's significant site improvements going on 

there, including the removal of 10 parking spaces, the 

introduction of green space, and a cafÃ© that will provide a 

dining option other than Burger King on this street. 

          And it's that type of amenity space that everyone 

recognizes will contribute to what's hoped for here in terms 

of creating an active street light.   

          So Davis is excited about the prospect of doing 

the building, eager to get started, and they're happy this 

evening to have Mr. Leary walk you through the changes that 

have been made to the building, based largely on comments we 

heard from the Planning Board.

          So Chris, I hope you're plugged in here?   

          CHRIS LEARY:  I am, Jim.  Thank you for that 

introduction.  This is Chris Leary up here in this box.  I 

am a Principal Vice-President at Jacobs, and we're the 

architects designing the building we're presenting here 

tonight at 75 109 Smith Place.  As Jim mentioned, my 

colleague, Brian Cook, is also here as well.  He may join 

in. 

          Starting with the slide before you, we actually 

have 59 slides in the deck tonight, but fear not, we will go 

through this overview in about 10 minutes.   

          We have a lot of detail here if there's questions 

and we want to go back or just as evidence of the amount of 

investigation thatâ€™s gone on over the past few months, and 

hopefully you looked at some of it in a preread. 

          So the goal for the presentation here tonight is 

the agenda that's on the screen.  I'll give a quick 

overview, because as Jim said it has been six months since 

we were before the Board. When we left, we thought we'd be 

back in a few weeks, and it's been a little while.   

          And then three major improvements to the project 

since we last presented.  The first is a reduction in the 

16

surface parking area, and an increase in permeable green 

open space. 

          The second thing we want to talk about tonight is 

just further explanation of the phasing -- the future 

planning for the streetscape. 

          And then the third issue are refinements and 

improvements to the building design that resulted from our 

last conversation.   

          So if we could advance the slide?  I'll go through 

these next few slides rather quickly.  Advance one more, 

please?        

          Just as a reminder -- that's fine, we can stop 

here -- this is a site plan of the project today in the 

Alewife Overlay District, just up past Concord Ave, which 

would be -- you know, just below this image on the screen.  

          And if you could click to the next one, this 

site's currently occupied by three -- you could count them; 

they're small structures, industrial structures, and we are 

assembling this property.   

          Give that one more click.  (And again, these were 

all presented at the last hearing, so this is here for 

refreshing.)

          What you see here in this screen as a reminder is 

a site plan, and that is our building to the left.  And what 

you see with these purple lines are the Envision the Future 

street alignments for Fawcett, for Smith Place, and for 

Wilson Road and Adley Road.    

          And a big part of the project, if you remember 

from our last presentation, was how the building anticipates 

this future planning and the future alignment.   

          And as Jim mentioned in the introduction, we find 

ourselves designing a building that will be put to use 

today, but anticipating a lot of changes to come in the 

neighborhood in the future. That was a big part of our last 

presentation, and it hasn't changed other than some 

refinements that you'll see here. 

          So if you could give that one more click, please?  

And again, this is at a more detailed -- zoom in again -- 

you see the purple lines representing the future street 

alignments and how our building sits between those 

alignments here today.   

          The red lines represent the center liens of the 

streets, and the purple lines represent the width of the 

assemblage of elements that make up those streets.

          Give that one more click, please? 

          Okay, so the first issue that I mentioned in the 

introduction was the reduction of surface parking.   

          And if you could give that one more click.  What 

you're seeing on this slide here on the screen is an overlay 

of the site plan that we presented at the last hearing. And 

in red is the area of the parking that we have now re 

planned. 

          And if you'll give that one more click, please?  

What you see here on this slide by comparison is a reduction 

and a redesign of the surface parking and service access, so 

that we now have eight less parking spaces of grade, but 

most significantly have this 400,000-500,000 square feet 

green permeable open space to the top left. 

          We've envisioned that space as a mix of planting 

and hardscape areas that could be used for anything from 

dining to activities for the folks in the building and the 

public. 

          So that was the first issue that we addressed, and 

in the next few slides there's -- again, not new information 

here, but just how this overlays with previously presented 

information, how we are still working with our carshare

          In the blue and red you see how passenger vehicles 

enter the site and turn into the parking garage. 

          And again, this hasnâ€™t changed other than the 

reconfiguration of the surface parking and the increased 

open space.   

          If you give that one more click?   

          In this slide -- again -- you see the underground 

parking garage.  There are electrical vehicle charging 

stations, more HOV -- High Occupancy Vehicle -- parking 

spaces set aside in the garage.  You can give that one more 

click, please.  

          This plan here -- again, largely similar to last 

time -- shows how cyclists would access the site off of 

Smith Place via this five-foot wide bike path.   

          That bike path is roughly in the alignment of 

where the future sidewalk will be -- you can see the future 

street trees around the back of the building and into the 

indoor bicycle storage room, with lockers and showers for 

bicycle commuters.   

          And we have 50 long-term bicycle spaces inside the 

building, as well as 10 we'll call transient, short-term

spaces out in front of the building at the sidewalk. 

          And then if you look just to the left, the orange 

-- that is our newly shown Bluebike station that will 

provide the bikeshares to the neighborhood.   

          If you give that one more click?   

          This diagram much the same as last time shows how 

the service deliveries will enter the site and maneuver at 

the back of the building and back into the loading dock and 

then turn out back the way they came in. 

          And then one more click. 

          Thank you.  And just some dimensional information 

here, but that's changed.  So if you give that one more 

click, I think we'll be onto the second issue. 

          So the second issue that I mentioned in the 

introduction was how we've worked with Staff in preparation 

for the Alewife Plan improvements. And there's been a lot of 

conversation about what would like to be done, what can be 

done today, and how anything we do today has to anticipate 

what will happen in the future. 

          If you give that one more click?   

          What we're presenting here on this next slide is a 

culmination of looking at a lot of things you see listed

here on this slide.  We're dealing with current overhead 

utilities and utility poles.  We're dealing with a desired 

alignment of the street and putting the street trees in the 

cycle track. 

          And we're going to talk a little bit about the 

2070 flood conditions, which we didn't explain very well at 

our last presentation. 

          So give that one click forward.  What this site 

plan here shows -- thank you -- is what we're calling, "the 

day one site plan."   

          This plan shows -- and I'll show you the backup 

detail -- the anticipation along Smith place of what we can 

achieve today.  What you see is a cycle track in green, in 

its desired location; street trees, sidewalk and a building 

frontage that is all located, as I showed, at a high level, 

anticipating this future plan. 

          We have learned through this process that the 

utility poles that are out in front of the building must 

remain.  The utility company isn't ready for us to 

underground those poles today.  But when they are 

undergrounded, and the curb is slightly realigned, we'll see 

the final desired alignment along Smith Place.

          If you give that one more click forward, there's a 

number of slides here in the deck that provide some detail.  

          These -- on this slide we see the tree species 

that we are proposing and plant species that we're proposing 

around the property.  If you give one more click, please. 

          The next slide highlights a few pieces of 

information that were asked about before.   

          We're highlighting the existing curb cuts, just to 

demonstrate how we're very much improving the number of curb 

cuts along Smith Place in front of the building, and that 

there are no existing curb cuts along Adley Road, and some 

of the other features that we're working with, particularly 

to the left and right of our site, as we get to the abutting 

properties. 

          One more click, please? 

          There was some discussion -- and Jim, I don't know 

if you want to jump back in here and explain this, you can 

probably explain it better than I can about the front yard 

easement that's illustrated in this slide?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Sure.  So we've talked with both 

DPW and Traffic about an expansion of the public way onto 

private property, and we would follow the typical pattern or

practice of creating an easement on our land for public 

access.   

          And the easements typically describe access to be 

used for purposes as -- commonly used as sidewalks or 

streets, depending on where the dividing line is. 

          So that's a familiar vehicle with the city, and 

one obviously we'd be prepared to provide when the roadway 

got expanded.     

          CHRIS LEARY:  Thanks, Jim.  And I think this is 

also a good example of how we've worked with the current 

zoning and the future plan to have this hardscape in our 

front yard in a way thatâ€™s desired?      

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yes, yeah.     

          CHRIS LEARY:  Okay, so next slide, please?  

There's a lot of detail here, and I'll just quickly -- we'll 

click through these quickly, if we could just keep going.   

          These slides illustrate the detailed planning that 

we went through with staff just looking at all of the 

various components of these building face to building face.  

Right away is the raised dimensions for the sidewalk, the 

elevated sidewalk, the band of trees, the cycle track, the 

curb.

          And again, this demonstrated a great deal of 

detail in plan and cross section how the new building will 

fulfill this plan going forward. 

          We can click through this slide.  And I'm going to 

go quickly through a couple of these.  Again, here's a C-

section showing this same information.  It's Smith Place, 

including that current utility pole that eventually will go 

away and allow that curb to get into its desired alignment. 

          One more click, please? 

          This, again, shows similar information on the side 

streets about the dimensions and building to building cross 

sections that we have preserved there. 

          And one more click, please?   

          Again, a series of cross-sections across the 

building, just demonstrating all of the various dimensions 

that we've committed to.  Give that one more click, please?   

          One slide here, we didn't do a terrific job 

explaining this at the last Planning Board and we thought a 

better graphic would explain how we've considered resiliency 

with regards to possible future flooding. 

          What you see here represented in blue is the high 

waterline, as measured by the 2070 ten-year floodplain at

elevation 22.3.  And then in yellow, slightly higher, would 

be the 100-year floodplain at elevation 22.4.   

          And what we want to demonstrate here with this 

slide is that the entire ground floor of the building is 

above high water.   

          And the garage entrance into the basement parking 

and the transformer pad are up on a naturally high elevation 

end of the site, so they would stay above that water. 

          And the loading dock, which is down a few feet to 

facilitate truck loading, is -- would be protected by a 

deployable barrier, and even if water were to get into the 

loading dock, there will be waterproofing as a backup that 

would keep that floodwater in the bays where the trucks 

would go, and not into the building. 

          Give that one click? 

          The next slide is looking a little bit into the 

future, if/when the streets are all fully fit out. 

          If you give that one more click, please? 

          This slide shows how the site would look in the 

future with the realization of Wilson Road and Fawcett 

Street as they were extended, how that green space would be 

preserved, and how the vehicles would enter the site off of

the newly conceived Fawcett Street, the elevated sidewalks 

that could be around the building on Wilson and Smith Place. 

          And then one more click?   

          This, again, just reinforces the point how we 

looked at this resiliency issue, and in the future even with 

the streets realigned, that corner of the site would remain 

up at higher grade above high water. 

          Okay.  If you'd give that a click, please? 

          So Number 3 on the agenda are the building design 

improvements that were suggested at the last meeting and in 

conversations with Staff.  And I'm going to start off -- if 

you can just click -- by showing photographs of our model.   

I know this would be so much more effective if you could see 

this model.   

          But what you see on the left is the model we 

presented to you at the last hearing, and the model on the 

right -- I'm going to show you some more detailed pictures 

next -- is the new model, which we'd love to share with you 

if we're in person. 

          And through a few more model pictures and some 

renderings, I'm going to try to convey the design 

improvements that we're proposing, if you give that one more

click. 

          This is an imaged -- yeah, of the new model, which 

shows the redesign and articulation of the penthouse, which 

is one of the issues that we worked on. 

          If you look around -- we're actually looking at 

the rear of the building here to the front -- we have 

accentuated and created this entry forecourt, which I'll 

show you in a second.   

          We've refined the articulation of the north and 

south end walls, and we've anticipated the future ground 

floor tenants and entrances.  And this is in addition to the 

site improvements we talked about earlier. 

          So if you give that a click, please?  I'll show 

you a lot of these same issues again.   

          This is a view of the model from closer down at 

street level.  You can see the forecourt at the front of the 

building, and the evolution of the penthouse massing.   

          And we think this really breaks up this faÃ§ade 

into two pieces at a different scale, and really creates 

this public space at the building entrance that's recessed.  

If you remember, our prior proposal had our protruding 

element there.

          Give that one more click, please? 

          There are some plans that are shown here.  I'm 

going to go through these pretty quickly, because I think 

the perspectives are a little more clear, but there's a 

revised ground-floor plan. 

          Click please? 

          There's a revised -- this is a revised ground-

floor plan that shows the forecourt, and the site features 

we showed earlier.   

          One more click, please?   

          Again, these are more for reference.  A typical 

upper-floor plan, again, registering this forecourt through 

all three floors of the building. 

          One more click, please? 

          Third floor of the building is much the same as 

the second floor.  You see a balcony on top of that entry 

piece, I'll show you that in three dimensions in just a 

minute. 

          One more click, please? 

          A roof plan showing the -- the penthouse plan 

showing the penthouse, which -- again, we've articulated a 

little bit more carefully than what we had prior.

          And one more click?  We'll see the upper roof 

plan. 

a little quickly.   

          One more click?  Intentionally going through these 

          These are elevations.  At the top is the scheme we 

presented last time, which had this forward-facing entry 

element.  And below is the new elevation showing this 

recessed forecourt, with a much more modest entry pavilion. 

          One more click, please? 

          What you see here in this next elevation view is 

the rear of the building -- very similar, but you see a much 

more articulate and expressive penthouse. 

          One more click, please?   

          And here in these drawings you see the end 

elevations, which have a much finer grain of articulation -- 

both of the penthouse and on the end walls.  And you'll see 

that again in the perspective in just a second. 

          So one more click, please? 

          This is a view that -- there were comments at the 

last Planning Board hearing about what the labs would feel 

like from the inside, and how the experience would be from 

inside to outside from the street.

          And we thought this was a good view to show our 

vision from another similar project about how we would 

propose the laboratories to be laid out, to really take 

advantage of that glazing along the street, and the views up 

and down from inside the space. 

          One more click, please?   

          And this last elevation shows diagrammatically 

where future tenant, ground-floor tenant entrances and 

canopies could occur.  We're going to make the structural 

and window wall accommodations in our design, so that these 

can be added in the future.   

          I don't know that you would have six entrances on 

the front of the building and additional main entrance, but 

this is where they could be as the tenanting of this 

building evolves in the future.   

          Give that one more click, please? 

          So these are probably the more telling images.  

This is the rendering of the front of the building that we 

presented at the last hearing -- again, showing the prior 

penthouse end wall and entry forecourt. 

          And then if you click forward?   

          This is a view coming up Smith Place.  You see the 

31

more articulated penthouse, the more articulate end wall of 

the building, and you're getting a peek as you get closer of 

this recessed forecourt at the entry of the building. 

          One more click? 

          Now we're getting closer.  This is a pedestrian's 

view on the sidewalk as you approach the building.  Again, 

you see the entry forecourt coming up, that articulated end 

wall. 

          What you're seeing around the building is the day 

one scheme.  And as the future evolves, that's the area 

where the planting is there that could become the elevated 

sidewalk in the future. 

          One more click? 

          This view -- again, we're getting closer.  You're 

seeing much the same, but perhaps a better view of the entry 

forecourt here at this view.   

          And then one more click?  We're really trying to 

walk you through the pedestrian experience coming up Smith 

Place.   

          Here's a bird's-eye view that brings a lot of 

these ideas together and explains the forecourt much more 

clearly.  It shows the penthouse from a bird's-eye view --

you know, different from the view from the street.  But you 

can see the articulation of the various masses, and how 

we've tried to make that a little more interesting. 

          And then one more click?   

          And then in this image, you kind of see straight 

on from across the street what the forecourt would look 

like, and lots of great suggestions along the way about 

reducing the width of the stair, planting, places to sit and 

gather in front of the building, and really kind of find 

this intermediate place between the active sidewalk, the 

elevated -- you know, future sidewalk, and then the front 

door of the building. 

          And as you go up the building, the second floor 

engages, and even the third floor at a balcony engages this 

entry element. 

          One more click?  We're getting near the end here. 

          We have some images here -- not much of a change 

since last time, but we wanted to go back over the material 

palate of the building.   

          So if you could give that a click?  I'll go 

through this quickly, but again, can certainly come back.  A 

lot of the materials that we're showing here are the same as

what we showed you last time, and in real samples.   

          Give that one more click, please? Here we go.  

It's always hard to see, I know, on the screen as opposed to 

real life, but I'll show you we have sample of our spandrel 

glass, vision glass.   

          We have a mix of some granites where we meet the 

ground, some gray metal panels in the same family as the 

granite, this ultra high-performance concrete that allows us 

to realize that texture on the end walls -- and again, a 

penthouse in this same gray family, but a little bit on the 

lighter scale. 

          Give that one more click, please? 

          This slide shows how those materials are deployed, 

much like I just said. 

          And one more click, please? 

          Similar, you know, just reinforcing at the entry 

where these different materials are deployed. 

          One more click? 

          And, again, in three dimensions just showing where 

we've deployed these materials. 

          One more click? 

          Okay.  And again, more of the same, just being 

34

thorough.  So that's an overview of the three things that I 

promised -- our proposal to reduce the surface parking and 

replace it with an increase in green, permeable open area; 

our resolution of a lot of the details of the planning, 

future planning and how to phase that over time; and then 

these refinements that I've presented to the building 

design. 

study. 

          Last but not least, Lorenco Dantas from VHB is now 

going to take us through some details of the transportation 

          LORENCO DANTAS:  Thank you, Chris.  This is 

Lorenco Dantas from VHB.  Just going to go over the results 

of our investigation on the Transportation Impact Study for 

this project.  We conducted a TIS back in 2019, it was 

certified by the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Department on October 21 of 2019.   

          They certified it as complete and reliable.  We 

did do the thorough investigation of all modes of 

transportation -- vehicle of transit, walking and biking, as 

well as a review of the project service and loading plan -- 

some of those elements that you've seen in the previous 

slides.

          We have elevated the area's traffic conditions at 

six intersections and the Quadrangle area of Alewife.  We 

looked at the impacts of the project's trip generation, as 

well as the traffic impacts with other known and permitted 

or under construction development projects in the 

neighborhood. 

          And our estimates and calculations determined that 

the project is not expected to exceed the criteria for daily 

morning peak and evening peak vehicle trip generation. 

          Next slide, please? 

          This is the overview of those findings, including 

those that I just mentioned, as they relate to the Planning 

Board's criteria.  What we're seeing is that the indicators 

under Project Vehicle Trip Generation, vehicle level of 

service, traffic on residential streets, and queues that 

signalize intersections are not exceeded by this project.   

          The exceedances that we did find occur under 

Criteria E, pedestrian delay and Criteria F -- Pedestrian 

and bicycle facilities.  And the main reason for that is 

that the existing conditions in the neighborhood, as it 

stands today, are relatively poor for walking and biking in 

the neighborhood.

          As you're aware, it's an area thatâ€™s under 

redevelopment.  And projects like these are showcasing some 

improvements to improve those conditions.  But as they 

stand, under the evaluation, there are those exceedances, as 

noted here. 

          The result of that indicates that the proponent is 

providing and improving conditions for walking and 

bicycling.  They're doing that by consolidating the existing 

curb cuts, so that the three parcels and the consolidation 

into one project are bringing those curb cuts from five to 

one on Smith Place. 

          As you've just seen, there are new sidewalks and 

landscaping on Smith Place, in the areas as well where there 

aren't any sidewalks in existence today.   

          The placement of the building itself, as you've 

heard and been experiencing through the materials submitted 

by the project, are providing for a wider Smith Place for 

bicycle lanes, and allowing for the future alignment of 

Fawcett Street, Adley and Wilson Road, and creating that 

block structure for the street corridors that are planned 

under Envision. 

          The project is also providing -- as Chris noted in

one of the diagrams -- a new Bluebike station.  The 

proponent on a separate project across the road is 

introducing the first Bluebike station in the Quadrangle at 

10 Wilson Road, and this is adding additional capacity for 

Bluebikes and bike-sharing access, by providing one on this 

site as well. 

          As you saw, there's on-site bicycle parking that's 

exceeding the minimum requirements from the city, and there 

are other improvements in the area that the proponent is in 

discussions with TP&T to help implement. 

          The -- in addition, the proponent has submitted 

and had an approved PTDM plan, with the final decision by 

the PDTM officer on April 20.  It's adopted a plan that is 

showing an aggressive SOV, or drive-alone mode share goal 

for the project, so to hit mode shares that are lower than 

even what was planned and studied in the TIS. 

          This constrained parking supply that's part of the 

project is one of the measures that's aiming to reduce those 

vehicle commute trips.   

          And there's a whole host of employee commute 

incentives, including free access to the Alewife TMA shuttle 

bus, subsidies of transit pass, and a GOLD level Bluebikes 

38

bike-sharing membership for employees. 

          And with that, those are the transportation 

elements associated with the project.  I believe I'm turning 

this back over to Jim Rafferty for some concluding remarks.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you, Lorenco and Madam 

Chair.  That concludes our presentation.  And obviously, 

we're prepared to answer any questions or engage in 

discussions.  There are, as I'm sure you're aware, there's a 

Traffic Department memo that represents an agreement between 

the proponent and the Traffic Department on some conditions 

-- mitigations, conditions. 

          One worth noting is a voluntary contribution came 

up with by the proponent, not even asked by Traffic and 

Parking, but a leadership gift of $1.4 million dollars for a 

pedestrian bridge.   

          I think it's a reflection of the proponent's 

concern for the well-being of the district as a whole, a 

reflection of its investment in the area, and the true 

belief that that pedestrian bridge can be a real game 

changer in terms of opportunities and availability of 

transit. 

          So the proponent offered to make this gift.  And

it's notable in its size.  Other projects much closer to the 

bridge have been asked to provide $100,000.  And we do have 

the two other projects -- the $140,000 and the $5 a foot.  

But this was really seen by the Davis Companies as a way to 

really participate in making the bridge become a reality.  

So I do think it's worth noting its potential. 

          I always tease Mr. Barr that when we negotiate, 

it's very straightforward; whatever the Traffic Department 

wants, the Traffic Department gets.  And it wasn't that much 

different this time, except in this case we actually came up 

with the $1.4 million without even having to be asked.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So we are in 

our new COVID world here doing things a little differently 

than we did them in person.  We are going to move to public 

comment now, and then we'll have Board questions and Staff 

discussion and all of that after we hear public comment.   

          So this is a public hearing.  Any members of the 

public who wish to speak should now click the button that 

says, "Raise hand." If you're calling in by phone, you can 

raise your hand by pressing *9. 

          So as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had not 

received any written communications on this matter, and

additional communications received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday 

will be entered into the record. 

          I will now ask Staff to unmute the speakers one at 

a time.  When Staff recognizes you, you should begin by 

saying your name and address, and Staff will confirm that we 

can hear you, and after that you will have up to three 

minutes to speak before I ask you to wrap up.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So this is Jeff Roberts.  At this 

point, I don't see any hands raised.  And so, I'm just going 

to repeat the instruction in case anyone is on and would 

like to speak.   

          At this point, you should push the button that 

says, "Raise hand" on Zoom.  It should be at the bottom of 

your screen, or maybe at the top of your screen, depending 

on what kind of computer you're using.  And if you happen to 

be connected by phone, press, *9 on your phone. 

          And I'll give it a few more seconds, to see if 

anybody raises their hand.     

          [Pause] 

          So I'm not seeing any hands raised at this time, 

so I'll have to assume that there are no attendees who wish 

to speak for this continued hearing, and I'll turn it back 

41

over to the Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Thank 

you.  We will now move on from public comment to Board 

discussion.  And if this hearing were to be continued to a 

future date, and additional information received, there will 

be an opportunity for public comment on any additional 

materials.

time. 

          Additional written comments may, of course, be 

          So we did receive memos on this application from 

Community Development, Traffic, Parking and Transportation 

Staff who are available, but I thought last time when we 

discussed this application, there were a lot of questions 

          So City Engineer Kathy Watkins from the Department 

of Public Works is here to present some information in 

response to the questions the Board members brought up last 

          So I'm going to turn it over to Kathy for her 

presentation on that.  

          KATHY WATKINS:  Thanks, Catherine.  I put together 

-- I have about probably 10 slides that I'll run through

pretty quickly.  I looked at the notes from last time and 

tried to highlight some of the questions that folks were 

asking.  So let me see if I can "Share Screen" and get this 

going, and then we can talk through from this. 

          Okay.  So can folks see my screen?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We can.   

          KATHY WATKINS:  Great.  So this is an image from 

the city's 10-year sewer and drain infrastructure plan.  I 

don't know if folks have seen it.  There is a link here that 

goes to the website.  I would encourage folks to try to take 

a look at it.  I think it provides a lot of the context in 

terms of some of the questions.   

          And I think, you know, it was clear from the 

questions that -- you know, the thing we're all struggling 

with is how do you review a specific project?  But then also 

sort of think about the broader, citywide issues and sort of 

not sort of put all of those on every single project as 

you're coming along. 

          And I think, you know, this issue has come up a 

lot.  And I think, you know, it's really started some 

discussion with the Eversource discussions about the 

Eversource capacity and planning discussion, how that sort 

43

of surprised people. 

          And so, one of the things that we've made a 

commitment to City Council to do is to try to set up 

meetings annually with the Planning Board to go through 

infrastructure planning.  So -- and we're really working 

with Staff across the various departments.  And the thinking 

would be probably in the spring.   

          And it would be somewhat similar to the Town and 

(sic) Gown Reports, but to sort of have a little bit of a 

step back and do a meeting with Eversource Electric and Gas, 

so they can go through their infrastructure planning. 

          And then also on the city utilities have a similar 

discussion about sewer drainage and water. 

          So I think that's probably really where this 

discussion should go, as that sort of broader piece.  I did 

try to bring in a little bit of background, so hopefully we 

can talk through and answer some of the specific questions 

that came up here. 

          With the 10-year plan we really released that 

about a year and a half ago, and it was the first time we 

really put together a utility plan that was sort of -- you 

know, pretty far-reaching in terms of where we are and where

we want to go.   

          And it deals with a lot of things that the 

Planning Board is also dealing with in terms of regulations, 

what's the overall condition of our infrastructure?  We deal 

a lot with water quality, focusing on the quality of the 

Charles River and the Alewife Brook. 

          And then also looking at private development, 

because one of the things that is critical to Public Works 

is that, you know, private property owners have 

responsibility for all of those things, and then 

particularly opportunities when people are doing new 

developments.   

          So when you're seeing the -- you know, DPW memos 

on these projects, you know, we're focusing on, you know, 

what's the sewer capacity?  Are they doing -- call it inflow 

and infiltration removal, are they pulling II flow out of 

the sewer systems?  And then are they building and 

protecting their properties to the various anticipated 

flooding elevations?   

          So again, just really -- and a lot of the 

regulations, just to emphasize, really come back to water 

quality and sort of public health issues.  But a lot of

water quality and wanting to make sure that we have clean 

rivers. 

          One of the big questions that comes up is sort of 

what happens when -- you know, with your sewer and with the 

drainage?  And so, one of the things I just want to spend a 

quick minute on is to talk about combined sewer system and 

separated sewer systems. 

          So the photo in the top is a combined sewer 

system.  And so, this was traditionally how a lot of 

Cambridge operated.  And so, with combined sewer systems you 

have one pipe.  And that pipe takes both sewer from your 

property as well as stormwater from the street. 

          And so, in a normal day-to-day and sort of smaller 

rain events, that type of system operates really well.  All 

of that -- both the stormwater, so rain as well as your 

sewage -- all goes to the treatment plan, which in our case 

is Deer Island with the MWRA. 

          During larger rain events, it doesn't operate as 

well, because what happens is instead of the system backing 

up and flooding people's houses, there's what we call a 

"combined sewer overflow" that goes to the river.  So people 

may have heard of those discussions in terms of reducing the 

46

22

amount of combined sewer overflow thatâ€™s going to the river.   

          So what we've done in a lot of areas is worked on 

separating it.  So we talk about sewer separation.  And in 

that system, your sewage goes straight to the Deer Island 

through the treatment plant to NWRA, and then the stormwater 

goes to the river. 

          And so, it depends on sort of when people ask, you 

know, "How does the sewer system work?" it really depends on 

where you are in the city. 

          So this next map has a couple different pieces of 

information on it.  So one is this blue line that sort of 

runs through -- you know, sort of the western third of the 

city.  All of the areas to the east of that line all drain 

to the Charles River.  So if it rains in this area, all that 

rainwater is going to the Charles River. 

          And then on the west of that it goes to the 

Alewife Brook and then up to the Mystic River.  So we have 

sort of two different watersheds.  And so, that's important 

because they operate differently.   

          And so, we think about -- and then the other 

things this map shows is this blue area and the tan area.  

So the blue areas are all separated.  So they have two 

47

22

pipes.  And then the tan areas are not separated and they're 

combined and they have one pipe.   

          So the area that we're talking about now where 

people are really asking a lot of questions, you know, "Is 

Smith Place and Fawcett Street in this area?"  And that's 

all separated.  So there's a separate sewer line from a 

drain line.  And so, I just want to give you a little bit of 

that context.   

          And then particularly just highlight, you know, 

with the Alewife, people probably would call the significant 

construction that happened in the West Cambridge Alewife 

area, and that was all about separating the sewer system, 

reducing the amount of combined sewer overflows, and 

constructing the Alewife Wetland.   

          And so, one of the things that maybe I should just 

talk about this before we go to the garages is that, you 

know, there was some discussion about what happens with 

sewage and labs?   

          So there was discussion about, you know, 

understanding the sort of industrial sewer violations.  So I 

just want to talk a little bit about the way labs are 

regulated. 

48

20

21

22

          So if labs have sewage -- labs all have sewage -- 

they need to get a permit from the MWRA.  Under that permit, 

that regulates the quality of their flow that goes to the 

sewer system.  So the MWRA wants to make sure they know 

what's coming into their system. 

          If the labs can't meet that, then they have a 

pretreatment system.  And that pretreatment system makes 

sure that the sewage is treated before it goes to the MWRA.  

And so, anything that's going into the MWRA, into our system 

from sewage, is pretty highly regulated.   

          And the MWRA has about 30 inspectors that do 

inspections and do random testing at all of these labs.  And 

that's where sometimes you will see -- you know, there's 

these industrial violators.  It's really part of that 

permitting process where they're going through and doing 

testing, and making sure that people are meeting their 

limits.   

          And if they aren't, there may be fines and then 

they do follow up.  And so, there is a pretty strong process 

involved in that.  So I just wanted to put that to one piece 

into how -- you know, if there's an accident in the lab, all 

of that flow will be going into the sewage, not into the 

49

stormwater.   

          The other question that came up was sort of, you 

know, if there's flooding in garages, what happens?  And so, 

you know, these folks have talked about a specific project.  

You know, one of the best things we can do is as we're 

building buildings and building garages, how do we keep the 

flooding out of those areas?   

          So in this instance, they're able to build up the 

entry into the garage.  And so, if the street is flooded, 

the intent is that the garage entrance is still above that, 

and so, the floodwater isn't entering into the garage. 

          The other thing I would say is that if garages are 

flooded, because of the oil and other things in the garage 

it goes into an oil water separator, and then would go into 

the sewer system as well.  And so, there's a couple 

different precautions in terms of trying to minimize the 

environmental impacts of flooding. 

          The other question that sort of came up was about 

Fresh Pond and the water supply.  And so I just -- I brought 

up this map, which is from the flood viewer that talks about 

-- you know, this is Fresh Pond, this is the water treatment 

plant -- you know 2030 this is showing there is some 

50

anticipated flooding in the area.  Definitely protecting the 

water treatment plan in Fresh Pond is a high priority for 

the city. 

mean?   

          And so, as part of the Alewife Climate change 

Preparedness Planning, it was really identified as a key 

priority in terms of protecting the water treatment plant 

and Fresh Pond.  So when we think about that, what does that 

          So one is we talk about looking at locations where 

we can build small berms around Fresh Pond to protect 

flooding water from going into Fresh Pond, as well as 

similarly with the building. 

          The other thing is how the Water Department 

operates Fresh Pond.  So one is that they artificially 

elevate the water in the reservation so that they do not get 

any groundwater into Fresh Pond.  So because there's 

contaminated sites around Fresh Pond, they artificially keep 

the water level high in Fresh Pond. 

          The other thing -- we've had pretty good 

conversations with the Water Department -- is if there were 

to be flooding, they can modify their system so that they 

don't pull from Fresh Pond.

22

          So Fresh Pond is a pretreatment system, but they 

can bypass it if it were to get flooded and get 

contaminated.  But certainly all of our goals are to take 

proactive steps about protecting water treatment. 

          So that was a really high-level overview, and I 

just -- and I want to look at my notes to see other things.  

So it seemed to me like the biggest questions were sort of 

about the lab and the sewer use, flooding.   

          Certainly, you know, anytime there's flooding we 

consider that water to be contaminated.  So when you see 

people out walking through flooding, it makes us all quite 

nervous, right?  We should all assume that water is 

contaminated. 

          When you're looking at new buildings, and sort of 

how do you protect them from flooding, you know, the key 

things are really making sure that looking at the elevation 

and looking at the water as it can enter those buildings, 

and understanding what would be flooded in that instance. 

          And I think those were the key things.  And 

hopefully -- if people have questions, I'm happy to answer 

any questions.  But I think what we want to do is provide a 

little bit of context, and then really sort of emphasize 

52

that this really highlights the need to have this sort of 

broader, citywide discussion with the Planning Board. 

          Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thank you.  

Questions for Kathy Watkins?  Can you use either the, "Raise 

hand -- " 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Just to point out, Catherine, 

you're getting a little choppy, so I don't know if that's --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep, apparently I am.  

Zoom just advised me my connection was unstable there.  

Sorry about that.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Better now.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  All 

right.  So let me try that again.  If there are Board 

members who have questions for Kathy, now would be the time 

to ask.       

          [Pause]  

          No?  Okay.  Any questions for CDD or Traffic and 

Parking?  As I noted, we have received memos from both 

departments, as well as the helpful context overview from 

DPW.  Do any Board members have questions for Staff on the 

issues of Traffic and Parking or design?

          All right.  Oh, Ted! Go ahead.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Just a very minor question.  

There are HOV parking spots, and I was wondering how they 

are enforced, and how they are used?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Joe or Adam, 

do you want to speak to that?   

          JOSEPH BARR:  Sure.  So the sort of HOV program 

overall is typically, and I believe in this case it's part 

of the PTDM plan for the project.   

          So there is -- I don't know the exact details; in 

fact the proponent may not have worked them out at this 

stage, but there's typically a process for, you know, that's 

implemented by the Transportation Coordinator for the 

building to -- you know, qualify employees, people commuting 

there for HOV parking spaces, and then keeping track of the 

fact that they are in fact HOVs on a regular basis users.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I'll just add on that 

that back when I was looking at PTDM plans on a regular 

basis, the best enforcement mechanism was that frankly other 

employees will let people out for using them, if they're not 

a qualified vehicle.

          The city is not in the habit of sending people 

around to inspect them, but other employees will tell their 

Transportation Coordinator that somebody is using them who's 

not allowed, or who has a permit, but isn't actually using a 

High Occupancy Vehicle. 

          Mary, you have your hand up.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, thank you.  So my question has 

to do with the additional spaces that will be given up in 

the future, based on -- you know, different changes and 

conditions.   

          Was there discussion of where those spaces -- are 

they going to be surface spaces, are they going to be ones 

from the garage?  And if they are surface spaces, how does 

that affect the loading dock and the access on that?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Well, if I may answer --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Sure.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  -- the first step would be 

further reduction surface parking.  So obviously -- and that 

would provide opportunities for additional green space, and 

perhaps some other better circulation.  But obviously the 

place for the reduction would be on the surface.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

55

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Presumably in the back portion, 

with adjacency to the green space.  So it might make sense 

to expand that area.  But I should -- I don't know if Chris 

Chandor has similar thinking or different thinking, but it's 

always been our assumption that when the reduction were to 

occur, it would occur with surface parking.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Well, it seems to make sense.  

That's what I was hoping you were going to say.  But that 

one diagram that showed the trucks backing in and out, I 

think some of -- I looked at it, it was very quick, but if 

you can just show it again, does that impact -- I mean,  I 

know this is down the road when it will happen but, you 

know, there was one -- this is the one that shows the 

vehicle access.  But there was another one -- I think it was 

right after?     

          CHRIS LEARY:  Slide 14.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.     

          CHRIS LEARY:  This is Chris.  It would not impact 

the loading dock.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  You'd be able to do it?     

          CHRIS LEARY:  Yes, we would --      

          MARY FLYNN:  It just looked like it backed --

          CHRIS LEARY:  -- have no problem.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah.  I didn't quite understand this 

slide.  I mean, it looked like you were going all the way 

over into that area, and then backing in?     

          CHRIS LEARY:  Yeah, those spaces where the truck 

would be pulling forward at the top would not be the spaces 

that we would eliminate.  We might eliminate something 

closer to the building, or perhaps the spaces in the top 

right corner that would be closer to the Boston street 

access could also be --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

space there.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          CHRIS LEARY:  -- eliminated to create more green 

          CHRIS LEARY:  It would certainly not interfere 

with the truck loading.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          CHRIS LEARY:  Thank you.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you so much.  Appreciate the 

answer.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Let's see.  

I'm still showing Ted and Mary with hands up.  Are there

other Board members who have questions?     

          [Pause] 

          All right.  Any questions?  We've covered Staff.  

Any other questions for the applicant before we move to 

Board discussion?     

          [Pause]  

          No?  All right.  Everybody is all on top of the 

material today, which makes this move a lot faster.  I 

really appreciate that.  Okay, we will turn to Board 

discussion now.  Let's see, Ted why don't you start us off 

tonight, then?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  I don't really have many 

comments.  It seems to me there have been a number of 

improvements over what we saw before that we liked, and -- 

you know, it seems to be an improvement over what we saw 

several months ago.  It certainly will be an improvement to 

Fawcett Street and Smith Place, 

          And you know, I guess a minor question: It still 

seems to me that it's a lot of glass, but -- and so, if 

either Hugh or Tom wanted to talk about that I'd appreciate 

that.  But I've read all the materials, and otherwise I 

think it's a good project.

side. 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Okay, I agree with Ted.  I 

think the changes gives the project a more forward-looking 

development here.  A couple of small items.  The patio area; 

it would be nice to see something either growing there or 

some kind of shading of these big outdoor areas on the right 

          The other thing that concerned me a little bit was 

the entrance to Smith Place from the shared private garage.  

The radius seems to be kind of bad on the side of the curb 

that's in addition to the driveway, or the sidewalk, the 

bike lane and also foot traffic.  But outside of that, I 

think they've done an excellent job.   

          Oh, and one other thing.  It looks like the 

Bluebike station needs to go towards the building a little 

bit more so we get the bikes out of the side yard.   

          But besides those small items, I think they've 

done a great job, and I love the entrance.  I love what they 

did to the wall faÃ§ades, they look much better -- just 

great.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh, how

about you?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have little to add to what my 

colleagues have already been saying.  The two places that I 

would like to see improvements, either initially or over the 

long-term is the tree canopy.  I'd like to see that that be 

prioritized when parking spaces are reduced to create places 

to plant more trees on the -- I guess west side, the back of 

the building. 

          I think the amount of trees is basically pretty 

much maxed out, although possibly the spacing along Adley 

Road could be -- you know, you could add a tree or two to 

get a tighter spacing. 

          I'm disappointed that people are building 

buildings with this much glass, given our city's priority to 

get to Net Zero, and I would want them -- if they're -- I 

would hope that the clear glass they're using is an 

extremely high-performance; maybe triple glazed or 

something.   

          Because it's -- you know, it's -- you're 

hearkening back to an era when energy was much less of an 

issue or climate change wasn't understood. 

          There's been a tremendous effort to get this

building to work with the day one conditions, and the 

ultimate desired conditions.  There have been significant 

improvements, based on our earlier comments.  I'm certainly 

prepared to make all the findings that would result in 

voting for the special permit.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary, why 

don't you go next?       

          MARY FLYNN:  So I agree with what my colleagues 

have stated so far, and I particularly want to thank that 

proponent and your Staff, as well as the City Staff.    

          Because as Hugh said, you know, it's very clear 

that a lot of people put a lot of time and effort and 

thought into thinking about ways to make this building 

successful and be able to transition from one condition to 

hopefully a better future condition.  It's certainly not 

easy.  And I think it's just an excellent job. 

          I like the new design very, very much.  I think 

it's a very big improvement, and the -- I think the addition 

of the open space in the back is helpful.  The more open 

space we can get the better. 

          My only other concern was the interior shades, 

which is really nitpicky I know, but it was mentioned I

think in the Staff memo something about trying to program 

all of them so that they can be controlled in terms of -- 

you know, light emanating from the building at night. 

          I also just think -- you know, it might be a 

better look to try to do something on the exterior, just 

because it would be uniform, whereas -- you know, I just 

have visions of some shades up, some shades down.  So to the 

extent that -- you know, there can be some level of control;  

I know it's hard in different tenants and things like that, 

but I think some thought needs to go into that. 

          But otherwise, I'm really, really impressed.  I 

think it's a great project.  Thanks.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  And I think 

that brings us to that brings us to Tom.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Yeah, I 

long for more tree canopy as well, I think they've done 

really well.  The renderings -- the plans always show the 

trees as if they are planted yesterday, the canopies will 

grow.   

          Relative to Ted's question and plea for one of the 

architects on the Board to address the issue of energy, I 

understand the proposal is 17 percent below the stretch

code, which is already 10 percent what the building code in 

Massachusetts offers, and the building code in Massachusetts 

is actually pretty progressive relative to energy.   

          So could they do better?  Absolutely.  Could they 

drive towards Net Zero?  Absolutely.  But they've done 

pretty well driving the energy needs of a lab building down 

to that level, in my opinion.   

          I also think the design has improved wonderfully.  

They're having the building read as sort of two separate, 

smaller, better proportioned masses with the central court, 

that's evolved really well.  It is a very, very positive 

development, along with the way the penthouse got resolved. 

          So that brings me to the model.   I know it's odd 

that we're asking for models within the Zoom context, but 

actually I found that really helpful.  In the moment just of 

the presentation, when we flashed the model -- the presenter 

flashed the model, it became very clear how that roof had 

all been resolved, and there's something about the power of 

the miniature renderings like on the miniature 

representations of the buildings that really, really help. 

          I also found the presentation succinct, respectful 

and clear.  And you think -- you would think we would see

more people and more presenters take that style here, 

especially when they're coming here asking for 

consideration.  I appreciated the consideration that the 

proponent gave us and being so well-prepared and so clear. 

          I also want to just comment on another discipline 

that's near and dear to my heart, which is Urban Design and 

planning.  All of us feel that way -- the day one proposal 

vs. the future proposal; that's Urban Design, right?  It 

takes a long time to build cities, and that kind of 

forethought and that kind of consideration about our future 

is really wonderful to see here.  That's what this is all 

about.   

          And there are nights -- I have to admit -- I know 

maybe I'm in the minority -- where I come away thinking I'm 

not sure we made much of a difference.  But tonight, I have 

to say the building's better, the proposal's clearer, and 

there's Urban Design happening here in a very positive way, 

which is going to affect this District.   

          The Planning Board has made a difference tonight, 

and I'm very pleased with the proposal and happy to support 

it.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very

much.  Yeah, I would agree with all the comments made by my 

colleagues and add my thanks to Staff from all the various 

departments for their work over this on many months.  I'm 

sure it was more months than anybody anticipated they would 

have to work on it, but I think it has been time well spent.  

          And I also appreciate the DPW and the Council have 

been working on these bigger infrastructure issues, because 

I know one of the reasons it came up was that we see a lot 

of these, and we do get a lot of questions on whether it's 

too much.  And it's great to hear that we're going to be 

getting more of that overview, so that we have that context 

going forward. 

          Let me pause there.  Hugh, you put up your hand.  

Did you want to add something?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I wanted to thank the City 

Engineer, Kathy Watkins, for her very interesting 

presentation.  I look forward to the annual sort of getting 

down into more detail.  I'm very impressed with the level of 

thought that's coming out of the Engineer's Office.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's great, and 

that is -- I second that.  I'm looking forward to getting 

that context and having it on a regular basis, so that we 

65

are better equipped to understand the context in which we're 

looking at all these plans, because that is certainly a 

question we're getting more often.   

          And it is helpful to know how it is being 

addressed on a systems-wide basis, which is really where it 

needs to be addressed.   

          So, having heard the Board members' comments, it 

sounds like we're going to move forward with granting a 

special permit, provided that we can make the findings.  So 

in order to grant the special permits requested, the Board 

would need to find that the proposal meets the following 

          And I'm just going to read them all out, and then 

see if there are any objections from any Board members on 

criteria. 

them.   

          So for the project reviews, special permit:  that 

the project will have no substantial adverse impact on city 

traffic within the study area, upon review of the traffic 

impact indicators analyzed in the Transportation Impact 

Study and the mitigation efforts proposed, as detailed in 

the memo from Traffic, Parking and Transportation.   

          And also for the project review special permit:

That the project is consistent with the Urban Design 

objectives of the city, as set forth in Section 19.3.    

          The Alewife Overlay District special permits for 

increase in FAR, increase in building height and waiver of 

yard requirements:  We need to be able to find that the 

project promotes the general interests of the larger 

commercial and residential neighborhood, as noted in Section 

20.92, and is consistent with the goals, objectives and 

guidelines established in the Concord Alewife Plan.   

          Specifically for waiver of yard requirements, we 

have to find that the objectives of the Concord Alewife Plan 

continue to be met, that the stormwater management 

objectives for the area continue to be met both on the site 

and as the site may be part of a larger system for managing 

stormwater runoff, and that the reduction or waiver of yard 

requirements provides for more efficient development of 

land, encourages or facilitates a more logical pattern of 

buildings, streets, parks and open space, or enhances the 

urban pedestrian character of the area, as envisioned in the 

Concord Alewife Plan.   

          And then we have, of course, our usual General 

Special Permit Criteria findings that we normally make those 

67

findings, unless it is found not to be in the public 

interest to do so. 

          So if Board members have any concern about making 

these findings, or if you'd like to note anything that 

should be included in the written decision, please indicate 

so now.  Any comments on the findings?     

          [Pause] 

          Okay.  For the conditions, both the Community 

Development and Traffic and Parking memos contain suggested 

conditions to be included in the special permit decisions, 

and there are also the standard conditions for continuing 

review and certification by Staff that the conditions have 

          Are there other conditions that the Board members

would like to include?     

          [Pause]  

          All right.  Hearing none, any suggestions or 

additions from Staff beyond the memos that we have received?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff Roberts -- no thanks 

to the Chair.  I will note when I stop talking I see Ted 

Cohen's hand up, so he might have more to suggest.   

          There are -- I just would point out from our memo

there are a few items that you've all reviewed that would 

need to be included in the findings and conditions just 

regarding some of the sort of peculiarity of this proposal 

having a day one plan and then a future plan.   

          So it's important to make sure that the decision 

reflects that the Planning Board is approving the day one 

plan as it's designed, but that also is granting approval 

for the modifications that will result in a future plan and, 

you know, contain conditions that would enable those future 

improvements to take place at a time when they're feasible.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I just wanted to direct your 

attention to that, because it's a little different from 

normal.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No, I appreciate that 

Jeff.  It's important to get on the record the Board 

understands that they're essentially approving a now plan 

and a future plan that would not -- in order to carry out 

the future plan not need to come back to us for an amendment 

to the special permit.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Correct.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted, you just

put your hand down, was that your question?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes, I just wanted to make sure 

that we authorize future changes to the parking?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep, yes.    

          JOSEPH BARR:  Madam Chair?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.    

          JOSEPH BARR:  Just two -- excuse me, two comments, 

one -- or two suggestions.  One, I just wanted to make sure 

that that was clear in our memo, because it wasn't 

specifically discussed, and it wasn't a specific mitigation 

piece, was that we are suggesting that the proponent be 

allowed to reduce their parking in the future -- not just by 

the ten parking spaces that was suggested, or that they've 

agreed to, but by an additional amount down to whatever the 

zoning is at that time, without further Planning Board 

review. 

          Because I will say that, you know, it was a long, 

drawn out negotiation and I apologize to Planning Board 

members for the fact that they only received our memo 

yesterday I believe.   

          And we certainly would have preferred to have a 

lower parking number.  We recognize in this document and the

memo that we're -- you know, we're okay with what the 

ultimate result is, although I would certainly disagree with 

Mr. Rafferty's contention that the Traffic Department got 

everything it wanted in this case.   

          So we would love to see a time when they are ready 

to reduce parking an additional parking reduction beyond 

those ten spaces, and if at some point the recommendations 

of the Envision Alewife Plan are implemented, and the 

parking minimums go even lower, then that would be 

considered -- well, again, not a requirement by any means, 

but something that should be considered.   

          So we just want to make sure that -- or we would 

hope that the Board would support the applicant having that 

flexibility in the future and without further Planning Board 

review.  So I just wanted to highlight that piece.   

          And then also just say that we did I think over 

the course of the entire negotiation make significant 

progress on the whole site plan and the design of the -- you 

know, the nonbuilding elements of the project and, you know, 

like I said although we -- it was a difficult negotiation, I 

think we ultimately came to a good place.   

          But we would -- like I said -- certainly hope that

the proponent would consider further parking reduction, and 

also, recognize that this is a unique time, both in terms of 

the COVID-19 situation and the -- you know, ability to move 

development projects forward, but also that this is one of 

the first projects out of the box, sort of in the Quadrangle 

in recent years, and we certainly wouldn't -- we don't want 

anyone to think that we considered the parking supply for 

this building to be necessarily predictive of what should be 

assumed for future buildings that may be developed by this 

developer or others.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So just to clarify on 

that, Joe:  We would be approving the ten space reduction as 

a requirement, once the future conditions are met, but you 

would like to include that they would have the flexibility 

to go down to, if the zoning minimum is reduced, they would 

have the ability to go down to zoning minimum without a 

Planning Board -- an amendment to their special permit?    

          JOSEPH BARR:  Yes.  The current zoning is -- does 

have a lower minimum than what they're providing.  So even 

if it doesn't change, there is an additional I think seven 

space reduction that will be possible.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.

          JOSEPH BARR:  And if the zoning is changed in the 

future, then who knows?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.    

          JOSEPH BARR:  -- what that would look like.  I 

think 0.8 was the recommendation in the Envision plan.  And 

obviously, I guess, you know, the -- I suppose -- and I'm 

not, I don't want to speak for sort of Jeff as the zoning 

expert here, but I suppose the Board has -- could either say 

you can go down to the current zoning minimum without 

further review, but anything below that would require 

further review; or you could say down to the zoning minimum 

thatâ€™s in effect at whatever point of time they're making 

that reduction; or you could not do either of those things, 

obviously.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mr. Rafferty, do you 

want to chime in on how amenable your client is to the 

suggestion from the Traffic and Parking Department?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yeah, thank you, happy to do so.  

That was an element of our discussion.  The Traffic 

Department was candid that conditions today will be 

different in the future.  We have a member of our team at 

VHB who says Envision Alewife improvements will yield

Envision Alewife reduction.  So we look forward.    

          I know the applicant sincerely looks forward to 

the time when there would be less dependence on auto and 

better opportunities for cycling and the bridge.  And that's 

candidly why they came -- stepped forward with the 

contribution, the $1.4 million-dollar contribution towards 

the bridge.  That will cost them money, and it will cost 

them spaces, but they committed to both.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Ted, I 

see you have your hand up.  Do you have a question on this?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It's not directly on this, but 

it is for Traffic and Parking.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Generally, there is a list of 

conditions that we put in from your memos with regard to a 

number of common or usual items about the Traffic 

Coordinator, about the Bluebike memberships; things of that 

nature.  That's not in either of your two memos this time; I 

was just wondering if those all have been incorporated in 

the PTDM agreement?    

          JOSEPH BARR:  Correct.  Typically you would see 

those in the Planning Board special permit for residential 

74

projects, since there is no PTDM plan, or for some reason 

PTDM didn't apply.  But in this case, those types of 

requirements are covered in the PTDM.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I would add, if I may, that 

generally the compliance with PTDM is also made a condition 

of the special permit.  So the two are tied together.              

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  What do 

Board members think about giving the proponent the 

flexibility to further reduce their parking supply down to 

the -- at the time applicable zoning minimum without coming 

back to the Board?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I'm in favor of that reduction, 

since it's less of an impact potentially.  It seems like a 

rational approach.  [It's Tom speaking.]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Tom.  

Other Board member comments on that?  Let me ask does anyone 

have any concerns about incorporating that recommendation 

from Staff that the applicant is amenable to?   

          Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, I'm all set for 

changing it to a distinct zoning [1:49:08 audio unclear]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.

Then I'm not hearing any objections to including that 

recommendation, so we will include that in the conditions as 

well.   

          All right.  Are there any other conditions, either 

recommended by Staff or that Board members would like to add 

at this time?     

          [Pause] Okay.   

          Hearing none, then do we have a motion to grant 

the requested special permits with those conditions, based 

on the Board's finding that the applicable Special Permit 

Criteria are met?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Hugh.  Is 

there a second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second -- Lou Bacci.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, Lou.  Roll

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On the motion to grant the special 

permit, Louis Bacci?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?

to the applicant and to Staff for -- as Tom noted, a 

succinct, yet really informative and helpful presentation, 

and for all the work everyone did to get us to this point 

tonight.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Well, Thank you, Madam Chair.  On 

behalf of the applicant, I express their appreciation for 

the work that the Staff and the Board has put into this 

case.  If I could be permitted one question of the Board?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Certainly.

appeared in this format before, and I certainly miss the 

intimacy of the second floor meeting room, I have been 

watching your meetings, and I've had one gnawing question 

for several works now, and I'm wondering what is it in Mr. 

Russell's background?  Is it European, is it Italian?  And I 

cannot figure it out.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Jim, it's -- the cathedral in 

Florence, it's a picture I took on a trip five years ago.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Wow.  It's impressive.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It's indeed impressive.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  It's right up there with the 

Chair's NASA background.  I thought that was maybe a 

reflection of that Elon Musk's private starship or whatever, 

but -- thank you again.  I look forward to a return 

engagement, hopefully in the not too distant future.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you Mr. 

Rafferty.  That concludes the business on our agenda.  Are 

there any additional comments from Staff?  Anything I'm 

forgetting?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Nothing from me, unless any other 

Staff members jump in.  Just another reminder that we don't 

have a meeting next week.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Actually, 

before I let people go, since we are all gathered in a 

public forum here, one of the things staff and I have been 

trying to weigh is whether -- is the balance between shorter 

meetings like this with only one major public hearing on the 

agenda versus less frequent but longer meetings?   

          And so, I know we don't have all Board members 

here, but if anyone has a strong opinion or any opinion on 

which of those is easier for you to manage in your life, it 

would be great to get that feedback while we're all gathered 

together.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Madam Chair, I prefer the shorter 

meetings -- more frequent.  I find a three-hour meeting on a 

Zoom in the evening almost impossible.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That's my feeling also.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I concur.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'll concur too.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, it sounds like 

we're getting a consensus.  Lou?   

79

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Same here.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Well, we 

will also poll the folks who can't be here tonight, but it's 

nice -- that was also my feeling, but I didn't want to 

presume that everyone had the same reaction I did.  So I'm 

glad we were able to discuss that.  That will make it 

clearer for Staff as we continue to schedule.   

          I do want to thank the Staff for on this one and 

several others we have coming up.  They have heard other 

feedback from other stakeholders about our willingness to do 

longer meetings, and they -- you know, there are people who 

would love to get our agendas packed as early as possible, 

and they've been really trying to be considerate of how 

challenging this is for all of us.   

          So thank you to Staff for doing this.  I feel much 

better about a meeting like we had tonight.  So thank you 

for that. 

          And with that --  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I thank you for your feedback 

to the Board members and everybody -- this is Jeff.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.  Thank you, 

Jeff.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have one other comment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  You'll notice I'm wearing earbuds?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Because I realize the -- I can hear 

the sound more clearly with earbuds or -- Tom's wearing 

earphones, I see.  So that's just a trick I've discovered.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's great.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And hearing it more clearly, that's 

the hardest problem in a Zoom meeting is the audio quality 

is not very good.  And so, that's a way to address that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.  That's 

terrific.  Tips are always welcome.   

          All right.  With that, unless any Board members 

have anything else they want to add?  No? Then we're 

adjourned.        

Enjoy the holiday.    

          MARY FLYNN:  This late in the day, everyone.  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  There you go.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- as much as you can, given the 

climate, the current COVID situation.
