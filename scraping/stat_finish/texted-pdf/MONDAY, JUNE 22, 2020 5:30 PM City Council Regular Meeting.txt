To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $5,300,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Human Services Extraordinary Expenditures Account to construct a new Universal Design 
Playground. 
 
Universal Design is a design approach that aims to create products or environments that are 
usable by all people to the greatest extent possible, regardless of unique individual challenges 
based on age, physical ability, or other characteristics.  An exclusively Universal Design 
playground will be the first of its kind in Cambridge and will be designed for inclusive play 
where every user and visitor, regardless of ability or disability, can benefit from play elements 
physically, developmentally, emotionally, and socially.  Through unique play equipment, 
landscaping, layout, and elevations, the entire park will be designed to factor in not only mobile 
accessibility, but other potential sensory, cognitive, and emotional barriers.  The new park will 
be located on an unutilized 0.75 acre portion of Danehy Park adjacent to the Field Street Parking 
Lot.  The location features off street parking and onsite maintenance staff.  
 
COMMUNITY PROCESS: 
The firm Weston & Sampson, was selected to lead a team of designers, engineers, architects, 
landscape architects, and environmental scientists to design the new park. A Focus Group 
comprised of city staff, parents, abutters, and educators was also created to work closely in 
coordination with the design team as well as solicit input from residents throughout the public 
process to develop park concepts and design.  There were also, two well-attended community 
meetings to gather feedback and ideas on design concepts.   The design team has also worked 
collaboratively with various city departments including the Cambridge Commission for Persons 
with Disabilities, Department of Human Services Programs and the Recreation Division, 
Department of Public Works, the Arts Council, and the Open Space Committee.

1.7

•  Tree Canopy - protection and enhancement of existing tree canopy; responds to City of 

Cambridge Urban Forestry Master Plan; 

•  Shade -  opportunities for shaded seating and play spread throughout the playground; 
combination of existing and new tree canopy, and play structure canopies/roofs; 

•  Walking Loop - level pathway at inside perimeter of playground 
•  Bathroom Facility - prefabricated, three-season building including men’s, women’s, and 

family restrooms with changing tables. 

 
PROJECT BUDGET: 
The project budget reflects an enhanced project scope based on feedback from the public and 
Focus Group, as well as review by the Department of Environmental Protection.   The design and 
construction are made more complex because the site is on a former landfill, therefore a 25% 
construction contingency is included.   The project also now includes a prefabricated bathroom 
building, based on feedback during the community process.    
 
PROJECT SCHEDULE: 
Construction of the playground will begin in late summer, 2020, and is anticipated to be 
completed in nine to twelve months.

CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSAL PLAY 
 

 

June 22, 2020 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am transmitting the recommendation of the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) for an 
allocation of $1,000,000 from the CPA Fund Balance to the Community Preservation Act Fund COVID-
19 Housing Stabilization Program.  A summary of the program and the CPAC funding request is 
attached.    
 
Funds will be combined with other resources, including Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) 
funds, to provide short-term financial assistance to individuals and families who are experiencing 
financial instability due to the COVID-19 crisis and as a result may be at risk of losing their home 
because they are unable to pay rent. 
 
This program is part of the City’s efforts to dedicate resources to housing assistance in response to the 
COVID-19 crisis and will be administered by the City Manager’s Office through the Office of the 
Housing Liaison, the Department of Human Services Programs (DHSP) through the Multi-Service Center 
(MSC) and the Community Development Department’s (CDD) Housing Division. 
 
On Wednesday, June 10, 2020, the CPAC considered a request for an allocation of $1,000,000 in CPA 
funds for the City of Cambridge COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program.  The CPAC held a public 
hearing through Zoom and voted on the following recommendation to the City Council, through the City 
Manager. The CPAC voted, six members in favor and one member voting present: 
 
That the Community Preservation Committee recommend the allocation of $1,000,000 from the 
CPA Fund Balance to the City’s Covid-19 Housing Stabilization Program. 
 
In accordance with the CPAC’s recommendation, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate 
$1,000,000 from the existing CPA Fund Balance to the City’s COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program.  
 
This appropriation will not affect CPA project funding for FY2021.  The FY2021 funding 
recommendations are expected in September, and they will be based on net local receipts from the CPA 
surcharge for FY2021, the FY2021 state match, and from the CPA fund balance.

COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program  
Request for CPA Funds 
Use of Funds Summary 
June 10, 2020 
 

 
An allocation of $1million is requested from CPA funds to establish the COVID-19 Housing Stabilization 
Program.  If approved, these funds will be combined with other resources, including Community 
Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds, to provide short term financial assistance to individuals and 
families who are experiencing financial instability due to the COVID-19 crisis and as a result may be at 
risk of losing their home because they are unable to pay rent.   
 
This program is the second phase of City efforts to dedicate resources to housing assistance in response 
to the COVID-19 crisis, continuing certain housing assistance supports allocated through the Mayor’s 
Disaster Relief Fund, and will be administered jointly by the City Manager’s Office through the Office of 
the Housing Liaison, the Department of Human Services Programs (DHSP) through the Multi-Service 
Center (MSC) and the Community Development Department’s (CDD) Housing Division.   
 
The program will subsidize households whose incomes are at or below 80% of Area Median Income 
(AMI) and whose rent is more than 40% of their income at the time of application, and reduce their 
housing costs to 40% of their current income.   
 
Funds will be disbursed in the form of a two-month rental subsidy.  Subject to funding availability, the 
program could be extended beyond two months, but will remain a temporary program responding to 
the COVID-19 crisis.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

In 1945, the City of Cambridge was among the scores of municipalities across the 
country that appointed a citizen's committee to review the treatment of African-
Americans, particularly those returning from serving during WWII, and to help them 
better reintegrate into the communities they were now returning to; and 
 
The charge of the Cambridge citizens committee was to provide a reliable voice in 
civic matters to the African-American community members and their allies, and this 
work resulted in the establishment of a formal Department of Civic Unity; and 
 
Over the next several decades, the Department of Civic Unity would work on bettering 
Police-Community Relations, on creating fairer educational and housing practices and 
policies, on ensuring that there were fair and equitable policies on matters of 
employment, and on various other areas of concern as they arose, and in time, much of 
this work was institutionalized across several City departments to engage in anti-bias 
work; and 
 
In recent weeks, as the entire country has been galvanized in the wake of the murders 
of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, there has been a renewed 
demand from the Cambridge community to ensure that the kind of work that the 
Department of Civic Unity was focused on prior to being discontinued in the 1990s 
must be re-committed to, to ensure that the City is fully engaged in stamping out issues 
of racism in all its iterations; and 
 
The City of Cambridge has the opportunity to be a true national leader in taking stock 
of our policies, of the opportunities presented to people regardless of their color, 
gender, religion, or orientation, and to ensure that all members of the Cambridge 
community are treated fairly and equally in all respects; now therefore be it   
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Chair of the Civic 
Unity Committee and the Chair of the Public Safety Committee  in appointing a 
committee charged with making recommendations on what measures the City should 
be taking to better address any systemic instances of racism, racial intolerance, and/or 
unequal treatment of African-American members of the community, and to report back 
to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Chair of the Civic 
Unity Committee and the Chair of the Public Safety Committee in convening a Town 
Hall meeting or other public forum designed to ensure that the voices from members of 
the community are heard on this important matter.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours,

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

Wednesday, June 17, 2020 7:08 PM
City Council
Clerk
On reallocating Cambridge policing funds

My name is Peter Godart and I live at 327 Hurley St, Cambridge, MA 02141. While I am pleased to hear that $2.5M have 
been reallocated from the policing budget towards hiring a housing case manager and central sq library social worker, I 
am concerned that this measure is just a stop-gap to placate the many Cambridge residents, myself included, who have 
called for much stronger reforms. I am calling on you as my local government representatives to continue putting 
pressure on the racist systems currently in place by committing to the following:

• Reallocate all of the remaining $4.1M towards preventative social services, including education for both 

community members and police officers.

• Re-evaluate the $65M police department budget and make a commitment to reducing this budget by at least 

20% to fund preventative social services, as well as Fire, Public Works, Human Services, CHA, and 
Transportation.

• Disarm and demilitarize the police force. Ban acceptance of excess military equipment from the 1033 program.
• Mandate retraining for all current police officers and extend the training program for new recruits. Expand the 

curriculum around racial discrimination with community-driven input.

It tells you something about our current values that our black neighbors live in fear of the Cambridge Police, an 
organization that is supposed to "Serve and Protect". As elected public servants, you have the same charge, to "Serve 
and Protect" all of your constituents. Please consider these points as you move forward, and realize that you have the 
power and responsibility to make real change towards restoring the rights of people of color in our community. Defund 
the police and refund the woefully underserved communities of color. We are counting on you.

Perez, Lori

Shared Streets

At this stage the shared street program is totally unnecessary. There are many different locations throughout the City 
that our citizens can safely socially distance with the appropriate face covering. Any purported benefit from this pilot 
program does not justify the hardships on our citizens particularly the residents of the three affected streets and the 
immediate neighborhoods.

Hi Councilors,

Dan Pratt <danwpratt@gmail.com>
Monday, June 22, 2020 4:11 PM
City Council
Clerk
June 22nd Policy Orders #1 and #9

I am writing to express support for Policy Order #1 and Policy Order #9 in the June 22, 2020 Council Meeting. I have 
been a resident of Cambridge since 2008 and see Cambridge as a leader for the state and the nation as a model of good 
governance. Government transparency has always been an important issue and has become increasingly salient in times 
of crisis: specifically now when there is a public conversation regarding the role of policing. To properly have that 
conversation, the public needs as much information as possible made available to them.

I strongly urge the Councilors to vote in favor of Policy Order #1 to make collective bargaining agreements (including the 
police union contract) public on cambridgema.gov and to vote in favor of Policy Order #9 to require the City Manager to 
compile and provide to the City Council a list of all materials, tools, and property owned by the Cambridge Police 
Department.

Thank you for considering my input.

the City Council meeting today on Monday 6/22.

To me, these policy orders seem like obvious first steps to take to bring the discussion about rethinking policing that is 
happening around the country to Cambridge, MA. In order for the residents of Cambridge to be able to participate in 
these discussions, it is paramount that the details of collective bargaining agreements and the materials owned by the 
Cambridge PD are made available to our elected representatives and to the public. These transparency measures 
constitute the bare minimum actions that the City must take to ensure that a proper discussion regarding policing 
concerns takes place in our city.

We are living in a consequential moment—the worst global pandemic in 100 years, mass unemployment not seen since 
the Great Depression, and quite possibly the largest protest movement in US history. Cambridge should be leading in 
this moment. The city council has the opportunity to drastically change our budgetary priorities and engage with the 
people of Cambridge on what we want our city to look like post-COVID-19. I hope that the city council chooses to listen 
to it's residents and hear that we want transformation of our city into one that ignores the requests of corporations and 
developers, puts people first, and invests into true models of public safety and sustainability. I believe that these policy 
orders constitute the beginning of that process.

I look forward to seeing how the council chooses to act on this matter.

Thank you,
Joshua Pirl

PO #1 and PO #9

I am writing to urge you to vote in favor of two policy orders related to transparency. These are:

• PO #1 which would require all collective bargaining agreements with the City to be made publicly 

available on the City's website 

• PO #9 which would require the City Manager to compile and provide to the City Council an itemized list 

of all materials, tools, and property owned by the Cambridge Police Department

Democracy thrives best when we operate in as much daylight as possible. These two policy orders help us to 
achieve this.

Supporting Policy Order #10, Cambridge City Council meeting June 22, 2020

I am writing in support of Policy Order #10, written by Councillor Dennis Carlone. Policy 
Order #10 proposes that applications for permits for new or substantially renovated 
buildings include alternative and renewable energy systems as alternatives to 
conventional energy systems. An analysis of the feasibility and cost of installing such a 
system compared with a fossil fueled energy system will be very useful and will likely 
result in more installation of alternative technology in buildings.

Clean alternative technologies for residential use such as solar thermal, air source heat 
pumps and induction stoves exist and are in use in Cambridge, but although many 
Cambridge residents want to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels for heating and 
cooling their homes and for cooking, they are not aware of the technological alternatives 
or have been told they are cost prohibitive , or will not work in our climate.

Developers of residential and commercial buildings also need to learn about the above 
mentioned technologies as well as district heating and passive design, and Policy 
Order#10 will be of great benefit to them and to our community.

Thank you,
Sharon de Vos

Comment on POR 2020 #138 and POR 2020 #146

My name is Sebastian J. Garza, and I am a public schoolteacher and voter residing at 210 Green St, Cambridge, MA 
02139.

As a believer in the Black Lives Movement, my heart goes out to my Black neighbors, so many of whom live in fear of the 
police who are meant to protect us. 

I learned that POR 2020 #138 (PO #1) and POR 2020 #146 (PO #9) were up for discussion today. These two measures are 
vital to the transparency and accountability our community needs and deserves, and I was actually surprised that 
neither were already in place.

As such, I urge you to please pass both of these orders. This is what our community needs!

Support Policy Orders 1 & 9

My name is Melanie and I'm a resident of Cambridge. I'm writing to ask that you support Policy Order 1 and 9.

Related to both policy orders, I believe it is essential that government policies, processes, and spending be transparent 
so that community members like myself have an accurate picture of how our government is operating. In order to be an 
engaged citizen, I would like to see all collective bargaining agreements with the City, including police union contracts, 
publicly available on cambridge.gov. I would also like to see an itemized listing of all equipment, materials, tools, and 
property owned by the Cambridge Police Department, as compiled by the City Manager. As a Cambridge citizen, I 
believe the general public should be able to easily access detailed information about our Police Department's privileges, 
obligations, capabilities, and equipment.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Dr. Melanie O. Matson

Dear Cambridge City Council,

City Council; Clerk
Support PO#1 and PO#9 at the 6/22 council meeting

My name is Maya and I am a Cambridge resident (90 Putnam ave, apt 4). I am writing to you today to urge you to 
support policy order 1 (to require all collective bargaining agreements to be made public) and policy order 9 (to require 
an itemized list of all equipment owned by the Cambridge police department) as written at tonight’s city council meeting 
(6/22). 

These two actions would help to provide more accountability and transparency to residents of Cambridge on policing in 
our city. Moreover, keeping this information private only serves to entrench the power that the police department has. 
Making this information public would be a small step in leveling the playing field for conversations on policing in 
Cambridge.

Thank you for your time and consideration, Maya Talwar-Hebert

Support for PO#1 and PO#9

I'm a voting Cambridge resident (16 Magnolia Ave Unit 2) and I would like to voice my strong support for Policy Orders 1 
and 9 on the docket for tonight's City Council meeting. This is a baby step in the right direction of keeping our city 
accountable for where our funds go and why, especially as it concerns the police.

I was particularly unsettled by Commissioner Bard's testimony a few weeks ago that Cambridge has no military-grade 
equipment. When Councillor Zondervan objected to this "factually incorrect statement", he was never recognized by the 
chair and the record was never corrected.

I sincerely hope that the passage of PO9 will illuminate the facts for all Cambridge residents.

Further, I would like to express my disappointment at the Council's inability to even hold a vote on PO #133 on June 10, 
which was the most tepid and inoffensive expression of public outcry to defund the police. The petty name-calling and 
personal attacks I witnessed on the floor were an embarrassment to our city and to the Black Lives Matter movement.

Let's put ego and personal squabbles aside. Listen to your constituents. Yes, even the thousands of so-called 
"inauthentic"(?!) people who called in and wrote in a few weeks ago. Even the thousands who marched in sweltering 
heat this past weekend. We are paying attention. We will remember what you do, and what you fail to do.

To the Cambridge City Council, 
 
Attached and below is the statement that I am planning to make during the Public Comment period at this 
evening's City Council meeting.  I have signed up to speak.

PUBLIC COMMENT: Cambridge City Council meeting 

June 22, 2020 – Commenting on Policy Order/Resolution #6 

Good evening.  I am Margery Davies.  I live at 35 William Street in Cambridge, and I am a member of Mothers Out Front. 

Thank you, Madame Mayor, for this opportunity to speak in support of Policy Order Resolution #6 (POR 2020 #143), put 
forward by Councillors Zondervan, Carlone, Nolan, and Sobranho‐Wheeler.  This resolution proposes that the City 
Council go on record in support of the Stop the Money Pipeline movement, calling on the insurance industry to stop 
investing in fossil fuels.  In doing so, the City Council would be joining the 38 Massachusetts state legislators who have 
already called on Liberty Mutual to stop investing in fossil fuels. 

This is a small, doable step, and the need to move beyond fossil fuels is urgent. 

Climate change is a crisis, a crisis that is deeply connected to issues of public health and race.  

  As you are all aware, the COVID‐19 public health crisis has had a disparate impact on communities of 
color and low‐income communities.  Members of these communities have higher rates of some 
underlying health conditions, such as asthma and heart disease, that are directly connected to 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions – both CO2 and small particulates. Members of these communities 
are more likely to live in dense urban neighborhoods, where urban “heat islands” and pollution from 
vehicular traffic have a negative impact on health.  

  

  Because of years of residential segregation by race, brought about by formal governmental policies, by 
the “informal” operation of the market, and by the behavior of individuals, members of communities 
of color have not had the choice to live in neighborhoods that have fewer highways, less air pollution,

Addressing climate change and environmental injustice is one part of what we need to do to address social inequalities.  

Voting in favor of Policy Order Resolution #6 ‐‐ going on record to ask the insurance industry to divest from fossil fuels ‐‐ 
is a small, doable step.  There are many doable steps, both small and large, to be taken.  Please take this one.  Thank 
you.

Support for PO 1 and 9

I wanted to write to support PO#1 which would require all collective bargaining agreements with the City to be 
made publicly available on the City's web site, cambridge.gov, including the police union contract.

PO #9 which would require the City Manager to compile and provide to the City Council an itemized list of all 
materials, tools, and property owned by the Cambridge Police Department.

Support for PO #1 and PO #9

I'm a Cambridge resident living in Avon Hill. I am writing to express my support for PO #1 on tonight's agenda, to make 
collective bargaining agreements publicly available on the City's web site, and PO #9, to itemize the property owned by 
the Cambridge Police Department. 

The public deserves to know how our tax dollars are being spent, what agreements the city has entered into. This is 
particularly pertinent to the current conversation around police budgets. It is impossible to make informed decisions 
about how to apportion money without a thorough understanding how the money is currently being used.

We also deserve to know the capabilities of the police department regardless of whether their tools came from the 
taxpayer's money or from some other source. In recent days, Cambridge police have made statements such as "we don't 
have tanks" which have been shown to be either false or misleading. The public needs to be able to fact check 
statements that pertain to our safety.

Statement: Alison King, Policy #1/ #9

I am a resident of Cambridge living at 564 Green Street. I am emailing in concern to policy #1 and #9.

Given the national conversation about police brutality, I believe we need to re-evaluate our approach to policing in 
Cambridge. I urge you to consider policy order #1 to require all collective bargaining agreements to be made public. This 
would increase transparency within our city and allow residents to effectively advocate for better police monitoring.

Also, I urge you to consider policy #9 to provide an itemized list of all materials, tools and property owned by the policy. 
This again would increase transparency and enable residents to monitor police policies and strategies to ensure it 
reflects the needs of residents they serve.

Thank you,

Comment on POR 2020 #138 and POR 2020 #146

My name is Jonah Ko, and I am a voter residing at 26 Inman St, Cambridge, MA 02139. As a supporter of the Black Lives 
Matter movement for reducing police violence against my Black neighbors, I was pleased to learn that Council voted to 
reallocate some of the potential budget increase squared off for the Cambridge Police Department.

I learned that  POR 2020 #138 (PO #1) and POR 2020 #146 (PO #9) were up for discussion today. The urgency of our 
need for transparency and accountability to prevent abuse of power is apparent -- I'm surprised that these proposed 
measures were not already standard. I am especially concerned about the militarization of our law enforcement (such 
as the Lenco BearCat and high powered sniper rifles in the CPD arsenal), and the fact that my fellow residents and I have 
no insight into why someone thought these things were necessary

Please vote to pass both orders!

Thanks,
Jonah

Policy Order #1 and #9

I’m emailing to show my support for Policy Orders 1 and 9. Stronger oversight in every aspect of policing is needed to 
begin a more open dialogue about public safety here in Cambridge. These policy orders will also serve to further my 
trust in your commitment to accountability in the CPD. There are many worrying gaps in public accountability of and 
accessibility of information about CPD and I see these policy orders as beginning steps.

June 22nd Policy Orders #1 & #9

I'm writing to express my thoughts on these two policy orders.

PO #1: Collective Bargaining Agreements should be public record. The police union contract should be public record. The 
public has a right to see & understand these agreements as they directly affect their health and safety. The police unions 
are powerful and their job is not to protect and serve, it is to protect their membership. This is understandable, but 
there needs to be checks and balances. Making these agreements public and allowing them to enter the public discourse 
can only be a good thing. Transparency is important.

PO #2: The city manager and the city council should know what materials, tools, and property are owned by the 
Cambridge Police Department. This is what the budget is being spent on, in part, right? How can we continue the 
conversation about police reform without knowing what the police even own or what they are intending to spend their 
funding on?

Thank you for considering what I've had to say here.

Brendan

Upcoming Policy Orders on Transparency and Policing

My name is Simon Silvan-Recht and I am a lifelong resident of the city of Cambridge. I'm writing to express my support 
for Policy Order #1 (Making our City's collective bargaining agreements public) and Policy Order #9 (Itemized list of CPD 
materials, technologies, properties), because I sincerely believe that increased transparency in our municipal 
government can go a long way in reducing the socio-political tensions emerging around systemic racism and police 
brutality that has gripped the nation and the residents of Cambridge. We need clarity and accountability from our public 
officials during this time, especially as CPD has attempted to distance itself from the scrutiny that we have placed on it 
during this volatile time. We deserve to know how well resourced and how well paid our Police force is during this time 
of governmental crisis. Please vote in favor of these orders so that we as a municipality may begin the process of 
reconciliation, healing, and growth. Thank you!

Sincerely,

Simon Silvan-Recht, Age 23, North Cambridge 02140

Dear Cambridge City Council Members:  

My name is Colleen McDermott, and I am writing in support of two of the policy orders being discussed at today's 
council meeting. PO #1 (POR 2020 #138) and PO #9 (POR 2020 #146) would both significantly increase the

the people it is supposed to protect.

Support of Policy Orders #1 and #9 for 6/22 Council Meeting

I am writing to express my support of policy orders #1 and #9, which are to be discussed at tonight's Cambridge City 
Council Meeting..

PO #1: Disentangling the Cambridge Police Department from all of the areas of life in our city requires transparency as
its first step. Disclosing all collective bargaining agreements made with the City would allow us to evaluate the type of 
relationship our city has with its police force. Now is the moment to take actions like these so that we can use the 
momentum of today's political awakening to ensure a safe, just, and equitable way of life for all of our city's residents 
and visitors.

PO #9: I personally have looked through the database compiled by The Marshall Project for all of the military equipment 
purchased by Cambridge through the 1033 Program. I was relieved to find that Cambridge (along with many of the other 
cities and towns I frequently visit or have lived in before) did not have the kind of tanks, rocket launchers, and other 
weapons of war that I've seen highlighted on Twitter as the most dangerous results of this program. I would be curious 
to learn what other equipment my city's police department DOES have access to. I believe this is a fair request, since my 
tax dollars purchased that equipment and the equipment is intended to protect and serve me.

Thank you for your consideration.

Gentlemen / Ladies:

RE: The latest outrage SECRETLY being pushed by destructive Cambridge Interests, Commuter Rail on the Grand Junction.

I am writing individually and as Chair of Friends of the White Geese, an Attorney General registered non profit defending the Charles 
River, its animals and environment since 2001.
 
Enclosed is a photo of the most visible of the many free animals under constant attack by destructive people in Cambridge, MA, the 
Cambridge City Council and the Department of Conservation and Recreation. These are the Charles River White Geese. In the 
background of the picture is the Grand Junction Railroad Bridge, a key part of their habitat. They have lived on the Charles River for 
39 years. For most of that period, their habitat has extended for a mile of the Charles River centered on the BU Bridge. 

Destructiveness of the DCR, the Cambridge City Council, and their friends has restricted their habitat to an area which was their 
nesting area. Massive destruction of vegetation, habitat and food has been to normal from these destructive people.
 

I understand you are having a meeting this coming Monday, June 22, 2020 at 11 am.

I further understand that very destructive people in Cambridge persist in trying to sneak through the I90 project the horribly 
irresponsible concept of Commuter Rail on the Grand Junction.

MassDOT has done a study on this matter which was PUBLICLY communicated and received strong negative comment. MassDOT 
responded to that strong negative comment and to its detailed analysis which found that commuter rail on the Grand Junction would 
have no value to anybody except for Kendall Square developers.

So a bunch of destructive people are trying to sneak it through the I90 project which PUBLICLY has nothing to do with commuter rail 
on the Grand Junction. EXACTLY WHERE THESE DESTRUCTIVE PEOPLE TRY TO SNEAK THINGS IN.
 
Such a project would be highly destructive to animal habitat, trees and the environment.
I have posted an analysis of these people’s “achievements” on the Charles River at The Destruction of Memorial Drive, Cambridge, 
MA, USA, January - February 2016, Final Cut

The Destruction of Memorial Drive, Cambridge, 
MA, USA, January - Februar...

. In January 2016, they achieved the destruction of more than a hundred excellent trees between the BU and Longfellow Bridge AS
SECRETLY AS POSSIBLE, business as usual.

Currently they are fighting for and in the process of the destruction of 59+ mostly excellent trees at Magazine Beach. Friends of the 
White Geese, of which I am chair, has strongly objected to this destruction in many communications. The key letter publishes the 
Department of Conservation and Recreation’s destruction plans with photos of doomed trees. That letter is posted at 
http://focrwg.com/agenda1.html. Significant destruction has occurred. Destruction of animal habitat at the banks of the Charles River 
has been SNEAKED THROUGH AS SECRETLY AS POSSIBLE in votes of the Cambridge City Council.

Related to this destruction, the key destroyer proceeded with poisoning the Charles River in December 2017, acting as agent for the 
DCR, WITH CAMBRIDGE ASSISTANCE.
Here is my original objection: http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=1&ID=1874&Inline=True
, pages 146 to 155.

In 1999, the DCR, Cambridge and the Charles River Poisoner achieved a declaration of a public health emergency based on this 
irresponsible behavior. We summarized that outrage in our letter to the Cambridge City Council posted on line at 
https://charlesriverwhitegeeseblog.blogspot.com/2019/08/charles-river-poisons-algae-blight.html

.   The DCR’s bragging about the destruction is posted at https://charlesriverwhitegeeseblog.blogspot.com/2019/09/state-agency-
admits-to-poisoning.html

.
The City Council letter versions of these blog posts were received by them at their meeting on September 9, 2019.

The City Council showed their opinion of the poisoning of the Charles River by voting funds to subsidize “environmental planning” 
by her which are initial steps toward destroying the excellent grove across from the MicroCenter.

I summarized after destruction the destruction of the Charles by the Charles River Poisoner at Developer Hated NON PAID FOR 
Vegetation Thrives on Charles River. Charles River Poisoner Rewarded by Cambridge City Council.

.

 
They are trying to sneak in further massive destruction between the BU Bridge and the BU Boathouse. Destruction would include the 
excellent woods east of the BU Bridge. That was included in the plans implemented in January 2016, but it was not done then. A 
detailed analysis of this project is included in the video, link above, and at 
http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=1&ID=2121&Inline=True
, pages 171 to 180. The DCR conducted a fraudulent “public meeting” on the project announced as ending going east at the BU 
Bridge. The slides showed it extending to this excellent woods.

The plans show EVERY TREE BUT ONE being destroyed in this woods.

MassDOT has been often active as the adult in the room with two destructive children, Cambridge and the DCR. 
The fight to sneak in this outrageous proposal have been part of that.

I have been active in the planning for the I90 project. MassDOT is to be commended for standing up to repeated attempts to 
SECRETLY expand the scope of this project.

I have participated to stand up to the outrages from these very destructive people in Cambridge. I have decades of experience in 
transportation planning by the MBTA. I have two years employment in mid / lower lever railroad management with exposure to 
pretty much all aspects of railroading.

The I90 project has benefitted from my experience in two major positive changes:

1. It was my idea to close the left turn from the Soldiers Field Road off ramp to the River Street Bridge and to replace it with direct 
connection from Soldiers Field Road to the main planning area east of the hotel complex.

2. Appointees of the City of Cambridge voted to kill the right turn as well. This turn is of major importance to people throughout the 
City of Cambridge. I objected and did a little organizing. MassDOT has been kind enough to save the right turn.

MassDOT has resembled the adult in the room with two destructive children (Cambridge and the DCR) in very many Charles River 
issues. The Charles River has greatly benefitted form the responsible, constructive behavior of MassDOT. One of the most important 
areas of benefit has been killing the irresponsible initiatives of destructive Cambridge interests has been MassDOT’s standing up to 
outrages such as the current attempts.

By legislative vote, MassDOT should replace the DCR on the Charles River. Removal of the DCR in favor of MassDOT would be a 
breath of fresh air.

Testimony of Edward Woll,  
79 Dana Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, Tel 617-395-0208,  
individually and on behalf of Cambridge Mothers Out Front, 
during the Public Comment Period of the City Council on June 22, 2020 
(https://cambridgema.zoom.us/j/97895847144) 
in support of 

Policy Order #6: That the City Council goes on record in support of the Stop The Money 
Pipeline movement calling on the insurance industry to not insure or invest in fossil fuels. 

Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of Policy Order #6 that the City Council go on 
record in support of the Stop The Money Pipeline movement calling on the insurance industry, 
and specifically Liberty Mutual, not to insure or invest in fossil fuel companies that  has been 
proposed by Councilor Zondervan, Councilor Carlone, Councilor Nolan, Councilor Sobrinho-
Wheeler POR 2020 #143. 

The Cambridge City Council has a long and consistent history of combating climate change, 
advancing clean and renewable energy initiatives and fighting environmental injustice and also 
supporting legislation that pursues those goals. This resolution, Policy Order #6, is a consistent 
and necessary adjunct to that history by directly addressing corporate responsibility for the 
damage to our environment. 

Some of the City Council’s initiatives are referred to in the proposed resolution. Others include 
being the first municipality in the state to issue resolutions supporting:  

• 

the pioneering gas leaks legislation Ch, 149, Acts of 2014, An Act Relative to Natural Gas 
Leaks, a safety bill, requires gas companies to report annually the location and date of the 
over 20,000 gas leaks statewide in 2015. POR 2016 #149. 

 

•  passage of An Act for utility transition to using renewable energy (FUTURE), the 
FUTURE Act, H.2849/S.1940, which is now before the state legislature’s Joint 
Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, POR 2019 #178. 

 
Cambridge City Council also resolved to oppose construction of the Weymouth compressor 
station and using Massachusetts as a fracked gas highway to Canadian liquid natural gas 
exporting terminals as part of the Atlantic Bridge project, POR 2019 #157. Policy Order POR 
2014 #109 urges the legislature to support the goal of 100% clean and renewable energy in 
Cambridge, including in building energy use and transportation, by 2035. Another Policy Order 
Resolution supported wind energy in May 2016. The list is long and admirable. 
 
Our City’s history and culture align with calling on the insurance industry and Liberty Mutual to 
stop underwriting fossil fuel projects that damage people’s ability to have clean air, clean water, 
and clean earth. In addition, Liberty Mutual’s and other insurance companies’ investment 
policies and practices are harming people’s health and wellbeing by providing investment dollars 
to the fossil fuel industry. Use of any insurance premium dollars paid to Liberty Mutual that fund 
perpetuation of extraction and use of fossil fuels even violates Liberty Mutual’ s stated purpose:

“At Liberty Mutual, the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and the 
communities where we live and work are our primary concern.” 
 
Although we are assured that Cambridge self-insures and is not paying premium dollars directly 
to Liberty Mutual, our inquiry should not stop there. We need to be clear that the City of  
Cambridge is not indirectly supporting Liberty Mutual by asking if the entities who do work or 
supply services, equipment and goods to Cambridge have as an insurer Liberty Mutual or 
another insurer who is a major investor in the fossil fuel industry. 
 
It is anomalous to be fighting pollution and environmental injustice in Cambridge only to 
contribute, even indirectly, to fund a company like Liberty Mutual, which is the largest 
underwriter of fossil fuel projects in the world. We do not want our tax dollars flowing indirectly 
into Liberty Mutual or another insurance company and funding those policies and practices as we 
pay our suppliers. 
 
As an actual Liberty Mutual customer, Somerville is a significant voice, and its City Council 
adopted a similar resolution  on June 11, 2020. Cambridge can also speak out, clearly and 
emphatically to those in our community and those of our suppliers who are significant customers 
of Liberty Mutual that our community is harmed by the pollution, degraded living conditions, 
and damage that Liberty Mutual and other insurance companies that invest in the fossil fuel 
industry perpetuate in their underwriting and investing.

These are two small steps in the right direction, and their passage would increase government transparency and enable 
better democratic oversight of our local PD, giving the public access to information we need to be fully informed and

Re: Please Vote in Favor of Policy Order #7 to reduce the police budget and redirect 
funds

Dear Cambridge City Councillors, Thank you all for what you have done. I urge you to please go further. The $2.5 million 
compromise is a significant step in the right direction, yet it is not adequate and less than what your community 
demanded. I understand that the window may have closed on the city budget for this year, but I urge you to keep these 
issues a top priority for next year's budget, and in the mean time to do everything in your power to push for other further 
measures beyond this year's budget such as: 1) the excellent recommendations proposed by the Moses family in their 
open letter signed by hundreds of residents, 2) identify the spending priorities with community input, prioritizing the 
recommendations of Black residents, for the money saved by reducing the Police Dept. budget - i.e. schools, mental 
health & social services, community programs for youth, more community health initiatives, services for homeless folks, 
etc., 3) conduct a further in-depth review of the line items of the police budget to determine where additional cuts could be 
made next time, 4) before next year's budgeting process, assess and release publicly a list of services currently being 
provided by police that the council proposes should instead over time be provided by other kinds of trained professionals 
like social workers, health professionals, and mental health professionals so that we can start moving more money away 
from the police and toward these important services in future year's budgets, 5) ensuring the police department returns 
military grade weapons to the federal armed services, 6) reducing the number of officers carrying guns when it is not 
necessary. Thank you all for your consideration and hard work on these important issues. Best, Claire Walsh

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Carlone, Councillor Simmons, Councillor McGovern, 
Councillor Nolan, and Councillor Toomey, My name is Claire Walsh. I’m contacting you as a resident of 
Cambridge (140 Columbia St.) to urge you to vote in favor of Policy Order #7 put forth by Councillors 
Sobrinho-Wheeler and Zondervan to reallocate a significant amount of the proposed police department 
funding to essential human services, which are under threat during this pandemic. I would like to reiterate my 
support for this order that I shared in the emails below earlier this week. I hope you will seriously consider 
voting in favor of this order today as a good first step. Then I hope you will consider taking further measures 
beyond it such as a further in-depth review of the police budget to determine whether additional cuts should
be made, assessing whether there are services currently being provided by police that should instead be 
provided by other kinds of trained professionals like social workers, health professionals, and mental health 
professionals, returning military grade weapons to the federal armed services, reducing cop presence in 
schools, reducing the number of police who carry guns, along with the suggestions proposed by the Moses 
family. 

Your community has spoken clearly in favor of Policy Order #7. Almost 2,000 people sent emails to the 
Council supporting Policy Order #7, and over 250 supporters testified at Monday night’s meeting in support. 
People across the country are taking to the streets to demand an end to the murders of Black Americans like 
George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police officers. Policy Order #7 answers these demands 
with real and lasting change in the form of decreased funds for systemic police violence, and increased funds 
for health and human services that protect and empower Black and Brown communities in areas like housing, 
health and mental health, education, and/or jobs for youth. I agree that our Black community members who 
would like to give input should have a big say in where and which kinds of services the redirected funds go to 
specifically. 

I ask that you do everything in your power to respect the community’s clear calls for justice and change, and 
vote for Policy Order #7 and vote against any weakening amendments to it—especially those that

I support policy order 7 currently being discussed in the city council meeting as a good first step and urge the 
councillors to reduce the police budget by an even larger amount than $4.1 million and redirect the funds to social
services identified as priorities by our Black community members. Thank you.

Dear Cambridge City Councillors,

I'm writing as a concerned Cambridge resident at 140 Columbia St. In my opinion, the Cambridge police 
receive far too large a budget relative to other more important services that empower and uplift Black and 
Brown communities in our city. It's time to reduce the police budget and reinvest the money in expanding 
affordable housing, mental health and health services, and effective programs for creating economic 
opportunities for young people like summer jobs programs.
I am calling on you to:
1. Reject the $4.1 million requested increase in the police budget.
2. Instead decrease the police budget by at least the same amount if not more.
3. Use the money to invest in our communities, including housing, health and mental health, and/or youth 
jobs, with affordable housing being the most important.

Police murders of Black people across the country reflect the larger violence that police departments and 
prisons commit against Black communities every day. We need to defund police departments across the 
country and reinvest in Black and Brown communities. Just as Minneapolis is cutting the police budget to 
reinvest in community-led health and safety, we must move funds from the Cambridge Police Department 
back into Cambridge communities.

Thanks very much for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Claire

Testimony of Edward Woll,  
79 Dana Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, Tel 617-395-0208,  
individually and on behalf of Cambridge Mothers Out Front, 
during the Public Comment Period of the City Council on June 22, 2020 
(https://cambridgema.zoom.us/j/97895847144) 
in support of 

Policy Order #6: That the City Council goes on record in support of the Stop The Money 
Pipeline movement calling on the insurance industry to not insure or invest in fossil fuels. 

Thank you for the opportunity to testify in support of Policy Order #6 that the City Council go on 
record in support of the Stop The Money Pipeline movement calling on the insurance industry, 
and specifically Liberty Mutual, not to insure or invest in fossil fuel companies that  has been 
proposed by Councilor Zondervan, Councilor Carlone, Councilor Nolan, Councilor Sobrinho-
Wheeler POR 2020 #143. 

The Cambridge City Council has a long and consistent history of combating climate change, 
advancing clean and renewable energy initiatives and fighting environmental injustice and also 
supporting legislation that pursues those goals. This resolution, Policy Order #6, is a consistent 
and necessary adjunct to that history by directly addressing corporate responsibility for the 
damage to our environment. 

Some of the City Council’s initiatives are referred to in the proposed resolution. Others include 
being the first municipality in the state to issue resolutions supporting:  

• 

the pioneering gas leaks legislation Ch, 149, Acts of 2014, An Act Relative to Natural Gas 
Leaks, a safety bill, requires gas companies to report annually the location and date of the 
over 20,000 gas leaks statewide in 2015. POR 2016 #149. 

 

•  passage of An Act for utility transition to using renewable energy (FUTURE), the 
FUTURE Act, H.2849/S.1940, which is now before the state legislature’s Joint 
Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy, POR 2019 #178. 

 
Cambridge City Council also resolved to oppose construction of the Weymouth compressor 
station and using Massachusetts as a fracked gas highway to Canadian liquid natural gas 
exporting terminals as part of the Atlantic Bridge project, POR 2019 #157. Policy Order POR 
2014 #109 urges the legislature to support the goal of 100% clean and renewable energy in 
Cambridge, including in building energy use and transportation, by 2035. Another Policy Order 
Resolution supported wind energy in May 2016. The list is long and admirable. 
 
Our City’s history and culture align with calling on the insurance industry and Liberty Mutual to 
stop underwriting fossil fuel projects that damage people’s ability to have clean air, clean water, 
and clean earth. In addition, Liberty Mutual’s and other insurance companies’ investment 
policies and practices are harming people’s health and wellbeing by providing investment dollars 
to the fossil fuel industry. Use of any insurance premium dollars paid to Liberty Mutual that fund 
perpetuation of extraction and use of fossil fuels even violates Liberty Mutual’ s stated purpose:

“At Liberty Mutual, the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and the 
communities where we live and work are our primary concern.” 
 
Although we are assured that Cambridge self-insures and is not paying premium dollars directly 
to Liberty Mutual, our inquiry should not stop there. We need to be clear that the City of  
Cambridge is not indirectly supporting Liberty Mutual by asking if the entities who do work or 
supply services, equipment and goods to Cambridge have as an insurer Liberty Mutual or 
another insurer who is a major investor in the fossil fuel industry. 
 
It is anomalous to be fighting pollution and environmental injustice in Cambridge only to 
contribute, even indirectly, to fund a company like Liberty Mutual, which is the largest 
underwriter of fossil fuel projects in the world. We do not want our tax dollars flowing indirectly 
into Liberty Mutual or another insurance company and funding those policies and practices as we 
pay our suppliers. 
 
As an actual Liberty Mutual customer, Somerville is a significant voice, and its City Council 
adopted a similar resolution  on June 11, 2020. Cambridge can also speak out, clearly and 
emphatically to those in our community and those of our suppliers who are significant customers 
of Liberty Mutual that our community is harmed by the pollution, degraded living conditions, 
and damage that Liberty Mutual and other insurance companies that invest in the fossil fuel 
industry perpetuate in their underwriting and investing. 
 
Thank you,

Public comment on Policy Order Resolution #6 -- City Council meeting, June 22, 2020
City Council public comment on POR #6 -- 2020-06-22.docx

To the Cambridge City Council, 
 
Attached and below is the statement that I am planning to make during the Public Comment period at this 
evening's City Council meeting.  I have signed up to speak. 
 
Best wishes, 
 
Margery Davies

Cambridge, MA  02139 
 
 
PUBLIC COMMENT: Cambridge City Council meeting 

June 22, 2020 – Commenting on Policy Order/Resolution #6 

Good evening.  I am Margery Davies.  I live at 35 William Street in Cambridge, and I am a member of Mothers Out Front. 

Thank you, Madame Mayor, for this opportunity to speak in support of Policy Order Resolution #6 (POR 2020 #143), put 
forward by Councillors Zondervan, Carlone, Nolan, and Sobranho‐Wheeler.  This resolution proposes that the City 
Council go on record in support of the Stop the Money Pipeline movement, calling on the insurance industry to stop 
investing in fossil fuels.  In doing so, the City Council would be joining the 38 Massachusetts state legislators who have 
already called on Liberty Mutual to stop investing in fossil fuels. 

This is a small, doable step, and the need to move beyond fossil fuels is urgent. 

Climate change is a crisis, a crisis that is deeply connected to issues of public health and race.  

  As you are all aware, the COVID‐19 public health crisis has had a disparate impact on communities of 
color and low‐income communities.  Members of these communities have higher rates of some 
underlying health conditions, such as asthma and heart disease, that are directly connected to 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions – both CO2 and small particulates. Members of these communities 
are more likely to live in dense urban neighborhoods, where urban “heat islands” and pollution from 
vehicular traffic have a negative impact on health.  

  

  Because of years of residential segregation by race, brought about by formal governmental policies, by 
the “informal” operation of the market, and by the behavior of individuals, members of communities 
of color have not had the choice to live in neighborhoods that have fewer highways, less air pollution,

or more trees.  Just as racial inequality means that these communities are more affected by COVID‐19, 
racial inequality means that they are more affected by climate change.  

3.27.a

Both the COVID‐19 public health crisis and the attention that has been focused on racism as a crisis have laid bare many 
basic social inequalities in our country, just in case people weren’t already aware of them.  I do not think that any of you 
on the Cambridge City Council have been unaware of these issues, and I know that you want to address them.  
Addressing climate change and environmental injustice is one part of what we need to do to address social inequalities.  

Voting in favor of Policy Order Resolution #6 ‐‐ going on record to ask the insurance industry to divest from fossil fuels ‐‐ 
is a small, doable step.  There are many doable steps, both small and large, to be taken.  Please take this one.  Thank 
you.

Support for POR 2020 #146

My name is Daniel Janini. I am a resident of East Cambridge, and a PhD student at Harvard. I am writing to express 
support for policy order #146. It is concerning to me that the city council does not already have a list of equipment 
owned by the Cambridge Police Department. In particular, I am concerned about the Police Department owning military 
equipment or violent equipment that is not needed. Transparency is the very least the police owe the community they 
claim to serve. I hope the other council members can join Councillor Quinton Zondervan and Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-
Wheeler in supporting this policy order.

Public comment for 6/22 council meeting

Hello, I have requested to provide public comment at tonight's meeting, and wanted to submit it in writing as well.

"Hello, my name is Kevin Wentworth, I live at 45 Pemberton Street, Unit 2, in North Cambridge. I’m 
commenting on policy orders 1 and 9. Instituting these policy orders will help to provide further transparency to 
one of the largest non-education line items on our city’s budget, giving greater insight into the workings of the 
police department. Detailed information is one of the best assets the council and its citizens can have to 
ensure a better future and more oversight of the city’s police force, particularly when considering the strength 
of police unions across the nation."

Supporting Policy Order #6 Cambridge City Council meeting June 22, 2020

I am writing in support of Policy Order #6, that the City Council goes on record in support of the Stop The Money 
Pipeline movement calling on Liberty Mutual to not insure or invest in fossil fuels. Thank you to Councillors Zondervan, 
Carlone, Nolan, and Sobrinho-Wheeler.

The Covid 19 Pandemic has shown us what happens when we ignore science and do not act swiftly to curb a crisis before 
it is totally out of control. We have to take immediate actions to halt catastrophic climate and health impacts. The City of 
Cambridge has taken many actions to combat climate change. An important next action will be adopting Policy Order #6 
which will send a critical message to Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.

The Fossil Fuel expansion will continue unabated as long as it is insured. Energy companies have to purchase insurance 
to cover the cost of liabilities during construction and operations. Liberty Mutual continues to insure oil and gas with no 
restrictions and invests billions in the fossil fuels industry, even while most large insurance companies now refuse to do 
so.

States and municipalities must send an important message that insurance companies can no longer promote or insure 
the fossil fuel industry, but must invest in renewable infrastructure and public programs that prioritize communities 
endangered by fossil fuel investments.

The Cambridge City Council has taken many important steps to combat climate change. Support of Policy Order#6 will 
be a critical step.

Thank you very much,

Sharon de Vos

In support of PO #1 and PO #9

I'm Banti Gheneti and I'm a registered voter living at 17 Pleasant Pl, Cambridge, MA 02139.

I wanted to write to you in support of PO #1 and PO #9 being discussed at the city council meeting today. 

As a Cambridge resident of eight years, a supporter of the movement for Black Lives and a believer in the need to 
defund and reform police practices, I have been wary of the lack of transparency and accountability around policing 
practices around Massachusetts. In Cambridge, these measures are needed so that the public can be aware of the 
privileges and resources entrusted to our police department, empowering us to ensure these are aligned with our vision 
for a safe and racially-inclusive environment.

Written comment on PO 2

Good afternoon.
My name is Luis Mejias and I’m a resident at 18 Plymouth St. I have degrees in City planning and transportation 
engineering, but I’m here today representing myself as a resident.

I am writing to support policy order number 2 asking the City Manager implement the pilot program to close Central 
Square to vehicles on Sunday, and in fact ask that it be done on Saturdays as well. We’ve lost almost 100 residents due 
to COVID, and now our businesses are dying. What’s the benefit of living in the city if our local spots close?

We can help our businesses by giving them the room to spread out. I think it would be easy to keep Central Square open 
for buses and emergency vehicles, but also increase space for pedestrians and outdoor restaurant and retail. We need 
the space to spread out so people aren’t crowded onto our too-narrow sidewalks.  

We also need to implement this idea elsewhere in Cambridge, for example Inman Square stretching into E Cambridge.

These ideas and the shared streets program are taking too long to implement. Other cities have implemented shared 
streets, pop up cycle lanes, etc. practically overnight. I’ve written two thoughtful letters (on 5/14 and 6/8) to the City 
Manager on this issue and have not received any response from his office.

My mother, who uses a wheelchair and lives in Central Square, has not left her apartment since March because she has 
pre-existing conditions and she’s terrified to be near other people. If I am walking down the street and someone comes 
by, I can pop off the curb to pass them safely assuming I am not hit by a speeding car (think Prospect Street). In a 
wheelchair, she has no place to go if the narrow sidewalks are full of people. I witnessed another wheelchair user get 
honked at by a car on Lambert Street by Millers River Apts because he was riding in the street due to the poor width and 
condition of the sidewalk. How sad is it that vulnerable people have to put themselves at risk or be homebound because 
we are unwilling to act?

The pandemic is not going to ease up; we’re witnessing its emergence in new areas across the country and we will 
potentially see another wave here. We cannot wait for that day to come to plan and implement these changes. The 
time to do it was two months ago, but today is better than tomorrow.

Thank you for taking my comment.

Hello Cambridge City Council,

Ben Sandler <benasand@gmail.com>
Monday, June 22, 2020 6:54 PM
City Council; Clerk
Policy Orders

My name is Ben Sandler, and I am writing in support of two policy orders on tonight's agenda.

PO#1 to require all collective bargaining agreements with the City to be made publicly available on the city's website, 
including the police union contract, and PO #9 where the city manager must compile a list of all material, tools, and 
property owned by the Cambridge police department.

These are simple ways to help the citizens of Cambridge better understand how the cities relationship with the police 
department works, and I can think of no legitimate reason why the members of the community should not be entitled to 
that information.

Thank you,
Ben Sandler

premature births and, ultimately attracted her to the field of public health and school 
nursing; and 
 
Susan joined the Cambridge Public Health Department in 1993 as a school nurse in the 
Cambridge Public Schools (CPS) and then served as the Manager of School Health 
Services for 10 years. During her tenure, Susan expanded access to care in the schools

and Fitness Progress Reports for CPS families; developed the CPS Food Allergy

In 2010, Susan was promoted to Senior Director of Public Health Nursing Services,

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

In recent years, the City has frequently been asked by business owners in Central 
Square to consider piloting a “Car Free Sunday” program during the summer months, 
to allow restaurants to establish outdoor dining on a greater scale than is currently 
possible, to draw more foot traffic to the area, and to bring a sense of vibrancy and 
vitality back to Central Square; and  
 
As the City prepares for the next phase of re-openings in the wake of the Covid-19 
pandemic, in which restaurants will be allowed to re-open with outdoor dining options, 
the need to work with our business community and help entice patrons back into 
supporting our local economy in as safe a manner as possible suggests that the summer 
of 2020 would be the ideal time to revisit such a program, and to see if this might be 
appropriate for other areas of the city; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to 
work with the Central Square Business Association in developing a pilot program that 
will allow Central Square to close to vehicular traffic on Sundays and allow restaurants 
to fully embrace the concept of outdoor dining for the summer months of 2020, and to 
report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge is invested in the health and safety of its unhoused population. 
In the time of COVID-19, the City is providing immediate food and shelter assistance, 
and is pursuing affordable housing zoning changes; and 
 
There is a great need, in between these immediate and long-term solutions, for a space 
that provides centralized aid, connects unhoused residents to resources, and helps them 
move into housing; and 
 
The need for such a centralized space is increasing due to the congregating of 
unhoused residents in Central Square without any day programming, and to their 
exposure to the sharply increasing heat outside, which puts them at risk for heat stroke, 
dehydration, and other grave health problems; and 
 
A cohort of City officials led by Councillor McGovern, including the Mayor, the Vice-
Mayor, the Police Commissioner, the Chief Public Health Officer, the Public Works 
Commissioner, and the Assistant City Manager for Human Services, toured the 
Downtown Day Services Center (“The Center”) in DC in March 2020.   
 
The Center provides a multitude of services, including meals programs, showers, 
laundry, housing services, legal services like ID, employment, records, and case 
management, healthcare, harm reduction services, computers, and entertainment. It 
serves as an exceptional, housing-first model for the City of Cambridge to pursue; 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to identify a climate controlled space 
for a Cambridge Day Services Center for unhoused people; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter no later than the 
regular meeting on June 29th, 2020.

WHEREAS:  The City and Council have taken admirable steps to use good governance and best 

practices in human resources, including making progress in greater diversity in 
hiring in all departments; and 

WHEREAS:  Civil Service is a system that was initially set up to ensure fair hiring practices in 

the 1800s and to provide help in hiring for a range of civic positions which was 
beneficial to professionalizing public sector jobs; and 

WHEREAS:  System delays in scheduling exams can make hiring difficult especially when 
exams are not timely, thereby inhibiting opportunities for advancement; and 
 

WHEREAS:  The Cambridge police and fire departments youth and cadet programs brought 

welcome diversity and applicants from a range of backgrounds, thereby 
contributing to the goals of the council which program would likely not have been 
needed if Civil Service was not in place; and 

WHEREAS:  Many believe the system has outgrown its usefulness and as a result some 

departments of city government are hindered by Civil Service;

Indigenous communities and environmentalists are outspoken against the dangerous 
use of tar sands oil and the harm caused by its water-intensive, destructive extraction

Since 2014, The Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) has been 
planning the Allston Multimodal Improvement Projecti, which will transform road, 
railway, and land use patterns along Interstate 90 just across the river from 
Cambridge, and create new planning opportunities on this side of the river; and 
 
One opportunity is to expand the Grand Junction Railway bridge from a one-track to a 
two-track crossing, which would realize the potential to connect the commercial hub 
of Kendall Square to Boston and MetroWest municipalities such as Framingham and 
Worcester via high-speed regional railii; and 
 
Local advocacy organizations including WalkBoston, the Cambridge I-90 Committee, 
the Conservation Law Foundation, the Charles River Watershed Association, Friends

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:  While phase 2 of the project is not scheduled to commence until 2022, significant 
preparation work has already begun, which in addition to phase 1 of the project is 
leading to serious disruption and inconvenience for neighborhood residents; and 
 
Residents of the immediately impacted neighborhood are faced with constantly 
changing traffic patterns, temporary tow-zones announced no more than 48 hours in 
advance, dangerous conditions for pedestrians, and more; and 
 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic impacts, residents are not 
necessarily using their cars on a regular basis, making 48-hours’ notice via a physical 
sign on the street insufficient, and fees associated with a towing outcome are 
burdensome for residents; and 
 
A section of the sidewalk on Bishop Allen Drive between Columbia Street and 
Douglass Street has been completely closed to pedestrians for quite some time, and 
cars using the road as a cut-through in both directions travel too fast for it to be safe for 
anyone on foot to take the road, creating a dangerous situation where there is only a 
single narrow sidewalk for pedestrians as they attempt to maintain social distancing 
practices while going through this area; and 
 
Bishop Allen Drive from Columbia to Norfolk was converted to a one-way street for 
some time in late 2019, which made things considerably more safe for pedestrians, but 
this restriction has since been removed, despite the ongoing construction; and 
 
As the city moves ahead with this important project, the impact on residents of the 
neighborhood and anyone passing through by foot or bike needs to be considered, and 
a community engagement process that begins in Fall 2020 is too late if preliminary 
work is starting this summer; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to immediately publish a list of all 
upcoming temporary tow-zones in the Port neighborhood and distribute this list to 
residents; and be it further

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

The Cambridge City Council recently declared racism as a Public Health crisis; and 
 
The recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others have elevated the 
conversation around where traditional Public Safety and policing intersects with social 
services, and there has been a national call for alternative emergency responses for 
non-emergency related situations; and 
 
Currently the definition of Public Safety only includes Police, Fire and EMTs, and said 
definition must be redefined to include Public Health and Human Services; and 
 
The Cambridge Police Department is the only response option when non-violent calls 
are received by Emergency Communications Department, calls that involve mental 
health, housing and homelessness issues, grief and trauma response, suicide prevention 
assessment and intervention and others that could be better served by an unarmed 
Public Health and Human Services response; and 
 
The Cambridge Police Department has made tremendous efforts in the last decade to 
intentionally reconceptualize public safety, which currently includes programs 
performed by non-sworn employees such as; social workers who specialize in mental 
health and addiction recovery, domestic violence advocates, an on-staff Child 
Psychologist, and more, and this model would not be intended to replace those 
program, but to enhance and create a co-response alternative model that includes the 
Public Health and Human Services departments; and 
 
Unarmed alternative emergency response programs exist across the country that can 
serve as a model for Cambridge to develop a program that works for our community; 
and 
 
Programs like CAHOOTS (Crisis Assisting Help on the Streets), in Oregon work in 
tandem with Emergency Communications to triage whether traditional Public Safety is 
dispatched, or an unarmed team that is better prepared to perform Health and Human 
Service functions; and

The CAHOOTS model consists of a medic (either a nurse or an EMT), and a crisis 
worker (who has at least several years experience in the mental health field). 
CAHOOTS provides immediate stabilization in case of urgent medical need or 
psychological crisis, assessment, information, referral, advocacy, and (in some cases) 
transportation to the next step in treatment; and 
 
CAHOOTS offers a broad range of services, including but not limited to:

•  Crisis Counseling 
•  Suicide Prevention, Assessment, and Intervention 
•  Conflict Resolution and Mediation 
•  Grief and loss 
•  Substance Abuse 
•  Housing Crisis 
•  First Aid and Non-Emergency Medical Care 
•  Resource Connection and Referrals 
•  Transportation to Services; and 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 
 

 
The City of Cambridge should consider and evaluate an effective, unarmed, Public 
Health and Human service response mechanism, like in Oregon, Miami, Dallas and 
others to redefine what Public Safety looks like, and develop an alternative public 
health response with the ultimate goal of decreasing arrests, increasing connections to 
critical housing, addiction and other services, and ensuring that Public Safety feels safe 
for all residents; therefore now be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Cambridge Police Department, Emergency 
Communications Department, Department of Public Health, Department of Human 
Services and other relevant departments to determine the feasibility of  an alternative 
Public Safety Crisis Response System, which department would be responsible for it, 
and how it would be funded and implemented in FY2022, and report back to the 
Council by September 14th; and be it further  
 
That the City Manager discuss such any alternative with community members.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created financial hardship for many Cambridge residents 
and families; and 
 
Thirty percent of U.S. residents said they have had one or more disruptions in income 
or employment during COVID-19, according to a survey by Gallup released in late 
April; and 
 
Nearly 7% of Cambridge residents are unemployed and experiencing a loss or 
reduction of their income due to COVID-19, which is an alarming difference 
from the 1.9% unemployment rate in January 2020; and 
 
The loss and reduction of income impacts residents’ ability to pay rent and utilities and 
purchase household and food essentials; and 
 
The Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund has assisted over 1,400 of those residents and 
families with rent and utility assistance for 2-3 months; and 
 
The City of Cambridge will be allocating $1,000,000 from the CPA Fund Balance to 
the Community Preservation Act Fund COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program, 
which will provide short-term financial assistance to individuals and families who are 
experiencing financial instability due to the COVID-19 crisis and as a result may be at 
risk of losing their home because they are unable to pay rent; and 
 
Governor Baker issued an eviction moratorium on April 20, 2020 to protect tenants 
during the COVID-19 state of emergency; and 
 
The eviction moratorium expires on August 18, 2020 or 45 days after Governor Baker 
lifts the state of emergency, leaving tenants still experiencing financial distress with 
limited options on maintaining their housing long term; and 
 
The City of Cambridge must formalize our long-term plans to assist tenants as we 
approach the end of the eviction moratorium; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the City’s Housing Liaison and Multi Service 
Center to discuss a variety of long-term housing solutions and tenant protections and 
report back to the City Council on July 27, 2020.
