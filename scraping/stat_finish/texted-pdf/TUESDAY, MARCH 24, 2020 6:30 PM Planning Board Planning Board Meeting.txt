Sitting Members:  Tom Sieniewicz, acting chair. All other 

                  members listed are participating via 

                  teleconference:  Catherine Preston

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Good evening, and welcome to the 

March 24, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  My 

name is Tom Sieniewicz, and I am the Acting Chair for 

tonight's meeting.  We'll begin with an explanation by staff 

of the format for tonight's meeting.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you to the Acting Chair. 

          This meeting is being held virtually, due to 

statewide emergency actions limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles D Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 

2020, amending the Open Meeting Law.   

          Video and audio will be streamed live on the City 

of Cambridge web site and on cable television Channel 22

within Cambridge.  

Meeting Portal.   

          All materials to be discussed are available online 

and linked to the Agenda page for this meeting on the Open 

          Because Planning Board members are participating 

remotely by telephone, all members must identify themselves 

before speaking, and all votes must be taken by roll call.  

          For this meeting, the Board will only be 

conducting matters of general business, and so, no public 

testimony will be taken.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you, Jeff.  Next, we will 

record the attendance for tonight's meeting.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So I will read off the names of 

Planning Board members and ask if we are audible to you, and 

then acknowledge that you are audible to us, and thereby 

present at the meeting. 

          So starting with Louis Bacci, are you on with Tom?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Are we audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, you are.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, and you are audible to us 

and present.

          Nikolas Bowie has indicated that he would not be 

in attendance.  Just to check quickly, is Nikolas Bowie 

present on this audio line?  Nikolas Bowie is marked as 

absent.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you.  The first agenda item 

will be an update from Community Development staff.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you again.  So, as with last 

week's meeting, the agenda for this meeting we expect to be 

pretty straightforward.   

          For all of the six pending special permit cases 

that are currently before the Planning Board.  The 

applicants have provided written agreements to waive the 

statutory timeframes for hearing and decision. 

          Staff have also spoken with all the other 

individuals with General Business --  

          [Noise - "Steven Cohen is leaving the meeting"]    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I will check later to see if Steve 

has resumed his presence on the audio line.   

          Staff have also spoken with all other individuals

with General Business before the Board, to inform them that 

their items will be postponed.  This allows us to 

temporarily suspend all business before the Board, and we'll 

begin rescheduling that business as soon as it's appropriate 

to do so. 

          Assuming the Board completes its business for 

tonight, the meeting we had already scheduled for March 31 

will be canceled.  When we begin scheduling public hearings 

again, notices will be published following normal 

procedures. 

          On another scheduling note, the Board had a public 

hearing scheduled on the Affordable Housing Overlay Zoning 

Petition for April 7.   

          The Ordinance Committee also currently has a 

hearing scheduled for April 14 from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m., and 

that would be for presentation and public comment, with a 

future meeting scheduled for deliberation. 

          After consulting with the Ordinance Committee co-

chairs and the City Clerk, we decided the preferred course 

of action would be for the Planning Board to attend remotely 

we presume the April 14 presentation and comment hearing as 

a joint hearing with the Planning Board and Ordinance

Committee. 

          So that means that the April 7 meeting of the 

Planning Board will also be canceled.  The Board would 

officially open its hearing on that petition on April 14, 

and then the Planning Board deliberation could be scheduled 

for a future date. 

          So that is the schedule update, just as a general 

update for Planning Board members and for the public that 

may be viewing, check cambridgema.gov/covid19 for all of 

latest updates and information related to COVID-19.  Thank 

you.             

at this time.   

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Are there any questions for Jeff 

          [Noise - "Is joining the meeting."] 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Let me just ask, for the person who 

just joined the meeting, can you identify yourself?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Hi, it's Steve.  You got 

disconnected.  I'm just rejoining.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  Just note, then that Steven 

Cohen has rejoined the meeting.  And the Chair had just 

asked if there were any questions for staff.  I'm happy to 

answer.             

9

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  This is Corinne.  My question 

is regarding the city and it's COVID response.  I'm 

wondering if you could direct us to where people who are 

unhoused can find resources -- specifically where they can 

go if they're sick, where they can use the bathroom, now 

that city libraries and other city buildings are closed?  

          And what people who are unhoused are supposed to 

do if they experience symptoms?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Unfortunately, I don't have the 

best information on that.  I would, again, advise going to 

cambridgema.gov/covid19 -- c-o-v-i-d-1-9 -- and otherwise 

contact the City Manager's office for additional information 

to be redirected to a Department or staff that can assist.           

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.             

TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Any further questions for staff?  Hearing 

none, we'll move on to the next item on the agenda, which is 

a waiver of the time for hearing, deliberation and decision 

on Planning Board Case Number 361, an application to 

renovate and rehab the existing building at 711 through 727 

Massachusetts Avenue, and construct an addition for a hotel.
