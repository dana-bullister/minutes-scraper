          Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, 

          Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven A. Cohen, H Theodore 

          Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne 

          Espinoza, and  Nikolas Bowie     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  This is the 

February 11 meeting of the Planning Board, and since we have 

six of us here, we're going to get started.  We have a long 

agenda tonight, so we may have other Board members who join 

us while we're in progress.  But we can get underway, and 

with updates, and start getting the business of the Board 

done, so that we can keep this moving. 

          So with that, let me turn it over to Iram for an 

update from Community Development Department.                

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Good 

evening, everyone.  Tonight's agenda is quite long.  We have 

three public hearings; the first one is on a zoning 

amendment related to the incentive zoning provisions in the 

ordinance, and it essentially is in response to the Nexus 

Study update, which is recommending an increase in the per

square foot set aside.  

          Then we have two special permit hearings 

scheduled, one is 34-36 Hampshire Street, and the second one 

is 541 Mass Ave.   

          February 18, we currently do not have anything on 

the agenda.  But if any matters are to be continued from 

today that could be a time when they would be accommodated.  

So please don't give up the eighteenth just yet. 

          February 25, we have two public hearings 

scheduled, one for 75, 109, 115 Smith Place, and then the 

second is a continued special permit hearing for 1686 Mass 

Ave. 

          The following hearing will be March 10 -- the 

following meeting will be March 10, and will include two 

public hearings on the definition of "family" in the zoning 

ordinance.  That is a citizen zoning petition, and the 

second is continued special permit hearing for 1997 

Cambridge Park Drive. 

          In terms of items of interest from City Council, 

the Ordinance Committee will be holding their hearing on the 

zoning changes that we are discussing today on February 12, 

which is tomorrow, at 5:30, in this room.

          On Tuesday the eighteenth at 5:30, the Ordinance 

Committee will have their hearing on the -- on amending the 

definition of "family" in the ordinance, and the one other 

item potentially of interest is that at Monday night's 

meeting, the City Council moved the Alexandria Zoning to a 

second reading. 

          And last week the -- I think I may have mentioned 

this, but -- I think last week they made  -- the Ordinance 

Committee made a -- forwarded the rezoning on the Harvard 

Square petition with a positive recommendation to the full 

Council. 

          It hasn’t arrived on the Council's agenda just 

yet.  There hasn't been a lot of time for the report.  But 

those are my updates.  Thank you very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Just a 

word or two about our logistics and recording for tonight.  

We are, as usual, being audio and visually recorded.    

          Because of the difference in our setup versus our 

usual home base, our stenographer is relying on the mics in 

front of us all tonight, and therefore they need to be left 

on at all times.  So you can move it away from you when 

you're not speaking, but please don't turn it off.

          Let's see, what else do I need to remind people 

of?  Well, obviously we will be using the screen behind us 

for presentations, so those of us with our backs to it may 

turn our backs to the rest of you at some point, as 

appropriate, and we're all kind of just rolling with this.  

          I want to thank the Staff and -- both our usual 

CDD staff, but also the City Hall staff for the speedy 

transition here.  This is -- getting us set up in our usual 

spot is a big enough challenge, but accommodating us so that 

we can get through as much of this as we can is especially 

appreciated.   

          So with that, okay.  One quick matter, we do have 

the January 28 minutes -- have been submitted and certified, 

so if we can take a -- have a vote to approve those minutes, 

can I have a motion?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved.        

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All those in favor?     

          [ All vote YES ]  It's unanimous.   

          Thank you very much.  All right.  And with that, 

we can open our first public hearing this evening, which, as 

Iram noted, is on the Incentive Zoning Amendment Petition.  

And we will first have a presentation from the Housing

          Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, 

          Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Steven A. Cohen, H Theodore 

          Cohen, Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, Corinne 

          Espinoza and Nikolas Bowie.        

          CHRIS COTTER:  Thank you, Madam Chair, members of 

the Planning Board.  We're happy to be with you this evening 

to talk about the pending zoning petition, but also the 

Incentive Zoning Nexus Study.  So my name is Chris Cotter, 

C-o-t-t-e-r, the Director of Housing, and Community 

Development Department.   

          So I will give a quick introduction, and I guess 

starting with introducing the people to my left.   

Linda led the city team working with Karl Seidman, who's to 

my right, who was the lead consultant in completing the 

Nexus Study.   

          This is --  I know the hearing is regarding the 

zoning petition.  We thought it would be helpful to take a 

step back, and also, review with you the Nexus Study that 

Karl and his team just recently completed.  So we will do 

8

that.  This is the first time that we have updated the study 

since the ordinance was last changed in 2015. 

          As you know, the Incentive Zoning ordinance is one 

of two zoning provisions that really have a very significant 

impact on our affordable housing goals.   

          The Incentive Zoning allows for new, 

nonresidential development to make contributions to the 

affordable housing trust.  The Trust then uses those funds 

to preserve and create new, affordable housing. 

          So Linda will give a quick overview of the study 

and the approach, and then we'll ask Karl to walk us 

thorough the findings, and then we're happy to answer your 

questions.  So with that, thank you. 

          LINDA PROSNITZ:  Thank you, good evening.  Just 

want to talk a bit --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you give and 

spell your name for the stenographer as well? 

          LINDA PROSNITZ:  Yeah, it's Linda P-r-o-s-n-i-t-z.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you so much.  I 

just want to give a little bit of background how we got to 

this point.   

          As you know, the ordinance was first passed in

1998.  In 2015, that was when significant changes were made, 

and the rate was increased from I think it was $4.58 to $12.  

Right now, it's up to $17.10, which have been annual 

increases since then.  And part of that -- changes then were 

that we had to do the study every three years.  And that is 

why we've done the study again. 

          A couple things just to note, is some of the 

impacts of the changes.  From the beginning of the ordinance 

to 2017, there was about 5.5 million dollars collected 

through the Incentive Zoning provisions.  In 2019 alone, 

under the new provisions, about $12 million dollars has been 

collected.  So it's made an enormous impact on the housing, 

and what we've been able to do. 

          In addition to the Nexus Study on the impact of 

commercial development on housing that we did in this study, 

we also have an additional component which was looking at 

jobs, looking at the jobs which were generated by new 

commercial development, and what the need for occupational 

training is for Cambridge residents in those jobs. 

          Those are the two major components.  Karl's going 

to go into -- Karl Seidman's our consultant.  He will go 

into the details of the study.  Karl also did our 2015

study.  Thank you.      

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Okay, thank you, Linda and Chris, 

and thank you to members of the Planning Board for having me 

here today.  Some of this you'll be very familiar with.  

Just to refresh your memory, on the Incentive Zoning 

Ordinance, this was established in 1998.  

          It was amended, as Linda discussed, in 2015, and 

it applies to all nonresidential development over 30,000 

gross square feet, including new construction, substantial 

rehab or changes in use for properties that were not subject 

to the ordinance. 

          It requires housing contributions now set at 1710 

per square foot.  There's a provision for annual CPI 

adjustments, and as Linda mentioned, a periodic study is 

required to update the contribution rate every three years. 

          As Linda also mentioned, the impact of the 2015 

amendment has been quite significant.  The rate was raised 

from 4.58 dollars per square foot to $12, with $1 annual 

increases for the next three years.   

          And one of the other big changes was it required 

contributions based on use, independent of special permits.  

          Before that, projects seeking certain special 

11

permits were subject to Incentive Zoning, and many, many 

development projects ended up not having to pay the 

contributions. 

          So the result of this has been a significant 

increase in contribution revenues.  You know, the first 

payment, because of the lag in actual permitting and 

construction of projects came in in early 2019 at $2.1 

million.   

          That payment alone was comparable to 10 years' 

worth of payments from 2014 to 2013, and this is projected 

to bring in, you know, somewhere between $5 million to $6 

million dollars per year over the next four to five years, 

and may even be greater, depending on the pace of 

development.   

          And this chart compares that projected annual 

revenue to the annual revenue over prior five-year periods.  

And you can see it's been -- you know, an order of magnitude 

increase in revenue by the end of the 2015 amendment.  So 

it's had the intended fact of really bringing most -- almost 

all nonresidential development into -- contributing to 

funding affordable housing. 

          So now I'm going to talk about the Study.  It

really had four components to it.  One was looking at 

development and employment trends recently, and then looking 

forward to project development, and then look again what 

that impact would be on the demand for affordable housing, 

and on the need for job training services.   

          There was a component that reviewed existing 

policies and policy actions to look at whether there should 

be changes in some aspects of the ordinance, and we had this 

analysis of the job contribution option, and then 

recommendations for new contribution rates and policy 

changes. 

          So just to give you a quick overview of where we 

landed in terms of recommendations, I have recommended that 

the housing contribution be raised from the current $17.10 

over five years, $2 in the first year for individual annual 

increases, as well as continuing the annual CPI adjustments.  

          This approach, which essentially was adopted in 

2015, allows for sort of predictable incremental change in 

the housing contribution rate, allows developers to 

anticipate and plan for the contribution increase, so to 

minimize some of the impact.   

          Also recommending that we maintain the sort of

simple uniform approach now of a single, citywide rate that 

doesn't vary by use.  One change we are recommending is to 

increase the time period for the policy review from three 

years to five years.   

          I think the three-year period is really too short 

to really assess the impact of changes.  I think, as we saw 

here, we didn't actually see new revenue coming in, you 

know, until many years after the policy change. 

          And then I ended up not recommending creating a 

job contribution option.  Talk about this more, but I think 

there are more efficient ways to address the funding need 

for job training, and through the development process. 

          So now I'm going to talk through the Study 

methodology for housing and some of the findings.  I sort of 

apologize a little bit for this complicated chart, but I 

wanted to be transparent in the sort of data and process we 

went through to come up with the final recommendations. 

          So it begins with a 10-year projected development 

and employment by use and industry.  And then we have to 

estimate of the jobs that are going to be created, how many 

of these workers do we expect to demand housing in 

Cambridge?  And we made those estimates based on surveys of 

14

12

22

workers.  We relied on the survey we did for the last study.  

          We then take the occupation distribution of 

earnings for jobs in those industry to estimate how much the 

workers are going to be making who are looking for housing 

in Cambridge, and then also based on household 

distributions, how many of them are living in single-earner, 

multiple earner households.   

          Because the income guidelines depend on the 

household, we need to make some estimate of the distribution 

of the workers by household size. 

          And that ultimately -- we end up with a final 

estimate of the demand for new, affordable housing that will 

come out of a new development.  And that's broken down by 

low, moderate and middle-income households.   

          And then based on that number of new housing units 

that would be required for -- to meet the demand from new 

development, we estimate the full development cost for 

those, and what the funding gap or subsidy to build that 

housing would be.  Because, you know, the income of the 

residents is going to be insufficient to cover the cost of 

the housing.  So that kind of takes you through the process.  

There's far more detail in the report, if you want to dig in 

15

to all the numbers. 

          So the first big, significant estimates here are 

around future development.  This is the foundation for the 

analysis.  So we looked at recent development trends in 

terms of what has been built over the last 10 years.  We 

looked at what has been permitted and what's been proposed 

before the city, as well as looking at some of the 

employment trends by sector and industry. 

          And based on that, we've sort of rejected that for 

the next 10 years, you'll -- Cambridge is likely to have 

somewhere around 5 million square feet of office and R&D lab 

space; a little more than $500,000 of institutional 

development.  That really reflected plans that universities 

have filed with the city, as well as combinations with the 

universities about development plans. 

          And then a small amount of retail restaurant 

services -- that really reflects the ground-floor 

development associated with the office and R&D lab space.  

And then looking sort of at maybe three small hotels, as 

these have been the trend recently in Cambridge.   

          So this totals 5.8 million square feet of new 

development. This is actually an increase over what was

projected when this study was done last time, and does 

reflect that development activity in the city has really 

been accelerating, as you undoubtedly are very much aware 

of. 

          And then we use per square foot figures from 

Transportation Study data to estimate the number of jobs 

that would be created.  So this results in an estimate of 

about almost 15,000 new jobs.   

          So once we did all of the analysis related to 

earnings and household distribution, we ended up with a 

projected affordable housing demand from this new 

development would be 722 units.  That's broken down both by 

income and household size, but it's somewhat evenly divided 

between low-income, which is 200 units, moderate income at 

277, and middle-income at 255. 

          So this is essentially the impact from new 

development done, affordable housing demand, that the 

housing contribution is designed to mitigate.   

          So in order to estimate the required subsidy 

level, we had to make some assumptions about the type of 

housing that would be built to meet this demand, and also, 

the distribution of household size by bedroom size.

22

          And these are the assumptions we use:  All of the 

low-income units are assumed to be rental units.  Moderate-

income units are divided 30/70 between ownership and rental, 

and middle-income 50/50 between ownership and rental.   

          And this sort of reflects current city affordable 

housing policy and the funding approach by the affordable 

housing trust. 

          And then, you can see the breakdown of unit sizes 

by households. And as a result of this, we ended up, you 

know, with this final distribution of 471 rental units, 251 

ownership units, and then this was the basis for estimating 

development costs and the funding gap. 

          So first for rental housing, we looked at recent 

affordable housing projects that had been funded by the city 

and the affordable housing trust.  I think we looked at the 

projects that were a combined 161 units, and we looked at 

the development costs for these projects, essentially 

working off of a square foot cost, and then applying that to 

that square footage of the new project. 

          So the total development costs were $284 million 

dollars with the 471 rental units, we then looked at the how 

much income residents would pay as rent, based on 30 percent 

18

of the household income, and then you subtract the operating 

costs, and we were left with net operating income a little 

less than $2.7 million dollars, which could cover a mortgage 

of a little less than $41 million and equity of $2.7 

million.   

          So -- and I realize there's a typo in this, I 

apologize for it -- the required subsidy is $240 million, 

there's a zero missing there, $240,534,000.  So almost all 

of the costs of the rental housing units have to be 

subsidized. 

          On the ownership housing units, the total 

development costs were $157 million dollars.  We estimated 

the sales price based on 30 percent of household income 

being used to pay Principal Interest taxes and insurance, 

and assumed a 5 percent down payment. 

          And then we ended up with a down payment, and then 

we ended up with the average sales prices of $228,600 for 

moderate-income units, $331,865 for middle-income units, and 

that generates revenue of about $75 million.   

          So a little less than half of the development 

costs can be covered by people's income, but there's still a 

required subsidy of over $82 million dollars.

22

          So when we combine these two requirements, the 

total subsidy that's needed to address the 722 housing units 

is $322 million dollars, $792,000.  We divided that by the 

expected development, and that brings us to a required 

subsidy of $55.27 per square foot. 

          So if you we were to apply the full subsidy cost 

to new development, that would be the new housing 

contribution rate.  However, there are other funding sources 

available, and historically the Cambridge Affordable Housing 

Trust hasn't funded the full subsidy.   

          So we've adjusted for, you know, recent 

experience, and typically the Cambridge Affordable Housing 

Trust has specialized about 43 percent of the subsidy for 

low and moderate-income units.  And there is a state subsidy 

that now covers some middle-income housing units.   

          So based on that state subsidy, we assume 73 

percent of the middle-income rental units would be covered 

by the Trust, and then all of the costs of the ownership 

units, since there isn't subsidized funding for those 

ownership units.   

          So that ends up in a revised maximum contribution 

rate of $33.34.  So that essentially is what you could,

based on the analysis, charge as a new housing contribution 

rate.  But we all come back to that, because I think we have 

some other considerations about the potential impact that 

that might have. 

Nexus.   

          So now to talk about the job contribution Nexus, 

first I just wanted to talk a little about the logic of this 

          So the basis for having a job contribution fee is 

the notion that new development will create employment 

opportunities for Cambridge residents, and particularly 

occupations for lower-skilled workers who may, you have, 

have access -- difficulty accessing those jobs -- without 

education and training and services. 

          And that could include both occupational training 

and potentially English-language skills, math skills, 

English skills that are needed to access some of those jobs. 

          And then if existing services are insufficient to 

meet the employment and training needs to fill those jobs, 

then a housing -- jobs contribution would be warranted. 

          So we started by looking at the development 

forecast, and how many low, middle-skilled jobs would be 

created over the next 10 years.  So we focused on 

21

12

13

22

occupations that would be accessible without a college 

degree, and that was a little more than 5900 jobs out of the 

$14,000 plus jobs that would be created. 

          Now, the city doesn't currently have a resident 

employment policy for new development projects, so we looked 

at the range of resident employment goals.   

          And so, the number of jobs you would seek to fill 

with Cambridge residents, you know, will vary based on that 

goal from a little less than 600 to potentially up to 2300 

or even more, if your goal is higher. 

          So this would be the potential demand for 

employment and training and services, and then we look at 

the supply side.  What is the existing training that's 

available now through training providers?   

          And this is a list of the current organizations, 

either based in Cambridge or, you know, serving Cambridge 

residents that are providing occupational training.   

          So we collected data on the training provided by 

those organizations and the number of Cambridge residents 

who will typically, you know, graduate from those training 

programs in a given year.   

          And so based on that data, we came up with -- you 

22

22

know, some of this will vary based on year to year -- so 

somewhere between 108 and 130 annual training slots for 

Cambridge residents are provided by these programs.  And on 

the 10-year basis, that's somewhere between 1080 to 1300. 

          So our next step was to -- oh, let me just go 

back.  We also looked into this issue of whether there was a 

need to fund additional ESOL training or Adult Basic 

Education Training, and the result of that was basically 

that there really does not appear to be a need to fund 

additional services in this area. 

          The existing Adult Basic Education programs are 

undersubscribed now, and the city has been cutting back on 

them.  And the level of ESL slots is actually quite high, 

520 a year, which is much higher than the estimated number 

of low-skill workers who might be needing this training. 

          So we don't feel there's a need to add to the 

funding stream for these services. 

          So when we focus on occupational training and the 

funding gap for this, we really do not get to a point where 

you need to fund additional services, until you get to a 

goal of hiring 30% of the positions with Cambridge 

residents.  Because the existing supply of 1080, you know, 

23

22

will get you to the 20 percent goal.   

          And once you get to the 30 percent goal, you might 

potentially need to fund 700 slots, if the existing supply 

is on the low end.  If you get to the -- if you have a goal 

of employing 40 percent of the new jobs with Cambridge 

residents, then you definitely have a need for additional 

training, which could range from 1000 to almost 1300 slots. 

          So we then used a weighted average training cost 

of $6800.  So this basically looked at the costs for 

different occupational training.  To train someone as a 

software technician or lab technician tends to be a lot 

higher than to train someone for an office position, for 

example. 

          So we took data from Cambridge and Boston training 

programs to estimate this cost.  And you can see here the 

costs are modest, certainly in comparison to the housing.  

You know, we're looking at a gap of somewhere between $5 and 

$8 to $9 million dollars over 10 years.   

          If you did want to establish a housing 

contribution, it would be somewhere between, you know, 82 

cents to $1.50 per square foot.  However, since on an annual 

basis you're looking at a cost of $500 -- to $900,000 square

feet using the development process to fund this might not be 

the most efficient means.   

          So just in terms of our review of existing policy 

ordinances, we looked at sort of three main policy options.  

One is changing the project size threshold, and eliminating 

it or reducing it below 30,000 square feet.  This would have 

very little impact.  There are not many projects that are 

under 33,000.   

          And you know, they're small.  If you actually add 

up all of the projects under 30,000 that were in the 

pipeline right now, it's less than the average size of one 

of the larger projects.   

          So it doesn't really seem like this is, you know, 

a worthwhile change in the policy.  It won't bring in much 

revenue, won't impact many projects. 

          The second option is to vary the contribution rate 

by use.  And here, there is a case to be made for doing 

this.  The impacts do vary quite by use.  Restaurants in 

particular generate the largest impact on housing and jobs.  

You have, you know, there's very high job density, and very 

low wages.   

          So a lot of the demand for affordable housing 

25

22

actually comes from restaurants, and a lot of the job 

impacts come from restaurants.  Institutions in R&D use tend 

to have the lowest impacts.   

          So there's an argument for making this -- I think 

we -- I ultimate recommended against this because of the 

administrative complexity of doing this, and the fact that 

it's more complicated.  Projects aren't always leased in the 

manner they're expected to be built.   

          So you don't always know what the final use is 

going to be at the time you would collect the fee and issue 

the permit, and projects can change over time from office to 

R&D to institutional use.  So that raises some issues about 

fairness. 

          So we sort of recommend staying with a single rate 

across all uses, and then varying your rate by geography.  

Once again, there is an argument to be made for this.  The 

rents in West Cambridge are much less than the rents, you 

know, in East Cambridge and Kendall Square.  So obviously 

the economics of development are very different in west 

versus East Cambridge. 

          I think the difficulty with this approach is where 

do you put that border?  What impact does it have if you 

26

22

define West Cambridge one way, do you then end up making it 

more desirable to build, you know, near that border?  Do you 

end up having to influence on development impacts?   

          And do you ultimately want to have Cambridge 

thought of as having very different development zones? 

          So a final recommendation -- oh, the other 

considerations we had is what impact does the fee have in 

terms of how Cambridge sits relative to other communities?  

And how it might create a disincentive for future 

investment. 

          So this compares the rates in different cities.  

Here you can see Boston and Somerville.  Their rates are 

significantly lower than Cambridge now, and much lower than 

the maximum rate of $33. 

          Seattle, San Francisco come close to what the 

maximum rate would be -- you know, Seattle in the largest 

downtown zone is almost $33. San Francisco for some uses is 

close to $30. 

          We also, you know, from this are a little 

concerned about the city ending up with a rate that's three 

times Boston, two and a half times Somerville, and then what 

the impact would be in the maximum rate on potentially

rents.  If developers passed this cost on to tenants, it 

would increase rents by somewhere between 2.5 -- to 4 

percent.   

          That's not a really big increase, but Cambridge 

rents are already the highest rents in the region, and the 

rent differential but we Cambridge and Boston and the 

Seaport District and some other areas is quite high, and, 

you know, you are seeing some movement of companies out of 

Cambridge into Boston, and do you want to further contribute 

to that by having a very large differential? 

          And I think in West Cambridge, rents are already 

quite high compared to competing suburban locations like 

Waltham or Lexington.  So you want to take that into 

consideration. 

          So for all of these factors, we're recommending a 

sort of, you know, more incremental change in the housing 

contribution rate, raising it from the current $17.10 to 

what would ultimately be incremental increases of $6.   

          So you'd be somewhere in the midpoint between 

where you are now and what the maximum rate would be over a 

five-year period to continue the CPA adjustment process, and 

as I said, maintain the citywide rate, and change the policy

review period to five years, and really look to address the 

job training funding need in other ways, perhaps through 

city appropriations, or philanthropic support for funding.   

          Another reason why the job contribution would not 

be very efficient is you'd probably have to wait four or 

five years before you got any of that revenue.  And ideally, 

you want to have the training in place and have workers 

train before the projects are built and occupied.   

          So the sort of lag between collecting the fee and 

when you want to have the funding for training is another 

reason why you might want to look to other funding sources. 

          So that concludes the presentation, thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Board -- 

I think we'll format this much the way we do other zoning 

discussions, where Board members can pose questions first, 

kind of factual and clarifying nature, , and then we'll take 

public comment and have discussion on what we want to 

recommend to the City Council.    

          So does the Board, do any Board members have 

questions, either for the housing Division or Mr. Seidman?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, it's not really a

          THE REPORTER:  Can you speak into the microphone?  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It's not really a question 

about the presentation, but my question is more, exactly 

what amendment is before us?  Because there have been a 

couple of different red lines.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, first off, just if you're 

seeing a couple of different red lines, I'm not -- we've 

provided one, but if there's another one I haven't seen it.  

The -- what happened, and how this came to the Planning 

Board is that there was a City Council policy order on 

December 16, 2019 in that if you see that, that's 

effectively what got referred to the Planning Board as the 

zoning petition.   

          It doesn't have specific text edits to it, but it 

indicates that it would amend the rate so -- to $19.10 per 

square foot, effective January 8, 2020. 

          So CDD staff provided a memo that explains the 

background, as was just explained, and also attempts to show 

what the text changes would need to be in order to 

accomplish what the Council order has referred. 

          So it amends the text of paragraph B of Section 

11.202 to reestablish a new base housing contribution rate

of $19.10 per square foot, and the one thing to note is that 

while this presentation talks about a recommendation of 

continuing $1 increases, that that was not I called in the 

Council Order.   

          So that would be not part of the -- that wouldn't 

be part of the petition.  And so, it wouldn't assume that 

there are those $1 increases in the rate over time.   

          I would note too, and this is something that’s -- 

it has raised some confusion that in the zoning ordinance, 

there is a table, and the table isn't -- is not the zoning 

requirements, it's sort of an administrative tool to try to 

help track how the rate changes over time, because it does 

change, you know, multiple times per year, and it -- and the 

way it's applied is it gets calculated at when a building 

permit is issued.   

          So for the sake of knowing what the rate ought to 

be at a particular point in time, it's important to be able 

to keep track of that, and for, you know, property owners to 

keep track of that. 

          So that was the red line version that we provided, 

which shows what the changes would be in order to effectuate 

the language that's in the Council Order.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Does that satisfy you 

for now?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  That explains the 

difference.                      

          BOARD MEMBER:  Sorry, Madam Chair.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm sorry, that explains the 

difference.  If this -- so the red line in your memo is the 

language that CDD has come up with to effectuate.  Could we 

put back in the reference to the annual adjustment?  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So that's an interesting and 

important question.  So when a petition gets referred and 

advertised for hearing, that is the petition that is before 

the City Council.   

          So what's before the City Council right now is a 

change in that base rate to $19.10.  Whenever -- just as a 

general point, whenever there's a zoning petition, there are 

ways in which that zoning petition can be amended before it 

gets adopted, but it has to remain the same, you know, 

fundamental matter that was originally advertised before the 

City Council. 

          So, you know, we've discussed this internally, and 

I think that for the Council to know what they could or 

32

could not do with this petition, now that it's been 

advertised before adopting it, it would require consultation 

with the Law Department.   

          We would certainly suggest consultation with the 

Law Department if they decided to amend the rate again, or 

make some adjustment to what the rate was going to be before 

adopting it to be sure whether that was within the bounds of 

what could be done. 

          And -- well, just as a -- I'll make just a final 

note that if -- maybe to help the Planning Board's 

discussion, if the Planning Board were to recommend 

something different than what's before it.  One of the 

options would be simply to not adopt it and file a new 

petition that would have a different effect.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Alternatively, I would assume 

we could make a recommendation to City Council that they 

file a subsequent petition -- that's assuming we did raise 

the rate to what's been recommended or something else -- to 

that we could recommend to City Council that they file 

another amendment to add in the annual adjustments. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So again, there would need to -- I 

think -- be some consultation -- I think that what we would 

33

suggest is that there be --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm suggesting that there would 

be this amendment, and then at some future time, in the near 

future, that they could file another petition to make an 

additional amendment.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the only caution that I would 

exercise there, and we didn't -- I thought this may have 

been provided in the memo, but it wasn't -- for anybody who 

has looked at the full text of this section of the zoning 

ordinance, and it came up a bit in the presentation, that 

the way it's written, it calls for a reevaluation of the 

rate no less than three years from the time the rate was 

          So that was done at the time because it was 

important to establish a rate and not have it be moved 

around a lot over time -- you know, within a short period of 

          So that would need -- it would need to be 

considered if the Council were to adopt a new rate, and then 

do something else right after that to adopt, to change it 

last amended. 

time.   

right away.   

          Then that -- I mean, that language of the zoning

could be amended as well, but again, it would be not 

necessarily within the scope of this petition.  It could be, 

but it would have to be -- that's something that would need 

to be discussed with the Law Department.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

questions for -- yep, Niko?                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah, thank you.  This is really 

helpful to see.  Just a basic question.  So for the 

methodology that you're using to compute the rate, are you 

looking for the effect of new commercial development on 

housing?  Is that the end goal?   

               KARL SEIDMAN:  Yes.  The basic analysis, or 

change of impact is new development generates employment, 

and some of those new employees will need housing and seek 

housing in Cambridge.  So the housing contribution is really 

designed to address that impact, the impact of new 

development on the demand for housing and affordable housing 

in Cambridge.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay, and so, am I reading it 

correctly that the main causal relationship are new 

employees for the offices or whatever will be built in the 

commercial development?   

35

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Right.  And those new employees 

who, you know, move to Cambridge or seek to live in 

Cambridge, yeah.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  And so, the Incentive Zoning 

Ordinance applies to not only new construction, but also 

substantial renovation, and does substantial renovation have 

the same effect on the need for housing as new construction?     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Well I think the scale -- it's 

assumed the scale, the -- I don't know what the exact 

definition of "substantial rehab" is, but, you know, it's I 

think set to be a trigger so that the property being 

rehabbed is going to essentially, you know, bring in new 

uses.   

          It's not a small-scale renovation in which 

existing employees would, you know, be -- would stay in the 

building, and their space would be improved.  It's a large 

enough scale.  I don't know, Jeff, you might be able to 

answer that.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  I could add some detail just 

around that provision in the zoning, that it applies to 

development that is substantial rehabilitation of a building 

for a use to which it wasn't originally built.

          And this is what -- again, it was thought about a 

few years ago, how to handle scenarios such as in an older 

factory building that's being, you know, rehabbed into a lab 

building where, in many respects that amounts to new 

development.  It's a significant enough change that it is -- 

it has similar effects to a new construction.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay.  And so does any part of the 

analysis address the opportunity cost of new commercial 

development?  So we have seen a lot of, like, mixed-use 

development, in which the applicant has the option of 

building new commercial space or new housing in the existing 

area.   

          And it would seem that the effect on housing would 

not just be the contribution of new employees to the new 

commercial space, but also the displacement of potential 

housing.  Is that part of the analysis at all, or is that --    

          KARL SEIDMAN:  That's not something the analysis 

took into account.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Would it be possible to take that 

into account?  Because in context in which -- I mean, like 

all -- a lot of the sort of new development around Alewife 

or East Cambridge that we're seeing in which, I mean it's

not obvious to me whether someone would just inherently 

build commercial or residential in an area.   

          It seems like the Incentive Zoning rate might 

affect their decision.   

          It also could potentially -- I don't know, to the 

extent that, like, we have seen many areas, of her many 

applicants in which we have asked them, why are you not just 

building 100 percent housing, because we really need 

housing?   

          And it seems like to the extent that they are not 

doing that, then that is also lost housing, in the same way 

that a new commercial developer that is bringing new jobs to 

the city is also creating a housing need.  I don't know if 

that's the same impact, but it seems related.    

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Yeah, I mean, you know, we've 

essentially used a methodology that has been fairly 

consistently used in these studies and, you know, has a 

legal basis for it.  So, you know, we're kind of stuck with 

that sort of tried and true methodology.   

          You know, so it certainly -- there could be 

alternative methodologies that you do use.  But, you know, 

this study was based on what was sort of the established

methodology. 

          So, and I'd have to give it more thought as to how 

the opportunity costs would get factored into it, and not 

necessarily -- you know, you wouldn't want to double count 

the impact of both the impact on new housing, something 

being built, and then an impact of what else would have been 

built.   

          So you'd have to think about that, to sort of 

combine those two so you didn't sort of -- you know, double 

count what the impact would be.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  And so is the legal basis for this 

methodology, like, the federal Constitution's taking 

analysis?  Is it the fee versus tax distinction?     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  I mean, essentially, it's based on 

the notion that there needs to be a rational nexus between 

the development and its impact.   

          So, I mean, you know, it's -- this isn't 

necessarily the only way to asses the impact.  In fact, the 

first study that was done for Cambridge actually looked at 

the impact of the demand for housing on rents, and based the 

original fee on an estimate of how it was affecting rents 

for everyone in Cambridge, or low-income households in

Cambridge.   

          So this isn't necessarily the only way to measure 

the impact, but there needs to be a sort of rational basis 

that is supportable.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  And so what is the basis for 

subtracting -- so I may have misunderstood the analysis, but 

it seems like the analysis at some point reaches a $55 

dollar per square foot number, and then subtracts for the 

expected contribution of other sources, like the Affordable 

Housing Trust or federal sources.                  

          So if I understand what's happening, so it is -- 

you would expect that new commercial development would lead 

to a need for -- in order to ensure that new employees can 

live in Cambridge, they need to get somewhere in the line of 

$55 per square foot, as far as the commercial developer is 

concerned?     

$55.               

          KARL SEIDMAN:  If you were going to fully fund the 

subsidy through commercial development, then you'd need that 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  But isn't it fair, then, to 

characterize this as saying, "New commercial development, in 

order to fully capture the impact it has on the need for

22

housing, it should be $55 per square foot, and not whatever 

will be subsidized by other sources?"    

          KARL SEIDMAN:  I mean, you know, there's an 

argument that can be made to that effect.  You know, you 

might be able to -- if you establish that rate, and it went 

to court, you know, you might be able to defend it in court.  

I mean, I think in practice, affordable housing that the 

Trust has funded, you know, they have not paid the full 

cost.   

          So you'd be -- you know, you'd essentially -- 

you'd be collecting more than you'd be spending to get that 

housing built, you know, based on what the practice had 

been.              

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  But wouldn't it -- I mean, but 

some -- so someone has to fill the 50 -- like, just so I'm 

characterizing this correctly, essentially new commercial 

development -- every square foot of new commercial 

development is creating a $55 hole, in terms of housing that 

needs to be filled by somebody.     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Right, yeah.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  And so, it could be the new person 

who will live in Cambridge filling the $55 hole, or --    

41

          KARL SEIDMAN:  No, the $55 --                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  That's what they --    

          KARL SEIDMAN:  -- is after.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  -- need in addition.     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Yeah, in addition to what people --         

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So it could be the developer 

filling that $55 hole.  Or it could be the developer and the 

Affordable Housing Trust and federal law subsidies and all 

of the other --    

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Right.  Yeah, the $55 is the 

subsection amount.  So typically, it wouldn't be the private 

developer's own equity.  You know, it would be money that 

the developer raised through low-income tax credits or, you 

know, state low-income tax credits or grants from the state 

or, you know, other sources besides the city and the 

Affordable Housing Trust.                     

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I'm just trying to figure out why 

it is not fair to credit to the developer those $55?  Like, 

I -- so I understand that that may be a maximum, and you are 

-- that the study retreats from that maximum, but I don't 

understand why that is necessary, other than it may be 

easier to defend legally.

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Well, I think once again, the logic 

is that the city in practice is only funding a portion of 

that cost.   

          So it should be extracting or charging the 

developer the amount of money that it is expecting to 

actually invest to supply the subsidy.  You know, so that's 

sort of the basis for why that amount was used.              

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  But isn't the developer -- I don't 

mean to get in the back -- I'm just trying to understand --    

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Yeah.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  -- isn't the developer imposing 

this cost on not just the city but the federal government 

and the Affordable Housing Trust and all these other 

sources?     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Yeah, I mean, yes that's true.  

There's a need for that subsidy that has taken from other 

sources as well.  You know, whether the city wants to 

collect from the developer the federal law and state share 

as well I guess is a city policy they could consider, but we 

sort of based our recommendation on what the practice has 

been, and what the city share has been.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Thank you.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So thank you for those 

questions about methodology.  I was also curious about 

whether they were -- the methodology used was prescribed by 

law, or whether they were decisions that were made, because 

I feel that the methodology seriously understates the need 

for housing. 

          So this question might be for Mr. Kotter.  The 

Study's estimations of projected square feet of development 

over the next 10 years feel really low, especially because 

this Board has seen about 5 million square feet of new 

development in the last year or two.   

          And so, estimating that that's going to happen 

over the next 10 years, especially when the rate at which 

new development is happening is increasing.  I'm curious 

about why we feel that's an appropriate measure.      

          CHRIS COTTER:  Thank you.  It's a good question.  

Actually, I think it may be more for Karl, looking at the 

projection, but I would say that one of the things that we 

have not seen in the last -- since the last study was done, 

and again, this is I think part of the basis for the 

recommendation to have some more time between studies -- is 

44

to see changes in the market. 

          You know, in some ways we finished the last study, 

and development continued at a steady pace, and has 

continued.  So we haven't really seen any change in that.   

          And certainly, if we did, that would affect the 

overall projection.  But I can ask Karl to talk about the 

projections, because I know he did a lot of research leading 

into it.     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Yeah.  You know, the projection is 

what's expected to be actually built and occupied over those 

10 years.  So, you know, we did look back over the last 10 

years, and, you know, total nonresidential development was 

6.5 million square feet, although a large portion of that 

was institutional development, and the institutional 

development plans going forward are significantly less.  The 

amount of private office and R&D development was about $4.3 

million over the last 10 years. 

          We also looked at the what's, you know, currently 

-- had a building permit, and had been proposed for 

development.  Once again, you know, that's a little less 

than five million square feet.  So, you know, it did seem to 

be a reasonable assumption -- a reasonable projection to

make. 

          I think the other issue is the amount of new land 

available for the development is declining.  So, you know, I 

think a lot of the developers I spoke with and others in 

Cambridge recognize that the pace you've had in recent years 

may be difficult to sustain over the next 10 years as the 

city gets increasingly developed.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay, I disagree with that 

based on our experience.  But I appreciate knowing how you 

got that information.   

          I also wanted to ask a similar question about why 

we feel confident in the projected housing demand.  I'm 

thinking about, for example, you calculated -- the Study 

calculates a need for 700 plus additional housing units over 

the next 10 years.   

          I'm thinking about one recent development that 

came up before us, and it was less than a million square 

feet of new development, but they expected to employee 3000 

plus people. 

          So understanding that all of those new employees 

wouldn't move to Cambridge with their families, it still 

seems really --    

46

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Yeah.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  It's hard to believe that over 

10 years, all the development that we're seeing will result 

in a need for 700 new housing units.     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Right.  Well, let me just clarify.  

That's the estimated new affordable housing units.  So 

obvious, there are going to be a lot more need for housing 

than 72.   

          And part of it does reflect the income level of 

the people who are taking jobs in Cambridge, and a lot of 

the new development is in industries heavily concentrated in 

higher paying jobs.   

          So, you know, Google or a large biotech company, 

pharmaceutical company locates your -- the number of 

employees who will need affordable housing, you know, is not 

as high.  So -- and a lot of that demand for affordable 

housing actually comes from the restaurant retail or income, 

you know, jobs that are associated with the development.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you for clarifying.  Does 

your methodology include the impact of housing scarcity, you 

know, the competition for existing housing units that might 

happen with development?

22

          KARL SEIDMAN:  No, I mean it's -- the impact 

model, as I said, is based on the demand for new, affordable 

housing being generated, you know, from the employment, and 

not necessarily impact on rents overall in Cambridge or 

prices in Cambridge.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And then this may 

be a question for staff.  But I just wanted to ask if you 

could walk us through what happens with the money.   

          So for example, Dr. Seidman mentioned that it 

might be five years from occupancy, or from permit stage, 

until money has reached the city.  And then I'm wondering 

when it reaches the community, or when it comes out as 

affordable housing?        

          CHRIS COTTER:  Thank you, that's a good question.  

So we mentioned that about this time last year, we got the 

first contribution made under the 2015 changes.  And since 

that time, we've had a handful more.  We now have a pretty 

substantial fund with those contributions. 

          So those contributions are made to the Affordable 

Housing Trust, and used by the Trust in combination with 

other sources of funds that the Trust has to preserve and 

create affordable housing.

22

          So the contributions that we have on hand now, we 

are talking with the Trust about how to best deploy those 

resources.  So I'd say at this point, they are -- could 

likely be a part of the package of assistance that we expect 

to offer to the older of Fresh Pond apartments to preserve 

affordability at that expiring use property, and/or made 

available to one of the non-profit or affordable housing 

providers that we work with to purchase a site where they 

could build an all-affordable housing development.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So if we had to estimate in 

years, say that I'm a new development, and I build a million 

square feet, starting on January 1 2020, or 2021, when would 

the money that I pay for my new development hit the 

affordable housing market?  When could someone live in an 

affordable place?     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  Sure, sorry, that's a good point.  

I think I missed that part of your question.  So the 

contribution is made, the rate is set at the time that the 

building permit issues.  The contribution is due to the made 

to the Affordable Housing Trust prior to a certificate of 

occupancy issuing for that project.   

          So, you know, if it's a one year or two-year

construction period, that would be the period during which 

we would expect the contribution to be made in practice.  

Most of the contributions are made just at the end of the 

project prior to the issuance of the CO. 

          The funds are then made available through the 

Trust, and depending on how they're used, it could be, you 

know, if for instance the funding was offered through our 

Homebridge program, it could be made available to a buyer 

almost immediately, out looking for a home in the market. 

          If it was funds that we were holding to put 

together a package of funding for the Fresh Pond Apartments, 

we've been working on that for three to four years.  So 

we've been really kind of looking at our capital 

projections, trying to figure out how we would be able to 

fund that, knowing that at some point we would be making a 

big outlay. 

undertake.   

          Likewise, if the funds are used to acquire a site, 

that would be the beginning of a project that could take two 

or three years for an affordable housing provider to 

          And conversely, we might -- we're often in a 

position where we're asked to put in funding for an

affordable housing provider to build a project.  So in that 

case, we might be turning around quickly and making the 

funds available to a developer who's about to go into 

construction. 

          So really, there is a range.  It could be a long 

time if we would get something that we're putting together, 

or pretty quickly if we're offering it directly to 

homebuyers.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Any other questions 

from the Board at this time?  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The estimated jobs number on 

page 8 of 14,800, is that the total jobs created, or the low 

barrier to access jobs?     

          KARL SEIDMAN:  That's the full employment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So now we can 

take public comment, that no one has signed up to speak on 

this matter.  I'm seeing at least one hand, a couple of 

hands, okay.  So you can come forward to the podium and use 

the microphone.   

          We do have our wonderful lighting system set up

your address.  The light will go green when your time

you're out of time. 

          So Ms. Farris, why don't you start us out?           

          LEE FARRIS:  Good evening. Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk 

Street.  So I'm speaking for the Cambridge Residence 

Alliance tonight, but I want to also give a little bit more 

context than has been given so far on why the City Council 

did not include the other recommended raises in this.   

          I was at that City Council meeting, plus I've 

talked to the sponsor Councillor Zondervan and several other 

Councillors.             

          It was stated very clearly that they wanted to do 

the $2 increase very quickly so that the annual $1 increase 

did not happen last year because the report arrived later 

than had been expected, by I think five or six months. 

          So the original timing would have given the City 

Council a chance to fully discuss the whole report and 

decide what levels of funding they wanted at each year, but 

that was not possible because the report was late. 

          And so, my understanding is the Council does in 

fact intend to come back and debate what further increases

there should be beyond this $2 increase.   

          The $2 increase is to try to stay on the schedule 

that the city was already on, so that all the new 

developments -- the large buildings that are getting 

permitted now -- will not get a windfall of $2 while the 

City Council is working on what the overall schedule of fee 

increases should be.  So I hope that's helpful. 

          Therefore, I came prepared to speak only to the 

$19.10 fee.  The Cambridge Residents Alliance strongly 

supports that.  We hope that you guys will recommend that 

favorably to the City Council, and that the City Council, 

which has an ordinance hearing tomorrow, will be able to 

quickly pass that, and then return to the larger discussion. 

          But I also want to just make a request that the 

presentation there get posted either on the Planning Board 

or the City Council website, so that people can see it ahead 

of time.  That’s very helpful to have it boiled down like 

that. 

          And the -- I also want to point out that the -- I 

don't really agree with the methodology that the Trust is 

going to make up the difference, and therefore we should ask 

for more funds, similar to the questions that were being

posed by some of the Planning Board members.   

          The city had -- the City Council has been trying 

to increase the Trust funds, and they have done so with the 

manager's support last year.  But they're still not able to 

keep up with the existing demand for affordable housing with 

that level of increase. 

          And if we keep assuming that the Trust will only, 

you know, and the federal and state subsidies are not 

keeping up with our need.  Therefore, if we don't do more 

than simply keep up, than simply assume that 43% is what the 

Trust is going to put in, we won't even begin to meet this 

need.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Sir? 

          DAN TOTTEN:  Hi.  My name is Dan Totten.  I live 

at 54 Bishop Allen.  Yep, T-o-t-t-e-n as in Nancy.  So I'm 

the aide to Councillor Zondervan, and I just want to very 

briefly confirm what Lee said.  The report was late, and 

there was no annual adjustment in 2019.   

          Because of this, Councillor Zondervan found that 

pretty unacceptable, and so, he actually tried on the floor, 

if you go back on and watch the video, he tried to raise it 

by $2 on the floor in that meeting.  He was told that wasn't

okay, and so, he introduced a -- this petition, the goal of 

which is to quickly pass a $2 increase while -- and then we 

can have a larger conversation about what else we should do.  

          But I just want to clarify for the Board that his 

intent is to introduce a second petition, which will do 

more, and that's coming very soon.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Is there 

anyone else from the public who wishes to be heard on this 

matter?  Okay.  I'm seeing none.  So I will open it up for 

Board discussion.   

          We have a fairly straightforward petition ahead of 

us, with a very detailed report supporting that petition, 

and we have to decide what kind of recommendation we want to 

forward, if any, to the Council.  So thoughts?  Steve, you 

want to kick us off?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  It seems to me that this process 

starts with the unique economic and political decision about 

how much payments need to be made by developers.  And then 

there's a post hoc rationalization for that decision, 

primarily because the law requires that there be a nexus 

between the payment and the costs being imposed upon the 

community.

          So, you know, as I listen to this thing and all of 

the reasoning, and the dozens and dozens of assumptions 

being made in order to get to the bottom line, you could 

question any number of those assumptions, but ultimately I 

think it comes down to the political and economic judgment 

made by the City Council, as to what the payments can and 

should be here. 

          And I think, you know, from that perspective, you 

know, the payments should be as high as they possibly can, 

just short of undermining the economics of the developments, 

and killing the golden goose.   

          I'm not in a position to make that judgment; 

personally I think the payments actually are quite low 

relative to the value of the buildings, and actually the 

payments are pretty modest, relative to the real estate 

taxes that they'll be paying as soon as the buildings are 

complete. 

          Anyway, bottom line I guess I'm saying, I'm 

suggesting, I'm supposing that a political judgment has been 

made as to how high these payments should be.  This is just 

a rationalization for that political judgment.   

          I think, you know, that I'm happy to defer it to

that political judgment, and I wouldn't be inclined to get 

too deep into the details of the reasoning, because, as I 

say, I think that's just a rationalization.  But this is a 

good thing.   

          Personally, I think the taxes -- I'm sorry, not 

the taxes -- the payments should be higher, but I defer to 

the political judgment that arrived at this number.  I guess 

we just heard that we may be hearing a little bit later more 

on this subject, and then perhaps we will become higher when 

we hear the next chapter from the City Council. 

          But for now, I see absolutely no reason or any 

basis to question the proposal, and I think that we should 

just support and make the appropriate positive 

recommendation.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

thoughts?  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I basically agree with Steve, in 

terms of the action we should take.  It seems to me that 

Nexus Study as shown has a very substantial impact, and that 

the city should be trying to extract contributions from -- 

ultimately from the people who occupy the buildings, since 

one thing I've learned working for the developers, there's 

57

only one source of money.   

          It's the guy who pays the rent.  So this is an 

alternative channel of money.  It's extracted in a different 

way, but ultimately it goes into the rent. So I think we 

should go forward and give a favorable recommendation.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Niko?          

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  I mean, I think I'd like to 

see more funding for the Incentive Zoning, and I think we 

should pursue as much funding as is legally permissible.  So 

I'd at least recommend to the City Council that the City 

Solicitor evaluates how much the city is willing to defend.  

          Because ultimately, I think it's a legal question 

about how much the city can get away with, and I think it's 

important that the city accurately figure out how much of an 

impact is all this new commercial developmental causing to 

the city, and to the people of the community. 

          And so, if the City Solicitor is willing to defend 

a higher rate, on the ground that a higher rate is the 

effect that this commercial development is causing on the 

city, then I think we should pursue a higher rate.   

          I don't think that absent any -- I don't see 

anything -- I did not see anything in the presentation, and 

58

there may be more in the documents, and maybe this is a 

question to ask, but I don't know what extent an additional 

rate would disincentivize new commercial development. 

          But to the extent that that is not a factor, the 

only question is what is the effect of new commercial 

development on ensuring that the people who work there, and 

the people who live in Cambridge are able to find housing, 

then the city should not be in the business of not 

extracting more from an impact fee, because we expect that 

other sources will fil in the gap, as opposed to the 

developer.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So I have a question about 

procedure, because I'm concerned that accepting the 

consultant's recommendation, which is higher than the zoning 

amendment recommendation, even that higher number wouldn't 

establish fees that are proportionate to the impacts of 

development in Cambridge. 

          So do I vote yes on this and then wait to see what 

happens after that, or do I say no, my recommendation would 

be that this is not high enough?      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I will attempt to

answer this and ask Jeff or Iram to correct me to the extent 

I get it wrong.  So I think we're making a recommendation on 

the petition from the City Council, which is just the $19 

increase.  It is not the recommendation in the study.   

          And this sounds like, at least from staff's point 

of view, there is an open question as to whether or not it 

would be legally permissible for the City Council to come 

back fairly quickly and make an additional change.  That's 

what I heard.  So if that's not correct, let's get that 

clarified.   

simpler in that.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'll just try to be a little 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We don't really know what follow up 

petition might be coming --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- and so, I was just -- all I can 

characterize is what's in the zoning language now.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And what's before us as a petition.  

So if something comes after that, then it would have to be 

evaluated by -- you know, by the City Council, by our Law

Department.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So we can't prejudge.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So we haven't had an 

indication specify that it wouldn't be permissible, it's 

just that we don't know, and we will have to look at it, 

should that come.   

          So tonight, your recommendation is, independent of 

knowing whether or not something will come later, or whether 

or not if it was proposed later, it would be allowed, are we 

prepared to support the increase to $19?   

          And what I've heard from speakers so far, I think 

is yes of course we want it at least to go to $19, and the 

Planning Board would strongly recommend that it go higher, 

because the study would suggest that that would be 

appropriate.  How much higher, we don't quite now yet.  And 

we could forward that additional context with our 

recommendation.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.  Then would now be the 

right time to give context about how much I think it should 

be?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Absolutely.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  All right.  So support 

increasing it to at least $19.10.  I think it needs to be 

much higher.  I have questions about the algorithm and the 

math, as well as questions about the overarching 

assumptions.   

          As merely one example, as my colleague mentioned 

on page 4 of the Nexus Study, the consultant makes an a 

priori assumption that we should give developers a break 

when it comes to building affordable housing, since the 

federal and state government contribute to affordable 

housing.   

          So Dr. Seidman recommends we take the developer's 

bill due to Cambridge and credit their bill with taxpayer 

dollars.  So in one sentence on page 4 we lower the 

developer's bill from $55.27 per square foot to $33.34 per 

square foot.  I don't think that's appropriate.   

          And then we have -- the City Manager's report 

seems to accept the consultant's recommendation of $0 per 

square foot for jobs.  I don't think that's appropriate.  I 

think if we're only creating low-wage jobs, we should still 

collect money to provide for free community college, free 

university scholarships for paid internships.

22

          I don't know how we can look at what we know about 

the city, based on the city's own needs assessment and say 

that we don't need or want money for jobs, education or 

skills training.   

          Furthermore, the harmful impact of gentrification 

on our city cannot be overstated.  On page 26 of the study, 

which again I feel still understates the problem -- on page 

26 of the city, Dr. Seidman references the American 

community survey, which indicates that 21 percent of all 

renters in Cambridge are paying more than 50 percent of 

their income in rent.   

          That's gross income, right?  So your take-home 

pay, you're paying even more than 50 percent of income and 

rent.  That's inappropriate and it's not sustainable. 

          So I fear that the recommendation by the study, 

and by the City Manager's office feels like it's rooted in 

concern that we don't want to discomfort development, but I 

wonder why we care more about developers being able to plan 

for contribution increases if we don't care how families 

deal with unpredictable housing increases.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, certainly on the limited

question of whether we should recommend the increase to the 

1910, I clearly agree with that.  And I do not disagree with 

the concept that it should be a figure larger than that.   

          I do remember, however, when this first came up, 

when it was discussed in 2015, I think there was a lot in 

the presentation about at what point would this figure 

discourage development? And that's not something we heard 

today, really.   

          And, you know, I think that that's information we 

and the City Council really need in order to determine what 

is the appropriate point.   

          I think it's easy to say yes, it's the $55, but, 

you know, if Seattle and San Francisco have the highest 

rates, and they're nowhere near that number, then there must 

-- I assume there is a rationale at some point where there's 

-- where developers are simply going to say, "no, I won't 

build in Cambridge, I'll go to Boston, or I'll go to 

Somerville, or I'll go someplace else." 

          And so, it's, you know, Steve said you don't want 

to kill the golden goose.  So I think we and they all need 

information, or at least a guestimate at where is that line 

that we don't want to cross.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I appreciate the good 

thinking of my fellow Board members, and do support 

exploration of figuring out what the right balance is.  But 

just building on Ted's last point, and referencing page 65, 

which questions what's the limit of -- and the effect of 

this particular fee on the competitiveness of Cambridge 

regionally and actually within its own boundaries?   

          I'm a business owner, I employee 70 people.  I 

proudly had a business in this city from 1987 to 2012, when 

I was priced out.  And I'm not asking for a rent subsidy for 

a businessperson, I moved to our neighboring city of Boston.  

But you have to understand that we're not talking about 

developers' money here as my -- what my colleague said, it's 

tenant money, right?   

          Developers simply pass the cost onto me, and there 

is an effect of the rising rents on the types of businesses 

that will be in Cambridge, right? 

          So it's not a surprise that it's multinational, 

publicly traded drug companies that are occupying these 

buildings, right?  And it's less and less homegrown 

entrepreneurs like myself who can afford to be here.  So we

should take that into consideration.  That's enough 

editorializing.  I think we should pass this on with a very 

favorable recommendation to the City Council.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So what I'm 

hearing collectively is strong support for adopting at least 

the increase to $19.10 with recognition that the number 

should probably be substantially larger than that, but 

everyone would like more information, both on the validity 

of the assumptions, and kind of the competitive limits of 

where do we start to see diminishing returns from raising 

this fee, either on what it can produce in terms of housing, 

or what it does to the overall economic balance in the city. 

          But our sense is it probably needs to be higher 

than $19, but we agree that we need to at least keep pace 

with where it -- how it has been going up the past three to 

five years.  Is that accurate?  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  All those 

in favor of forwarding such a recommendation to the City 

Council?           

          [ All vote YES ]    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That is unanimous.  

All right.  We will -- thank you very much.  We'll take a 

brief recess to allow for switching of the public hearing 

and the next group to set up.  We'll be right back.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So this 

is a public hearing on Planning Board #358 for 34-40 

Hampshire Street.  Do you want to kick us off here?

I'm representing my client here, Mr. Mark Boyes-Watson and 

Ally Ladha for their parcel at 34 Hampshire Street.   

          We were with you last year requesting a zoning 

change from the Council for exactly this project -- an

increase of FAR from the 2.75 to 4.0, which the Council 

unanimously approved, and that this Board had recommended to 

the Council -- all of which was in contemplation of this 

project, which we had shown at the time, both to 

neighborhood groups that were looking to engage to the hotel 

as well as to the Council, and as well as to the Planning 

Board. 

          We are here now with the project.  So making good 

on our initial push to have the zoning changed.  We are 

seeking relief for a couple of items, one of which in this 

particular district hotel use is a special permit 

requirement.   

          We are seeking relief for parking, to reduce the 

amount we have on site.  We also have a short-term bicycle 

parking issue in terms of distance from the -- basically the 

point of entry.  And we also have a request for exemption of 

gross floor area in the basement. 

          I can start with sort of the overview of the 

project and relief, but I'd also like to talk about some of 

the process that got us here.  We did have a neighborhood 

meeting at the Italian consulate next door, where several 

members attended.

          And unanimously, I think, people had felt as 

though this site had been not used for a very long time.  

There was a very small parking lot, and then I think cars 

were sold there briefly for a little while.   

          But people are looking forward to some kind of 

change, considering Emma's has closed.  Next door to Emma's 

was a real estate office that was kind of defunct, and the 

land itself was vacant. 

          No real concerns voiced in terms of what we are 

building -- heights, dimensions, massing.  I think people 

were just more excited that there was something actually 

happening.   

          We met with the East Cambridge Business 

Association as well.  Similar response from them.  The 

vendors across the street at Kendall 1 were especially 

excited to have a more active use that would sort of engage 

their businesses during times when it sort of lulls.   

          You know, this area is a kind of booming area in 

the weekdays; not so much on the weekends, and I think this 

hotel as a residential use will liven it up. 

          I can speak specifically to the relief that we 

seek.  For parking, we are looking for a reduction in the

required parking down to 16 spaces, which -- using stackers.   

          And the, you know, having spoken with Traffic and 

Parking and with the neighbors, we feel that this is a more 

appropriate use for -- or more appropriate in terms of the 

amount of parking we have on site. 

          The usage for these hotels is typically low.  We 

are close to a transit mode, and we are also offering a sort 

of abundance of bike and alternate transit uses of this 

site. 

area. 

          We do have a garage; we do have a loading area.  

So we're not looking to alter that scheme.  We have been 

working with Traffic and Parking relative to things like 

pickup and drop-off and how we would load, but the consensus 

has been -- at least according to Traffic and Parking's memo 

-- that the reduction in parking is warranted, based on 

usage for the area, which is at 0.2 percent, 0.2 to 0.3, for 

          The special permit for use is a curious one.  It's 

one of the things I think the -- at least the Council had 

asked us why we did not change that piece of it when we 

changed the zoning.   

          And I think we felt as though that at the time it

was too big of a leap to remove a special permit 

requirement, and that just getting the FAR alone would maybe 

sort of signal that this is something that people wanted for 

the area. 

          Now, the criteria for this special permit is 

pretty -- is basically 10.43 -- you know, a substantial 

detriment to the area, which I believe in our memo we have 

given that, you know, this is a desired use, it's an allowed 

use based on the special permit. 

          And it's something that, you know, during our 

zoning tour on this, we talked about the need for hotels in 

this area, the need for hotels in general in Cambridge, the 

lack of study on the subject and the fact that the city 

itself has about 140 to 160 nights a year where it's 100 

percent occupied, and that, you know, given the intricacy of 

the spot, that it was a better use to put -- well, better 

use would be served through a hotel than any other use 

that's currently allowed on the site. 

          The short-term parking for bicycles I will leave 

to the architectural presentation, but it's simply a matter 

of logistics.  The natural entry point to this building is 

on Hampshire Street, not Portland.  Portland is more of an

active area, and we feel as though by locating them closer 

to the entrance on the Hampshire side is simply just a 

better way for people and safer way for people to get into 

the building; that that access point just simply elongates 

the travel distance from that location to the actual bicycle 

parking by about 30 feet. 

          The last bit of relief we're seeking is for the 

basements, which is under Article 2, regrettably.  But where 

it states that, you know, all other uses may seek a special 

permit, provided they can show that in this area, other 

basements are similarly used. 

          Across the street, we have State Park, which is a 

bar, restaurant, multiple uses of cycling and I believe 

there's a software company as well.  But the basements in 

this area have been utilized for a number of uses.   

          Our plan is somewhat de minimis.  We have 

locations in the back of our parking area, which we're going 

to put in the back of the house, perhaps a kitchen, perhaps 

I think we're looking at a gym right now just for the 

occupants of the building -- things that are amenities that 

keep people on site.   

          The -- we did submit a letter from a City

Councillor in approval of this project, as another piece of 

our outreach.  But I believe the meat and potatoes of this 

presentation is really in the architectural review.  So I 

would like to switch over to my friend here and have him 

walk you through it.        

          THE REPORTER:  Can you spell your name, please?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Good evening.  It's Mark 

Boyes-Watson from -- and I'll spell that -- it's Mark, and 

it's B-o-y-e-s hyphen W-a-t-s-o-n of --       

          THE REPORTER:  Mark?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Mark with a “k,” yes.  From 

Boyes-Watson Architects, of 30 Bow Street, Somerville.  Good 

evening.  So I'm going to see if I can make everything work.  

          So this may not be in exact order of your books, 

and you'll excuse me, but I just put it into an order that I 

find will better explain what's going on, and I think all 

the slides are in, but maybe not the same order. 

          So this is a site on Hampshire and intersection 

with Portland.  Dante Alighieri here, office building here, 

the tire and auto repair shop here and the loading docks for 

that are right here, so that's kind of why our entrance is 

off Hampshire -- get onto that in a little bit.

          But just, I think the next slide will show, kind 

of, visually the context.  So here is the site.  We're in 

actually the Industry B is the zone, as you recall from the 

rezoning hearing.  So this is all Industry B with all of 

this stuff in here.   

          So our building is going to make this corner on 

the edge of Portland and Hampshire.  So some existing 

conditions, photographs:  The old Emma's Pizza building 

here, this is what's no longer around in Cambridge, the 

above-grade parking that services the office building.   

          You see it here again, fairly clearly, the office 

building above.  Here are those parking loading bays that 

are exactly opposite where we'll be coming in and out of our 

entry to our parking. 

          So that's generally the context.  Hampshire's an 

odd street, actually, and you can see that the office 

building actually has a lot of its loading here, and it has 

a mechanical above.   

          And actually, the buildings that are further up 

the street set back off the street line.  So Hampshire's a 

little weak down here.  But we're hoping with our building 

design to hold the corner, and actually make some sense of 

74

the way that the office building comes right to the street. 

          You'll also notice -- because it came up in staff 

review about potential setbacks, and I'll talk about that as 

we go through the presentation -- our building is proposing 

to be about just under 80 feet tall, and then the roof sets 

back.  And I'll show you how that relates to the adjacent 

structures.   

          A couple more -- just looking, what's really nice 

about the site is it has generated a lot of what we are 

designing for, as it were.  Because we look kitty-corner 

across to One Kendall.   

          And actually, our building will enjoy really nice 

views across the courtyard of One Kendall all the way up, so 

that's really one of our big amenities. 

          Here is the Dante Alighieri, and of course that's 

very low.  You can kind of see that it's a mixed thing, a 

mixed bag of what's around us. 

          So this is a slide that just basically we're 

looking down Hampshire, and here's Portland, here's the auto 

repair.  Here's One Kendall in the foreground, and you can 

see this very strong relationship across the intersection. 

          Just while I'm on this slide, I'm just going to

give you the basics about design.  We have a lobby first-

floor area that is tall enough to allow for the loading and 

very generous glass that makes the corner.   

          And then our hotel rooms start at the second 

through the sixth floor.  There's sort of a top floor that's 

treated differently. 

          The streetscape -- these trees on Hampshire are 

good, and you know this is a tree that exists -- I think 

we're showing it larger than it is in real life in its 

rendering.  These are two proposed trees, so these four 

trees are proposed, there are no trees there now.   

          These trees could be a little tricky, because 

there's a lot of stuff in this sidewalk here.  But we're 

going to make every effort to get those in there as a 

sidewalk shading device. 

          So I'm not going to dwell on this slide, because 

Mr. Barrett has already gone through it.  So -- and I think 

each of these will come up as I go through the presentation. 

          So this is a first-floor plan, where you're kind 

of seeing those elements that I've already described at the 

entrance.  We're actually a foot above the sidewalk here, 

because the street flooding 2070 in this area gets a flood

elevation above sidewalk elevation.  So we are raising our 

first floor slightly above.   

          So I think it's more like nine inches, actually.  

So this is the lobby.  It's nine inches above the side wall, 

which is why there's a slightly labyrinthine way of getting 

in.  But all these windows then, you can see how it opens up 

to the corner. 

          We actually -- I'm going to in this presentation 

show you two slightly different architectural expressions, 

because of some staff comment.  And I'll get into that as I 

get to those slides.  So the parking ingress and egress is 

here.  We actually come through.  We go into a car elevator, 

and those elevators go down to the basement.   

          Here's the short-term bicycle parking.  This 

little foyer is kind of designed -- it's going to be fully, 

you know, a not a back-of-house, it's going to be treated as 

pavers, and the short-term bikes are all here, with a much 

greater provision than is required by the zoning.  And 

that's that journey back to the front door, however, from 

that location. 

          There's loading -- Number 10 is loading, so 

there's loading here, which also allows the cars to pass 

77

behind any truck that's parked there and unloading. 

          So this is a view from -- is it still called, 

"Pollen (sic) Street" here, or is it actually called, 

"Cardinal Medeiros?" It's probably Cardinal Medeiros, where 

we're standing, looking back at the building.   

          And here you can see that corner, you can see the 

building entrance, the curve that unites the two streets.  

It's not a right angle, which is why, you know, it kind of 

looks like a warped perspective. 

          Another shot this shot from One Kendall is the low 

building of the autobody shop.  And this is, as it were, 

standing on the sidewalk next to the Dante Alighieri. 

          So this is just a little bit of detail of that 

lobby, where the sideline's coming out of the parking lobby 

areas.  It's a very simple building, actually, which 

consists of two stairs.  And then if we go up, you'll see a 

fairly straightforward floor plan. 

          The site, though small, enjoys quite a lot of 

frontage.  So that it's actually an ideal site for a hotel.  

And this is our typical floor plan. 

          The -- I didn't really point out, and I might even 

go back and point out something -- actually it shows here.

The office building doesn't exactly track the parking garage 

on which it sits.   

          So you can see here this is the -- this is 

actually mechanical, but the parking garage tracks this 

line.  And the office building is actually set back off that 

line.   

          I'm actually going to go back, because I didn't 

point that out.  I'm going to go all the way back to -- 

maybe this is a fool's errand, but -- so see that up there?  

The office building is setting back off this wall.  Whereas 

this one is actually sheer down to the ground.  So there's 

slightly different conditions.   

          And in designing our building, we've taken some 

care to say -- here we are on the second floor, and you can 

see that although the loading dock is covered and follows, 

this is basically our lot line.  But the actual building 

opposite the office building, that's the line of the office 

building, okay? 

          So we're actually got -- considerable light well 

in this area.  At the top of the page, which actually 

unfortunately is cut off, but the line of the building is 

here -- there's a decent distance here, we get tight in this

bottom left-hand corner to the existing building. 

          And these are just -- as we go off the floor 

plans, and we're now -- we're just up at the roof, and there 

you see again there's the roof of that, and here's the 

office building, which goes on up above our building. 

          Height limit in the zone is 120 feet.  This corner 

line is just under 80 feet, and then there's just under 13 

feet that these stairs project in the elevator, and this 

thing that's hatched with those rectangles is a screened 

mechanical.   

          So I'm just going to quickly take you through how 

the elevations work.  So -- and I'm not going to dwell on 

this, because the perspective's illustrated, but it's a 

transformer entrance, and then one of the windows, and then 

we turn onto Portland, and that's the other window that's 

making the lobby the parking entrance. 

          And then we've -- we worked a lot -- and it came 

up I think in staff review, and find that if we put that -- 

this cornice line down here, that it's too weak.   

          And so, we moved it up, and you'll see -- I think 

you might have seen in the perspectives how this is designed 

as a bit of a screen peeling away from this curve, just to

get the thing to work with the bottom, middle and top that 

we think is the right scale adjacent to the other uses 

around us, rather than having our first story be too weak. 

          And now we're on Portland, and that's the garage 

door.  You see basically all the same elements again. 

          Just going to go back there, because I should be 

really talking about some materials a little bit here.  So 

this is -- the notion is that this is clad in a porcelain-

type tile that stonelike.  We have a slide later on with 

some possible colors.  I mean, it's not definitive.   

          And then the bays are treated as their own 

element, and all of these elements, these metal elements, 

are actually copper or copper patina, because if they're the 

windows, and -- because we've found that it's actually a 

strange building, because it's sort of a big level building.  

And actually, if you introduce too many things to this 

building, it disintegrates.   

          So we've actually, basically said on these three 

facades, we've got these two main materials, which is that 

porcelain panel, and then the other elements are all  

that other, what I would call, "the metal" on the building.  

          These two elevations are the hidden elevations 

81

that are behind the building.  What we are doing is that the 

visible parts of those are, again, the porcelain type -- 

porcelain panel.  Then there's a different kind of panel on 

the invisible surfaces that are only visible from the office 

building.   

          So here you see -- so these flanking end walls -- 

this is the other internal elevation.  These are then those 

rooms that face the rear courtyard, these windows here.   

          So this is just a little bit of a closeup.  Just I 

wanted to talk a little bit more about the location of that 

cornice slide.  And I have a -- I was talking a little bit 

about how we have two versions of this.   

          We have another version I'm going to show you in a 

minute, which brings this curved element down behind this 

screen.  This one is shown where this glass line is right 

out in the line of this element, and I'll show you that in a 

minute.  But here the basic ingredients are, that base. 

          And here you see that those windows actually form, 

then, a little balcony for the rooms that are behind here on 

the second floor.  And I'll show you how that changes if we 

do that. 

          So here, what we're looking at, because the

22

suggestion was made by the city review was that maybe it 

would be nice if that element came down.   

          And so, we've explored bringing this curved 

element down, and then it's void behind here, and you 

actually get a curve there that follows the lobby.  That's 

not how it's shown in plan, but it's definitely a 

possibility. 

          Here's from a different angle, what happens.  You 

see that those elements now are coming down and landing.  

And we brought the sidewalk right into that element.  So you 

could cut the corner here, which has some advantages. 

          So just getting the sense of that.  And here's 

that little court that allows us -- because one of the 

things that came up in Traffic and Parking is that, you 

know, they don't exactly have a plan for Hampshire, in terms 

of bike lanes, et cetera.   

          So, you know, if we needed to pull a valet around 

here, they could pull into here, and actually unload and get 

back into the building, so there's a resilience to whatever 

that plan ends up on Hampshire. 

          And we've said that we'd love to work with the 

city with whatever that plan ends up being.

          This is just a slide to illustrate what Mr. 

Barrett was saying about the distance from this parking.  So 

here you go, this is the distance to the front entrance, and 

just some details of the bike parking. 

          This is -- so an element of the relief is the -- 

another element of the relief is the number of parking 

spaces.  So a hotel is required to have, by zoning, half as 

many cars as the number of rooms.  So if you have 68 rooms, 

you have 34 cars.   

          The hotel -- local hotels all have much less 

utilization than that, and a lot of them don't provide a lot 

of parking.  What the parking study indicated that the 

average demand would be around 12 cars.   

          We have provided -- it shows eight spaces, but 

they're on the stackers here.  So there's a total valet 

parked 16 cars on the site. 

          This is just an illustration of how that works.  

So this is just a one-story basement.  And it's a very small 

site, so avoiding the ramps, et cetera. And utilizing that 

space optimally is really key.  So this is a bit of a 

materials board, which is not related directly to our 

building.

          So some of the -- I was actually born in Coventry, 

and this is Coventry Cathedral.  I was not -- and this is 

actually the Baptistry.  Maybe it's not -- anyway, copper 

fins, copper elements -- this is the porcelain tile.  It's a 

rain screen.  This is the mechanical penthouse.  This is the 

material on the rear façade.   

          We are thinking of the whole building sits on -- 

because it's a foot above, or nearly a foot above the 

street, is maybe the little vertical surface that shows on 

the elevations.  Becomes the flooring, and it has this 

solidity, so when you step onto that plinth, you know you've 

arrived somewhere -- which ironically is how it's designed 

inside. 

          So the existing is now below.  We actually -- this 

is showing very -- the dark is the new shadow, but actually, 

because we are in the shadow of the building next to us, 

we're really not -- see that's showing our shadow on their 

building, we don't actually cast any of those shadows.   

          So it's a little bit misleading.  So basically, 

this building -- this might be a new shadow line, but almost 

all the other shadow lines are no greater than the existing 

shadow lines.  So for instance that actually -- if you can't

see it, but all that gray behind is created by the office 

building adjacent.   

          So just to just go back over there, there's -- the 

way that this is, that's this façade going up to the 

roofline at just under 80, and there's -- set well back is 

their mechanical penthouse.  These cars are just maneuvering 

in the garage, there's no parking on the lobby level.  

That's just the loading. 

          So the last element of relief is that's that 

little basement area.  There are now staff lockers, a small 

exercise room, and the possibility of a small kitchen to 

service the -- you know, minimally service the lobby. 

          Here you can see the sort of simplicity of the 

plan layout.  So let me just see.  That's it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you very much.  

Okay.  Do Board members have questions for the applicant?  

Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  None of these are, like, deal-

breaking questions, but I'm just curious.  You show two 

elevators, one of which doesn't have any door to the 

corridor.  Are they both passenger?  Are they passenger 

service?

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  They're both passenger, with 

one favored for service, right.  We actually designed it as 

a single elevator building, but the operators were really 

urging us to get that second elevator.  The door will come 

later.  [Laughter]            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Presumably opposite that door in 

the caf.  I can only find 67 rooms; 13 on floors 2, 4 and 6 

and 14 on floors 3 and 5.  But it should be clear by that 

Jeff writes up a decision.  Should we vote a decision at 

some point?   

          The atrium, does it receive any natural light, or 

could it receive natural light?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  It can.  It's -- it actually, 

if you look at the way that it comes to that point, that 

point, well I can go back.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  There's like a four-foot section of 

wall.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Exactly.  See that point 

there?  It actually -- it's not very beautifully designed 

yet.  See that there?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  There's an opportunity -- a 

87

really kind of cool opportunity for a very vertical light 

element all the way up there.  There's actually -- it sees 

daylight in that corner.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'm just -- sorry, in some way 

curious why you didn't put another room there?             

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Well it's interesting you 

should say that.  Yeah, that's interesting.  Well, I'll tell 

you one reason, is that actually the elevator -- this does 

not count as floor area.   

          So it's a managing -- because the hotel is tight 

and that corridor is tight.  And so, it is a way of 

alleviating the tightness without affecting the gross floor 

area of the building.  That's the best answer I can give.            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  Did you consider making the 

architectural treatment of the sixth floor similar to the 

treatment of the second floor, as a way of having a 

different expression than the middle, but something that was 

not out of character with the rest of the building?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  So I think the answer is no.           

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It kind of looks like a spaceship 

had landed on the building.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah, actually you know what's

interesting, we did play with some columnar elements in 

front of that screen, so it wasn't so kind of foster-like up 

there, but got simplified.  I think I was trying to just 

have a top and deemphasize it.  And it's a little heavy, the 

second floor.   

          So I was deliberately trying to be a lot heavier 

now at the bottom and lighter at the top.  Also, you know, 

there's all those Viennese buildings that do that.  So I 

guess I was trying to do an attic story that's glazed.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Tom, did you have 

questions?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yep.  I'll start with a really 

hard question.  In the courtyard behind Mark, what's -- how 

does the abutter service and access their existing building, 

even though the walls are blank?  They might need --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah.  So on the -- oops -- so 

that property line is actually there, right?  And they 

didn't -- they actually do have some equipment back here, 

and they didn't provide any way in and out of their garage 

to reach that.

          We've set back our building here to provide people 

the ability to go back here and check on stuff and do what 

they need to do.  See that?  Which is not formalized in any 

way with our abutter.  I think you're going to hear from 

them little bit. So that's the answer. 

          Up above, our building follows the lot line.  So 

it's a very strange piece of captured space back here.   

          We do have the ability to make a hole in our 

building, you know, to get through there.  There is our 

loading dock right there. Yeah.  So with some good 

cooperation, we could do that.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.  Can you go to the second-

floor plan?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  I'm going to have to go all 

the way back to it.  Excuse me a second. Am I at the 

beginning?  All right, sorry.  Thank you.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So it goes to the question of how 

that space behind your corniced second floor, you know, line 

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Okay. Yeah.   

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I didn't see doors or access.  

works.   

What is that?   

90

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah.  There should be 

actually doors here.  This -- see this bit here is useable.  

And so, in the version where that screen came all the way 

down to the ground, the second version I showed, there would 

be no -- there wouldn't be --            

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Right.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  -- a floor here, right?  And 

the lobby would come all the way out to this line.  And in 

the version where you kept that curve, this would be void.  

So there should have been doors shown here, they're omitted.         

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.  You can add those with the 

elevator door when you get?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So I guess the renderings are 

clever, because I do the same technique.  For me, there's an 

unresolved section of the elevation behind a tree, and it's 

on the Hampshire street side next to the door, to the left 

of the door. 

comes down?   

          So architecturally you have a large pier that 

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yes.  So let's get to that.  

You'll get that in elevation, maybe.

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yes, I do know about it.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Because you put a tree there.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  I may be -- it's actually on 

both elevations, but yes, mm-hm [laughter].       

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Okay.  It's just there's a large 

--  

elevation.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  You're talking about here now?         

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes, that whole area of the 

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  It's worse on the other one.           

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Right, okay.  Okay, so that needs 

work.  Because I mean visually, I don't understand 

architecturally formally how is that resolving itself here.  

You're supposed to sort of ignore the mass coming down form 

above, and the cornice breaks in, and then there's no 

resolution to my eye architecturally at the corner.   

          I stop at that intersection every Saturday on my 

way back from coaching hockey, it'll drive me crazy for the 

next 25 years.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  You know, I have an answer, 

which of course you know that I was going to have an answer,

right?  Because it bothers me.  I mean, obviously I've got a 

lot of necessity on that first floor.  But the -- I just 

wanted to actually get to this one.  Okay.   

          But one of the things I do think is interesting 

about old buildings, as opposed to new buildings, let's say 

in Central, is the amazing way in which the first floors 

have lost all relationship to the upper floors.    

          I know -- I knew you'd laugh at me.  But in a way, 

you know, what it does it strengthens the street and loosens 

-- all right, fine, I'll leave it alone.  So I get that.   

          So, but I was going to say, actually, because we 

changed it --  why I switched to this -- see this?  We 

changed it here.  See this?  Because when we did that curb, 

it comes a little further than the square design, and it's a 

little more solid.  It's not as good on the garage entrance, 

because we're really trying to keep the sight lines for 

Traffic and Parking on the garage entrance.  But this one's 

way better. 

          So that's one of the kinds of interesting things 

to figure out whether we should be doing this version or the 

other version.  And this version definitely preserves that 

mass coming down and creates a more kind of interesting 

punched opening that gets you into this light lobby.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah, I still like the balcony on 

93

the second floor, so you'd see heads there.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yes.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  There must be a way to put a 

floor in there and still -- if you choose formerly to go 

this way, and that's not decided.  I mean, I don't want to 

monopolize the time here.   

          I do think -- my eye is also drawn to the same 

thing that Hugh's was, relative to that top floor.  I'd like 

a reference to Vienna, but it doesn't look like, doesn't 

remind me of Vienna, right?  The scale of that reminds me of 

a Howard Johnson's more than Vienna.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Mm-hm.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  So -- now, without the orange 

roof.  If you had the orange roof, but --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  We were going to talk about 

materials next.  We can do that.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yeah.  So it seems incongruous to 

me, and it's the scale of the openings, and maybe you're 

trying to suggest those are the luxury suites because you 

got the views, but without being specific -- I don't want to

-- you are a skilled designer -- there's got to be a way to 

make it hang together a little better up there. 

          What's the public interest in that comment in 

particular?  It has to do with the unity of the whole 

building, right?  Just so that it's proper.  And so, I think 

there is a public interest.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions right 

now?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Did you ever look at it with 

the loading on Hampshire?  It seems like it's going to be 

creating a lot of congestion on Portland, especially during 

the loading periods.  You know, the hotels generate a lot of 

laundry, a lot of beverage.  I don't know if you're going to 

try to get a restaurant.  It's a very tight spot.  And I 

know you're going to try valet parking, correct?             

          Mark BOYES-WATSON:  Yes.     

          Louis J. BACCI, JR.:  But the cueing is a problem 

for me, and I do not know what Traffic and Parking, I didn't 

get their memo.  You're on the crosswalks as soon as you cue 

on Portland.   

          So when there were trucks maneuvering in and out, 

you'd be backing the street up for a while.  I'm curious

what your thoughts are on the other façade?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  I think that we actually 

didn't look at it on Hampshire, but actually as we've been 

talking to Traffic and Parking, I think that they're really 

looking at Hampshire as a major bike-through.   

          And we've already got the -- this is a small 

hotel.  There won't be intense loading, and what's going in 

and out of that I know it won't be there forever, but it's 

been there forever. 

          The auto repair shop, they back in and out of 

their loading docks.  So facing those opposite each other, 

and I know that it doesn't sound optimal, and it a really 

weird little stretch, that tiny bit between Broadway and 

Hampshire.  But I think concentrating those uses on that, we 

won't be a big contributor to any problem there. 

          In terms of the valet parking, there's room to 

pull -- if there was a pressure point, a lot of people, we 

have room to pull in in front of that garage elevator and 

actually stack cars in that space.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You know, your neighbor is 

pulling in and pulling out automobiles, not trucks.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  They are, yes, yeah.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  When they have their 

sidewalks full of cars, you have a truck there, or several, 

because you do create loading.  I don't know if you're doing 

your own laundry in house?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  We are, but not at present.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I live around the corner.  

It's already pretty tough when there's traffic.  That 

intersection is touchy.  I'd hate to see you start cuing up 

cars into both intersections.  I'd like to actually hear 

from Traffic and Parking at some point.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do you guys want to 

speak to that now?  Sure.  Yep.    

          JOE BARR:  So I guess -- Joe Barr -- B-a-r-r-, 

Director of Traffic, Parking and Transportation.  I guess 

specifically to the question that you're asking Lou, I think 

that given the scale of the garage, which is relatively 

small, and the scale of the hotel. 

          And my understanding is there would not be -- you 

know, there would not be a significant restaurant, there 

might be some -- it sounds like some small amount of food 

service for room service or things like that, but not like a 

restaurant that would generate a huge amount of loading and

unloading, that we're not particularly concerned about the 

traffic impacts on Portland itself. 

          You know, it's a -- it is a weird little stretch 

of street, I agree.  But I think having the access off of 

Hampshire Street, in terms of our sort of larger goals for 

how we want the streets to function is more problematic, 

because that’s what the applicant referred to.   

          The expectation is that that would be a location 

which is -- you know, already is a location which has 

significant bicycle traffic, and it would be upgrading the 

bicycle facilities there.  And I think having additional 

curb cuts on Hampshire would not be particularly compatible 

with that use. 

          So on balance, I think keeping it on Portland 

Street, which is more of a service street at this point is 

more compatible.  Obviously, we'll have to keep an eye on 

things.   

          The existing impacts of One Kendall Square in 

their -- they've really tried hard, but the fact that their 

delivery drivers don't seem to have any ability to behave 

properly is a much more significant concern than anything 

associated with this building.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  My first reason for 

rationale use of Hampshire Street it it's adjacent to 

another loading area that's quite well used.  So -- and if 

you do not use that side, and you do queue cars into the 

intersections, now we have Hampshire Street with the bike 

lanes, with the extra traffic, with the -- and it's a 

blocked intersection all the time. 

          It's probably not the best location for either.  

I'd just like to have seen it on the other side, just to see 

what it looked like, and see how it seemed to work.   

          It seems like there's more room on that side with 

Webster Ave coming out towards it, and there's some room in 

that intersection right there, where they would be able to 

turn around.  They're not going to be able to drive into it, 

they're not going to have to pull across the lane and back 

in. 

          There's going to be a lot of congestion there.  I 

don't know what their trips are a day for this operation for 

loading, I'm curious.               

          JOE BARR:  I mean, when we don't have exact 

numbers for the loading operations part of things, and they 

did not -- the project is too small to require a TIS for, 

99

22

you know, what we would normally see, I don't expect there 

to be a huge volume of loading.  If you guys have something 

to add to that.   

          I guess the other thing I would just say about 

Hampshire Street is that although you're right, there is the 

existing loading dock, I think over time we'd like to see, 

and I recognize that that building is not new, but not 

particularly old, it's not going to change use anytime soon, 

but we certainly want to try to limit the amount of curb 

activity, or number of curb cuts that were happening on 

Hampshire Street. 

          So I totally understand the concern.  I think it's 

something we can work with them to manage.  Obviously, I 

don't know what the impact on the building function would be 

if you were to move the entrance onto Hampshire.  This is 

sort of the layout that we saw, and we felt reasonably 

comfortable that we could make it work. 

          We did say, and I'm not sure why you don't have a 

copy of our memo, but in our memo we did note that one thing 

we are concerned about with Portland Street is making sure 

that any vehicle -- any trucks that are backing out, because 

they will not have line of sight out of it.

22

          And, you know, they're more likely to be backing 

out, as opposed to the cars coming out of the garage, which 

will be coming out front wise, they make sure that they have 

somebody to help them back out or help with traffic flow to 

avoid them sort of blindly having to back out into the 

intersection.  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Well, that was the other 

thing I noticed.  You have a 30-foot space carved out for 

loading.  How are you going to control the length of your 

vehicles?  Your trucks?     

          PATRICK BARRETT:  So --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  This is always a problem.     

          PATRICK BARRETT:  As an operational piece of this 

hotel, without a significant commercial component to it, 

there's no restaurant.  There's no -- we have no -- the only 

loading really right now that's being contemplated is 

laundry service.  They typically don't come with a larger 

vehicle.  And certainly we can adjust hours of operations to 

make sure that these things happen in an earlier timeframe 

that keeps out of the traffic. 

          But, again, not a perfect scenario, but the lack 

of these commercial uses at the base of the building I think

see -- at least loading traffic you'll see in this building.  

It's mostly just managing the rooms, cleaning the rooms, and 

monitoring trash. 

          The trash generated by a hotel room, very 

different.  I've actually had an intimate experience with 

this down the street in terms of what's generated if it were 

residential use or even a commercial use.   

          Not to minimize it in any way, but there is -- 

those operations will happen, and we -- similar to a project 

in Central Square that -- we worked with Traffic and Parking 

in terms of determining time of use, that’s the key.   

          I think, you know, these -- managing these loading 

and unloading I think is only really done well if you're 

able to be able to coordinate with your operator, and that's 

where we're thinking. 

          The Hampshire Street, just to speak to that a 

little bit, we did talk to Traffic and Parking, 

understanding that they are bringing a bike lane down there.  

They're going to be asked to do -- I believe it's a change 

to the bicycle ordinance en route, to require a temporary 

lane going down Hampshire Street as well. 

102

          We're looking into potentially designing that 

piece of sidewalk around that corner to accommodate for a 

raised bicycle lane.  So it does take up a significant 

amount of sidewalk space.   

          And that's more of a working with Traffic and 

Parking kind of thing in terms of trying to accommodate the 

future use, because we also do not know really when it's 

coming.   

          We know it's coming.  So it's -- and we decided 

it's better to get used to the idea that it would be on 

Portland side, as opposed to try to make anything 

operational on Hampshire.  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Just to speak to the size, I 

just want to just make sure that it was clear, and it 

probably was not clear when I was talking, is that there's 

an aisle there -- see that? -- that leads to the parking and 

then this is the loading area.  So this is actually just the 

zoning requirement in that sort of green, that kind of green 

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You realize you have that --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Which is -- I think it's 10 x 

line.   

30.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  You realize you have that 

spot inside your wall, correct?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah, just [laughter].  Just, 

just, just.   

of problems for you.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'm looking for pinch points 

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I don't want you to have 

problems, and I'm just -- that's why I'm looking, and I 

think it's a problematic location.  I think it's going to 

take a lot of work on your part to make it work.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So Joe, while we have 

you there, can you speak a little bit about the operation of 

the bicycle parking?  Any concerns about the distance, 

alternatives explored, that kind of thing?     

          JOE BARR:  So, I mean I don't -- given that it's -

- you know, a relatively compact site, I don't think that we 

perceive this as a huge issue to provide relief for the 

bicycle -- for the distance, for the bicycle parking.  We 

didn't really look I don't think at any alternative 

locations, just because the site is so tight. 

          We did ask about whether there was any way to

allow access sort of directly from, you know, through the 

sort of back entry, but I believe that that's sort of where 

the front desk is located.  And so, there's a door there, 

but that's not really a door that I think they would want, 

you know, their guests going through. 

          But, like I said, given the small size of the 

site, and the constraints, it seemed like a reasonable 

tradeoff, and particularly if that area, as Mark described, 

is sort of a pleasant, you know, not a back of house area, 

but sort of feels like it's actually, you know, part of the 

lobby where the short--term bicycle parking is located, that 

I think makes it -- doesn't feel like you're sort of having 

to go down some random hallway and, you know, find your way 

through some mess.  It's like it's -- you know, in a weird 

place.  It's right out there, and it's easy to find.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So then I guess my 

question is, have we explored whether the front desk needs 

to be right in front of that door?  I mean, that seems like 

the easier thing to move.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  What we're -- my thinking on 

that is that you could move the front desk.  It's not, like, 

bolted down as it were.  The only thing is that what I think

that we were passing out on the site is that, you know, you 

really want a bicycle experience to be the same as any other 

experience for the guests.   

          So using the front door and coming in the same way 

and supervision and the elegance of the whole space.  So 

that's why we didn't -- we don't see that way in.  That's 

what -- that was our thinking.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I'd like to follow up on 

that.  So when a family drives up in one of the 16 cars 

that's going to park there loaded with luggage, where are 

they going to go first?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  They're going to go into -- 

they're going to stop opposite the front door.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  In what?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Well, in the current 

situation, there's parking along that edge on Hampshire.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  So they're going to stop 

there.      

pull up to the curb.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  But they're going to

the curb and they're going to unload their car there.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right, and give it to 

a valet.  They're not allowed to pull into the garage 

themselves.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Right.  They're not allowed to 

pull into the garage themselves at all, okay?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  But -- and the bicyclists, the 

short-term bicyclists, are they pulling into the garage 

themselves?  Into that forecourt through --       

          THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  So the door location is there.  

So this is open to the street space here.   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  And so, if you ride 

your bike, where are you going to go?     

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  So you park here, your 

bicycle.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So you pull into where the 

valets pull in the cars?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Well, the valet then is going 

to pull all the way into the garage.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  All right.  So there's going to 

-- assume there's not a car there.  But the parking is still 

going in the garage.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Sorry, the bicycle?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  The bicycle.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  No, it stays right there.  

Those are bike parking spaces right there, for the short-

term.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah, but they still want -- 

when you ride up, and you get off the bike, where are you 

getting off your bike?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Right here.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So you are pulling --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Oh, sorry.  Yes, it's just a 

question of definition.  Absolutely, you're in this 

forecourt.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  You're in with your bike?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Now what is this 18 that says, 

"future scooter parking"?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  That is me, believing that the 

city is going to love those once they come.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And how are they going to get 

into there?   

--  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Exactly the same way.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So they're going to come into  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Right here.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- into the garage.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  And leave their scooter.  

Instead of leaving them on the street, they're going to 

leave them right here.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right, but they --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  But of course they don't exist 

yet, and I'm not allowed to talk about them.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  So --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I guess my question is --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  -- they are --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- why can't the car filled 

with luggage and people pull into that area?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  It could, and the hotel could 

instruct them to do that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  They would have the 

109

same problem, right?  Right now, there is the front desk 

right in front of that door.     

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Right.    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  But there is -- shows a 

door there.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And it --  

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yes, and that's actually for  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- makes room for the events to 

let people come in there, and you've got that nice triangle 

right behind it where a lovely desk, reception desk could 

--    

go.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I think you're 

hearing from us we'd like to at least see that explored.  So 

I want to just finish up with Joe, while we've got him here.  

I note that we've got some TDM measures listed here, but the 

PTDM plan is not finalized.  Do you have any information on 

where we are with that?     

          JOE BARR:  My understanding is that it's a small 

project, PTDM plan, and so I believe it's been submitted to 

the PTDM Officer very recently.  And so, she had not had a

chance to fully review or provide a decision on that, so 

obviously that means that the Board can't make -- act 

officially tonight.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.  We can't --    

          JOE BARR:  -- tonight.  It sounds like there are 

plenty of other issues that require further investigation.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          JOE BARR:   So that doesn't seem like a high 

danger that you'd want to act, but --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No.  I just wanted to 

clarify that.  Thank you.  All right.  Ted, now you can take 

--    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Okay.  So my other two issues, 

I'll leave my comments about design for later.  You don't 

have any renderings that show the penthouse, do you?  That 

rationally show the penthouse what it's actually going to 

look like?   

Yeah.     

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Not that you haven’t seen.  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Just what's here?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  All right.  Well, I would

really like to see what it's going to look like.  It looks 

like there's an awful lot of stuff up there, and an awful 

lot of screens in many different directions.   

          And so, I'd like to see that, and I'd like to see 

it from, you know, what it looks like down Medeiros Ave, 

from down Medeiros Avenue, and probably from Hampshire 

Street. 

          And then, since there is a next time, I'd really 

like to see the materials with the siding.  Because I'm not 

familiar with that.  And in the renderings, it mostly looks 

like it's a solid blank wall.   

          What you've shown us today, you know, the grout 

lines -- and I get they're not grout -- but the lines look 

more interesting, and so I'd really like to have a good -- 

better concept of what that really is going to look like.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Corinne?              

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I have a couple questions for 

staff, and then a couple for the applicant.  What is allowed 

to be built with no zoning relief?  It looks like this is a 

very flexible area.   

          So are we basically trying to decide if an office 

or a lab versus affordable housing, versus a hotel is better

in this space? Assuming it meets the special permit 

criteria?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  So this is a district that 

allows a range of different uses, and it's a particular 

twist in this district that a hotel use as well as 

residential requires a special permit, and the hotel use 

requires a special permit from the BZA, but this is a case 

where because some of the relief that's being sought is from 

the Planning Board, all the special permits go to the 

Planning Board.      

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So if we were to find that it 

didn't meet the special permit criteria, what could be built 

with no zoning relief, an office or a lab?  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I would have to -- generally 

speaking, a range of commercial uses might be allowed.  So 

it would be lab or office, or even industry type uses would 

be allowed in the district.   

          I would -- there's a kind of a constellation of 

requirements of what would require a special permit or not, 

but yeah, it's a pretty broad range of uses.   

          And as-of-right commercial use could be allowed, 

as long as it doesn't trigger the -- it could be allowed as

of right, as long as it doesn't trigger some project review 

requirement or, like as in the case with this project, 

there's a lot of dimensional and parking relief that’s 

needed.  So you might imagine just about any land use that's 

put on this type of a lot might need to seek some kind of 

relief.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And they're 

requesting a special permit for exemption of basement area, 

and the calculation of gross floor area.  I understand why 

an applicant might want that, but is there any benefit to 

the city, or to the community in making that finding?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Funny you should ask.  So there is 

a provision that was added to the zoning a few years ago, 

four years ago, 2016.  And it's -- the definition -- it's -- 

a special permit is embedded in the definition, which is 

sort of unusual.   

          But it says that it's -- if the uses that are 

occupying that basement space, or the character of the 

neighborhood or district, then it would be -- it could be 

exempt by special permit.   

          So that's -- often there are more criteria -- and 

it's important with special permits that the special permit

describes what the criteria area are for granting the 

special permit, and the decisions are based on that. 

          But this simply says that the uses support the 

character of the neighbor or district.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And if for some reason we 

didn't find that, would that mean that it costs more to 

build, or would that mean that they're -- they would need 

zoning relief for FAR, or what would the implications be?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It just had -- really that 

provision ultimately -- the thing that's interesting about 

it is it ultimately doesn't have much to do with what's in 

the basement, it has to do with just the total development 

that's allowed on the lot.   

          So this development is fairly -- sorry, I had lost 

track of where I had the application, but fairly close to 

the maximum of what's allowed for the district.  It's also 

fairly close to 25,000 square feet, which we noted in our 

memo, triggers some additional requirements. 

          So it would simply put -- that would add -- if it 

weren’t exempt, it would add to the total gross floor area 

of the project, which could trigger other requirements, or 

it could require adjusting the building design to reduce

gross floor area and some other parts.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  My next questions 

are for the applicant.  What is the estimated length of 

construction? If you were to receive this special permit, 

how long would it take to build this hotel?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  So it would take a little 

while to start.  There's lots of further permitting.  

Probably it's 18 months to 24 months.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  How many feet of public 

thoroughfare would be blocked off during the construction, 

and for how many months?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yeah, we don't have a complete 

plan from a contractor yet about how he's going to utilize 

the site.  So I actually don't know the answer to that 

question.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  In your best guess, do you 

think that for example Hampshire Street would have a lane 

blocked for 18-24 months?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  I think that it might have the 

parking areas that we would seek the city's help with having 

a drop zone off the site, which would likely be the parking 

areas in front of the building on Hampshire.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And I understand you don't have 

a construction plan yet, but you're saying you don't expect 

-- it's reasonable to not expect that you would block 

traffic lanes?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Correct.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So my next question was 

actually about public parking spots.  If you had to estimate 

how many meters or spots that people could otherwise -- 

spots which would be open to the public otherwise will be 

unusable during construction and for how many months?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  It's around three, I think, 

that are in front of the building.  There may even only be 

two.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay.  Thank you.   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  It's a small area.  Because 

there's a loading dock adjacent.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And that would be for the 24 

months maximum?   

          MARK BOYES-WATSON:  Yes, it wouldn't be more than 

to the length of construction.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And during construction, will 

you block any bike lanes, and for how long?

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Okay, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

questions for the Board, before we go to public comment?  

All right.  So we did have a signup sheet.  If you're here 

to speak on this, but didn't have an opportunity to sign up, 

don't worry.   

          The -- our -- when you are called, please come to 

the podium, speak into the microphone, give and spell your 

name and give your address.  Once you've done that, the 

timer will start.  You'll have a green light until there's 

30 seconds left, at which point it will change to yellow, 

and then to red when you're out of time. 

          I think that's all of my reminders. So our first 

speaker is Chris Chandor.   

          CHRIS CHANDOR:  Good evening, Chris Chandor, 

senior Vice-President of Development for the Davis 

Companies, an affiliate of the Davis Companies owns the 

adjacent office building, 201 Broadway. 

          We're here with -- generally in support of what we 

see here, but there are a couple of issues that are of

concern to us.   

          First and foremost is the lower left-hand corner 

of the plan you see on the screen there, where the building 

comes very, very close, and in fact the trip of the triangle 

actually touches our building. 

          On the lower floors, it's not an issue, 1,2 and 3.  

It is a party wall.  4-8 we do have windows on the corner of 

that building.  They are basically on the property line that 

was permitted when this building was developed in the'80s.  

Obviously, it would not be permitted today, but it is what 

it is.  And we're very concerned that we would have a blank 

wall less than 12 inches away from those windows. 

          Further detail, I'm not even sure how you would 

build that wall from a constructability standpoint, to have 

contractors up there installing a rain screen with no room 

to work, no room for scaffolding, no room to put materials 

in there that could cause damage to our buildings.   

          There are people whose desks are right on that 

corner.  I was in the building on Friday afternoon, a brick 

or hammer, or, you know, material being lifted into place 

came in contact with those windows, people could be injured. 

          I have not -- I honestly have no idea how you

would put up a rain screen there without putting a 

contractor inside our building, taking the window out, and 

installing the wall from inside our building. 

          So that's our primary concern.  Otherwise, we are 

not opposed to the hotel use.  We think it's a great 

addition to the neighborhood; certainly an improvement over 

the lot as it stands today.  We have a small restaurant, 

Kendall Kitchen, on the ground floor, and we'd be happy to 

provide food service to hotel guests.  We invite everybody 

to come in and support our restaurants.   

          So our -- again, our primary concern is the fourth 

through eighth floors.  We'd like to see that set back.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  The next 

speaker is Alex Wang. 

          ALEX WANG:  Hi, Alex Wang, W-a-n-g, 45 Market 

Street.  I'm a 10-year resident of area.  I've been working 

in the neighborhood as far back as 2008.  First learned 

about this hotel plan today.  Didn't hear about, or didn't 

attend the previous neighborhood meetings. 

          Here to speak largely in support.  Really glad to 

see something replacing the Emma's Pizza site, what has been 

vacant for now over three years.  And in terms of the

choices, I'd prefer residential, but in terms of a 

nonresidential use, a hotel is really great.   

          Proximity to some great restaurants -- Kendall 

Kitchen just mentioned my favorite breakfast sandwich place 

in the city, next door 201 Broadway, automatic at night, One 

Kendall -- a lot of great places.   

          Public transit in the area is great, convenient to 

MIT, 68 Harvard, CT 2 out to Longwood Medical Area.  When 

I've been working in the area, we've had candidates and 

partners come in, and it would be really convenient for them 

to stay here.  They’ve been staying at the Marriott Kendall 

Cambridgeport, and even on the Boston side. 

          The only concern I wanted to bring up relates to 

the valet garage entry and exit on Portland, sort of adding 

to the discussion the Board had.   

          I was reading a parking study dated November 8, 

2019, that said, "Visitors driving to the hotel will drop 

their vehicle off along Hampshire Street." The valet will 

bring the vehicle to the parking area via a curb cut on 

Portland Street.   

          The proponent is committed to ensuring that all 

drop-off and pickup activity will take place in along 

121

22

Hampshire Street.   

          I'm not sure if that's still the plan or not, but 

in terms of the entry, if the valet is taking someone who's 

dropping off, that makes great sense to me.  It's a quick, 

very easy right turn.   

          I'm a little more concerned about bringing the car 

back to the front door, if that is still the plan.  I don't 

know if it's legal to make a U-turn if the car is coming 

left out of the garage back onto Hampshire, then to take a 

U-turn with the bike lane.  I'm not sure if that's legal.  

Like we said before, that's a pretty heavily biked traffic 

area.  Not super thrilled about that.   

          The alternatives are actually pretty long because 

of one-way streets in that area.  So if you're taking a 

right on Portland going out to Broadway, you've got to pass 

Market and Hampshire, which are really one-ways in the other 

direction.   

          You'd have to go all the way to Windsor to turn 

around and bring that car right in front of the front door.  

If you're going up Cardinal Medeiros, you've got to go past 

another few streets, and then it's I think Plymouth to 

Webster. 

122

          So some very small convenience factor there in 

terms of bringing the car in front of the front door.  But 

like I said, overall in support -- not many cars, but just 

mostly concerned about bikes.  Thanks.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  So I 

don't have anyone else signed up to speak on this matter.  

Is there anyone else in the audience who is here to be heard 

on this tonight?   

          Okay.  Seeing none, as was previously noted, this 

project does need a PTDM approval before we can vote on the 

permit.  So the applicant will be coming back.          

          Are there additional comments Board members want 

to make on things they want to see when it comes back?  Or 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess my first feedback is I 

think this is a great use.  I think it's a good design, 

although I think it needs some polishing.   

          The -- in my folded over pages here -- so on the 

rendering on 86.3, it doesn't show the building material 

wrapping into the forecourt.  That would be a good idea, at 

least in terms of color and texture and sheen it might be a 

somewhat different material.  But it's -- as you're trying

to accomplish your goal that would be a good idea.   

          And yes, I would very much like you to take the 

Howard Johnson's off the top.  But I'm -- and I very much 

like the alternative proposal of bringing the curve down to 

the lobby.  I think that's really a very striking feature, 

and it's also -- like, it's a shortcut if you're a 

bicyclist. 

          But it sort of -- you know, you've got to get rid 

of -- I guess that's probably Joe's parking cabinet in the 

middle of the rendering, but nothing's perfect.  So I agree 

with the points Tom made, so I won't reiterate those.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other -- 

yep, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Oh, well, I've already 

requested the materials, and the information about the 

penthouse.  It seems to me there's -- yes, there is a very 

definite base middle and top.  But it doesn’t seem to me 

they all work together.   

          And I really agree with what staff had talked 

about, and I'm curious about, you know, whether they would 

consider, you know, bringing the drum all the way down to 

the ground, but without having the -- whatever it is in 

124

front of it.  You know, I think having the sharp edge, right 

angle of the base and then going up to the drum looks very 

odd to me.   

          So I would ask whether they would consider that 

again.  And again, the Howard Johnson's, the sixth floor I 

think really needs some rethinking.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So I would say 

the comments brought up by the abutter in particular should 

probably be addressed in terms of constructability and how 

that's going to be achieved.   

          I want to -- and the neighbor who talked about the 

roundabout route for -- I hadn't frankly even focused on -- 

we were so focused on dropping off the car, talking about 

how that pickup works, to me argues even more heavily in 

favor of having that door to the forecourt work.  But we at 

least want to hear how hear how that operationally is going 

to work, I think when you come back. 

          Anything else? 

          All right.  So we'll hold this hearing open, and 

see you when you have your PTDM plan approved and some 

additional drawings to show us so that we can move forward.     

          PATRICK BARRETT:  Thank you very much.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  We're 

going to come back into session now.  This is the public 

hearing on Planning Board #339, 541 Mass Ave.   

          And just to remind everyone where we are 

procedurally with, last time we met on this, we had the 

applicants present their plans for the space for this, and 

then the Board essentially had an instant message question 

as to whether or not the applicant had to comply with the 

1,800-foot buffer zone, as required under the ordinance, 

given that this is not an Economic Empowerment applicant.   

          We requested an opinion from the City Solicitor on 

that, which we have received, and the City Solicitor has 

said that we cannot apply that 1,800-foot buffer to

Revolutionary Clinic's application in this location. 

          So in light of that, we're here tonight to 

continue the public hearing.  If the Board wants to review 

the design, given that it has been a while since we last saw 

you, we can certainly do that, or we can go right to 

questions -- oh, Jeff is stopping me.  What have I 

forgotten?   

          Thank you.  I need to note that we have only six 

members here tonight.  And we need to know if you want to go 

forward tonight, before I get too far into this that it 

causes a problem?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Please.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you, 

Jeff, I appreciate that.  Sorry, can you give your name for 

the stenographer?      

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  Yes.  Timothy Flaherty, 103 

Fresh Pond Parkway, Cambridge.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Now that 

we have established we are going forward tonight, despite 

the fact that we are only six members.  Okay.  All right.   

          So given that -- does the Board want a refresher 

on what we're looking at?  No? I am seeing folks are

familiar with your facility on Mass Ave, what I still think 

of as the old Blockbuster space, despite your very nice 

signage out there, I must say.   

          So folks are familiar with that and with changes 

such are being thought of, given the inclusion of retail, 

not just medicinal, at this location, which is what the 

permit is for. 

          Okay.  So should we then go straight to public 

comment on this and discuss after?  Good.  I like it.  Okay.  

Swaathi is getting a signup sheet.  If you have not signed 

up, as with all of our other public hearings tonight, I will 

make sure that anyone who's present who wants to be heard on 

this still gets a chance too. 

          When I call your name, please come forward to the 

mic at the podium.  State and spell your name, and then give 

your address.  And then you will have three minutes to make 

your comments.   

          The light will go green after you're done giving 

your address, and then yellow when you have 30 seconds left, 

and red when you're out of time. 

          So our first speaker on the list here is Donald 

Grossman.

          DONALD GROSSMAN:  Good evening, Donald Grossman, 

G-r-o-s-s-m-a-n, 179 Sidney Street.   I wrote you on the 

twenty-first of January and followed up with a subsequent e-

mail this week, and I'm just going to blast through quickly 

my concerns, which deal with the general criteria for 

issuing a special permit. 

          I didn't see any context map, as required by 

11804-B, that shows other cannabis uses, schools and other 

facilities.  So I think that needs to be completed before 

it's -- and resubmitted and reposted before a hearing.   

          The traffic generation I think would cause a 

substantial change in the established neighborhood 

character.  Their numbers are basically indefensible.  They 

choose -- they themselves chose NETA in Brookline as a 

comparison, but they only did a mode split in April of 2019.  

          They didn't actually record and present the 

absolute numbers.  They pulled the number out of the air of 

500 patients a day, and said that in their suit of the City 

of Cambridge, that they would be losing 700,000 a month in 

revenue. 

          I looked at NETA's numbers for sale tax paid in 

Brookline in April of 2019, and based on that, they sold 

129

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

5,400,000 in 1 month, it's a similar sized facility.  If you 

scale up based on 700,000 of sales for 500 patients, that 

would be more like 4,000 patients a day.  So I think this 

is, you know, approximately an eight of a credible number.   

          Traffic and Parking needs to do something to look 

at this.  There's just some proximity issues with the 

Buckner School, and they should certainly review that, given 

the increased traffic that was approved based on 120 trips.  

          And then there are two new factors.  One is that 

there's a nuisance and detriment to public health.  So there 

are 25,000 students in Cambridge, undergraduate and graduate 

living here.   

          A disproportionate number are domiciled next -- or 

near Central Square in the clinic.  29 August, 2019 

Surgeon's General reports that no amount of marijuana use 

for adolescents under the age of 26 is acceptable or safe.  

          So I think that, you know, just as the Traffic and 

Parking does a study, the Public Health Department should 

say that there are no risks to adolescents, or else prohibit 

the recreational sale to those under the age of 26. 

          And lastly, cannabis growing is an extremely 

energy-intensive use.  Revolutionary Clinics has a 70,000

square foot facility, which uses as much as 3,000 typical 

homes in Massachusetts.  So it seems like if we're really 

interested in greenhouse gas emissions, we should be 

addressing that also.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Okay.  

Next on the list is Jacquelyn Fahey Sandell.   

          JACQUELYN SANDELL:  8 Clinton Street.        

          THE REPORTER:  Could you spell your name, please?   

          JACQUELYN SANDELL:  J-a-c-q-u-e-l-y-n F-a-h-e-y S-

a-n-d-e-l-l.  Okay.  Thank you.  I had not realized because 

of -- until this meeting of tonight, when I saw it posted on 

the Revolutionary Clinic's window when I was walking by.  

But I do think that a special permit should not be issued. 

          Number 1, for these criterias (sic) under 10.43B, 

the traffic generated or pattern of access would definitely 

cause congestion.   

          I have heard from western Massachusetts residents 

that, you know, basically it's the Apple Store with, you 

know, people lining up the block and, you know, cars 

everywhere, et cetera. 

          Central Square is already extremely congested, 

particularly with all of the lane reductions and the bike

lane and everything.  You really can't drive through very 

quickly at all anymore. 

          There was talk at the last meeting -- well, not 

the last meeting.  At the time of the granting of the 

medical dispensary license, there was discussion, of a 

traffic study.  I think the demands on the traffic would be 

much different for a retail space than the dispensary 

clinic.   

          So I would ask that the Planning Board take a 

good, hard look at that.  I also am concerned under 

paragraph D for the welfare of children, as the prior 

speaker is.   

          I did not find on the website the context map, 

which was required to be submitted.  Perhaps that's been 

submitted to the Planning Board, but I submit that that 

would be very help for the public.   

          The Henry Buckner School is nearby.  There's a 

Salvation Army day care there.  There's a dance complex 

across the street, which is five floors of hundreds of 

children taking dance lesson.  There's a new charter school 

on Prospect Street.   

          There's the Tae Kwon Do studio, and the list

really goes on and on in that neighborhood.  And as a 

parent, I strenuously object to any waiver of the number of 

feet for the welfare of the children of this city. 

          Also right now, there's an -- there are somewhat  

-- there are paintings or artwork hanging in the window, and 

there is a very empty room off to the side facing Mass Ave.  

I had seemed to recall from the time of the dispensary that 

that was going to be a public space or something of that 

nature.   

          But I was interested to hear the -- what was 

agreed to for that empty room, because I don't recall that's 

what Tom had expected, and others had expected on the 

storefront in Central Square.  Thank you very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Next is 

Mike Crawford.     

          MIKE CRAWFORD:  Hi.  I'm a past Cambridge 

resident.  Right now I live in Marblehead, Mass.  Crawford, 

C-r-a-w-f-o-r-d, Mike.  I'm against giving the permit.  148 

Lafayette Street, Marblehead, Massachusetts.  I'm against 

the permit tonight for several reasons.  One of them is 

definitely the parking situation.   

          I also wanted to reference a post I think that

Revolutionary Clinics should definitely answer.  There was a 

Reddit post almost a year ago -- Revolutionary Clinics.  

It's basically about workplace, sexual harassment, 

discrimination.  We don't know if it's true.  I don't even 

want to bring it up, but there is no comment from 

Revolutionary Clinics on it.  It's been over a year.   

          If something like this was posted about me on 

social media, I would have a response in almost -- over a 

year.  So I think the zoning City Council should ask clinics 

about this incident that's been posted on Reddit.  And I'll 

just leave it at that, because that's a question that I 

would love to have an answer for.   

          If any Revolutionary -- you know, I also host a 

show -- any Revolutionary Clinic's rep. wants to speak to me 

about it, I'm more than willing to hear it out.  But that's 

concerning.  I think you guys should be aware of that and 

check that out.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Next 

speaker is Grant Ellis.   

          GRANT ELLIS:  Good evening, Madam Chair.  Grant 

Ellis, G-r-a-n-t E-l-l-i-s, Center Street, Cambridge, 

Massachusetts.  So I have some questions about this special

permit.   

          Firstly, regarding disabled parking, the applicant 

notes that they plan to use the shared municipal lot for 

this purpose for staff and customers, but the applicant has 

no way of ensuring those spots will be available for staff 

or customer use.   

          The ADA mandates that disabled staff be provided 

with accessible parking, and if there's no way for 

applicants to control the use of the shared municipal lot, 

there's no way for them to ensure that there's accessible 

parking for staff. 

          Likewise, applicant talks in their permit 

application about how they plan to manage crowd size by 

using an app to register applications -- appointment times 

throughout the day.  They note that there's an indefinite 

period that they'll use this process for, without giving any 

specifics.   

          I worry that if they transition away from that, 

we're going to end up with a situation like NETA has in 

Brookline, where there are lines snaking down the street of 

customers waiting to get in.  There's no other game in town 

right now.

          So if this opens, these lines could very well 

match, if not exceed what we see at NETA.  And for someone 

like myself who's disabled, I'm worried about the 

accessibility of that sidewalk if there's a line running 

down the sidewalk. 

          Unlike with NETA, there is no sort of discharge 

parking lot.  These lines will be on the sidewalk, and I'm 

concerned about that. 

          I also have some concerns about their estimated 

trips per day.  So in their application, they estimate 260 

vehicle trips per day.  But there is no dedicated parking, 

and they -- their proposal to use the municipal lot doesn't 

make sense, because the municipal lot is already at 

capacity, nearly constantly.   

          So this leads me to have concerns about whether or 

not there's going to be double parking, whether or not -- 

even though they say they're going to work with Uber and 

LYFT to designate a pickup spot on the municipal lot, people 

are going to put their address in on Mass Ave, and those 

Uber and LYFTs are not going to go to the municipal lot, 

they're going to double park and cause even more congestion, 

which is another serious concern.

          I'd really like to hear more about how the 

applicant is going to approach Uber and LYFT to get this 

drop-off at the municipal lot.  Does it guarantee that every 

pickup and drop-off is going to be at the lot, or can people 

circumvent the system?  Double parking is already a huge 

concern there. 

          And so, along with the Uber and LYFT concern, I 

worry that that double parking could impact the bike lane, 

which is already seeing a substantial amount of problems. 

          I also have concerns -- there was a community 

outreach meeting for this applicant's medical dispensary.  

There was no community outreach meeting for their 

recreational dispensary.   

          Likewise, at that initial outreach meeting for the 

medical, the space in the front of the store is brought up.  

They told us that that would be a community space.  Now it's 

being referred to as a vestibule in the application 

materials.   

          And I worry that's just going to be an extension 

of the retail space, not the community space we were 

promised.  Thank you.

James?     

          SASKIA JAMES:  Hello.  Saskia James, 251 Cottage 

Street, here in Cambridge.  So just --       

          THE REPORTER:  Can you spell your name, please?    

          SASKIA JAMES:  S-a-s-k-i-a.  Last name is James 

like James Bond, 251 Garden Street.  So just a few things.  

One, with Rev Clinics we know that they've sued the city, 

and so far, they've won.   

          And we've seen their attitude with them towards 

our city.  And it's one where they would rather sue our city 

than have a conversation with us as a city. 

          And so, there's certain things I think that they 

need to know that we as residents are concerned about, and 

they should be addressing.  And I think one of them in the 

first place is workplace protection rights.  When you come 

into the City of Cambridge, we know what's going in in the 

cannabis industry in the state of Massachusetts.  There are 

serious egregious workplace protections violations, because 

our state is behind in getting legislation for that going. 

          And so, there are certain things that somebody 

else pointed out, like a Reddit thing, about a sexual 

harassment claim that has happened at Rev.

          So we want to make sure that anybody that does 

work there is actually protected, and that there's a safe 

measure.  And that this should be written in as part of 

their plan, because they also have a diversity plan.  We 

know the state numbers, and right now the state is saying 

about 60 percent, over 60 percent is male, and over 70 

percent is white.   

          And so, Rev, in their lawsuit countered that they 

felt that what the city of Cambridge did was they had used 

race as a factor. And the judge didn't -- hadn't found that 

reason, but did find that their actual findings was in their 

favor, but not to that claim. 

          So I want to make sure that Rev Clinics actually 

cares about what these numbers are looking like from -- that 

the CCC has released.  That is predominantly cisgender, 

white men that are getting these jobs legally, as the 

cannabis industry has become legalized. 

          And as well as that, they are caring about the 

community.  And as far as the community space, quite 

frankly, I don't care about that.  Rev I would really like 

to see you guys go ahead and go forward and give some 

resources to SE and EE applicants, even out the field.

          You see what the applicants are looking like.  You 

see how expensive it is.  You've gone through it yourself.  

Be generous.  There's no need to be greedy.   

          So why don't you go ahead and help those who are 

not in a position to be able to have the finances to back 

themselves, and give equity.  That's a very big word within 

this city.  So you need to show forward (sic) and show that 

you understand that word as well too, if you think you're 

going to play here, and that this city is going to support 

you.  Thank you.    

Piff?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Goldie 

          GOLDIE PIFF:  I'm Goldie Piff, Goldie G-o-l-d-i-e 

P-i-f-f, 56 Mallard.  So I'm here with two concerns also; 

the traffic, it's a horrible location.  Also, let me back 

up.  A lot of people weren’t able to show tonight.  They had 

planned on coming, went to the wrong address and kind of got 

annoyed and gave up.  So the little bit of representation 

here really doesn't show the people that wanted to come, and 

where it was so last-minute, we all rearranged our schedules 

-- besides the point.   

          But the traffic is a big concern.  And just what

Saskia said, and Grant, and everyone else before me, we do 

have concerns as far as the Reddit.  Is it in court?  What's 

going on there?   

          Before you can allow a company to come in our 

community, they should be in good standings, completely.  

And if there was an incident with an employee, it needs to 

be addressed before you permit them to come into your 

community, I would hope. 

          And just like Saskia said, as far as doing 

something for the EEs that you have the lawsuit up against, 

we're trying to work with people, but I kind of feel like 

the bravado attitude that they've come in with, and it's 

just their way or the highway. 

          And I think that Cambridge needs to slow things 

down, take a hard look at them, lift up those blankets and 

see what's underneath, and make sure that Cambridge is 

getting a great deal.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Ominique 

Gardner?        

          OMINIQUE GARDNER:  Hello, my name is Ominique

else against Rev Clinic being able to open up.  I have a 

couple concerns.   

          My major concern is the article that I just read, 

but it's not new, it's been out there for over a year now, 

and protections of employees and the community altogether, 

and the fact that this hasn't been addressed by Rev Clinic 

or anyone is a major concern, especially as they're planning 

to open up in the center. 

          So that's my Number 1 thing.  Secondly, just Rev 

Clinic being against -- well, not being against, Rev Clinic 

using patients as an excuse for their greed and for them 

thinking that they should have priority opening.  I think 

that it's disgusting and just totally unacceptable.   

          And their plan, they -- one thing that they 

mentioned in their plan was about using the storefront, and 

that's what someone else mentioned too, using the storefront 

like a community space.  And they mentioned about using it, 

having a radio station there.  And it's just more so used as 

a storefront.  So that’s one thing. 

          Another thing is parking.  Their parking plan 

altogether just -- it's not legit, it's not solid, and I 

don't, like Grant said, I don't believe that they're going 

142

to have Uber drop off at a certain site.   

          A lot of people are going to still put Rev 

Clinic's address in there and say, "Let me just hop out 

right here in the front."  And that's going to cause more 

traffic jams. 

          Second thing, well third thing, is thinking about 

the lines that will be backed up, and how the sidewalks, how 

we're going to use the sidewalks so that people that are 

using wheelchairs coming through, and just how crowded that 

          And one other thing is thinking about their -- I 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  

could be. 

think that's about it.    

Next is Caleb Mathis.   

          CALEB MATHIS:  Caleb Mathis, C-a-l-e-b M-a-t-h-i-

s, 111 South Main Street, Randolph, Massachusetts.  As 

somebody who works in Cambridge, my biggest opposition is 

also the traffic.   

          We already know that Central Square has a whole 

lot of traffic.  I don't know how Revolutionary Clinic is 

going to be dealing with that, but I assume as a 

multimillion-dollar company, that they should have or hire

people that know how to create a strategic plan, and 

especially also when delivery is also becoming legalized in 

Massachusetts.  So I don't know how they're going to be 

dealing with that also. 

          As massive amount of traffic is going to be coming 

in, and they also are doing delivery, I don't know how 

that’s going to work.   

          Basing your study, based on NETA is a very big 

challenge, because we all know how NETA is dealing with all 

their foot traffic and all the traffic that’s coming into 

Brookline.  Putting that into Cambridge is going to be a big 

hustle, and that's going to be a very big problem, and 

nobody wants to deal with that.   

          So they -- from my perspective, they need to come 

up with a better traffic study, a better traffic strategic 

plan, and that's kind of my understanding of it.  I don't 

really have anything else I really thought about, but I 

think that they need a better traffic plan.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Next is 

Chauncy Spencer.   

          CHAUNCY SPENCER:  C-h-a-u-n-c-y, last name 

Spencer, S-p-e-n-c-e-r.  And that's 53 Roslin Street.  I'm

here today in opposition of the Rev Clinic proposal, or 

permit.   

          And I would like to start by saying that there are 

at least a dozen or more citizens of Cambridge that wanted 

to be here tonight, and that we need to delay this, because 

they've been on social media screaming to come here and be 

here, but this has been pushed back to this late hour.   

          They should have the right to voice their opinion.  

And I recommend that you guys delay this, and allow them to 

be here.   

          But I can tell you some of the things that they've 

been saying.  One in particular is the fact that they did 

not have an outreach meeting.  We are as economic or -- as 

people trying to open up an establishment, it is required 

that we have an outreach meeting before we go to licensing, 

before the CCC. And that needs to be -- the community needs 

to be heard and have those issues addressed.   

          And especially when they're switching from medical 

to recreational, that's a whole 'nother ball game.  And you 

won't have people coming or needing to be someplace at, you 

know, 9:00 at night to voice their opinion.   

          They would be able to -- they would have to

address that, and have that conversation with the community, 

just like every single one of us have to do.  And then the 

community can make their decisions based upon those 

conversations. 

          However, this group decided to file a lawsuit and 

ram this through.  And that has created a whole host of 

problems throughout the state, because when we're trying to 

do things in other cities, they're citing this lawsuit as a 

reason to deny Economic Empowerment a priority in their 

cities. 

          You need to really think about what type of 

company you're bringing to your community, and what 

commitments they have to the community.  It doesn't mean 

much if they're railroading this through the entire state.  

They're railroading or creating problems throughout the 

entire state for other people. 

          The other issue is I'm hearing all these problems 

with the traffic plans from your citizens.  And the last 

thing we need in this industry are more people with poor 

traffic plans.  And if you're going to be the first to open 

up and set the example, all you're doing is making 

unnecessary problems for other entrepreneurs who are trying

to open up after that.  Because they're going to see that 

you're setting a bad example, once again.  So I think that's 

all I need to say today.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  So that's 

the last person who had signed in.  Is there anyone else who 

wants to be heard on this matter tonight?  Yes, sir.   

          ROBERT BARBER:  Hi, my name is Robert Barber.  

That's R-o-b-e-r-t B-a-r-b-e-r.  I live at 131 Orchard 

Street, Somerville.  I ride the Red Line in.  I work near 

Kendall Square, so I walk past the site every day.  I guess 

I'd like to say this time around -- I wouldn't say I'm for 

or against this permit.  I'm not sure if I'm quite educated 

enough on some of the details around it.   

          But I can see that traffic is definitely an issue.  

That's going to have to be dealt with.  But it seems like 

no, matter where this is going to happen in the city of 

Cambridge, if it's ever going to happen in the city of 

Cambridge, that traffic is going to be an issue, because 

wherever the first place is going to be, there's this 

ridiculous induced demand.   

          So it's a hurdle that’s going to have to be 

overcome at some point.  There's going to have to be a

feasibility study or something that's done to figure out how 

to address that problem. 

          I would like to push back, though, on one point 

that I've heard in this room by a couple of individuals and 

outside of this room amongst other people is this idea that 

bringing recreational use marijuana into Cambridge is, like, 

it's something that’s going to be brought in and it's going 

to be spreading it, it's going to be tainting -- like 

college kids are now going to be gaining access to it.  And 

it's something that it's not here.   

          And that's -- I would just like to say from 

personal experience and what I've seen firsthand, is that 

that's not true; that when you walk around town you can 

smell it.  And I know people -- I personally drive to 

Brookline and go to NETA if I want to get some.  I'm -- I 

have a job, I'm an upstanding member of society, and I do 

smoke marijuana sometimes.   

          But most people don't have access to that, and 

they go to street dealers who can supply them and make sure 

that they don't forget to offer you harder drugs -- pills, 

and various illicit street drugs.  And I think that maybe 

not necessarily, this may be rushed for this to happen at

this particular location, but there's a -- I think that 

there's essentially two paths that's available.   

          One is kicking the can down the road and 

supporting -- basically tacitly supporting the illicit drug 

trade that’s currently happening.  Or eventually making, you 

know, something available that's taking the illegal element 

out of it and making it safer and taxing it. 

          So, you know, this may or may not be the time for 

-- at this specific location, but it's a bit of a fallacy to 

think that it's not happening until you make it illegal, or 

make it permitted and available. 

          That's all I have to say.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Mr. 

Barrett?     

          PATRICK BARRETT:  Thank you.  Patrick Barrett.  

You may know me from the previous hearing.  41 Pleasant 

Street.  I own a business and operate in Central Square.  I 

think that to just add some information to this argument, 

this site went through its medical licensing process.  It 

did have community meetings.   

          You know, I think that Keith Cooper has done 

outreach through the bid.  He's done, you know, he has been

an active member and trying to be a good citizen to some 

degree, even though, you know, he's an evil big marijuana 

guy. 

          But the bigger issue that I think is we've had 

four recreational marijuana stores come into Central Square.  

They're all going to get their community host agreements, 

and if people are worried about traffic and parking, I don't 

really think I've heard that argument really brought up too 

much in the other hearings so far. 

          Central Square is a congested area.  I think you 

guys remember this particular site used to be the 

Blockbuster site.  That's the last time there was an active 

use in this building, is when people used VHS cassettes and 

DVDs.  It's been a long time coming.  But the state regs are 

what the state regs are.  That's why they fought, that's why 

they sued.  I don't look at it as good or bad or ugly, it 

just is what it is. 

          So if you're going to deny their permit, do it 

based on the merits of their case.  If not, just understand, 

like, when they're talking about the traffic coming to 

Central Square, four stores, I've heard a potential fifth 

one, that's a problem with the zoning in terms of buffers 

150

between EE applicants and other groups, but I think the case 

needs to look on the merits in terms of what relief they're 

seeking, and not any other superfluous argument.  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Anyone 

else who wants to be heard on this matter tonight?  Yes, 

sir.   

          DAN TOTTEN:  Hi.  My name is Dan Totten.  I live 

at 54 Bishop Allen Drive.  The name is spelled D-a-n T-o-t-

t-e-n as in Nancy.  And so, living on Bishop Allen Drive, I 

obviously am right around the corner from this site.   

          And I just want to point out there's a lot of 

change happening in this neighborhood, and it's very 

unsettling just about everyday there's a new traffic 

pattern, there's a new street you can't go down, there's a 

new -- there's new parking that's taken away. 

          And I hope people will think about that context.  

Because what I'm seeing from the plan is not ideal, and if 

they're going to go first, I don't think this is the example 

that should be set. 

          So, you know, one thing I noticed is that they 

estimate that there's going to be around 260 vehicles coming 

in and out, and they estimate that at peak hours in the

evening, we might see 39 vehicles in an hour.  And their 

plan is basically, "Well, there's a parking lot in the 

back."  

          And their -- that parking lot is full all the 

time, all the time.  And the street parking around there is 

full all the time.  And I don't really understand what the 

plan is.  So I don't think that's sufficient.  I think they 

need to give more thought to that.   

          I'm not saying that it's ever going to be perfect.  

Obviously, this is going to generate, you know, more 

traffic, but I think more thought needs to be given to that. 

          I also think, you know, this idea that an app is 

going to make it so there isn't a line around the corner is, 

you know, I don't think that's been thought through.   I 

know that NETA and Brookline have an app, and they still 

have lines.  I -- you know I've been there, and I've seen 

the lines.   

          And if you think about NETA versus this space, 

NETA has the parking lot around the side where they can 

snake the line and it works, and doesn't disrupt anything.  

I'm thinking about, okay, if you have a line, is it going to 

down Norfolk Street, or is it going to go along Mass Ave?

Either way, it's going to be disruptive.   

          If it goes down Norfolk Street, it's going to 

maybe impact access for people who are trying to go down 

there.  I just don't think they thought about it.  And I 

hope that the Board will, you know, ask some questions about 

this to get more details. 

          Uber and LYFT, I know they say that, you know, 

they're going to request that Uber and LYFT drops off around 

the back, instead of around the front.  I'd like some more 

certainty there.  I don't think that's, you know, a given, 

as they seem to present it. 

          And then finally, I just want to say, you know, I 

did go to the community meeting about a year ago maybe, and 

I heard that that space in the front, I was actually very 

heartened to hear that to the hospital space in the front 

was going to have a community-oriented use.  That doesn't 

appear to have made it in here.   

          Somebody else said, "radio station."  I have a 

memory of that phrase, like, "We'll put a radio -- "I don't 

know what that meant, but I remember that phrase, and 

somebody else said it, and I was like, "That was said at 

that time community meeting."  So thank you.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Okay.  

Anyone else want to be heard on this matter?  I'm seeing no 

hands.  Okay.  All right.  Board members, then I turn back 

to you.  Are there questions, comments, additional 

information you need?  Who wants to kick us off?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Is Joe Barr still here?  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I do not see Mr. 

Barr.  No.  He has left?  Yeah.  He has -- he provided us 

with a memo on the traffic impact and recommended mitigation 

back in October.  We do have that.   

          And he provided an updated memorandum in November 

about the mitigation contributions, and how that -- how they 

have determined how much each applicant should be asked to 

pay towards traffic mitigation. 

          So Traffic and Parking has provided their opinion 

on what needs to be done to address the traffic concerns. 

But they are not present at the time.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Another question I have is for the 

findings we make, are they the same as we've been using by 

the other retail -- basically 11-1800?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Jeff, I believe 

that's correct.  Do you want to confirm that?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  It's the same zoning that was 

adopted over a year ago for all of the nonmedical cannabis 

establishments.  It's different from the findings that were 

made originally for the medical dispensary.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So my recollection is that we for 

several of the other retail stores that we've permitted, we 

required substantial queuing space --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- inside the premises, because 

basically any Central Square location doesn't have -- is on 

a busy sidewalk.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So why did we do that for these 

guys?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, when they were 

-- when they came in for their medical?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Well, I guess, I mean have we -- 

we've discussed this to some extent.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No, we didn't.  We 

stopped at --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  We stopped.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- we stopped at the

question of whether or not -- so we have not had that 

discussion.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  I guess my last set of 

question point is how do you think about the maximum number 

of people that are going to be there at any one time?  And I 

guess the plan I have shows 15 point of sale locations.   

          And I don't know how long it takes to purchase, 

but I'm not thinking it's horrendously lengthy.  They might 

have 10 transactions an hour.  They could probably do that.   

          So maybe the number that the facility is designed 

for is something like 150 transactions and hour, and 15 

people at any given time in the store.  And maybe an equal 

number on their way in and on their way out or something 

like that.   

          So I decided to walk to the Central Square Theater 

for the play a couple weeks ago.  And I walked -- it was on  

a Friday, which I don't usually go.  And Central Square is 

really hopping on a Friday night.   

          And I assume it's similar on Saturdays.  It's not 

anywhere near as busy on my normal Thursday night, but I 

would certainly be very skeptical of finding street or 

public parking.  You know, if 10 or 15 people are there, and 

156

maybe, so, like, 30 or 40 or 50 percent might be coming by 

car.   

          So it's maybe five or 10 people looking for a 

parking place, which somehow, I think isn't apt to be there.  

Not that many.  Some will be there.  I mean, I guess the 

public garage in the evening probably has vacancies.  Just 

trying to think into this about what are the actual issues, 

given that we don't have a lot of -- you know, we're giving 

our permit, which is only one of three permits that are 

needed, our permit is fairly narrowly drawn. 

          I think we've turned down one or maybe two 

applications where there was no credible parking.  There was 

one on Third Street.  I think it might have been a medical 

dispensary, and right now, so that the -- so I'm somewhat 

perplexed about this one.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I would like to remind us 

all that we have already improved two in Central Square, and 

we've dealt with the same issues of parking and queuing.  It 

is a transit-oriented location.  I mean, it's either this or 

Harvard Square.  We've got the subway right there.  And 

there are city lots in many areas around this.

22

          So I'm not saying that it isn't an issue that we 

have to think about and address.  You know, one of these 

facilities is going to be the first.  And when we have the 

first facility open, I presume there will be a line, and, 

you know, we need to deal with that.   

          But, you know, if there are indeed three in 

Central Square and one in Harvard Square, and I don't 

remember where the others are right at the moment that have 

been approved, and that there will be some in Somerville 

that I think the NETA situation is -- may exist when the 

first one opens. 

          But I think it's going to just disintegrate is not 

the right word -- I think it's going to lessen dramatically 

when the second and the third, and then the fourth all open. 

          So yes, I think we have to deal with that issue.  

But, you know, looking at the map, they are on the corner of 

Norfolk Street.   

          So it's conceivable.  We could say they have to 

queue.  If there's going to be queuing, it's preferable --  

I know Joe, when we talked about some of the others was -- 

you know, had concerns about queuing on Mass Ave, because of 

people waiting for buses and people moving back and forth.

And I assume this might be an issue on that side of -- the 

other side of the street too. 

          But then I think it can be addressed, you know, 

one way or the other.  And where we've sometimes insisted 

that they expand the waiting area, where we have insisted 

that they have -- you know, appointment only for a period of 

time. 

          So I think there are ways we can address this 

issue.  I mean, some of the other issues that I think were 

raised may be more appropriate for the City Council when it 

is dealing with the facilities going for a permit under the 

Permitting Ordinance, and perhaps also in the host 

agreement.  I think yes, we have to make -- determine 

whether we can make the findings under 1043 in Section 11. 

          But, you know, I think we're limited to that.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I guess I always have to preface 

my comments by stating that I'm skeptical about the wisdom 

of this law in general.  But after I make that comment each 

time, I also point out that this train has left the station.  

And that being the case, I really -- I have not heard any 

credible argument against this particular application.   

          We heard about certain employment issues.  I don't 

159

think that's within our area of responsibility.  We've heard 

about traffic issues.  We are in the middle of a 

transportation hub in the city with access to several bus 

lines, subway lines, there's access to Ubers.   

          If and to the extent that people wish to drive to 

this location, they may do it once, they probably won't do 

it a second time.  Certainly not if they have any other 

options, and even if they don't have options today, they 

will have other options tomorrow.  So I don't think that, 

you know, that's a credible argument about this particular 

establishment. 

          I don't remember -- perhaps my memory of this is 

imperfect -- I don't remember really perusing the interior 

plan with as much, you know, care as we have a certain 

other.   

          And I certainly do think that we should, you know, 

make sure that there's plenty of queuing space in the 

establishment to make sure that there are no lines that 

spill over into the street.  I think that's a relatively 

easy matter to address, but we have made a significant issue 

of this in other establishments, and I think we should try 

to be consistent in our approaches, and we should do so here 

160

as well. 

          I think somewhere in the background here, there's 

a difference between empowerment establishments and non-

empowerment establishments.  There's all sorts of 

interesting political considerations in the distinction 

between the two, but it really is not a consideration for 

us.  You know, our concerns and considerations should be the 

same, whether it be Economic Empowerment or not. 

          So at the end of the day, I think we do need to 

provide a little bit more scrutiny of the interior and 

queuing, and the appearance and the architecture and so 

forth, as we have for others. 

          But the issue is certainly of employment, but also 

of your parking and traffic.  It just does not seem to me to 

be a credible issue in this location.  

           And therefore, while we still have a little bit 

of review and work to do ultimately, I don't see any reason 

why we would not ultimately approve this application.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.: I hear the neighborhood's 

worries about the parking.  I think it will be important 

that you do an appointment-only, and the duration of time of 

161

the appointment only scheme works is really a key to this.  

Once there are some more of these shops open, it will 

relieve some of the pressure.   

          But it's indeterminate when those will be.  This 

could go for another year.  You could be there at open and 

the community has to suffer with the queuing.   

Also, the vestibule on the Mass Ave façade, we went from 

artwork to an open space to a -- and I think the last 

rendition of this was kind of a queuing area already.   

          And because you'll be doing both, you have to 

separate your customers at some point there, between the 

adult-use and the R&D.  So how's that queuing going to work, 

and is that what you intend on using that space for now?         

          KEITH COOPER:  Keith Cooper, CEO of Revolutionary 

Clinics.  We were asked by the Planning Board to create that 

space on the corner, which we thought was an excellent idea, 

to make it more of an open use area, that didn't have to go 

through security or adult-use and that's the way it's 

designed.   

          When you walk through the front door, if you go to 

the left, there's a security guard, there's access control 

and so forth which is necessary for what we do.  And on the

right is an open door into a retail space.   

          What we ended up doing throughout this whole 

process is trying to help somebody that as an Economic 

Empowerment candidate to utilize that space.  It can't be 

used for a regulated space.  

          So we have a one-year lease as an experiment, with 

a company called, "Kush Grooves" - Cambridge resident Marcus 

Johnson-Smith, who has a clothing line that he's developed.  

It's located in Dorchester right now.  It's a very nice 

shop, he runs a good business.  He's an excellent person.  

So he will be the tenant in there, and it will be clothing 

mainly for the general public. 

          And so, the queuing --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  They won't be using this for 

queuing space?         

          KEITH COOPER:  No, no.  So the queuing -- we have 

room inside, as you may recall, the scale of the building, 

for 65 people easily.  We could do twice that, but the 

capacity by way of the regulations are 65 people.  So 

there's quite a bit of space in there.  And we do plan on 

doing the appointment-only scheduling.   

          NETA does not have that, by the way.  They have 

163

online order and pickup, which is helpful and we will do 

that also.  We will not be doing delivery out of the space.  

That's part of the deal as well.  I noticed the concern 

about that.   

          So, you know, we're going to work with the city 

and the police and everybody that's in the community to make 

this a very welcoming space that compliments the community, 

as opposed to detracts from the community.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So you're open to the 

appointment and Internet pickups and so for this.  What kind 

of duration do you think you need?         

          KEITH COOPER:  To complete a transaction?  10 

minutes.  10 minutes.   

with this system.         

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  That you would need to go 

          KEITH COOPER:  Oh, for the appointment-only?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Is it a year, is it two?         

          KEITH COOPER:  I don't think that long.  Already 

if you look at the statistics in the state, those stores 

that we all famously read about in the headlines that were 

first opened and headlines down the street have basically 

cut their businesses in half since 33 stores have now

opened.  They're opening three or four every month now, not 

just around the city, but everywhere.  But more are coming, 

as you've seen in Boston. 

          So you know, for business it's not great to have 

declining demand, but for demand management, it certainly 

is.  I'm going to guess it's 6 months, and we certainly 

willing to commit to that and then come back and chat with 

you guys, if that's most appropriate.  But it's worked very 

well for those that have implemented it.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Well, it's the queuing.  You 

know, we did hold the other applicants' feet to the fire 

relative to design modifications to, especially, you know, 

in the old Harvest Food Mart space.   

          And there were design modifications made to the 

interior to allow for the maximum amount of queuing.  So it 

would not occur on Mass Ave or on the side street at that 

site.  The store was permitted as a medical marijuana store, 

and downtime a different intensity of use. 

          And so, design modifications, that's got to smart, 

because you've just fitted the place out.  But if there's 

some way in which we could figure out how queuing could 

happen and be accommodated on the inside, how the 65 people

fit in there or more.   

          As you suggested, how do they safely ingress and 

egress without causing a nuisance or hazard?   That's a 

discussion that I think we -- I -- this Board would have to 

get into in order to make a finding favorable for the 

special permit. 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So do you have some -

- I think we're looking for a demonstration that the kind of 

queuing that will be necessary at this location, especially 

with -- even with appointment-only, can be accommodated in 

the spaces currently designed or used?         

          KEITH COOPER:  Just one comment, before you do 

that, because there were some statistics cited by one of the 

presenters.  NETA may do $5 million dollars a month, I don't 

think so.   I know them quite well.  But the actual number 

of visits, if you look at our store, which has planned to do 

about half of that, it would be about 500 people a day.   

          That's -- we have $130 average transaction.  We 

have all the statistics for both the existing adult-use 

stores, as well as existing medical stores that we run.   

          So the 3,000 something visits per day is off by a 

factor, and should allay the concern to a large degree,

along with the appointment-only scheduling. 

          The diagram above -- and we do have our architect 

here, Willy -- shows the 15 POS terminals that are the red 

dots behind the counters.  And those blue footprints are 

meant to be people that are in the que.   

          Whether it will happen exactly like this or not, 

the point is that there's a lot of space in there, and it 

really -- with 10 minutes per transaction on average, some 

are faster, some do online order and pickup, some will be 

new people that want to discuss products and services, that 

could take longer.   

          But there's quite a bit of space in there for 

people to mull about.  There's display cases -- those are 

the triangles, or the rectangles in the middle that have 

samples of the marked products and so forth. 

          So for what we do for a living, and the number of 

people that we are looking to entertain, even on the busiest 

days, it's actually quite a perfect size for that.  And with 

the appointment-only scheduling and the queless app, which 

actually works very, very well for multiple applications -- 

this isn't a new thing, this is isn't like the Iowa caucus, 

this is, they have hundreds and hundreds of big clients who

do not want queuing, and it works very, very well.    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Excuse me, yeah.  So this was 

originally permitted for medical.  And now we're talking 

about recreational.  Are you providing both services?  And 

are they somehow segregated, or internal stimuli the same 

queues and lines and what have you.  How do these two uses 

work and integrate?         

          KEITH COOPER:  Yeah, good question.  We've 

committed to do both.  We don't have to do both.  

Recreational only stores can serve medical patients.  They 

can't use their card to avoid taxes, but medical patients 

can go in recreational stores like anybody that's 21+ can. 

          We have committed to be both medical and 

recreational here at this location.  And there will be two 

different queues for medical versus adult-use, and there's a 

regulation and a commitment to have a certain percentage of 

product set aside for the medical patients.  So that 

recreational demand doesn't outstrip the need for the 

medicine. 

          And that's pretty tightly regulated.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  But it is the same space?         

          KEITH COOPER:  Same space.  The counters on the

left or the top, as you're viewing it now, will be for 

adult-use, and the ones on the bottom to the right will be 

for medical.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I see.         

          KEITH COOPER:  And generally it's about a 3X 

volume difference, is what the experience has been at other 

places, depending on where they're located.         

          THE REPORTER:  [ Prompting people to use the 

microphone, side conversations ]        

          MELISSA WORTH:  We had a rendering of -- a 3D 

rendering, it looks like a photo --        

          KEITH COOPER:  Oh. 

          MELISSA WORTH:  -- a realistic rendering.  There 

we go.         

          KEITH COOPER:  I don't know if that helps very 

many.  Thank you, though, Willy.      

          MELISSA WORTH:  Melissa Worth, W-o-r-t-h, Project 

Architect.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I agree with my 

fellow Board members that this is really the important 

issue, because as much as this does also abut Norfolk 

Street, so you wouldn't have to have queuing on Mass Ave, 

169

Norfolk Street.  The sidewalk is very narrow. So I think we 

do want to equally make sure that we're containing queuing 

within the building. 

          I also think, though, that this is probably one of 

the more spacious ones we've seen, in terms of there is 

actually places to put up stations here.  And that, with the 

commitment to appointment-only as its needed, and the -- I 

assume that at this point, you're in concurrence with 

Traffic and Parking's memos and recommendations?     

          COLLECTIVE:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Which involves a 

thorough logistics plan, and coordination with them and with 

the lease on these things.  I will say in my experience with 

Uber and LYFT for when places request to have essentially 

their address blocked out, because the local traffic and 

parking do not want them dropping off there, it's a doable 

thing.   

          So you can -- I have been to many an event where I 

could not get dropped off at the event, but I could get 

dropped off in the designated drop-off zone.   

          So I am confident that's a thing, and that Traffic 

and Parking and that the police and you will work together

on the logistics plan that will put just as we have asked 

the other applicants in Central Square to do, to put those 

same kinds of plans and restrictions together.      

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  And just as to that point, we 

spent an awful lot of time with Adam Shulman in Traffic and 

Parking discussing this --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.      

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  -- and discussing geofencing 

and drop-off locations --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Exactly.       

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  -- and municipal Lot #5.  Also 

developing and implementing a press and public relations 

starting about an initial opening, instructing people that 

they're not to take automobiles.  There will be no available 

parking.  They should use public transportation, advertising 

that through whatever media sources that are available to 

use, and really trying to change behavior. 

          And frankly, I think that the impact will be just 

as one of the Board members mentioned, if somebody drives 

there once, they won't want to drive there a second time, 

which is important for two reasons.  One, it's important to 

be a good neighbor in the City of Cambridge, but it's also 

171

good business.   

          Because the experience is in some of these other 

places, like, out in the western part of the state, when 

customers had a difficult time going to the location, they 

didn't return, they don't capture that customer.  So it just 

makes good business sense for everyone.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  So having 

kind of refreshed our memories on the drawings and the 

queuing, how are Board members feeling about that at this 

point?  Do we need more information?  Is there anything 

additional that we need to see?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yeah.  I was concerned about the 

queuing, but actually seeing the plans once again, there 

seems to be plenty of queuing space way within the space.  

I'm being reminded how large and spacious it is, and how it 

can accommodate it.  So no, I don't feel the need for more 

study and information on that point.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have related question, if you 

could flip back to the plan.  That's good.  So right above 

the scale, there's an exit door that goes out on Norfolk 

Street.  Is that useable as a means of egress?

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Right, as -- it is useable in an 

172

emergency?         

          KEITH COOPER:  Yes, sir.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  Because there will be -- if 

you design a queue for 65 people and you've got 25 

employees, then you've got more than 50 people who need two 

means of egress.  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Go ahead.         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I mean, I think it would be good to 

have in the file a plan that shows how you could do the 

queuing.  You know, I've had a stab at it, I'm quite 

convinced it's doable.  So I think we could condition that 

approval that such a plan be furnished and reviewed by the 

staff.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I think -- because one other 

thing is that -- there was some question as to if there are 

problems, who deals with them.  I think the answer is if 

there are transportation problems, and queuing is one of 

those, you deal with the traffic and Transportation 

Department --

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- who have charged you a 

significant fee to mean that they can be responsive to 

whatever issues come up.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And so that you don't come back to 

us, which as you can tell, can take months.  But -- so 

that’s --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That should be clear in our 

description that that's how the process works.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, as the 

applicant has also noted, that they have agreed to the 

recommendations of the Traffic and Parking memos.  I mean, 

Traffic and Parking recommends that the applicant work with 

the department, as well as with the Cambridge Police 

Department on an operations plan that has to be approved by 

the city prior to issuance.   

          It has to detail how to manage traffic, parking, 

sidewalk crowding, in a way that maintains safety and access 

to all adjacent buildings, transit and other key uses, and 

that they have to be -- continue to work with Traffic and 

174

Parking and police on the plan throughout the initial 

opening period to identify and respond to any unexpected 

situations -- again, including traffic, parking, transit and 

bicycling accommodations -- any safety issues.   

          So that is absolutely contemplated in what they 

have recommended, and I presume why they -- the fact that 

they're not here tonight, and the applicant has verbally 

acknowledged that they have agreed to the recommendations, 

to me says that they're confident they're going to work with 

them, to make sure that these things do not become an issue. 

          All right, yes, Ted?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Could we see a rendering of the 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I'm sure we can.        

          KEITH COOPER:  Is that what you're looking for, 

façade?    

Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, is there anything that 

gives me a greater understanding of what it will look like 

as I'm walking by the windows?         

          KEITH COOPER:  So on the right-hand side is a 

wellness facility.  That corner is, again for a year is a 

retail store with clothing.

not ours.  We have leased it to, or sublet it to a company 

called, "Kush Groove."     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  And can I assume that beyond the 

year it's going to remain as a retail facility?         

          KEITH COOPER:  Yes, we -- I mean, it's part of our

going to be something that does not have to be secured, it's

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And what will one see from the 

outside on the left-hand side?         

          KEITH COOPER:  We have that currently constructed.  

It's sort of a shadow box a little bit, with paintings that 

we contracted with the Cambridge Arts Council for, and they 

rotate those I think quarterly.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Is that going to be the entire 

height of the windows, or --

          KEITH COOPER:  We accounted for seven-foot-people, 

but it's probably eight feet high, really, and then you can 

see into the store after that.  So we didn't want it all 

blocked off.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And behind that would be the 

          KEITH COOPER:  Correct.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Ted, I've been looking at 

storefronts in Central Square, and also, in Harvard Square, 

but more in Central Square.  And, you know, this will be 

somewhere in the large middle of kind of interesting but not 

fabulous.   

          And that's kind of the norm, and it seems to work 

okay.  I think that, you know, so there's a lot worse 

storefronts in Central Square, and a lot less interesting.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  What I've been looking at in 

storefronts, and hopefully is all the smoke shops that have 

opened, which have no restrictions on what you can see --

that anybody can walk by and look at.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  But the state won't 

let them do that, so.

understand.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  For better or for 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  But, you know, that 

also in my mind goes to a lot of the issues about kids 

walking by and what --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Absolutely.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- they're going to be seeing 

inside, because they're going to peer in most of the others, 

they're not going to be able to see inside, whereas they can 

walk by and look into liquor stores, and look into smoke 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- any other store they want 

shops and --

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Worse for their health, they can 

look into ice cream stores.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So are 

there other questions for the applicants, other things we 

need to see, or do Board members feel we can make the 

necessary findings on this, subject to compliance with the 

staff -- the recommendations in the staff memos, and the -- 

a more detailed interior queuing plan to be submitted to 

staff?  Anything else folks think we need?  Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'll just note, this is something I 

don't know that we made very clear in the memo.  This is -- 

it's a new special permit to add sort of adding to an old 

special permit, and the conversation about the storefront 

reminded me that that is a condition of the previous special 

permit, and it might be advisable to make it clear that 

those --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Make that clear.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- those conditions from that and 

any other conditions that applied previously, which carried 

forward, except for they're modified by the new 

recommendations.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  And that's 

179

acceptable.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Should our record include the memo 

that we received from City Solicitor, saying that we can 

grant this permit?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So, I mean, --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Or how we can act on it?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, I think clearly 

it is part of the record.  We can include it specifically in 

our findings, that based on the memo from the City 

Solicitor, we can.  Because that particular distance buffer 

cannot be applied to this applicant, we don't need to make 

that finding, that particular finding.   

          Yeah, because you're right.  One of the findings 

we would normally make is that it's not within 1800 feet of 

another cannabis retail store, and the City Solicitor has 

opined that that particular criteria cannot be applied to 

this applicant 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Based on state law?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Based on state law.  

So yeah.  So I will briefly go through the findings and just 

confirm that we're all good on those, since we know that one 

doesn't apply.  It's located in one of the qualifying

districts, which we've confirmed, located in a permanent 

building.   

          Not within 300 feet of an existing public or 

private K-12 school, or other related facility or if it is, 

that it is sufficiently buffered such that users of the 

facility will not be adversely impacted.   

          I think given the location and other facilities 

we've similarly found would not be -- are either not within 

that distance, or are not adversely impacted if they are 

just over that line, that we can make that finding here. 

          No package or repackaging of cannabis products 

will occur on site, which has been -- the applicant has 

affirmed.  Site design provides convenient, safe and secure 

access and egress for clients and employees arriving on all 

modes of transportation, and we've had a lot of discussions 

about how both employees and customers will arrive at this 

site that has good transit and public bicycle and pedestrian 

access. 

          Like, all businesses in Central Square, drivers 

may find it challenging.  But the working with Traffic and 

Parking and the Police Department to ensure that all access 

is safe and does not impose an undue burden on the public 

possible under state law you can have a lively façade.             

181

facilities, including sidewalks and bus stops in the area.  

That criteria can be met. 

          The location and design of these will not detract 

from the sense of activity, with opaque, unwelcoming façade 

at ground level and retail areas.   

          We have both the one retail corner, which will be 

an active use, and we have talked about how using our -- 

through the -- obtained through the Cambridge Arts Council 

to enliven the other windows such that to the extent 

          HUGH RUSSELL:  We should probably note that 

there's a blind section on Norfolk Street that has been 

there for decades, possibly, since the construction of the 

building, and that's not an issue for us.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's correct.  

Yeah.  Okay.  That façade is unchanged by this use.  

Loading, refuse and service areas are designed to be secure 

and shielded from abutting uses.  We have discussed that at 

length with you both in your original medical permitting and 

gone over the designs here. 

          The building and site are designed to be 

compatible with other buildings in the area and to mitigate

any negative aesthetic impacts that might result from 

required security measures and restrictions on visibility 

into the building's interior.  Again, I think we've covered 

that.   

          And the facility will provide programs to assist 

qualifying patients in obtaining services under the medical 

-- Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program, which 

you've indicated this will fully serve both, which is great. 

          So I think if the Board is -- oh, Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Just a quick thing I 

remembered.  Are we still talking murals on the rear and the 

side of the building?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  That was part of the first 

decision.  Yeah, we have -- you can still do that.         

          KEITH COOPER:  I'm sorry, I didn't hear you, Hugh.         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So in the first decision, I asked 

you to get murals created on the parking lot side.  And you 

said you were -- you'd committed to doing that.         

          KEITH COOPER:  Yeah, there's a mural on this side, 

on Norfolk on the back.  There's another space right now 

which we repainted, and have our sign up there.  We're 

talking with the Central Square bid about the mural that

would go there.  I think it's a great idea.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Just wondered.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  And I think, 

again, it's worth reiterating that these findings are based 

on compliance with the recommendations of the staff memos, 

the additional queuing and review by staff, and as Jeff 

noted, any conditions on the original permit, which do not 

conflict with anything that we have discussed here tonight 

would be carried over.  All right. 

          Based on those findings, does someone want to make 

a motion that we grant the special permit?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor?      

          [ All vote YES ]    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  And that's unanimous.  

Thank you very much.     

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you very much.         

          KEITH COOPER:  There's one more I think matter on 

this case, which is that the filing deadline is coming up 

February 28.  So I think we would ask for an agreement to

extend to March 28.  That usually takes us maybe four weeks 

or so to get the decision drafted --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Decision in order.         

          KEITH COOPER:  -- and reviewed and filed, so.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is that acceptable to 

the applicant?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So a vote 

to extend the filing deadline to March 28?  Okay.  A move by 

Lou, seconded by Steve.   All those in favor?                

          [ All vote YES ]    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's unanimous.

cases next.   

the microphone.    

agenda, which  --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So the next item of business on the 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do you want to do the 

special permit extension for 51 New Street first?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yes.  I thought I had it right in 

front of me, and it disappeared, the agenda.  But yeah, the 

Board has received a request for an extension on the case at 

51 New Street.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  What's the date?  The extension is 

June 10, 2020.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So that's -- 

remind me procedurally, this is one where we have opened the 

hearing, but not voted on a decision, correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  So this case, it was 

originally continued, without a presentation.

and a discussion around a number of issues.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  This is the one with 

the funky parking? Yeah, okay.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  There were a lot of questions about 

how the parking was going to handled there on New Street, 

and it -- it seems that it's going to take some time to 

figure those out.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  And so, they 

have requested an extension of the filing deadline to June 

10 of this year.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor?     

          [ All vote YES ]      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  It's unanimous.  All

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Do you want me to do this one too?  

So this one --   

awesome, thank you.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That would be 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- this one's a little bit --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- unusual compared to -- so this 

is a case, it's 315 Columbia Street.  I think we have the 

applicants; they've been very patiently waiting for us to 

go.  So this is one of the unusual cases where every once in 

a while, there's a question about repetitive petitions. 

          And that relates to -- man, I don't know what's 

happening today.  I have things in front of me, and they 

just disappear immediately.  I'm just pulling up the zoning 

ordinance so I can make reference to this more precisely. 

          So when there is an application to the -- either 

the Planning Board or the Board of Zoning Appeal which is 

denied, if there is another application on a -- for a 

similar type of matter, it normally -- you know, you can't 

make the same application for two years after the 

unfavorable action.   

          But there's a provision in the zoning ordinance 

188

1

2

3

4

7

8

11

12

13

14

15

16

18

21

22

that if there is such a petition, that first the permit 

granting authority would have to vote to make a finding that 

there are material changes in the conditions upon which the 

previous unfavorable action was based, and described such 

changes in the record with the proceedings.   

          And then after that, if all but one of the 

Planning Board members consents there too, so essentially 

what that means is -- and so this is a case where the Board 

of Zoning Appeal is hearing an application in which they had 

a previous meeting, and we provided the transcript of that 

meeting, that indicates that the Board of Zoning Appeal 

found that there were material enough changes to meet this 

condition in the zoning ordinance, and now it goes to the 

Planning Board, and the Planning Board has to consent to 

what the BZA determined in this case. 

          So the applicants are here if there's any 

questions that need to be answered, but that’s what the 

Planning Board needs to do.  And in addition to that, just 

as part of general Board of Zoning Appeal case review, if 

there's a recommendation or comment that the Planning Board 

want to make on the case, you could do that as well.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So

11

12

13

15

16

18

21

22

essentially for this, for the BZA to act on this matter, 

this Board has to consent, and essentially agree that the 

changes have been adequately material to -- such that this 

is not a repetitive petition. 

          At the same time, if we -- we can both agree with 

that, and also have comments on the design, or make another 

recommendation on whatever we think the BZA should do.  But 

we have to at least make a decision on whether or not we're 

consenting.  Did I get that right?  Yay. 

          After 11:00, all bets are off.  I need to confirm 

all of this.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I actually read the transcript, 

and I can affirm that the Board of Zoning Appeal spent a lot 

of time considering this.  And I think we can defer safely 

to their judgment.             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I think they 

outlined a great number -- well, not a great number, but an 

adequate number of changes to make the finding that there 

are material changes here that make this not a repetitive 

petition.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I wasn't clear whether they had

actually voted it down, or it had just been tabled without 

any action, which qualifies as a negative action, I guess.  

But --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Right.  I think that's the case.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- I was just not clear on what 

they did.  Yeah, after reading the transcript.  Yeah, but I 

--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- I'm fine with --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So let's 

get that part on the record for -- do I have a motion to 

consent to this moving forward, and as a not repetitive 

petition?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All those in favor?      

          [ All vote YES ]    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep, that's 

unanimous.  Okay.  Now, does the Board want to make a 

recommendation on anything pertaining to the request of the 

BZA on this matter?  We don't have to.  But this is our 

opportunity to, if we are going to.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It's a contextual design, you know?

So I don't think we have any need to comment on it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I tend to agree.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Am I -- is my understanding 

correct, that it was really about creating a parking spot?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Cutting a notch.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Cutting a notch in the building 

to create a parking spot.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And adding a story and redoing the 

whole building.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think it's super squeaky and 

nice.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  I'm 

hearing that no one feels strongly about sending a 

recommendation on this to the BZA, and that we're 

comfortable just having consented to it.  All right.  Thank 

you for your patience, and for being here in case we had 

          Jeff, is there anything else we need to do 

tonight?  Swaathi?  All right.  We're adjourned.  Thank you 

questions.   

all.
