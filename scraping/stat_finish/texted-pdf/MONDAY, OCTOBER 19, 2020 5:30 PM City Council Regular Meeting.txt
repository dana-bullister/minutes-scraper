To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
The City Council has requested that the City explore the feasibility of opening the Golf Course for 
general recreational use for one day or one evening during the week. During the golf season, the golf 
course is heavily used by both adults and young people for playing golf. With the restrictions for COVID-
19 health and safety, there has been a significant limitation on the number of golfers each day and closing 
down for a day or evening would further limit play. During the golf season, allowing users besides golfers 
on the course would cause several problems. First, it would further reduce the time that golfer would be 
able to play. Second, because it is possible to access the golf course not just through the main path from 
the clubhouse, walkers, runners and dog walkers may be entering the golf course while play is happening 
putting themselves at risk because they are not certain which day or evening the course is open to them. 
There have been times when families or individuals have wandered onto the course because of the 
attraction as they walk around fresh pond. Third, the course is certified as an Audubon Cooperative 
Sanctuary using environmental practices that support water conservation, quality and wildlife habitat 
management. This requires that the golf course staff remain particularly vigilant during the playing season 
to maintain the course. 
 
In West Cambridge, there are other alternatives for walkers and runners because of the proximity of 
Danehy Park. Once the Golf Course closes for the season which will happen depending on the weather 
sometime in December, walkers, runners and cross country skiers are all welcome on the course. While 
that use can cause minor damage to the course, the staff are able to manage and maintain the course and 
close off limited areas only when the greens or bunkers are getting damaged.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am herby requesting an appropriation of $175,000, from Free Cash, to the Public Investment Public 
Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to launch a COVID-19 sewer testing program.    
 
The COVID-19 sewer testing effort has been discussed and supported by the City’s COVID-19 Expert 
Advisory Panel.  The program will use a sampling and data analysis platform derived from direct samples 
taken from the sewer at specific locations within the Cambridge sewer system that represent defined 
catchment areas.  
 
This sampling program work will allow the City to obtain Cambridge-specific data in order to 
disambiguate from the regional sample and assisting the City and School Department in making data-
driven decisions that are supported by well-understood metrics indicating “real-time” viral prevalence in 
all users of the sewer system in our City. 
 
This appropriation also responds to Policy Order #9 of September 14, 2020.

Date:  October 19, 2020   

Re:   Awaiting Report 20-21 dated March 2, 2020 regarding developing 

a Vacant Storefront Registry and involving Cambridge’s small 
business community throughout the process.  

In response to the above-mentioned policy order, we report the following.  
The City’s Retail Strategic Plan was completed in June 2017, and most of 
its recommendations to help Cambridge’s small businesses were 
implemented in Fiscal Years 2018, 2019 and 2020. One such 
recommendation was to document storefront vacancies best practices 
which was done in the Storefront Vacancy Best Practices report, 
completed in 2018.  This report was presented at the September 12, 2018 
Economic Development & University Relations Committee meeting and 
describes a variety of reasons for Cambridge’s ground floor storefront 
vacancies.  Since then, the Community Development Department (CDD) 
staff have developed a variety of programs related to ground floor vacant 
storefronts including:  
 
o  Created a Vacant Storefront Initiative webpage that includes: 
o  Storefront Activation Resources including links to pop-

up/activation/placemaking specialists like No Longer Empty, 
CultureHouse, Spaceus, and the Cambridge Arts Council.  

o  Vacant Storefront Database, a data set updated quarterly beginning 
in July 2018. Information includes owner or leasing company, 
former tenant (if known), square footage, length of vacancy (if 
known), and ownership structure.  

o  Vacant Storefront Creative Design Contest, launched in January 
2019 to provide property owners with original artwork to display 
in their vacant storefront. 

o  Undertook a variety of connected projects and provided access to 

information concerning the projects on the CDD webpage under the 
Economic Development Division:  
o  Prepared District Assessments Reports, which highlight 

opportunities in the City’s commercial areas.  The District 
Assessment for Central Square was completed in 2018, for Inman 
Square in 2019, and for Porter Square-Lower Massachusetts Ave. 
in February 2020.  The next business and customer intercept 
surveys will be completed for East Cambridge in 2021.  
o  Provided a range of resources on CDD’s Small Businesses 

Resources web page, including links to the Greater Boston Legal

Services and Harvard Transactional Law Clinics, which may be 
available to provide assistance to small business owners. 

o  On September 30, 2020, the Community Development Department 
presented to the Economic Development & University Relations 
Committee its final recommendations on updating the commercial 
land use classification system within the Cambridge Zoning 
Ordinance and received a favorable recommendation from the 
Committee.  

In 2020, CDD also completed a study identifying action steps to 
streamline permitting and licensing processes for new businesses and 
create journey maps of ISD and Licensing processes to make them 
more transparent to small businesses.  

Due to the COVID pandemic, CDD staff developed a variety of new 
programs and workshops to assist small businesses through the crisis to 
prevent or mitigate additional vacancies.  This includes:  

o  Awarding $3.6 million in grants and loans to support small 

businesses through a partnership between the City of Cambridge 
and Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.  

o  Developing additional workshops for COVID-impacted small 

businesses.  

o  Managing the City Manager’s Small Business Advisory 

Committee.  The Advisory Committee is providing expert advice 
and has developed best practices, recommendations, and guidance 
on how to safely reopen businesses.  These recommendations have 
included the Pick It Up Local Campaign and the Project Neighbor 
Campaign, both instituted in the summer of 2020.   

o  The City also recently developed and issued a survey to small 
businesses to determine their needs to support fall/winter 
operations during the pandemic.   

 
All of this is in addition, to outreach CDD staff performed in the summer 
of 2019.  This outreach included reaching out to property and businesses 
owners, as well as business association leadership to gather feedback on 
potential vacant storefront policies. This included outreach to East 
Cambridge Business Association, Harvard Square Business Association, 
Cambridge Local First, All-Business Associations Meeting, as well as 
including a feature on vacant storefronts in the August 2019 Economic 
Development E-Newsletter, and meeting with several private property 
owners. 
 
The overall findings were a general agreement that something should be 
done about ground floor vacant storefronts, that business owners are 
concerned about safety, sanitation, and general upkeep of properties, and

that there are concerns from both property and business owners over 
possible fees and fines that could be implemented if a vacant storefront 
registry was established. The pandemic has exacerbated concerns over 
vacancies and necessitates the continuation of programs currently in place.  
 
Due to these concerns, and a wide variety of reasons for vacancies, as 
described in the Vacant Storefront Best Practices report, staff recommends 
creation of a Vacant Storefront City Policy supported by the City Manager 
that would apply to ground floor vacant storefronts within the City of 
Cambridge. This would apply to both ground floor storefronts that do not 
have a current lease with a tenant for at least thirty (30) consecutive days 
and ground floor storefronts that have been leased but are under 
construction, or otherwise unoccupied.   
 
Staff additionally recommends the policy contain best practices that a 
property owner should follow. For ground floor vacant storefronts without 
a lease, or that have otherwise been vacant, the property owner shall:  
 
•  Put up paper for purposes of covering storefront window(s) that face a 

public way so that entire window(s) is covered, and post leasing contact 
information in the storefront window(s) that is visible to a prospective 
tenant; and/or 

•  Put up art work for purposes of covering storefront window(s) that face a 

public way so that the entire window(s) is covered and post leasing contact 
information in the storefront window(s) that is visible to a prospective 
tenant 

 
For ground floor storefronts with a lease, but undergoing renovations, the 
property owner shall: 
 
•  Place a “coming soon” sign with information about the new tenant in 

accordance with the City’s Sign Ordinance, Article 7.000 of the 
Cambridge Zoning Ordinance.  

 
In addition, all ground floor vacant storefronts, regardless of lease status 
need to comply with additional regulatory requirements per the Cambridge 
Municipal Code, the Building Code and all other applicable federal, state 
and local laws, rules and regulations (e.g. snow removal, trash, etc.). This 
includes:  

 

1.  Cambridge Municipal Code Chapter 12.16. Section 12.16.110 – 

Sidewalks – Requires snow and ice removal;

CITY OF CAMBRIDGE 
VACANT STOREFRONT POLICY 

Scope 

Overview 

 
I. 
 
The City of Cambridge’s (“City”) is fortunate to have a robust local economy that extends to its 
retail, personal services, and restaurant sectors. However, even temporary storefront vacancies 
through normal turnover can have a negative impact on the perception of a commercial corridor’s 
vitality and quality of the consumer shopping experience. The purpose of this Vacant Storefront 
Policy (“Policy”) is to preserve street level activity, protect property values, maintain 
neighborhood integrity and accessibility, safeguard against economic property blight, and ensure 
the safe and sanitary maintenance of ground floor vacant properties. 
 
II. 
 
This Policy applies to ground floor vacant storefronts within the City where the property owner 
has not had a lease with a tenant for at least thirty (30) consecutive days, or the ground floor 
storefronts have otherwise been vacant for a period of at least thirty (30) consecutive days.  This 
Policy also applies to ground floor storefronts that have been vacant for at least thirty (30) 
consecutive days where the property owner has executed a lease with a tenant but the property is 
undergoing renovations to accommodate the tenant’s use of the property.   
 
III.  Requirements 
 
After thirty (30) consecutive days of vacancy, the property owner shall do the following: 
 

A.  If the space is not leased and remains vacant, or is otherwise vacant but not undergoing 

renovations, the property owner must do one or both of the following: 

1.  Put up paper for purposes of covering storefront window(s) that face a public way so 
that the entire window(s) is covered, and post leasing contact information in the 
storefront window(s) so that it is visible to a prospective tenant; 

2.  Put up art work for purposes of covering storefront window(s) that face a public way 

so that no less than ten percent (10%) of the storefront window(s) is covered, and post 
leasing contact information in the storefront window(s) so that it is visible to a 
prospective tenant. 

B.  If the ground floor space is leased, but undergoing renovations, the property owner shall:

The information below is provided in response to Awaiting Report 20-5, dated 
January 27, 2020, related to implementing traffic calming measures on Upton 
Street to support safety, as is consistent with the City’s ongoing commitment to 
Vision Zero and safe street initiatives throughout Cambridge.  
 
City staff have been in communication with administrators at the Amigos school 
regarding issues related to pedestrian and traffic safety, as well as pick up/drop off 
on Upton Street. In response to these discussions, staff have reviewed the 
neighborhood context, and specifically street operations, evaluate traffic 
movement related to this currently two-way street from Magazine to Pleasant, and 
plan on installing a push button-activated Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacon (RRFB) at 
the existing crosswalk on Magazine and Upton Street (see example in Exhibit-A). 
The RRFB is a traffic control device intended to alert motorists traveling on 
Magazine Street when a pedestrian wishes to cross at the crosswalk. 
 
Staff are also evaluating other street operation strategies including the 
implementation of a one-way traffic operation for Upton Street during school drop 
off and pick up hours, from Magazine Street to Pleasant Street, which is currently 
the direction school buses travel on Upton Street. The timing of implementing this 
change would need to be carefully coordinated with the school, particularly given 
the uncertainty in school operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
Staff are planning further discussion and coordination with Amigos School staff 
regarding these measures and their implementation schedule; and will continue 
the discussion and review of potential additional measures and/or signage needs in 
order to address the safety concerns on Upton Street. Staff will also recommend 
that School administrators reach out and inform the residents of Upton Street and 
the school community about the traffic calming measures to improve street safety.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $5,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for the City’s third annual 
contribution to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line Extension 
(GLX) project. This payment will bring the City’s total contribution to this critical project to $15 
million of the total of $25 million that we agreed to contribute, half of which will be provided 
through our partnership with DivcoWest relative to the Cambridge Crossing development. Two 
additional $5 million contributions will be due in the fall of 2021 and the fall of 2022, at which 
point we will have satisfied our funding commitment to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
 
As documented in the previous appropriation letters from January 2018 and October 2019, the 
GLX project has significant benefits to the City of Cambridge: 
 

•  Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the recently demolished facility, 

which was obsolete, in poor condition, and not fully accessible for those with disabilities. 

•  Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and Medford that 
are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. The GLX will serve trips 
from these locations into the key employment centers located in eastern Cambridge, as 
well as trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge. This will help to reduce the number 
of cars driving to and through Cambridge, helping us meet our transportation and 
environmental objectives. 

•  Assisting in meeting the City’s and the region’s mobility, sustainability, and economic 

development goals. 
 

According to the GLX program management team, the project is advancing on schedule and on 
budget and is on track to be completed within the overall project budget of $2.3 billion. The 
project recently passed the 50% completion milestone and service to the general public is 
currently slated to begin by the end of 2021. COVID-19 has exacerbated the already tight 

1.8

 

 

Packet Pg. 51

1.8

construction schedule, and the GLX team is particularly focused on determining the impacts of 
critical supply chain challenges and developing mitigation strategies where possible. 
 
As documented in the photos attached, the GLX project has made significant progress on 
construction: 

•  The project is well along in construction of the new Lechmere Station and the 

replacement of the viaduct adjacent to Cambridge Crossing/North Point. The existing 
viaduct-including the connection across Monsignor O’Brien Highway-was demolished 
earlier this year and placement of steel beams for the new viaduct is largely complete, as 
shown in Photograph 1. As part of this work, a “bus bridge” is in place to move riders 
between Lechmere and North Station, including dedicated bus lanes on Monsignor 
O’Brien Highway to minimize the delays for passengers using the buses. 

•  Construction is also well underway at the other six new Green Line stations in Somerville 

and Medford. 

•  The extension of the viaduct to connect to the two branches in Somerville and Medford is 

also making significant progress, as shown in Photograph 2. 

•  The Community Path connection from Somerville into Cambridge Crossing/North Point 
is being built as part of the GLX project, including the bridge that brings the Community 
Path across the GLX alignment near the Cambridge/Somerville border, as shown in 
Photograph 3. 

•  23 of the 24 new Type 9 Green Line trains have been delivered. These additional train 

sets are necessary to extend rail service along the GLX. 

•  Construction is progressing on the Vehicle Maintenance Building where trains will be 

stored and serviced, as shown in Photograph 4. 
 

Of the project’s overall $2.3 billion budget, approximately $1.3 billion has been expended, and 
the project is employing the equivalent of 800 people across Cambridge, Somerville, and 
Medford. 
 
City staff continue to be heavily involved in reviewing and commenting on the design of the 
improvements within Cambridge, as well as the impacts on City streets and utilities. The project 
has hosted 32 consecutive monthly Community Working Group meetings since late 2017, which 
are attended by representatives from Cambridge, as well as from Somerville and Medford. In 
addition, staff continue to review designs and construction documents, assess utility impacts, 
coordinate with nearby construction projects, and assist in publicizing upcoming construction 
work and the resulting impacts. 
 
Based on the progress to date, the project continues to meet the requirements laid out in the 
Project Participation Agreement (PPA) between the City of Cambridge, the MBTA, and the 
Massachusetts Department of Transportation. As a result, I remain confident that the funds being 
contributed to the GLX project are being spent responsibly and for the purposes laid out in the 
PPA, and I am pleased to request this appropriation to continue our partnership with the state and 
the MBTA.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-49, regarding a report on the feasibility of 
closing several blocks of streets in Harvard Square to vehicular traffic, with the exception of 
deliveries, Traffic, Parking & Transportation Director Joseph Barr reports the following:  
 
Overall, the City is supportive of implementing street closures on weekends and possibly 
weeknights when they help support the vitality of local businesses and the Harvard Square 
neighborhood. In any such effort, we need to be sensitive to the specific needs of these groups 
and ensure that any changes recognize and respond to their operations.  Implementation of any 
street closures would need to be done in a manner that increases the attractiveness of the area. 
This typically requires programming and activation to attract positive activity and prevent the 
area from looking empty or inactive.  
 
It is worth keeping in mind that activation that encourages people to congregate would have to be 
undertaken with caution while we are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Active stewardship 
of such spaces is important at all times, but particularly during the pandemic, to support and 
safely manage such activation. This is key to ensuring that changes help support the overall 
safety of the Harvard Square area, from the perspective of traffic safety, public health, and 
overall public safety. Locations where abutting restaurants or other businesses are interested in 
utilizing the space for outdoor dining and/or other permitted activities would be the optimal 
locations to be considered for closure. 
 
The Harvard Square Business Association (HSBA) is generally supportive of street closures that  
are limited in terms of times of the day and days of the week, and that help contribute to the 
vitality and liveliness of Harvard Square, particularly in areas where businesses are seeking 
additional outdoor space to enhance their operations. The City has successfully partnered with a 
number of restaurants in Harvard Square to provide additional space for outdoor dining, most 
prominently on Bow Street between DeWolfe Street and Plympton Street. Leaders from HSBA 

1.9

 

 

Packet Pg. 56

1.9

want to ensure that any street closures help to further activate space within Harvard Square, and 
do not result in the area seeming less busy or less vital. Furthermore, HSBA emphasizes that any 
consideration of street closures should take into account the needs and constraints of the 
businesses on those streets. 
 
Feedback from local business owners indicates that many small businesses are not supportive of 
closing the streets in and around Harvard Square beyond the current closures for outdoor dining. 
Construction activity in Harvard Square has resulted in reduced availability of on street parking. 
During the pandemic, when patrons are driving to the Square including to “Pick It Up Local” as 
encouraged by the City, businesses have expressed the concern that closing additional streets and 
further limiting parking could negatively impact their attractiveness, which even more than 
usual, depend on attracting both local and regional visitors.  
 
Based on a letter sent by the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association (HSNA), they are 
supportive of street closures, as long as those closures are given “careful consideration” and 
continue to take into account access to key locations that need to be accessible to motor vehicles. 
Their letter also acknowledges the need to accommodate deliveries to local businesses, which is 
a critical need. 
 
Public safety experts from the Fire Department  and the Police Department have expressed 
concerns about the impact on emergency response that would result from the closure of major 
streets such as JFK Street, Mount Auburn Street, and portions of Brattle Street and/or Church 
Street (since those two streets provide overlapping access to certain locations within the Square). 
It is also important to consider that the closure of more significant streets in Harvard Square 
would likely result in vehicles detouring to other streets, resulting in larger volumes of through 
vehicular traffic on streets not designed to carry such volumes. Such diversions would also result 
in multiple additional movements across bikes lanes and unsignalized crosswalks, potentially 
leading to safety issues at those locations. Currently, such detours do take place during special 
events such as Octoberfest and Mayfair, but these events are accompanied by a significant police 
presence to manage traffic at a level that would not be sustainable for the types of daily or 
weekly closures proposed in this Policy Order. As with other changes that have been discussed in 
Harvard Square, it would be important to ensure that closure do not divert commercial traffic 
onto local residential streets, particularly given the limited alternative routes around Harvard 
Square. 
 
A number of the streets in Harvard Square carry Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 
(MBTA) bus service, along with other bus services from the Longwood Medical Area, Harvard 
University, and other institutions, and we would want to ensure that any changes do not 
negatively impact those services. Although it would be possible to allow buses to travel through 
streets that are closed to general traffic, this would have to be done very carefully to ensure that 
all street users are safe and that unauthorized vehicles do not follow the buses through the closed 
area. In addition, keeping a portion of the street open for buses could compromise the overall 
intent and functionality of a street closure. 
 
Harvard Square is currently experiencing a significant amount of disruption due to street and 
building construction. As noted above, limited parking and loading zones have been a concern 

Packet Pg. 57

1.9

for businesses even prior to COVID-19. Additional closures could also further disrupt deliveries 
and customer parking options. These construction projects also constrain the locations where we 
can implement street closures that are beneficial to the local area (e.g., Linden Street is already 
closed due to Adams House construction). Representatives from a range of City departments 
meet monthly with representatives from HSBA, HSNA, and small businesses to coordinate 
Harvard Square construction projects and mitigation strategies to reduce their impacts on the 
district. 
 
Next Steps 
 
At this time when many of our local businesses are struggling with the impacts of the COVID-19 
pandemic, it is important that we move forward deliberately and in consultation with nearby 
businesses, and ensure that any street closures are both beneficial to Harvard Square and take 
into account the public health risks associated with COVID-19.  
 
The Harvard Square Advisory Committee is charged with stewardship of Harvard Square and 
members include representatives of the Harvard Square Business Association, the Harvard 
Square Neighborhood Association, Harvard University, residents from adjoining neighborhoods, 
local businesses and property owners, among others. While the principal role of the advisory 
committee is to review development proposals in the Square, we recommend expanding their 
scope to incorporate consideration and consultation on potential roadway modifications as part of 
a pilot proposal.  
 
Staff from the Community Development Department, the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation 
Department, and the Department of Public Works would work with the Harvard Square Advisory 
Committee and solicit additional public input to evaluate a pilot intervention. For initial 
consideration, we recommend the following possibilities: 

•  Maintain the existing full and partial street closures that are currently in place in Harvard 
Square, specifically Winthrop Street from JFK Street to Eliot Street and the segment of 
Bow Street from DeWolfe Street to Plympton Street. These closures help support outdoor 
dining for adjacent restaurants and provide additional pedestrian space for people 
traveling to and through the Square. 

•  Palmer Street is currently an underutilized public space in Harvard Square. At the same 
time, it fulfils an important delivery function supporting adjacent businesses and office 
uses while removing those deliveries from nearby public streets. Implementation of 
relatively low-cost tactical visual enhancements and activation interventions could 
improve the quality of the public experience, emphasize the pedestrian-oriented nature of 
the street, and draw new activity, while still accommodating the delivery function.  
•  Brattle Street, between Eliot Street and Church Street, adjacent to Deguglielmo Plaza, is 
the location most often mentioned for a recurring closure. This space could function as a 
natural extension of nearby public open spaces, while supporting the business located on 
this segment of Brattle Street. Church Street functions as a natural alternative route to 
access the remainder of Brattle Street west of Church Street, so the impact on business 
access could be relatively limited.  
 

Packet Pg. 58

As noted earlier, we propose working with the Harvard Square Advisory Committee to review 
and develop an activation strategy for Harvard Square. If a successful approach can be 
developed, it could point the way towards additional street modifications in other locations 
around the Square. In addition to the advisory committee, we will continue to meet with the local 
community, including businesses, residents, and institutions to identify additional needs and 
potential solutions.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report 20-51, regarding an update on the installation of Rectangular 
Rapid Flash Beacons (RRFBs) as part of the fourth round of Participatory Budgeting and 
evaluate the feasibility of installing an RRFB at the intersection of Broadway and Norfolk Street, 
Budget Director Taha Jennings and Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Director Joseph Barr 
report the following: 
 
Round Four of the Participatory Budgeting program (PB4) allocated $176,000 for flashing 
pedestrian beacons in the FY19 Capital Budget, which allows for the installation of 22 pedestrian 
beacons. A typical intersection requires two beacons (one on each side of the roadway); for 
locations with a median (such as the northern portion of Massachusetts Avenue), three beacons 
are required. 
 
The PB4 proposal included a list of several potential locations for the proposed beacons. It is 
important to note that was simply an illustrative list of potential locations, not a definitive list of 
locations where a decision had been made to install an RRFB, and that the actual Participatory 
Budgeting ballot did not include that list. Specific locations where RRFBs are to be installed are 
prioritized based on crash history, roadway design/geometry, and engineering judgment. In 
accordance with our evidence-based approach to Vision Zero, the Traffic, Parking, and 
Transportation Department worked closely with the Police Department to obtain crash data for 
unsignalized crosswalks across the city, to allow us to prioritize the locations where the greatest 
improvement to pedestrian safety could be realized with the allocated funding. 
 
The safety analysis was conducted with a focus on locations with two approach lanes in a single 
direction. These locations, frequently referred to as “multiple threat” crosswalks, have been 
documented in local and national research to create a higher risk of a pedestrian crash, as a driver 
stopping to yield to a pedestrian in the crosswalk may obstruct the visibility of the pedestrian for 
a driver approaching in the second lane. Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs) are a 

1.10

 

 

Packet Pg. 60

1.10

proven countermeasure that have been documented to significantly improve driver yielding at 
multi-lane crosswalks. 
 
Table 1 below documents each of the locations that was selected based on analyzing crash data 
and assessing pedestrian safety. These locations will fully utilize the funding allocated in PB4. 
City staff are currently engaged in a further review of the remaining crosswalks citywide in order 
to identify locations for additional crosswalks which have been funded for $150,000 under PB6, 
which will allow for the installation of approximately 20 more beacons. Through that process 
staff will be reviewing locations near schools, parks, and senior centers, as well as the locations 
noted in the Policy Order on Broadway and Hampshire Street. Staff will work with the 
Purchasing Agent over the winter to conduct a bidding process, with construction on the next 
round of beacons commencing in the Spring.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-25, which requested that the City work with the 
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to identify the bus stop at the corner of 
Massachusetts Avenue at Churchill Avenue as serving Matignon High School, Traffic, Parking 
& Transportation Director Joseph Barr reports the following: 
 
Based on discussions with MBTA staff, they are open to changing the name of the stop to 
recognize the proximity to Matignon High School and would recommending making the change 
at both the inbound stop at Cottage Park Avenue and the outbound stop at Churchill Avenue. 
This name change would be communicated to customers through both audio and visual 
announcements on board the bus. 
 
To provide a customer service experience that is consistent with how these types of landmarks 
are identified elsewhere in the system, the MBTA would continue to refer to these stops as 
Massachusetts Ave at Cottage Park Ave or Massachusetts Ave at Churchill Ave, but would add 
Matignon High or Matignon HS after the intersection location, in line with this request. For 
example, the official name of the bus stop would become “Massachusetts Ave @ Churchill Ave - 
Matignon High” or “Massachusetts Ave @ Churchill Ave - Matignon HS” (the exact name will 
be constrained by character limits within the electronic systems that audibly and visually 
announce upcoming stops). 
 
The MBTA has indicated that they should be able to make this change by the end of the year, as 
part of their regular updates to the stop names in the electronic systems on board their buses.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
This is in response to Policy Order Number O-13, of October 5, 2020, which requests that the 
City Manager work with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department and the City 
Solicitor with regard to a draft Truck Safety Ordinance which “would provide requirements for 
safety improvements made to trucks owned by companies which have contracts with the City.”  
 
After consultation with the Law Department and the Traffic, Parking and Transportation 
Department, as well as the Department of Public Works, the Police Department, the Purchasing 
Department and the Community Development Department, I am forwarding a Truck Safety 
Ordinance that contains the measures that could be taken to improve the safety of large trucks 
utilized by City vendors, particularly in relation to the safety of pedestrians and cyclists.  Similar 
to the ordinance in Boston, the attached ordinance requires side guards and other safety measures 
with respect to trucks operated by vendors contracting with the City.

Date:  October 15, 2020 

Re: 

Zoning Recommendations for Retail Uses and Home Occupations 

 
Following from the September 30, 2020 meeting of the Economic Development and 
University Relations Committee, CDD staff in consultation with the Law Department 
have prepared the following materials for consideration if the City Council chooses to 
refer this language in the form of zoning petitions for hearing and report by the Planning 
Board and Ordinance Committee: 

•  Clean text versions of the potential zoning changes presented and discussed on 

September 30, 2020. 

•  A set of additional amendments to other sections of the Zoning Ordinance that are 
intended to resolve potential conflicts or ambiguity that might be created if the 
retail use changes discussed on September 30, 2020 are referred. These changes are

Retail Land Use Zoning – Potential Text Amendments 

Contents: 

1.  Amendments to Article 2.000 – Definitions.  These changes are intended to provide general and specific definitions for all Retail and 

Consumer Services Uses and amend some current definitions.  

2.  Amendments to Article 4.000, New Section 4.210 – Additional Allowed Retail and Consumer Service Uses.  These changes are intended 
to clarify the allowances and limitations for subsidiary Retail and Consumer Service Uses that are contained within another larger non-
residential use.  

3.  Amendments to Article 4.000, Section 4.30 – Table of Use Regulations and Section 4.40 – Footnotes to the Table of Use Regulations.  
These changes are intended to adjust current district use regulations for Retail or Consumer Service Establishments, with the overall 
objectives of relaxing limitations that have been particularly onerous to small businesses and establishing more permissive regulations in 
areas where retail is desired. 

4.  Amendments to Article 6.000, Section 6.32 – Parking Exemptions.  These changes are intended to expand current exemptions from 

parking requirements to apply to non-residential uses in existing buildings. 

5.  Amendments to Article 10.000, Section 10.43 – Special Permit Criteria.  These changes are intended to provide a set of specific 

considerations to guide the review of proposed special permits for Retail and Consumer Service Uses.

Special Permit: a golf course; yacht club or marina; boat docks, ticket offices and other support 
facilities for ferry services, boat rentals and boat cruises services. [Section 4.35i]

12.   

In  all  Office  Districts,  permitted  Retail  or  Consumer  Service  Establishments  shall  meet  the  following 
standards, which may be modified by special permit from the Board of Zoning Appeal; Yes in an Office 2 
District  provided  that  the  establishment  is  located  within  a  building  principally  containing  uses  listed  in 
Subsection 4.34 and that the total gross floor area of all establishments included under items 4.35e and 4.35f 
in this table do not exceed ten (10) percent of the gross floor area of the building. Hhowever, this ten (10) 
percent  floor  area  such  limitations  shall  not  apply  to  a  cafeteria  or  other  eating/drinking  facility  which  is 
accessory to permitted uses in a building or associated group of buildings in the same ownership and which is 
intended primarily for employees of those uses and their guests.: 

(a)  Retail  or  Consumer  Service  Establishments  shall  be  located  within  buildings  or  on  lots  or 

Development Parcels containing other permitted office and/or residential uses; 

(b)  Retail or Consumer Service Establishments shall occupy no more than 25% of the total Floor Area 

Ratio or Gross Floor Area permitted on the lot or Development Parcel;  

(c)  Retail  or  Consumer  Service  Establishments  shall  be  located  at  the  Ground  Story  with  entrances 

accessible to pedestrians directly from public sidewalks; and 

(d)  all permitted Retail or Consumer Service Establishments in Office 1 Districts shall require a special

13.   No in the Business B-1 and Business B-2 Districts.  

14.  

[Deleted]Board of Zoning Appeal special permit in the Industry B-2 District.  

[…] 

23.  

[Deleted]Where all display and sales are conducted within a building or where a permit has been issued by 
City Council for an outdoor sale, and where no manufacturing assembly, or packaging occur on the premises, 
except in Industrial districts as permitted elsewhere in this Ordinance.  

24.  

[Deleted]Provided that the establishment is located in a structure also containing retail uses, and that no 

establishment shall exceed two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet gross floor area.  

25.  

[Deleted]Provided that at least fifty (50) percent of such merchandise is sold at retail on the premises and 

that all display and sales are conducted within a building.  

1.14.b

Explanatory note: Footnote 12 
currently permits restaurants in 
office districts as part of mixed-
use buildings, with limitations. 
The proposal is to expand this 
provision so that other selected 
Retail and Consumer Service 
Establishments (indicated in the 
table) would be allowed, with 
similar limitations. This would 
allow more ground-floor retail in 
predominantly commercial areas 
such as Kendall Square and 
Alewife. 

Explanatory note: Footnotes are 
proposed to be deleted where they 
are superseded by the definitions 
above or where they are 
inconsistent with stated planning 
objectives in applicable districts.

58.   Subject to the provisions of Section 11.800, Cannabis Uses.  

59.   

In  Residence  B,  C,  C-1,  C-1A,  2,  2A,  2B,  3,  3A,  and  3B  Districts,  certain  Retail  and  Consumer  Service 
Establishments identified in the Table of Use Regulations may be allowed by special permit from the Board 
of Zoning Appeal, subject to the criteria set forth in Sections 10.43 and 10.43.1 of this Zoning Ordinance, if 
all of the following conditions are met: 

(a)  The proposed use is located within the Ground Story of a building; 

(b)  the use is proposed to occupy a space that was originally built for non-residential use and has been 

previously occupied by one or more non-residential uses in the past; 

(c)  the use is proposed to occupy a space that has not contained a residential use at any point within the 

two (2) years prior to application for a special permit; 

(d)  the special permit shall be valid only for the entity to which the special permit was issued, and shall not 

be transferrable to a new entity unless a new special permit is granted; and 

(e)  the special permit shall be valid for a time period of five (5) years after its date of issuance, subject to 
reissuance upon application to the Board of Zoning Appeal at the end of that period, or the Board of 
Zoning Appeal in its discretion  may set forth a different time period in the conditions of the special 
permit decision.  

60.   A Craft Retail and Production Shop shall be permitted as-of-right in a BA, BA-1, BA-2, BA-3, or BA-4 District 
if it occupies no more than 2,500 square feet of Gross Floor Area, including storage areas, and does not 
involve the use of equipment that produces dust, fumes, odors, smoke, vapors, noise, vibration, flashing, 
light trespass, or glare outside of the premises. 

61.  No special permit is required for Temporary Outdoor Retail or Consumer Service Uses on municipal-owned 

land. 

 

 

Cambridge Community Development Department – September 25, 2020 

1.14.b

Explanatory note: New footnote 
59 would provide a special permit 
option for an existing non-
conforming commercial space to 
be used for a limited range of 
Retail or Consumer Service 
Establishments. Currently, a retail 
space in a residential district 
would be expected to transition to 
residential use, or would need to 
seek a use variance if a new retail 
use were proposed. 

Explanatory note: New footnote 
60 would allow retail and 
production shops in neighborhood 
retail areas if the size and impacts 
are limited. 

Explanatory note: New footnote 
61 would allow temporary open-
air retail, such as farmers’ 
markets, on City-owned lots in 
residential districts without a 
special permit. This would apply 
to sites such as public school 
parking lots.

1.14.b

Part 4:  Amend Section 6.32.1, Parking Exemptions for Small Business, as set forth below: 

6.32   Parking Exemptions.  

6.32.1   Small Business. The minimum amount of parking required by Subsection 6.36 Schedule of Parking and 
Loading Requirements shall be waived for any nonresidential use in an office, business, or industrial district 
if such use would require four (4) or fewer spaces. However, and such nonresidential use shall be is located 
in a building or row of attached buildings which contains a total of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or less 
of  gross  floor  area  devoted  to  nonresidential  use.  Furthermore,  for  a  new  nonresidential  use  within  a 
building in existence on or before [EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AMENDMENT], no new accessory parking shall 
be required.  

6.32.2  

Institutions. Where an institution provides dormitory, fraternity, faculty, employee or other residence 

accommodations, the number of parking spaces provided as a result thereof may be deducted from the 
requirements established to satisfy the needs of classrooms, libraries, lecture halls, laboratories, similar 
educational areas or dining facilities normally used by such residential occupants. In order to qualify for such 
deduction, the institutional applicant shall submit to the Building Department the institution's current 
residential parking plan clearly indicating the location of all existing and proposed residential parking 
facilities available at the institution.  

 

Explanatory note: This change 
would exempt new uses in existing 
buildings from having to either 
construct new parking spaces or 
seek relief from the Board of 
Zoning Appeal if the change in 
use affects the number of parking 
spaces normally required. A 
similar approach is already 
employed in the Harvard Square 
Overlay District and Central 
Square Overlay District zoning. 
Parking requirements were found 
to be one of the most frequent 
reasons for new small businesses 
to have to seek zoning relief.

Part 5:  Create a new Subsection 10.43.1 following Section 10.43, Criteria for Special Permits, as set forth below: 

10.43   Criteria. Special permits will normally be granted where specific provisions of this Ordinance are met, 

except when particulars of the location or use, not generally true of the district or of the uses permitted in 
it, would cause granting of such permit to be to the detriment of the public interest because:  

(a)  

It appears that requirements of this Ordinance cannot or will not be met, or  

(b)   Traffic generated or patterns of access or egress would cause congestion, hazard, or substantial 

change in established neighborhood character, or  

(c)   The continued operation of or the development of adjacent uses as permitted in the Zoning Ordinance 

would be adversely affected by the nature of the proposed use, or  

(d)   Nuisance or hazard would be created to the detriment of the health, safety and/or welfare of the 

occupant of the proposed use or the citizens of the City, or  

(e)   For other reasons, the proposed use would impair the integrity of the district or adjoining district, or 

otherwise derogate from the intent and purpose of this Ordinance, and  

(f)   The new use or building construction is inconsistent with the Urban Design Objectives set forth in 

Section 19.30.  

10.43.1 Conditional Retail or Consumer Service Establishments. Where a special permit is required for a Retail 
or Consumer Service Establishment listed in Section 4.35 or 4.36 of this Zoning Ordinance, the special 
permit granting authority shall consider the following factors when evaluating the criteria in Section 
10.43: 

(a)  Anticipated delivery and loading operations, their potential impacts on neighboring uses and the 

overall neighborhood, and the extent to which those impacts are mitigated;  

(b)  The extent to which neighboring uses would be impacted by environmental nuisance such as dust, 

fumes, odors, smoke, vapors, noise, vibration, flashing, light trespass, or glare, and the extent to 
which those impacts are mitigated; 

(c)  The extent to which storefronts and other elements of the façade visible to the public are 

compatible with the visual character of the surrounding area and conform to the City’s urban design 
objectives for retail uses in the area; and 

(d)  The extent to which the establishment serves a public objective identified in citywide or 

neighborhood plans that would offset potential adverse impacts. 

Explanatory note: These criteria 
would supplement the general 
criteria in Section 10.43 when a 
special permit is needed for a 
retail establishment.

Retail Zoning Petition – Supplemental Consistency Amendments 
CLEAN VERSION 

Supplement to Proposed Retail Zoning Amendments 

Overview:  The proposed zoning amendments, which include definitions of Retail or Consumer Service Establishments in Article 2.000 and 
amendments to the Table of Use Regulations in Section 4.30, result in the need to amend other sections of the Zoning Ordinance that may 
contain outdated references to those Definitions or Sections. While any zoning amendment can have unintended outcomes, the changes 
suggested in this document are intended to maintain consistency within the language of the Zoning Ordinance and minimize potential 
substantive changes. 

i. 

In Article 3.000 Zoning Districts, amend Section 3.11 to read as follows: 

Explanatory note not to be included in zoning text:  The amendments below delete “Business C-1” and “Industry C” districts, which are no longer 
included on the Cambridge Zoning Map, and add “Business C” which appears to have been inadvertently excluded. It also revises inaccuracies in 
the numbering of districts. 

3.11    For  the  purpose  of  this  Ordinance,  the  City  of  Cambridge  is  hereby  divided  into  fifty-three  classes  of  districts  listed  below  in  order  of 
decreasing restrictiveness as follows:

iii. 

In Article 6.000, amend Sections 6.36.5 and 6.36.6 of the Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements to read as follows: 

Explanatory note not to be included in zoning text:  The amendments below mirror the proposed changes to the Table of Use Regulations in 
Section 4.30. Where these changes result in the need to create new parking, loading, and bicycle parking requirements, or to amend existing 
requirements, the proposed requirements are intended (a) to be consistent among uses that have similar trip-generation patterns, and (b) to 
use Gross Floor Area as a standard rather than occupancy or other standards that are difficult to apply through zoning.

consider the size of the staff customarily occupying the premises, the nature of the client, resident, or customer population and the extent 
to which additional off street parking will be detrimental to the physical character of the neighborhood.

read as follows: 

o.    Beekeeping,  conducted  in  conformance  with  the  Standards  for  Urban  Agriculture  set  forth  in

(c)   The establishment fulfills a need for such a service in the neighborhood or in the city;  

(d)    The  establishment  will  attract  patrons  primarily  from  walk  in  trade  as  opposed  to  drive  in  or

within which the establishment is proposed to be located does not have significant pedestrian 
traffic, this requirement need not be met.

packaging the food and in the utensils and other items provided for consumption thereof;

be  utilized  only  by  the  owner  or  operator  of  such  establishment  as  described  in  the  application 
documents  or  as  those  documents  may  be  modified  by  the  conditions  of  the  Special  Permit  as 
granted.  

In granting a Special Permit under this Section 11.30 the Board shall specifically detail in its decision 
the types of foods for which the Permit is granted and shall also identify those other aspects of the 
establishment as outlined in the application documents for which alterations will require the issuance 
of a new Special Permit.

provided that the total amount of retail GFA in the District does not exceed 70,000 square feet and

the Planning Board determines in writing that more retail GFA and establishments of a greater size 
better  serve  the  residents  within  the  PUD  district  and  in  adjacent  districts  and  better  advance  the 
policies set forth in the Eastern Cambridge Plan and the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines.

17.105   Additional Use and Gross Floor Area Provisions for Existing Nonresidential Uses and Structures 

.  

(A)  

It is the intent of this Section 17.107 to encourage a gradual evolution of nonresidential uses in 
this Special District 10 now heavily nonresidential in character, from those least in harmony with 
the adjacent residential neighborhood and the residential uses ultimately desired in the district, 
to those nonresidential uses most compatible with residential uses and ultimately to residential 
uses exclusively. Therefore, in the Special District 10 the following additional uses not otherwise 
permitted in the Residence C District shall be permitted as of right, provided the conditions set 
forth below are met. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.31, no variance for use shall 
be  permitted  in  the  Special  District  10.  For  the  purposes  of  Article  8.000  the  Special  District 
shall continue to be considered a residential district and therefore Section 8.22, Paragraphs a 
and b shall not apply.  

(1)    All  uses  in  Section  4.34,  Office  and  Laboratory  Uses,  shall  be  permitted  but  only  if  the 

following conditions are met:  

a.   The building thereon, (or that portion of the building proposed to be reused) is vacant and 
not  occupied  by  a  residential  use  in  the  five  years  immediately  preceding  the  time  of 
application for a Certificate of Occupancy for the proposed use, or if occupied, the current 
use  is  any  office  and  laboratory  use,  Section  4.34;  any  retail  or  consumer  service 
establishment, Section 4.35; any light industry, wholesale business or storage use, Section 
4.37; or any heavy industry use, Section 4.38.  

(2)   All uses in Section 4.35, Retail or Consumer Service Establishments, Paragraphs a-1, a-2, 

a-3,  and c shall be permitted, but only if the following conditions are met:  

a.    The  use  existing  at  the  time  of  application  for  a  Certificate  of  Occupancy  for  the 
proposed  new  use,  or  that  first  legally  established  use  immediately  preceding  the 
application for a proposed new use should the premises be vacant (provided that the 
previous  use  was  in  operation  within  the  two  years  immediately  preceding  the 
application  for  a  Certificate  of  Occupancy),  is  any  Retail  or  Consumer  Service 
Establishment,  Section  4.35;  or  any  light  Industry,  wholesale  business  and  storage 
use, Section 4.37; or any heavy industry use, Section 4.38; and  

b.    The  use  shall  occupy  only  that  gross  floor  area  meeting  the  use  limitations  of 

Paragraph a above.  

(3)    All  uses  in  Section  4.37,  light  industry,  wholesale  business,  and  storage,  Paragraphs  a

Retail Zoning Petition – Supplemental Consistency Amendments 
MARKUP VERSION 

Supplement to Proposed Retail Zoning Amendments 

Overview:  The proposed zoning amendments, which include definitions of Retail or Consumer Service Establishments in Article 2.000 and 
amendments to the Table of Use Regulations in Section 4.30, result in the need to amend other sections of the Zoning Ordinance that may 
contain outdated references to those Definitions or Sections. While any zoning amendment can have unintended outcomes, the changes 
suggested in this document are intended to maintain consistency within the language of the Zoning Ordinance and minimize potential 
substantive changes. 

i.

Explanatory note not to be included in zoning text:  The amendments below delete “Business C-1” and “Industry C” districts, which are no longer 
included on the Cambridge Zoning Map, and add “Business C” which appears to have been inadvertently excluded. It also revises inaccuracies in 
the numbering of districts. 

3.11    For  the  purpose  of  this  Ordinance,  the  City  of  Cambridge  is  hereby  divided  into  fifty-three  classes  of  districts  listed  below  in  order  of

In Article 6.000, amend Sections 6.36.5 and 6.36.6 of the Schedule of Parking and Loading Requirements to read as follows: 

Explanatory note not to be included in zoning text:  The amendments below mirror the proposed changes to the Table of Use Regulations in 
Section 4.30. Where these changes result in the need to create new parking, loading, and bicycle parking requirements, or to amend existing 
requirements, the proposed requirements are intended (a) to be consistent among uses that have similar trip-generation patterns, and (b) to 
use Gross Floor Area as a standard rather than occupancy or other standards that are difficult to apply through zoning.

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours,

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 
MAYOR SIDDIQUI 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

During a public hearing on October 3rd, 2019, the Cambridge Historical Commission 
voted to initiate a Neighborhood Conservation District (NCD) Study for a portion of 
East Cambridge; and  
 
On September 10th, 2020, The Historical Commission voted to extend the Study for 
another year due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
The City Council has a vested interest in ensuring that all stakeholders are given equal 
opportunity to attend and give input at East Cambridge NCD Study Meetings, as 
expanding and deepening community engagement is one of the City Council’s stated 
goals; and 
 
The City Council has also affirmed that its first priority and goal is promoting housing 
affordability across Cambridge; and 
 
There is a question on whether Neighborhood Conservation Districts and other such 
historical preservation districting have a secondary effect of generally increasing home 
prices within and even beyond their borders; and 
 
East Cambridge already faces unique and intense development pressures from its 
proximity to Kendall Square and the proliferation of biotech and commercial 
development in what is one of the most valuable square miles of real estate in the 
country, which, in addition to the downsides of direct encroachment of these 
developments into the neighborhood itself, has already led to rents and home values 
rising at astronomical levels; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  While increases in property values may be beneficial to some residents, they can also 
lead to rent increases and displacement for other residents who do not own property, 
and overall a much more comprehensive strategy is needed to preserve historical 
aspects of East Cambridge while creating new opportunities for affordability and 
preventing displacement in what is already a very dense neighborhood; and 
 
Residents who rent should have the same rights and access to participate in public 
policy and decision making as property-owning residents, as overlooking the 68% of 
East Cambridge households who rent and the 56.9% of City-wide households who rent 
leaves out the majority of Cambridge residents; now therefore be it 
 

 
WHEREAS:

ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

That the Cambridge Historical Commission remain mindful that housing affordability 
is a regional issue, and that a new Neighborhood Conservation District anywhere in the 
City may result in higher housing prices elsewhere in the City; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with the Cambridge 
Historical Commission, other relevant City Departments and community partners to 
develop strategies to expand residents’ access to and participation in the East 
Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee Meetings so that 
participation reflects the demographics of the neighborhood, particularly as it pertains 
to property owners and tenants; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Cambridge 
Historical Commission and other relevant City Departments to ensure that any access, 
outreach efforts, or opportunities to engage with the Neighborhood Conservation 
District Study process made available to homeowners be equal to those available to 
renters; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Cambridge 
Historical Commission and other relevant City Departments to ensure that any report 
or recommendation for a new Neighborhood Conservation District in Cambridge 
presented to the City Council include an analysis of the potential effects on City 
housing affordability based on current research, as well as any mitigations that the 
Cambridge Historical Commission recommends, so that the City Council may 
holistically evaluate the matter. 
 
That the City Solicitor provide a legal opinion by October 26th on the legal 
implications of the Historical Commission’s decision to extend the study beyond one 
year following the acceptance of the designation petition as listed in Article 3, section I 
of the enabling legislation, as it relates to the approval of building permits by the 
Historical Commission past October 3, 2020

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge publicly acknowledges we are facing a climate change crisis 
due to increasing dangers of fossil fuels impacting public health and quality of life; and 
 
The intent of Article 22.000 of Cambridge’s Zoning Code is “to promote 
environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient design and development practices in 
new construction and renovation of buildings in the city”; and 
 
The city has set goals for different building types to meet the highest standards for 
environmentally sustainable design in the coming years; and 
 
Costs for different forms of clean energy are equal to or less than fossil fuels; and 
 
Cambridge set a building standard for utilizing clean energy in their non-zero buildings 
to minimize adverse environmental impacts and as examples for private industry and 
all public facilities design to replicate; and 
 
It is of utmost importance that new and renovated projects seriously explore the 
environmental and likely cost advantages of using alternative and renewable energy 
resources during the design development of their projects; now therefore

Supervising Engineer 
Cambridge Department of Public Works 
147 Hampshire Street 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
RE:  Curb Cut Application 
10 Acorn Park Drive 
 
 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 
 
 
Dear Mr. Niranjan: 
 
On behalf of SXC Alewife Hotel, LLC, BSC Group has completed the City of Cambridge’s 
online application for a curb cut at 10 Acorn Park Drive to service the AC Marriott Hotel.  
The AC Hotel is located within the Cambridge Discovery Park development and currently 
has access from Discovery Way, a private way, running parallel to Acorn Park Drive. 
 
The proposed curb cut and driveway have been designed to provide one-way only access 
from Acorn Park Drive in accordance with the City of Cambridge requirements and the 
comments communicated at our site meetings in order to improve site access for hotel guests 
and deliveries, and to provide improved emergency vehicle access to the Hotel.   
 
Visitors to the Hotel exiting Route 2 via the Alewife Station Access Road currently travel 
along Acorn Park Drive to Discovery Way in order to access the Hotel.  The proposed drive 
will have improved wayfinding and access to the Hotel by providing direct access to the 
Hotel from Acorn Park Drive, including for ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency 
vehicles.   
 
We are available to discuss further at your convenience anytime.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact our office with any questions or inquiries you may have.  I can be reached at 
dbiancavilla@bscgroup.com or at 617-896-4347 or my cell phone:  978-857-0513. 
 
 
Very truly yours, 
BSC Group, Inc.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home

now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it

ORDERED: 

 
That section 2.119.020(D) of the Ordinances of the City of Cambridge be

covid potentially spread by joggers

Everyday when I am in my front yard, joggers who are breathing strenuously whiz past a few feet from me without 
wearing a mask. This happens multiple times during the day, and joggers who sensibly wear a mask are few and far 
between. I understand that mask wearing makes breathing difficult for joggers when running, but we all have to make 
sacrifices! Since it is safer, many of us are spending more time outdoors and joggers who don’t wear masks are 
endangering others.

Now that we know that Covid droplets remain in the air for a long a time, and that it can spread well beyond 6 feet, I 
hope that joggers will be mandated (if not already) to wear masks and will be held accountable. This is a large and 
serious health problem considering that joggers are running at such a pace that it makes it difficult for others to quickly 
get out of their path of spewed out pathogens. Even though I always wear a mask, droplets can land on clothing and hair 
as well.
Please address this issue if you haven’t already done so.
Thank you,
Maria Lindberg

Bard, Branville G.; Clerk
Public Safety Committee: ShotSpotter Impact Report

Chair Zondervan., members of Public Safety Committee:

In 2014, when Cambridge installed ShotSpotter, a microphone based gun shot surveillance system, the City made lofty 
promises. ShotSpotter, it said, “allows the police to proactively develop effective problem-oriented, data-driven policing 
strategies and tactical deployments.” By that measure, ShotSpotter has been an utter failure.

What the Cambridge Police say now is that it allows police to be dispatched more efficiently to gunshot incidents. If 
ShotSpotter has value, it would be if police could get to an incident more quickly, intervene and save lives. It doesn’t do 
that for Cambridge. SpotSpotter has provided evidence in some cases, the Police report, but the real question that 
evidence materially supported the outcome.

But the core question is why we have ShotSpotter in the first place. It is a technology that is intended for high crime, 
high gun shot incidence areas. That isn’t Cambridge. We have because it was thrust on us by regional Federal grant. It’s 
really hard to imagine that, if we didn’t already have ShotSpotter, that Commissioner Bard would come to the Council 
for an appropriation to purchase it. This is, by the way, ShotSpotter’s scam. They couldn’t get any police departments to 
buy it so, instead, they lobbied Congress to create grant programs to fund the purchases and coached grant applicants 
on how make sure they’d be successful.

With respect to disparate impact, the ShotSpotter report fails to mention the need to hold live fire exercises to calibrate 
its sensors.

On August 19th 2019, the Cambridge Police conducted a live fire exercise to calibrate and validate ShotSpotter 
microphones 
(https://www.cambridgema.gov/news/detail.aspx?path=%2fsitecore%2fcontent%2fhome%2fcpd%2fnewsandalerts%2f
Archives%2f2019%2f08%2fcambridgepolicedepartmenttoconductshotspottertestingaugust27th). This resulted in 
gunshots in three separate locations within the effective radius of ShotSpotter detection. These may be more gunshots 
than residents otherwise had heard all year.

The Police Department went to admirable lengths to inform the public of these tests and to make sure they were 
conducted safely. First, those preparations and arrangements for the test must have incurred costs. Shouldn’t those be 
documented? Second, certainly not everyone within the sound of those test gunshots knew they were tests. Are the 
Cambridge Police suggesting that hearing repeated gunshots in a City that almost never has any has no impact? If we’re 
going to be true to the oversight process established by the Oversight Ordinance, shouldn’t we demand the Police 
Department be complete in their response?

To be sure, ShotSpotter isn’t the worst surveillance technology, but, for Cambridge, it’s a complete mismatch for our 
needs. The question for the Council is what threshold it’s going to set for the acceptance of surveillance technology in 
Cambridge. Accepting ShotSpotter means that we’ll take basically useless technology as long as someone else pays for it. 
That shouldn’t be Cambridge’s standard.

Residents Alliance letter on traffic enforcement by police

The Cambridge Residents Alliance supports exploring the idea of unarmed personnel enforcing traffic 
laws. This idea is part of important efforts to re-think the role of police to increase racial justice.

We share the concern that traffic stops impact Black and Brown drivers disproportionately.  We need 
to reduce interactions between armed police and drivers.  Elsewhere these interactions have 
sometimes been deadly, as in the case of Philando Castile.  Traffic stops sometimes lead to vehicle 
searches, which also occur more often for people of color.

Exploring this idea should include a strong community engagement process that engages with people 
of color and others who are more impacted by traffic stops. 

We also request that Cambridge police collect and make public race data on traffic stops, so we can 
better understand current enforcement in Cambridge.

It would also be good to find out if residents are satisfied with the way traffic laws are currently being 
enforced.

Sincerely,

Lee Farris, President
Cambridge Residents Alliance

Dear	Mayor,	Councilors,	and	City	Manager,	

I	am	writing	for	the	Cambridge	Residents	Alliance	regarding	the	Envision	plan.		As	you	may	remember,	
the	Cambridge	Residents	Alliance	worked	hard	to	get	the	city	to	create	a	citywide	plan.		Our	supporters	
participated	in	many	Envision	meetings	and	joined	many	Envision	working	groups.		I	participated	in	the	
numerous	meetings	of	the	Housing	Working	Group	from	2017-2018.	

We	think	the	Envision	plan	goals	are	good	overall,	but	we	note	that	some	of	them	conflict	with	each	
other.		We	ask	that	the	city	discuss	creating	a	process	on	how	to	resolve	conflicting	goals.		(A	current	
example	is	how	to	increase	both	tree	canopy	and	affordable	housing	in	a	given	site.)			

It	also	is	not	clear	how	the	city	is	implementing	the	plan.		A	particular	area	of	concern	is	Alewife,	where	
new	large	developments	are	being	proposed	now	that	do	not	fully	align	with	the	Envision	
recommendations.			

Many	of	the	most	important	Envision	recommendations	would	require	zoning	to	be	implemented.		We	
need	a	process	and	schedule	of	how	that	will	be	accomplished.	

There	were	several	requests	by	councilors	in	2018	for	information	about	how	the	housing	(and	other)	
recommendations	would	affect	the	city’s	tax	base	and	finances,	after	the	manager	expressed	concerns	
in	public	meetings.		The	Planning	Board	also	asked	similar	questions.		Originally	the	city	staff	said	they	
would	respond	before	the	end	of	2018,	but	nothing	has	been	issued.	

Some	important	recommendations	propose	using	new	sources	of	funding,	such	as	tax	increment	
financing	or	bonds.		This	too	needs	to	be	put	on	an	implementation	timeline.		For	example,	members	of	
the	Alewife	advisory	group	reiterated	their	strong	desire	for	both	a	pedestrian-bike	bridge	across	the	
railroad	tracks	and	a	commuter	rail	station	at	Alewife.	The	consultant	from	Utile	acknowledged	that	
both	would	be	necessary	to	support	the	proposed	level	of	density,	but	said	a	plan	for	financing	them	
was	beyond	the	scope	of	the	Envision	work	and	the	suggestion	of	using	tax	increment	financing	
was	discouraged	by	city	staff.	

How	does	the	Council	use	and	incorporate	the	Envision	goals?		We	think	that	sending	relevant	portions	
of	the	Envision	plan	to	council	committees	for	discussion	would	be	a	step	in	that	direction.	

How	do	we	update	or	refine	the	Envision	plan	as	we	put	it	into	use?			Could	the	city	staff	provide	3	and	6	
month	updates?	It	would	be	helpful	if	the	city	staff	could	create	dashboards	on	the	progress	on	Envision	
goals.	

Thank	you	for	your	attention,

100% Affordable Housing and Parking

Dear Honorable Mayor, Councillors, and Director Barr,

I trust you and all your loved ones are safe and healthy during this unprecedented pandemic. I want to thank you for 
your leadership in keeping all the Cantabrigians safe during these trying times.

Now that the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Amendment (the Amendment) has been adopted, I would like to bring 
to your attention a golden opportunity to prove (or disprove as case may be) couple of the arguments the proponents of 
the Amendment used in justifying no/limited parking spaces at these 100% affordable housing developments 
(developments):
1) tenants of these developments will be relying on public transit as they will be near public transit hubs such as Porter 
Square
2) City's stated goal is to reduce car ownership (target set in 2014 was about 0.8 cars per household by end of this year, 
a reduction of the ratio of cars owned by 15 percent from 1990 levels 
(https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/18/cambridge-wanted-big-drop-car-ownership-that-hasn-exactly-
happened/sBu3TbWIBQLi5Nlo00L6AM/story.html))
These arguments have also been used for large development projects in requesting special permits to waive the parking 
requirements.

It came to my attention that 78 Porter Road, which to my best knowledge is a 100% affordable development, is currently 
undergoing renovation and is empty. I am writing to urge you to conduct a comprehensive, around the clock parking 
study during different days of a week for Porter Road/Regent Street loop while 78 Porter Road is empty and repeat the 
study once the renovation is completed and the building is fully occupied to measure the true impact of 100% affordable 
housing with no parking spaces. Matter of fact, this would establish a parking requirement baseline for any large new 
development near public transit. Opportunities like this will be very hard to come by and I beg the City and 
Capstone/Hope to take advantage to prove that indeed one parking space/dwelling unit is no longer necessary.

Thank you for your attention and your consideration,
Respectfully yours,
Young Kim

Residents Alliance letter on traffic enforcement by police

The Cambridge Residents Alliance supports exploring the idea of unarmed personnel enforcing traffic 
laws. This idea is part of important efforts to re-think the role of police to increase racial justice.

We share the concern that traffic stops impact Black and Brown drivers disproportionately.  We need 
to reduce interactions between armed police and drivers.  Elsewhere these interactions have 
sometimes been deadly, as in the case of Philando Castile.  Traffic stops sometimes lead to vehicle 
searches, which also occur more often for people of color.

Exploring this idea should include a strong community engagement process that engages with people 
of color and others who are more impacted by traffic stops. 

We also request that Cambridge police collect and make public race data on traffic stops, so we can 
better understand current enforcement in Cambridge.

It would also be good to find out if residents are satisfied with the way traffic laws are currently being 
enforced.

Sincerely,

Lee Farris, President

Public Safety committee/Public comments

I applaud the safety committe for taking a pro-active position in attempting to determine the extent to which racial 
profiling occurs in traffic policing. We cannot live up to the values of an un-racialized, democratic community unless we 
are vigilant in acknowledging where we fall short in the way our city institutions carry out their mandates. Traffic 
policing is no exception.

Several years ago, the car driven by a family member was pulled over because one of the tail lights was out. The 
officer had to be reminded that any citation belonged to the driver of the car, and not to the passenger, and that a 
demand to see the license of the passenger was unwarranted. One of our grandchildren was in the back seat. This was 
his first 'riding while Black' experience. Needless to say,  the experience was traumatic for him.

Unfortunately, the experience which I have just shared is not uncommon. As we all so painfully know, the outcome of 
many like scenarios ends in tragedy. The issues of 'probable cause' and 'search and seizure'--
Constitutional guarantees are all at play here but pale when compared to the emotional and psychic trauma that these 
scenarios engender.

The use of police for traffic details is an old issue in Cambridge.
I should think that traffic detail work could be carried out by civilian personnel in the same way that school crossing 
guards are used. Traffic detail work would expand, albeit in a very small way,  employment opportunities which have 
dwindled for those who cannot access the hi-tech-information-age-economy that characterizes Cambridge. Such a shift 
in traffic detail work would likely be cost effective.

Thank you,
Janet Moses

Hi Kate,

My friend mentioned to me that the city council would be discussing a proposal to close the Fresh Pond golf course on 
certain days to allow general walking, etc. He said that the council would be discussing it on Monday October 19, is that 
correct? I tried looking for that meeting's agenda, but couldn't find

Concerning the Proposed Neighborhood Conservation District for East Cambridge

As a resident of East Cambridge since 2005, I have been actively involved in the push for a Neighborhood Conservation 
District (NCD) in East Cambridge from its beginnings two years ago because I don’t want to see my neighborhood 
flattened by large-scale development interests.  Over the years, I have watched the encroachment of bio-labs along 
Binney Street, and now further encroachments as proposed by MITIMCO for the Volpe site, Alexandria for the 
Metropolitan Pipe site, and New England Development for the redesign of CambridgeSide.  In the East Cambridge 
neighborhood itself, I have seen a mid-19th century house be razed for a CVS, a mid-19th century house have its original 
windows torn out and replaced with much larger windows as an enticement to short-term Air BnB guests, and numerous 
ski-lodge style residential buildings being built that are out-of-scale and out-of-keeping with the character of this 
tenement neighborhood first laid out in 1811.

During the last two public meetings held by the Cambridge Historical Commission (CHC) on the proposed NCD, I have 
witnessed a group of people seemingly bent on destroying the process itself rather than have a balanced discussion of 
the merits and demerits of the subject under consideration.  In essence, they have said that we, the initiators of the 
study, are doing this to increase the value of our homes and that the announcement of the process was only directed to 
homeowners, with renters being excluded from being involved.  By extension, they claim that we are elitist and against 
affordable-housing and rent-control.

Such claims seem strange to me because I am only wanting to preserve and protect a neighborhood I love.  It has 
nothing to do with increasing the value of my property, which, as assessed, has raised astronomically anyway, along with 
accompanying tax payments, without an NCD being in place.  My understanding is that the CHC only mailed notices of 
the proposed NCD meetings to homeowners in that their addresses are active, whereas many renters’ addresses
currently on the rolls are no longer active.  To better invite and include renters, we the initiators of the NCD proposal 
were asked by the CHC to divide the proposed district into sections and personally hand-deliver flyers door-to-door so as 
to include everyone, which we did.  Also strange is that most folks who have voiced against the NCD as proposed do not 
live in East Cambridge district in question; indeed, many of them live in parts of Cambridge that already exist as NCDs.  
What they fail to realize is that affordable-housing and rent-control are not necessarily in contradiction with an NCD.  
Instead, their mantra of default up-zoning to achieve general affordability risks to destroy this neighborhood to replace 
it with an unsustainable type of sterile, urban development.

To this date, to my knowledge, no member of the sitting City Council has attended any of the CHC hearings or meetings 
concerning the NCD proposal for East Cambridge.  This being the case, I find it odd that certain members of the Council 
have already thrown their hats into the ring, aligning themselves via social media with those who are against the NCD as 
proposed.  And like some of those who oppose it while living outside of the district as proposed, some of these members 
of the Council reside in NCDs in other parts of town, whereby a contradiction presents itself: how can one be against the 
formation of a new NCD elsewhere when one already resides and benefits from an NCD in another part of town? That in 
itself, to which one must also recall the history of the East Cambridge as a neighborhood for immigrant factory and low-
wage workers for two centuries, seems a more genuine form of elitism.

To conclude, such immediate expression by certain members of the Council on social media, without even having 
attended any of the CHC hearings and meetings so as to obtain a more global, nuanced, or informed view, seems out of 
keeping with the role that a Councillor should maintain as an elected representative, which is to listen to all points of 
view before coming to a decision.

Parking and Traffic Assessment for proposed 2072 Mass Ave project

Dear Honorable Mayor, Councillors, and Director Barr,

I would like to thank Mr. Korb for the independent parking and traffic assessment conducted by Vanasse & 
Associates (V&A) for the proposed 2072 Mass Ave (2072) 100% affordable housing project (AH project) at the 
southwest corner of Mass Ave and Walden street (intersection). This is an impressive, well conducted study 
that was made public in perfect timing to my request for a comprehensive parking study around 78 Porter Road 
Apartments (appended below), also an AH project.

I am sure V&A followed the City’s guidelines for such a study, but it has several flaws and it didn’t go far 
enough.
I am not a parking or traffic expert by any means but offering my comments as a retired system 
engineer and a long-time resident of North Cambridge.  

The most glaring flaw is that the effects of COVID-19 on parking and traffic were not factored in. I live on 
Norris Street and the normal, pre-COVID-19, morning rush hour traffic heading into Porter Square and beyond 
regularly backed up to Norris Street making it very difficult to exit the street to get onto Mass Ave in either 
direction. The reverse was true in the evening on the northbound side heading towards Alewife Brook 
Parkway compounded by two traffic lights separated only by a block at Cameron Ave and Cedar Street 
intersections. And there were hardly any parking spaces available on Norris Street after 6 PM. But since 
COVID-19 shut-down began, there have been plenty of parking spaces available and I hardly have to wait to 
make the turn onto Mass Ave, just enough time to come to full stop and observe the oncoming traffic.

The second flaw is that the study was not done from the point of view of residents in the neighborhood nor did 
it consider the effect of the business establishments of the neighborhood. It is impressive that V&A surveyed 
parking availability within a quarter-mile, 1320 feet, radius. That is almost 4 football-field lengths, including the 
end zones! Can you imagine yourself circling around to find a parking space and then trudging home in a 
pouring rain or blinding snowstorm that far? Mr. Korb stated that the proposed 2014 AH Project was planned 
with family in mind. Can you imagine dragging your child even half that distance with groceries? When you 
purchased your house, I am sure your expectation was to be able to park on your block if you didn’t have a 
driveway.

The meter and unrestricted parking spaces around the project will be taken up by the customers of the existing 
businesses as well as the proposed 1040 square feet on-site ground floor retail during the business 
hours. The stay-at-home parents or caregivers of children/elderly, let alone the customers of the proposed 
retail space, will have a hard time finding parking spaces during these hours.

Another example of this flaw is that the study was conducted for just one weekday, namely Tues, ignoring the 
bustling social activities around that neighborhood on weekends starting from Fri evening. 

The traffic study didn’t go far enough in only considering the estimated trip generated by the project. The study 
should have considered the road configuration at that intersection and the impact of the project on the traffic 
flow. Walden Street at the intersection is a 3-lane road; one westbound lane and two eastbound lanes with

The study should also have counted the current traffic volume at the intersection and counted the number and 
duration of cars waiting to make turns either onto Mass Ave from Walden Street or vice versa during the peak 
commuting hours. This could have been done easily by using strategically placed traffic counters. These 
counts should then have been extrapolated into normal, pre-COVID estimates to be used in assessing the 
impact of the new vehicle traffic. Furthermore, the study should have addressed the issue of bicycle traffic and 
pedestrian foot traffic at this very busy intersection for people trying to get to Porter Square T station or to their 
destinations. Finally, the study should have assessed the social issue I mentioned above. When we return to 
“normal” after COVID-19, I envision a vibrant neighborhood with area restaurants and other businesses 
running at full capacity creating a heavy congestion at this intersection during peak social gathering times.

I beg you to consider my noted flaws and shortcomings of the parking and traffic assessment for the proposed 
2072 AH project and address them in the parking study around Porter Road/ /Regent Street loop I have 
requested. Going one step further, I beg you to update the parking and traffic assessment guidelines for future 
developments to include but not limited to:

Conduct community outreach meeting with neighborhood residents to assess their current 

  Employ traffic counters to analyze current traffic volume and rate
  Factor in road configuration and commercial establishments in the neighborhood
  Reduce the parking survey to an eighth-mile (660 feet) radius
Conduct the parking survey for at least two days, one weekday and one weekend (starting from Fri 

1)
concerns with parking and traffic in their neighborhood
2)
3)
4)
5)
evening)
6)
its mitigation plan in the transportation demand management plan

  Include any special situation in that neighborhood (playground, church, school for example) and 

I am more than willing to discuss this further with you and volunteer to work with you in any way I can.

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully yours,

Young Kim

Subject: 100% Affordable Housing and Parking

Dear Honorable Mayor, Councillors, and Director Barr,

I trust you and all your loved ones are safe and healthy during this unprecedented pandemic. I want to thank you for 
your leadership in keeping all the Cantabrigians safe during these trying times.

Now that the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Amendment (the Amendment) has been adopted, I would like to bring 
to your attention a golden opportunity to prove (or disprove as case may be) couple of the arguments the proponents 
of the Amendment used in justifying no/limited parking spaces at these 100% affordable housing developments 
(developments):

1) tenants of these developments will be relying on public transit as they will be near public transit hubs such as Porter 
Square

2) City's stated goal is to reduce car ownership (target set in 2014 was about 0.8 cars per household by end of this year, 
a reduction of the ratio of cars owned by 15 percent from 1990 levels 
(https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/18/cambridge-wanted-big-drop-car-ownership-that-hasn-exactly-
happened/sBu3TbWIBQLi5Nlo00L6AM/story.html))

These arguments have also been used for large development projects in requesting special permits to waive the 
parking requirements.

It came to my attention that 78 Porter Road, which to my best knowledge is a 100% affordable development, is 
currently undergoing renovation and is empty. I am writing to urge you to conduct a comprehensive, around the clock 
parking study during different days of a week for Porter Road/Regent Street loop while 78 Porter Road is empty and 
repeat the study once the renovation is completed and the building is fully occupied to measure the true impact of 
100% affordable housing with no parking spaces. Matter of fact, this would establish a parking requirement baseline 
for any large new development near public transit. Opportunities like this will be very hard to come by and I beg the 
City and Capstone/Hope to take advantage to prove that indeed one parking space/dwelling unit is no longer 
necessary.

Parking and Traffic Assessment - Proposed Residential Development 
2072 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts

RE: 

 
 
Vanasse & Associates, Inc. (VAI) has completed a Parking and Traffic Assessment of a proposed 49-unit 
100% affordable residential development with 1,040 square feet (sf) or ground floor retail to be located at 
2072  Massachusetts  Avenue  in  Cambridge,  Massachusetts  (Project).    Two  short-term  drop-off/pick-up 
spaces are proposed on-site. Contained within this memorandum is a parking supply and demand analysis 
within a quarter mile radius of site, estimated trip generation by mode split and a recommended a Travel 
Demand Management plan (TDM) for the proposed project. 
 
 
PARKING SUPPLY AND DEMAND ANALYSIS 
 
A comprehensive field inventory of the existing parking supply within approximately a quarter-mile radius 
of the Project was conducted in September 2020.  Figure 1 depicts the study area.  The field inventory 
consisted of on-street parking by quantity and type (handicapped, permit only and regulations). The study 
area  was  subdivided  into  twenty-eight  (28)  parking  zones  in  order  to  identify  parking  trends  occurring 
within the study area. Figure 2 identifies the parking regulations and number of parking spaces (1,145) in 
the  area.    Figure  3  depicts  the  residential  permit  parking  spaces,  handicap  spaces,  and  spaces  with  no 
regulations which total 985 of the 1,145 spaces. 
 
In order to determine the availability of parking spaces, a parking demand survey was conducted during a 
typical weekday (Tuesday September 22, 2020). The parking observations were conducted every 2 hours 
from 10:00 AM to 10:00 PM.  Table 1 and Figure 4 summarize the parking demand observations for the 
available resident parking.  
 
As shown in Table 1 and Figure 4 the peak demand occurs at 8:00 PM when 318 spaces were vacant. The 
Project has proposed only 3 handicap spaces on-site and all other parking will be on-street. By not 
providing parking, the Project impact will be minimized as auto ownership will be discouraged.  Auto 
ownership is expected at 0.50 vehicles per unit or 25 vehicles.  Zoning requires one space per unit. 
Typical residential peak parking occurs at 10:00 PM and after, when most residents are home for the night 
on weekdays.  Based upon the parking analysis, there is more than adequate on-street parking to 
accommodate the Project.

PROPOSED SITE TRIP GENERATION 
 
Traffic volumes expected to be generated by the Project were determined by using the ITE Trip Generation1 
manual and utilized Land Use Code (LUC 221), Multifamily Housing (Mid-Rise) and LUC 820, Shopping 
Center.  It should be noted that the project is proposing affordable housing units which have lower vehicle 
trip rates than market rate units therefore the actual trip increase due to the development will be less than 
what is estimated by LUC 221. In addition, it is expected that a significant portion of the residents of the 
Project will utilize alternative modes of transportation other than automobiles.  Based upon the U.S. Census   
and 2018 American Community Survey data for Census Tract 3547, the tract in which the Project is located, 
the mode split characteristics of the Project are estimated as follows: 32 percent automobile trips; 43 percent 
transit; 10 percent walk; 6 percent bicycle, and 9 percent other trips.   
 
The Project trip generation by mode is summarized in Table 2. 

 

As can be seen in Table 2, the Project is expected to generate approximately 98 vehicle trips on an average 
weekday (49 entering/49 exiting), with approximately 6 vehicle trips (2 entering/4 exiting) expected during 
the  weekday  morning  peak-hour.    During  the  weekday  evening  peak  hour,  the  Project  is  expected  to 
generate approximately 9 new vehicle trips (5 entering/4 exiting).

TRANSPORTATION DEMAND MANAGEMENT (TDM) 
 
Reducing the amount of traffic generated by the Project is an important component of the development 
plan.    The  goal  of  the  TDM  plan  is  to  reduce  the  use  of  Single  Occupant  Vehicles  by  encouraging 
car/vanpooling, bicycle commuting, the use of public transportation and pedestrian travel.  The following 
measures will be implemented as a part of the proposed project management team in an effort to reduce the 
number of vehicle trips generated: 
 

In order to encourage the use of public transportation, the property management team will make 
available  public  transportation  schedules,  which  will  be  posted  in  a  centralized  location  for 
residents. 

In  order  to  encourage  car/vanpooling,  the  property  management  team  will  coordinate  with 
MassRIDES and the Charles River Transportation Management Association (CRTMA) to identify 
car/vanpool  resources  that  may  be  available  to  residents.    This  information  will  be  posted  in  a 
centralized location. 

•  The property management team will investigate joining the CRTMA. The CRTMA could provide 

a ridematching program among the residents. 

•  The  property  management  team  will  provide  information  on  available  pedestrian  and  bicycle 
facilities in the vicinity of the project site.  This information will be posted in a centralized location.  

•  Bicycle racks and a bicycle “Fix-it” station will be provided on-site. 

•  Annually, upon initial move-in and lease renewal, residents will be offered the choice of: (1) annual 
Bluebikes membership (including one-time discounted helmet through bluebikes), (2) $90 credit 
for 
and/or 
(4) 3-month Student or Senior Monthly LinkPass. This will be provided PER RESIDENT (not per 
household) on an annual basis. 

adult  MBTA  Monthly  LinkPass, 

(3)  1-month 

service;

ride 

The above strategies will encourage non-auto travel by the residents.   

 
SUMMARY 
 
In summary, a detailed parking survey was completed in the area of the Project and based upon this data it 
can be concluded that there is more than sufficient availability of on-street parking to accommodate the 
Project.  The Project proponent is committed to implementing a Travel Demand Management plan which 
promotes alternatives modes of transportation and will minimize the Project’s impact on available on-street 
parking and traffic in the area.

Dear Mr. Clerk,

      

  

re: Curb Cut Application
    10 Acorn Park Drive

Please accept the attached filing as supplemental information related to the above 

captioned curb cut application.  The application first appeared on the City Council’s 
September 14 agenda.  Councillor Zondervan exercised his Charter Right at that time and 
the application has remained on the Table on the agenda for two subsequent meetings.

As a result of recent conversations with Michael Brandon, Clerk of the North 

Cambridge Stabilization Committee, and Councillor Zondervan,  it was recently 
discovered that the plan that is contained in the pending application is in fact not the 
current plan.  The original plan filed with the application was modified in response to 
comments received from the Traffic Department and DPW.  That modified plan was 
reviewed and approved by both the Traffic Department and DPW.

Attached hereto is the correct modified plan as well as email verification from 

both DPW and TP & T that this is the plan that they approved when reviewing the curb 
cut application.

Bulfinch Companies is grateful to Mr. Brandon for alerting them to the 

discrepancy between the modified plan and the plan contained in the pending application.  
Councillor Zondervan’s assistance in facilitating a resolution of this issue is also 
appreciated.

I would request that this communication and the attachments be placed on the 

Application and Petitions section of the City Council’s October 19th Agenda.  Thank you 
for your attention to this matter.

cc: Michael Brandon, Clerk of the
     North Cambridge Stabilization Committee

Very truly yours,

James J. Rafferty

Masks in residential buildings

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Councilors,

I am concerned that the city administration changed its mask requirements in common areas of residential buildings. I 
live at the Atmark Apartment complex. The management has taken down all signs in regards to social distancing and 
mask wearing. Residents and visitors are often not wearing masks even in the elevators and mailrooms.

Cambridge does not follow the Governor in every COVID 19 policy. Why this one? Do you have a graphic the 
management company could use? (If they could be persuaded to do so.)

Mask wearing was followed much better before the city relaxed the requirements for the summer and is lax now in my 
building. I try to avoid common areas but I do have to leave my apartment sometimes. 

Thanks for your consideration and stay healthy and safe.

Sincerely,

Kathy Watkins

Hello,

Kavish Gandhi <kmbrgandhi@gmail.com>
Thursday, October 15, 2020 9:29 PM
Clerk
Support for CM #13, PO#10

I just wanted to email to register my thanks for CM#13, and support for PO#10 on next week's city council agenda. It is 
so, so important during this time that the most vulnerable among us do not end up on the streets. We must bear the 
horrible economic burdens of this pandemic collectively, and not shift this burden onto the most vulnerable, as it is so
often is, and preventing evictions is one small piece of this. I fully support PO#10, to potentially make this even 
stronger, and make sure that not only will evictions be enforced, but even prevented. A survey in Milwaukee showed 
that informal evictions may occur at almost twice the rate of formal evictions, so it is key that both tenants are informed 
as their rights, as Cambridge is already doing an admirable job of, and Cambridge takes active steps to make sure that 
these informal evictions do not happen for any reason.  

I also want to use this opportunity to reiterate that, in addition to preventing evictions, I believe that we must continue 
to recognize that rent burdenship and homelessness are political choices that we collectively make and maintain, and 
we need to have the political will to not continue to treat these as anywhere near the status quo.

Thank you so much,
Kavish Gandhi, 115 Hampshire St #4

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Carlone, Councillor 
McGovern, Councillor Nolan, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, 
Councillor Toomey, and Councillor Zondervan: 
 
As residents and owners of the property at 12 Sciarappa Street and owners of 
the property at 31 Winter Street, we are writing to express our support for the 
East Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District study.  Our family has deep 
roots in East Cambridge, and our 12 Sciarappa Street home has been in our 
family since approximately 1917.  We value our membership in this diverse and 
inclusive Cambridge community.  We want to ensure that this diversity and 
inclusiveness is able to continue as cornerstones of the community in years to 
come.  There is substantial evidence that the designation as a conservation 
district does not result in increased property values or rental costs. In fact, one 
may reasonably argue that it is the continued unfettered construction of 
oversized and out of scale developments that is systematically destroying the 
fabric, diversity, and affordability of the neighborhood and, further, is negatively 
impacting the quality of life for all East Cambridge residents, whether one is an 
owner or a renter. Please support the Cambridge Historical Commission in 
continuing the East Cambridge study process in the same fair and equitable 
manner that has been afforded to other Cambridge neighborhoods and 
communities over the years.  
 
We thank you for your consideration. 
 
 
Sincerely, 
Anna Spera  
Jean Spera

POR NCD Study
20201019_POR_NCD.pdf

To the Council, the City manager and Clerk.

IN re: POR#9 Housing Impact study of NCDs

  Please refuse, or re write this order.

  The request of a Housing Impact study of a study, which states in its inception to study the impact of housing 

during such study period sounds as redundant and alliterative as the tone of this sentence.

CHC among the many services it provides the administration of the city, includes balancing the public benefit of 

housing in their reviews. Is this perhaps a request more suited, and legitimate, for other city departments?

  Neighborhood Conservation Districts add value to the city as they promote smart, consistent and evolving 
development; they promote and foster community involvement in deciding the future of the city they live in by creating 
opportunities, even to renters to get an active voice. A committee member currently serving is purposefully a renter to 
offer the important insight of their experience.

What raises my civic concerns about this policing attitude and its discretionary application of this review, while 

welcomed should it become the new standard to bear, it follows an increased selective scrutiny of certain developments 
over others, like asking financials of some and not of other projects, or provide lackluster data on some plans and 
extensive requests of others. 

Protected bike lanes, Affordable Housing, Open space programming, new schools and libraries, Commercial and 
Academic development, all these things carry an impact on the cost of housing as they implicitly improve the quality of 
living and working in Cambridge, why are these, and many more, projects not vetted against the same standard?

  If the intent of this council is to derail a civic process, please find courage in your honesty, and claim that for you 

the discourse is over before it should even start.

I urge you to oppose this POR as written and perhaps offer a solution that embeds, or reaffirms, the same noble 

sentiment into all the codes of review, along with traffic, transportation, infrastructure, power load, and not left to the 
whims of the transient chairs of the council or the administration.

  Thankful, but alarmed.

Conservation Districts, Rent Increases, and related issues (P.O. before Council on 
Monday)
Op Ed conservation districts 10.16.20-final.a  .docx

Honorable City Council Members,

Please find attached my letter and study (an extracted version of which appears as an Open Letter to City Council titled 
“Does Housing Really Become Less Affordable Within Conservation Districts - Actually No”  that appeared last 
night in Cambridge Day. This Open Letter addresses the core question behind Policy Order-9 that falsely claims property 
values and rental rates increase in Neighborhood Conservation Districts, based on a local political blogger’s post that 
misrepresents or falsifies the cited studies (which actually state the opposite of what he claims). 

I would be happy to share with you (on a one-by-one basis) the data I have on property value increases from 2015 to 
present for your own residence, but decided not to include any Councillor’s  name, address, or other more precise data 
because of the public nature of this study and op ed. I also chose to use the City Council data specifically as a core “study
group” because as a group Council members are a self-delimited entity, broadly representative geographically, and 
includes both city renters and property owners. 

With respect to other facets of this Policy Order that are problematic, please note that:

CHC study meetings, including the East Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee are, 
like City Council, Planning Board, BZA, and CHC meetings themselves, ALREADY are open to the general public –
now by zoom – everyone can join in and sign up to speak.

An earlier Cambridge City Council P.O. ALREADY requires that the city notify renters of potential changes in 
abutting properties.
The present proposed Policy Order requests  the additional  burden of further study to determine the impact of 
Conservation Districts on City "housing affordability." Information regarding whether Conservation Districts 
increase rents is ALREADY available in the attached study. This study also makes clear that Conservation Districts 
in Cambridge and elsewhere in the country do NOT increase property values or rental rates. It identifies other 
factors such as proximity to commercial districts or large developments as the primary cause of those increases.

• We have seen this maneuver before. If the proposed study outlined in the Policy Order is intended as a request 
that CDD invite Affordable Housing developers to opine on whether Conservation Districts make their projects 
more expensive to build here due to their need to demolish or restore historic buildings, we will likely witness a 
repeat of the fate of our mature tree canopy under the AHO. Just as trees were sacrificed for the AHO, historic 
preservation would also be cut down to make way for a self-interested definition of housing affordability 
articulated by Affordable Housing developers.  

•

As noted in the Washington State overview of this issue: “Historic Preservation and Sustainability are natural 
partners. Preservation and reuse of historic buildings reduces resource and material consumption, puts less 
waste in landfills, and consumes less energy than demolishing buildings and constructing new ones.” SOURCE

•

Finally, I am not sure whether, under Plan E, City Council is allowed to be interfering so directly with the 
workings of a city commission (here the Cambridge Historic Commission), but this Policy Order seems to go 
against this longstanding policy, or at least gives the appearances thereof. As I note in my longer letter, this also 
goes against core tenets of the recently enacted Envision Plan.

4.17.a

In short, I hope there will be a means to remove P.O. 9 from a vote Monday tonight, and simply allow the CHC process to 
play out as intended, following its recent decision to reconvene the study committee after COVID.  Please let the 
residents of this proposed Conservation District work through the issues themselves, come to a decision, and then bring 
that decision to City Council for a vote when they have completed the work that has been set before them. You will have 
a chance to vote on this then – or if you want further study at that point, that also can be requested when it comes 
before you.

Cordially,
Suzanne Preston Blier

Do Conservation Districts Make Housing Less Affordable?  

 
 
An Open Letter to City Council: 

On October 19 the Cambridge City Council will consider a Policy Order addressing Cambridge 
Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCD) and their possible impacts on property values. This Policy 
Order is largely based on a September 10, 2020 Cambridge Chronicle Op Ed, itself a reprise of a Feb. 27, 
2020 blogpost by a local political activist, claiming that “Conservation Districts Make Housing Less 
Affordable.” However, an objective real estate data review, reveals not only the Cambridge 
Neighborhood Conservation Districts have not increased property values or rents, but also that, on 
average, increases in these Districts are consistently lower than those in areas outside these Districts. 
Moreover, in analyzing both Cambridge data and the actual studies this blogger cites, alongside others, 
the presented conclusions are readily debunked. The Council should not be in the business of opposing 
neighborhood preservation efforts particularly through efforts whose premises are so obviously flawed 
and tendentious. 

Exploring the Issue with facts for Cambridge 

A review of Cambridge real estate data shows that values are NOT going up disproportionately in 
Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCD). We can do this by comparing Cambridge rents in 
Conservation District neighborhoods and NON-Conservation District neighborhoods by using sources 
like Area Vibes.1 Here we learn that:2 

•  East Cambridge (NOT a Conservation District): rental rates are 12% higher than the 

average Cambridge rents and property values are 11% lower than the Cambridge average. This 
data was compiled largely before the study group was started, so it would not be impacted by it.  
•  Mid Cambridge (largely comprising a Conservation District): average rents are 12% lower than 

the Cambridge average and property values are 35% lower. 

•  Area Nine (including Avon Hill Conservation District): rents are equal to the Cambridge average 

and property values are 6% higher. 

 
Cambridge City Council Properties Provide Further Insight 

•  Our City Councillors' own experiences offer a useful lens through which to view these patterns.3 
Councillors in Conservation Districts have seen more moderate rent and property value increases 
than those in unprotected areas of the city. This data is particularly insightful for this reason: three 
are renters. The other six own their own homes. Of the nine Councillors (renters and non-renters), 
two live in Neighborhood Conservation Districts (both Mid-Cambridge); The neighborhoods 
where the remaining Councillors reside represent a cross-section of residential areas: 
Neighborhood 9; Riverside; Observatory Hill/West Cambridge; Cambridgeport; the Port; East 
Cambridge; and Wellington-Harrington. 
 

•  How have these specific Cambridge property values (for both owned and rented homes) changed 
between 2015 and today for Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCDs)? Data compiled by 
Redfin.com shows that on average Councillors living in or adjacent to Conservation Districts 
show a stunning 9.46% LOWER average housing value increase than those Councillors NOT 
living in Conservation Districts. Specifically, NCD Councillor properties from 2015 to today 
show an average 36.01% property value increase. 4 In contrast, non-NCD Councillors’ properties 
had an average 45.47% property value increase since 2015.

•  The reasons are important, but first, let’s examine 2015 to present data for Councillors’ properties 
both within Neighborhood Conservation Districts (NCDs - and adjacent) and those in non-NCDs: 
The NCD residing group includes the following percentage increases: 35.69%; 37.50%*, and 
34.93%* (condo value increase); For non-NCD dwelling Councillors, the results are significantly 
higher: 39.46%; 43.38%; 39.46%; 47.17%; and 57.89%.  

•  Cambridge Renter data confirm these conclusions: One Councillor’s rental home saw a likely 
29.69% rent increase since 2015; This seems about average. CDD reports a 36% increase 
in the rent of a single bedroom apartment and a 28% increase in two-bedroom apartment rents 
from January 2010 to August 2016, not accounting for inflation.5 These data can be compared 
with a city-supported mixed income rental housing for one person in a building that saw c.18% 
rent increase in a 2-bedroom apartment there. A Councillor living in city supported housing faces 
far less severe rental price increases. This large multi-unit city-owned property sold in 2005 for 
$2.247 million; today’s assessed value is $2.110 million, which shows that these city-owned 
properties also do not increase land values (and drive up housing prices) in the same way that 
other housing projects do. This fact alone behooves Cambridge to build more housing on city 
lands and acquire city properties for this specific purpose. The far lower valuation increases on 
city-owned property is consistent with urban planner, Patrick Condon’s recommendations in 
Smart Cities as a key means to keep property values low enough so that long term residents can 
afford to continue to live here.6 

 
What drives up costs if conservation districts are not responsible for rising rents and increasing property 
values? Specifically, in East Cambridge, where increases have been the most dramatic, what appears to 
matter is its proximity to Kendall Square biotech developments (as signaled in the sizable value increases 
of the two nearest Councillors’ property values). Most renovation costs, for their part, are driven up 
through the updating of kitchens and bathrooms, not through work on the exterior. Conservation District 
guidelines only address the facades visible from a public way and would not be a factor unless one wished 
to make a change. Moreover, exceptions are made for financial burden and decisions can be appealed.  

The Data Reassessed 

The writer incorrectly claims that “Conservation Districts Make Housing Less Affordable” in both his 
Feb. 27 blogpost and September 10 Op Ed reprise. In the original post he cites 12 preservation studies. All 
of these on closer examination show the opposite of what he asserts as can be seen in four of the studies 
he cites:  

•  The  New York City study on historic districts finds “no change in reported rents and little 

evidence of racial turnover in neighborhoods.”  

•  The Memphis (Tennessee) study on historic districts concludes there is “not sufficient evidence to 
conclude that districting itself causes higher prices or greater price appreciation.” For national 
contexts the same study notes that historic designation may have either neutral or beneficial 
impacts on property values depending on contexts. 
In Connecticut, historic districts least impacted by increased values are those “where there are 
significant commercial and multifamily structures” (a finding that complements East Cambridge)  

• 

•  Tucson (Arizona) Historic Districts “insulate property values from wild swings in the housing 

market, including downturns and ‘bubbles’ caused by real estate speculation.” Also 
“neighborhoods with stable values do not offer opportunities for ‘flipping’ (at a high profit 
margin). Historic district designation reduces the uncertainty facing the buyer regarding the 
future value of the investment.

The eight other cited studies that formed this blogger’s study include data and conclusions that are 
similarly the opposite of his claims:7 1) Central States (Ohio etc.) – historic districts only and key other 
variables omitted including the import of historic districts in revitalizing rust-belt cities; 2) Dallas (Texas) 
addresses only the outlying suburban conservation districts; and highlights MORE impactful factors, e.g. 
proximity to downtown, rail, lakes & scale of home; 3) Johnson City (Tennessee) - an historic district; 
promotion of this for inner city fiscal restoration; 4) Oklahoma – National Registry Sites only; and 
POSITIVE economic impacts (rehabilitation jobs, local income, goods, services, and heritage tourism); 5)  
Philadelphia - only national registry sites; (heightened value before designation; 6) South Carolina - 
historic properties and districts only; tourism import and related financials; 7) U.S. generally: only 
National Registry sites with prior historic or cultural value; 8) Utah – National Registry and Historic 
districts only; real benefits of $717 million from visitors; $35 million from Federal Rehabilitation Tax 
Credit investments. 
 
Going still further afield, a 2012 study focused on Conservation Districts Across Great Britain concludes  
in the same way, namely  (p.5) that any differential is “generally small when controlling for other factors” 
and the results are higher for large “suburban” districts and “significantly lower” for “at risk” (urban) 
settings. More important are single family vs multi-family homes, proximity to key destinations (London) 
and if site is a “heritage” one or “at risk.” They conclude that ‘district designation does not exhibit a 
statistically significant impact on property prices inside a conservation area when comparing the trend to 
carefully selected properties outside the newly designated areas.” And, whereas in the short-term, 
“designation has a neutral effect on property price,” in the longer term, one sees “the even broader 
potential benefits to potential visitors, future generations and heritage.” We could add other broad-based 
studies showing the critical environmental importance of building reuse and preservation, noting the 
carbon equivalencies for existing building reuse versus new construction. 
 
 
A Sloppy and Tendentious Argument and Why it is So Misleading 

Cambridge-specific data conclusions are consistent with and supported by the very studies cited in the 
blog. Simply put, real estate values do not go up disproportionately within a conservation district.  Why 
the blog ignores the data and summary conclusions (or misrepresent their findings) to create a counter-
narrative, is not clear. What we do know is that the debate about Neighborhood Conservation Districts is 
intended to be a distraction. By focusing on the possibility of increased renovation costs for homeowners, 
the objective is to divert attention away from commercial development projects. As one opponent of the 
Conservation District study noted on a neighborhood list serve: 

“East Cambridge’s land represents opportunity….because of its location, your neighborhood 
should not be able to continue to exist as is….East Cambridge [has been described] ‘as a once-
peaceful backwater.’  I understand why people like it that way. Who wouldn’t like to live in a 
quiet charming town…. But I think more people should have those same opportunities. That 
means East Cambridge has to change.” 
 

Yet East Cambridge has always changed. The topography long has enjoyed a shoreline with the Charles 
and has quick access to Boston. East Cambridge historically was and is the cash cow for the rest of 
Cambridge and was a major industrial engine in the region. Although a great deal of the industrial 
infrastructure of East Cambridge has been lost, much of the architectural fabric has been preserved. We 
should not now destroy the homes of current residents and sacrifice the interests of future generations 
simply because this part of the city represents an “opportunity” for someone else.

Conclusions: How Could the Earlier “Study” have been so Wrong?  
 
The question is an important one. Part of the issue may be lack of expertise in the fields of preservation, 
planning and economics but it may also reflect a willingness to bend the facts to fit a political agenda 
aimed at promoting increased commercial development in East Cambridge, under the false flag of renter 
cost concerns. In short, it is the underlying motives that in part have led to this misguided “study” under 
the false assumption that commercial development is inconsistent with a neighborhood conservation 
district.  
 
Councillors: Flawed and downright deceptive arguments should not be the basis for city policy under any 
circumstances, and certainly should not be allowed to chip away at policies that have protected our civic 
fabric and made the city a more humane place for generations  Does requiring the city to do an impact 
study for potential Conservation Districts mean that the city should be required to do similar studies 
(economic, environmental, traffic and other) for large commercial developments and housing projects, 
including projects for the recent AHO up-zoning? Consistency is important.  
  
Honorable Councillors: Please recognize the attempt to mislead here. Vote no and allow the East 
Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation study to proceed as planned without additional obstruction. You 
will be able to vote again on this once the study is complete and a determination sought. In short, the false 
data, analysis, and narrative in this blog needs to be recognized for what it is -an effort to impact policy.  
This kind of effort goes against the stated goals of the city’s Envision's Urban Form section to “Maintain 
the existing patterns of the city where they are well-established, and advance the city’s values through a 
mix of preservation and complementary infill development.”  
 

Four Key takeaways 

•  Do conservation districts in Cambridge increase property values? No. 

•  Do conservation districts in Cambridge increase rents? No. 

•  How about elsewhere in the United States and United Kingdom? No. 

•  Overall everyone’s housing prices go up because of proximity to large developments and 

commercial areas, as well as people moving here with out-of-scale salaries, willing to pay higher 
prices. 

 

 

 

 
 

 

1 Overall the average Cambridge rent prices have gone down 11.11% since Oct 2019. 
 
2 On possible COVID factors: The neighborhood and Councillor home data go from 2015 to today (2020) 
so the latter differentials would include COVID. Housing prices in Cambridge have not been heavily 
impacted by COVID – nor were they in 2008. Analysis of recent real estate sales by a local Realtor I 
consulted reveals that “the positive rate appreciation has slowed for single family homes, but they are still 
3% above October 2019 prices; both condos and multi-families have seen sales decrease without

significant loss in value, thus far, but with current inventory at a historically high level, coupled with 
demand well below normal, appreciation impacts will only become apparent in the coming months.” 
 
3  Needless to say, property values vary significantly across the city, based on a range of factors from size 
of the property and home, to proximity to commercial areas and other factors.  
 
4 One Councillor lives directly adjacent to a Conservation District (Avon Hill). Since some Historic 
District studies suggest that properties adjacent to these Districts are impacted by proximity. I have 
included his property with Conservation Districts. Without this inclusion, the NCD value rate increase 
from 2015 to today would be 36.60%. As a multi-family property this also may be reflected in the value. 
 
5 It is interesting to note that at least three City Councillors are landlords– leasing units in their own 
homes; like many other small city landlords they probably keep their leases well below market rate.  
 
6 Patrick Condon also points out that the premise of Supply/Demand simply does not work for urban settings such as 
this; hence, removing Conservation District limitations to build large residential developments will only drive up 
property values, forcing out local residents - unless such projects are built on city-owned land.  
 
7 The City Council Policy Order cites specifically to the Oklahoma and Dallas studies.

Making Room for Quantitative Literacy in Historic Preservation: Local Historic 
District Designation and Property Values as a Case Study 
District Designation and Property Values as a Case Study 

Abstract 
Abstract 
This thesis calls for a twofold shift in the training in and practice of historic preservation: first, increased 
data literacy and use of data in the discipline, and second, for a higher degree of skepticism about the 
implications of data-driven findings. Even if the results of quantitative studies are less definitive in their 
findings than preservation advocates would like, these grey areas can serve a valuable purpose of forcing 
stakeholders to become more deeply engaged in why effects might be what they are, and how policy can 
intervene to achieve more desirable outcomes. Following a review of previous studies and their 
methodologies, this project looks to Philadelphia as a case study for the quantitative analysis of the 
association between local historic district designation and residential property values, exploring whether 
it is possible to develop a straightforward and meaningful methodology for assessing the economic 
impact of local historic district designation on residential property values. Transaction prices serve as the 
dependent variable in three separate models, each corresponding to a locally designated historic district 
and a similar but undesignated neighborhood. Limitations are explored in detail, and future directions for 
study are outlined in order to offer insight to others who might undertake similar work going forward.

INTRODUCTION 

As Jennifer Most writes in “The Case for Data Analytics in Preservation Education and 

Practice,” preservationists produce quantitative studies “largely in a reactive way, 

defending themselves against specific claims or defending the field more broadly.”1 

Because so much preservation work is reactive, and because methodological approaches 

are often glossed over in favor of accessibility, existing quantitatively-oriented 

preservation studies remain open to criticism and potential refutation. Academic historic 

preservation programs have been slow to establish data analysis as a core skill, alongside 

more typically taught methods like historical research, architectural survey, or building 

recording techniques.2 In fact, a study that Most conducted on the inclusion of data and 

spatial analysis courses within historic preservation programs in the U.S. found that only 

three of the thirty programs surveyed offered such material within a broader course in a 

historic preservation department during the 2017-2018 academic year, and few others 

required students to take a course in quantitative methods or spatial analysis taught 

elsewhere in a university.3 

Instead of leaving methodological approaches out of reports to make results more 

accessible to audiences unfamiliar with quantitative methods, this thesis proposes that the 

field of historic preservation work toward increased comfort with and transparency 

around data and quantitative approaches. By following open data trends, in which

academic departments) have become more commonplace as electives in historic preservation programs.

datasets (and the code used in quantitative models) are made publicly available to others 

who may want to modify, verify, or reproduce results, preservationists can support one 

another’s work and better integrate historic preservation with allied fields. That is not to 

say that reports can or should sacrifice qualitative approaches and policy discussion in 

favor of data, but rather that a variety of approaches need to be made available to offer a 

more complete understanding of preservation policy issues and outcomes. For this to 

happen, not only must more data be collected, but preservation planners must be able to 

work with existing and new datasets, and to be able to critically engage with each other 

and with colleagues in adjacent fields. 

Even if the results of quantitative studies are less definitive in their findings than 

preservation advocates would like, these grey areas can serve a valuable purpose of 

forcing stakeholders to become more deeply engaged in why certain effects might be 

what they are, and how policy can intervene to achieve more desirable outcomes. An 

expectation for historic preservationists working in policy to have a grounding in 

quantitative methods would allow for deeper engagement with the work being done in 

adjacent fields. Data analysis can help answer the question of what, so that we can more 

deeply examine the why, how, and for whom. 

This thesis calls for a twofold shift in the training in and practice of historic 

preservation: first, increased data literacy and use of data in the discipline, and second, 

for a higher degree of skepticism about the implications of data-driven findings. While 

these goals may seem at odds with one another, a deeper level of engagement from within 

the field will set the stage for richer conversations and clearer advocacy goals.

Project Outline 

Following a review of previous studies and their methodologies, this project looks to 

Philadelphia as a case study for the quantitative analysis of the association between local 

historic district designation and residential property values.4 Before delving into the 

quantitative model itself, an overview of Philadelphia’s planning, development, 

preservation context offers background into conditions specific to the city, which has 

undergone substantial changes over the past twenty years both in its preservation culture 

and in more general planning and development trends. This context, which does not 

factor into the model itself, is necessary for understanding additional influences at play, 

including the limitations of the quantitative model presented in the subsequent section.  

Section 4 of this thesis explores whether it is possible to develop a straightforward 

and meaningful methodology for assessing the economic impact of local historic district 

designation on residential property values, using three pairs of neighborhoods in 

Philadelphia as case studies. Transaction prices serve as the models’ dependent variable, 

with location within a locally designated historic district as one of many predictors. After 

results of the models are presented, limitations are explored and future directions for 

study are outlined in order to offer insight to others who might undertake similar work 

going forward. 

 

4 Local historic districts, rather than national districts, were chosen for this analysis because they are less 
closely associated with the Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit program than are properties listed 
individually or as contributing to districts on the National Register of Historic Places. In Certified Local 
Governments (including Philadelphia), locally designated properties and contributing buildings in locally 
designated districts are also eligible for the Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit program, provided that they, 
like any other property receiving the tax credit, are income-generating. This distinction is one of many 
factors that complicates the use of quantitative methods to evaluate the impact of local historic district 
designation, particularly when attempting to generalize beyond a single municipality. The inclusion of only 
residential properties in the quantitative analysis helps narrow the scope of this project and allows for more 
of an apples to apples comparison than if all types of uses were included.

The final section of this thesis delves into potential policy implications, both of 

using quantitative models as an evaluation tool in the designation process, and of the 

potential for increased data literacy among preservation professionals. This portion of the 

project looks more holistically at economic impact beyond just rising property values, to 

examine how these effects may impact residents’ quality of life and neighborhood 

identity and stability, and what role historic preservation might play in ensuring sustained 

positive outcomes.

PREVIOUS STUDIES 

Economic impact studies of historic preservation often point to a “preservation 

premium,” claiming that historic districts are associated with higher property values than 

comparable neighborhoods. These studies allude to quantitative approaches but generally 

do not delve deeply into their methodologies. They typically highlight rising property 

values as an unequivocally positive outcome, without exploring how changes in property 

values within a historic district might impact residents within these areas or in other parts 

of the city. 

policy. 

These reports, often conducted as part of broader studies commissioned by 

national, state, and local historic preservation advocacy organizations, frequently gloss 

over their methodological approaches in favor of simplicity and the strength of the 

narrative. This thesis explores property values and local historic district designation as a 

case study into how greater nuance and increased transparency around methodological 

approaches and quantitative findings could be introduced into preservation planning and 

In the introduction to Preservation and the New Data Landscape, Erica Avrami 

frames the need for continued, rigorous study of the impacts that preservation can have on 

neighborhoods and communities: 

Because preservation is often at odds with better financed and politically 
empowered real estate development interests, studies on the subject are often 
reactive and geared toward rationalizing investment in heritage by defending the 
status quo. Despite half a century of local policy experience behind us, there is still 
much to learn about the positive and negative influence of preservation on the 
social and physical fabric of cities. A better understanding of that influence can

help policy meet contemporary needs more effectively and serve communities 
more justly.5 
 

In a 2011 report to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, Measuring the 

Economic Impacts of Historic Preservation, Donovan Rypkema, Caroline Cheong, and 

Randall Mason argue for consistent and rigorous data analysis across five major economic 

measures: jobs and household income, property values, heritage tourism, environmental 

measurements, and downtown revitalization. 

Impact assessments of historic preservation typically also acknowledge other 

aspects of value that are not purely economic – the recognition of these broader values 

forms the basis for “values-based preservation,” an approach that considers the social, 

heritage, environmental, and other values that are associated with a historic site.6 Indeed, 

the benefits of local district designation extend beyond the economic. Although the details 

of local designation vary greatly among municipalities, benefits can include a strengthened 

sense of place-based identity among district residents, improved perceptions on the part of 

other city residents, and the potential for more control by property owners over the built 

form of their neighborhoods (which can also be a problem, of course). These additional 

impacts, which are not measured in quantitative economic models, must remain at the 

center of discussions around historic designation – while a core section of this thesis is 

centered around statistical modeling, the results are not what matters so much as an 

understanding that this is a complex issue that cannot be fully captured by a mathematical 

equation. Nonetheless, the prevalence of quantitative models in discussions around both

local and national historic district designation (and more broadly, in policy advocacy) 

makes it worthwhile to delve more deeply into the topic. 

Studies that address the association between historic preservation and residential 

property values typically argue one or more of the following: 

-  Historic preservation is associated with increased property values. 

-  Historic preservation is associated with more stable property values. 

-  Historic preservation is associated with (or causes) gentrification or displacement. 

-  Historic preservation protects against gentrification or displacement.7 

In this context (and more generally), historic preservation is defined as the renovation or 

rehabilitation of formally designated historic structures, whether through the individual 

designation process or by way of their being identified as contributing buildings in a 

locally or nationally designated historic district.8 

Studies that claim that historic designation raises (or is associated with higher) 

property values generally argue that the prestige and security offered by designation – in 

the form of a guarantee that a neighborhood will be protected from out-of-scale or out-of-

character new development – will offer a “preservation premium.”9 While statistical 

approaches can indicate association between designation and property values or 

transaction prices, claims of causality must be substantiated through policy analysis. On 

 

7 See page 13 of this thesis for more information on why the dynamic of homeownership and rentership is 
not typically included explicitly in quantitative models, including in the ones in this document. 
8 Individually-designated buildings (on local, state, or national registers) are generally not studied using this 
type of quantitative approach, as they represent fewer data points (particularly when exclusively 
considering occupied residential properties), and they are more likely to represent “exceptional” examples 
of their type, whether for architectural excellence or by association with a particular individual or historical 
event.

the other side of this debate, those who find designation to be associated with lower 

property values or prices attribute this to the fact that local designation can restrict 

building uses, thereby preventing a property from realizing its highest and best use, 

particularly in cases where a building’s existing configuration is smaller in scale (or 

otherwise less profitable) than what zoning would allow. Additionally, some point to 

rising prices that may be associated with development restrictions.10 

Because local ordinances differ among cities with local historic district 

designations, these districts vary from one city to another. In cities (Philadelphia 

included) where property owners are required to submit plans to the local historical 

commission before performing work on a building’s exterior, critics of historic 

preservation argue that property owners are forced to invest substantially more money 

into renovations than they otherwise might.11 

Together, increased renovation costs and higher property values (along with the 

associated increases in property taxes) can contribute to displacement of low- and 

moderate-income residents, including property owners as well as tenants, who might see 

these costs passed on in the form of higher rental rates. While low-income property

that other potential uses of the property are foreclosed. The applicant has an affirmative obligation in good 
faith to attempt the sale of the property, to seek tenants for it, and to explore potential reuses for it.” While 
the owner’s personal finances are not a factor in claims of financial hardship, unnecessary hardship,

owners can benefit from increased property values if they choose to sell, additional 

studies are needed to better understand the extent to which these households remain in 

control of deciding when and if to sell, and where they move once they have sold their 

properties. Studies concerned with potential displacement or neighborhood-scale 

gentrification look at household movement, typically using markers of upward or 

downward moves to identify whether a household was able to take advantage of rising 

property values to move to a “better” neighborhood (defined by set parameters), or to 

build wealth.12 

In general, studies evaluating the potential association between historic district 

designation and property values tend to gloss over the policy implications of whatever 

relationship is found, instead focusing on quantitative findings that are framed as 

exclusively positive (or sometimes as exclusively negative). This approach does a 

disservice to preservation planners and policymakers, who could delve more deeply into 

precisely who benefits and who loses when property values change. In particular, the 

dynamic of renters versus homeowners is one that receives less attention than needed, 

especially when considering the financial incentives associated with the Federal 

Rehabilitation Tax Credit program, which is reserved for income-generating properties. 

 

Local Historic District Designation and Property Values 

Because studies of the economic impact of historic district designation treat property 

values and transaction prices somewhat interchangeably, this thesis will generally refer to

Residential Mobility in Philadelphia (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, December 2015).

the association between designation and property values, in line with the language that is 

more commonly used in the literature. It should be noted, however, that the approach in 

this thesis uses transaction prices as the dependent variable, not property value.13 

In Measuring the Economic Impacts of Historic Preservation, Rypkema, Cheong, 

and Mason advocate for annual evaluation of property values in a representative sample of 

communities, to establish a consistent approach for measuring the association between 

local historic districts and property value nationwide. They propose that a national real 

estate firm could undertake the research, and that property values in the selected 

communities could be reviewed annually, to establish baseline data over time.14 This 

proposal is both ambitious and likely unfeasible, as there is no mechanism for collecting 

consistent property data across municipalities in the United States. Next steps as given in 

the report would work toward “Identify[ing] a finite number of indicators that can be used 

to regularly, consistently, meaningfully, and credibly measure the economic impact of 

historic preservation over time,”15 through the following processes: 

1.  Identify and reach agreement with responsible parties to undertake the ongoing 

research and data collection for each of the recommended indicators. 

2.  In conjunction with the responsible parties, create a long-term research, evaluation, 

and reporting plan. 

3.  Establish baseline(s) for each of the recommended indicators. 

 

13 Since the City of Philadelphia instituted the actual value initiative in tax year 2014, assessments are 
meant to reflect the true market value of properties, although this has not been the case. See pages 30-32 of 
this thesis for a discussion of Philadelphia’s property assessment.

4.  Work with the identified parties to systematize data collection.16 

Looking more closely at property value as a measure, Measuring the Economic Impacts of 

Historic Preservation addresses the pros and cons of using transaction prices as a proxy 

for property value. Assessed property values offer a larger sample size than transaction 

prices (as all properties in a given municipality have an assessed value for tax purposes).17 

In order to account for variation in residential properties, assessed value per square foot of 

livable area is given as a possible dependent variable to be used in a model. The use of 

property assessment as a dependent variable introduces problems of its own, however, as 

the process can suffer from issues of inconsistency. 

An alternative approach using transaction prices can show what actual homebuyers 

are willing to pay at a given time. Measuring the Economic Impacts of Historic 

Preservation suggests the possibility of looking at changes in individual properties’ sales 

prices over time (given a sufficiently long study period) to begin to understand whether a 

property in a local or national historic district might appreciate at a faster or slower rate 

than a similar property elsewhere in the same city.18 The Economic Benefits of Historic 

Preservation Activities in Pennsylvania does just that, using three local historic districts 

throughout the Commonwealth as case studies. 

 

Hedonic Regression 

A hedonic regression (or hedonic pricing) approach aims to isolate the effects of 

individual characteristics (given as predictor variables) on the dependent variable – in this

case, property value or transaction price. This approach, which is described in greater 

detail on pages 43-47 in Section 4 of this thesis, offers the ability to separate various 

predictor variables, like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, building condition, and 

presence or absence of a garage, theoretically making it possible to isolate the effect of 

historic designation by including that as a variable.19 This approach is the one used in the 

2011 Economic Benefits of Historic Preservation Activities in Pennsylvania report and 

many others, and it forms the framework for the quantitative approach taken in this thesis. 

However, this approach assumes that it is possible to account for all variables that 

contribute to property value or transaction price, when limitations in data availability 

make this impossible. 

In discussing the strengths of hedonic regression, Measuring the Economic 

Impacts of Historic Preservation argues that because the approach is a well-established 

quantitative method, the findings that it offers will minimize potential complaints of bias 

compared to approaches that rely solely on surveys or interviews. While past reports by 

preservation advocates often only gloss over the quantitative methods that they employ 

(generally for the sake of clarity or simplicity), hedonic regression is a familiar and fairly 

interpretable technique. In reality, however, there is not always sufficient high-quality data 

to build a robust model. 

Although there are approximately 580,000 properties within the City of 

Philadelphia, and 3.75 million property transactions associated with them over the past 

twenty years, data quality issues bring uncertainty into the analysis. Additionally, the use 

of a single binary predictor variable – whether a property is located within a local historic

district or not – removes nuance from conversations about how neighborhoods boundaries 

are defined and redefined by residents (both owners and renters), developers, realtors, and 

community organizations. 

At the neighborhood scale, different levels of owner occupancy may change the 

dynamics of what designation means, whether in terms of property values directly, or in 

how changes may impact residents. This measure is particularly challenging to track in the 

context of a model, as current occupants are not included in any dataset; the closest proxy 

for determining owner-occupancy would be through a comparison of the owner mailing 

address with the property address, and even that has its limitations.20 Furthermore, as the 

authors of Measuring the Economic Impacts of Historic Preservation acknowledge, 

inconsistent data collection, together with differences in how property assessments are 

done across U.S. cities, makes a cross-city comparison impossible using this technique, 

even within a single state.21 

Most studies of the association between historic designation and property values 

use an approach in which transaction values within historic districts in a particular city 

are compared with those outside of historic districts in the same city. Because these 

studies generally divide all residential properties with a given city into one of two groups 

– designated or undesignated (typically, but not exclusively, at the level of local 

designation) – they do not sufficiently control for other property or neighborhood 

characteristics. 

 

20 The records themselves may not be entered consistently, and historic information is not tracked in any 
publicly available dataset, meaning that all property characteristics apply to a property’s condition at the 
time of the website OpenDataPhilly’s most recent update for a given dataset.

Some studies look beyond a binary variable to consider proximity to historic 

districts in addition to simply presence within them. A 2010 report by Econsult 

Corporation (now Econsult Solutions, Inc.) found a 1.6% increase in residential 

transaction prices for each mile closer to a national historic district, and a 0.5% for each 

mile closer to a local historic district.22 Given that more than 70 percent of all residential 

properties in Philadelphia, including all of Center City as well as South, West, and North 

Philadelphia, are located within two miles of a local historic district (a fact not mentioned 

in the report itself), this finding should be approached with some degree of skepticism 

(Figures 1 and 2, on the following page). While this study does separate some 

neighborhood amenities as additional predictor variables, it does not acknowledge the 

degree to which these other amenities (like proximity to Center City, transit, or particular 

schools, for example) may make a difference as well. 

While many demographic and neighborhood characteristics can be included as 

independent variables in a regression model, they depend on data sources that may not be 

appropriate to the individual building scale. For example, census tracts, used in the 

neighborhood selection process in this thesis (see Section 4), create artificially defined 

geographies. Depending on where a property is located within a census tract, this data 

may be more or less representative of that property’s immediate surroundings. Coulton, 

Korbin, Chan, and Su address this in their 2001 article “Mapping Residents’ Perceptions 

of Neighborhood Boundaries: A Methodological Note,” in which they report on a survey 

22 Econsult Corporation, The Economic Impact of Historic Preservation in Philadelphia, (Philadelphia: 
March 2010), 24.

of Cleveland residents living in seven census block groups. By overlaying neighborhood 

boundary maps as drawn by residents within each area, the authors highlight areas of 

overlap and areas of divergence within each neighborhood, with areas identified as within 

a neighborhood by 70 percent of respondents shaded in. The resulting areas were similar 

in size to census tracts but did not align with those boundaries, pointing to issues with 

using census tract data on a neighborhood scale (Figure 3).24 Furthermore, given differing 

perceptions of neighborhood boundaries among residents, the selection of these 

boundaries are by nature arbitrary, including in the models given in Section 4 of this 

thesis (see page 56 for a discussion of boundary selection).

Similarly, differing approaches to measuring the dependent variable can have a 

substantial impact on how findings are reported. Hanka, et al. explores this in 

“Contemporary Neighborhood Housing Dynamics in a Mid-Sized US 

City: The Policy Consequences of Mismeasuring the Dependent Variable,” where 

neighborhood median values, dollar changes in median values, and percentage changes in 

median values are all considered as the dependent variable in a model that includes 

historic district designation, participation in HOPE VI (a federal grant program through 

the Department of Housing and Urban Development), and the presence of  

of a federally-funded university–community partnership within a given census tract as 

predictor variables.25 A comparison of eight models found varying associations and 

levels of significance between each of the three predictor variables described above and 

whatever dependent variable was used in a given model. While local historic district 

designation was found to have a positive and significant association with the dependent 

variables, HOPE VI and university-community partnerships exhibited more complex 

dynamics that are explored in greater depth in the paper.26 

 

Comparisons Across Municipalities 

A 2001 article in Urban Studies by Robin Leichenko, Edward Coulson, and David 

Listokin broadens the analysis to include a wider sample of properties in several cities, 

rather than looking at data from an only an individual city. While the authors offer a 

cogent argument for taking this approach, which fills a clear gap in the literature, this

broader comparison flattens the substantial differences in both preservation cultures and 

preservation (and broader planning) ordinances between municipalities, as well as 

statewide differences. Given the hyper-local nature of historic preservation, particularly 

in the context of buildings that make up the overall urban fabric (as opposed to landmark 

buildings), this misses a key part of the discussion. 

The Economic Benefits of Historic Preservation Activities in Pennsylvania, a 

2011 report by Econsult Corporation and Urban Partners, includes three case studies 

located throughout Pennsylvania (one in Philadelphia, one in West Chester, and one in 

Pittsburgh) to offer broad insights into how local district designation might reveal 

different associations with property value or sales prices depending on local context. 

Each of these three cases evaluates property appreciation before and after designation, 

relative to either the citywide averages or surrounding neighborhoods.27 

Because details about the studies’ quantitative methods and findings are given in 

this report’s appendix, it is possible to delve more deeply into the approaches taken in its 

three hedonic regression models for Philadelphia, West Chester, and Pittsburgh. While 

differences in data availability certainly played a role in variation among the models’ 

structures (i.e. which predicator variables were included), the need for a compelling and 

straightforward narrative must have also played a role in each model’s development. 

A closer look at the Philadelphia neighborhood included as a case reveals a robust 

model, with transaction data extending to before 1985, when the sample district of 

Powelton Village was added to the National Register of Historic Places.28 The inclusion

of historic data extending back this far, as well as the level of detail about the model itself 

that is given in the appendix, indicates that Econsult would have had access to additional 

data that is not currently publicly available, but that would improve similar modeling 

approaches.29 This model still does not account for the use of the Federal Rehabilitation 

Tax Credit at the individual property level, a variable that could potentially be built from 

multiple data sources but that might not offer sufficient predictive strength to be included 

in a model, although it has had a clear and visible impact on this particular 

neighborhood.30 The other two cases (in West Chester and Pittsburgh) are sketched out 

much more generally in the report’s appendix, making it challenging to draw conclusions 

about these two models and the data included in them. 

An earlier study by Econsult, completed for the Preservation Alliance for Greater 

Philadelphia, focused solely on the City of Philadelphia and identified premiums 

associated with both local and national district designation. The model built for this 

report also found that increases in transaction prices were sustained, with properties in 

designated districts continuing to appreciate more rapidly than other similar properties in 

Philadelphia beyond the initial year of district designation. Additionally, the study found 

a positive association between proximity to (rather than just location within) a designated 

historic district, although this scale of analysis might not make sense in a city like 

 

29 The dataset used in this thesis, which is available on OpenDataPhilly, includes transactions dating back 
to 1999. It is available as the file “Real Estate Transfers” at https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/real-
estate-transfers, most recently accessed by the author on August 23, 2019. 
30 Although it would be challenging to assemble this information into a single consistent dataset, it would 
theoretically be possible to track the exact dollar amount received in Federal Rehabilitation Tax credits for 
each transaction within a geographic area over time (adjusted for inflation). This could then be used to 
build a model in which each tax credit dollar would be associated with a particular change in property 
value. The sample size of transactions would likely be too small for this to be meaningful, however.

historic district, as shown in Figures 1 and 2, above.31 

 

Other Quantitative Studies Evaluating Property Values 

This approach of using hedonic regression to identify associations between a particular 

condition and property values is widely used in city planning and adjacent fields. In 

addition to studies looking at historic designation as a factor in determining property 

values, other studies evaluate the associations with commercial corridors, land vacancy, 

access to transportation, affordable housing, and even airport noise. In part because these 

reports take a range of forms, including white papers and academic articles, some delve 

more deeply into their methodological approaches than others, and all can be used to help 

determine the level of detail that might be appropriate for future reports in historic 

preservation, whether looking at designation and property values or at other policy tools. 

For example, a 2015 report by Jonathan Wiley analyzes the association between 

commercial land uses and residential property values in the Atlanta metropolitan area, 

with 0.5, 0.75, and one-mile boundaries used to define proximity.32 Additionally, this 

study uses matched samples, meaning that each property transaction included in the 

model within the boundary is matched with a similar transaction in the same zip code and 

from the same quarter and year, but that is outside of the given historic district boundary. 

The level of detail given in the report allows the reader to understand how the model 

actually works, rather than simply stating the results as fact. An explanation of the

project’s methodology includes the model’s assumptions, a mathematical equation 

showing how distance is measured, and a schematic form of the model itself, with groups 

of variables shown and explained further in the text, all given within the body of the 

paper.33 

“The Economic Impact of Greening Urban Vacant Land: A Spatial Difference-in-

Differences Analysis” by Megan Heckert and Jeremy Mennis compares changes in 

transaction prices over time between a “treatment group” of properties that was greened 

through the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society’s LandCare program and a control group 

made up of other unbuilt properties in Philadelphia. Because the LandCare program 

primarily treats properties that are located in lower wealth communities, and in close 

proximity to schools, commercial corridors, or other sites of interest, control group 

properties were selected with these criteria in mind. At the same time, these additional 

properties needed to be sufficiently far away from actual LandCare properties, in case 

proximity conferred its own benefit in the form of increasing value.34 This report, more 

than any other surveyed, examines spatial autocorrelation as part of its approach through 

the inclusion of geographically weighted regression as well as the use of separate models 

for each of seven geographically-defined districts in Philadelphia. This approach, in 

which the association is measured in a range of neighborhood types, aligns closely with 

the quantitative case study in Section 4 of this thesis. The authors of this report found that

individual areas, and of the model’s limitations, also adds substantial richness to the 

report’s findings. 

 

Residential Stability and Foreclosures 

A 2011 University of Pennsylvania thesis by Kimberley Broadbent (now Chantry) 

explores whether local district designation in Philadelphia was associated with lower 

rates of mortgage foreclosures in single family homes during the nationwide housing 

crisis of 2007-2011.36 By comparing mortgage foreclosure rates between October 2009 

and September 2010 in six local historic districts and comparable neighborhoods, this 

thesis finds that in three cases, the designated district performed better (meaning that the 

foreclosure rate was lower) than comparable neighborhoods, in two cases, the designated 

district performed similarly to its comparables, and in one case, it performed worse, 

indicating additional factors at play.37 Despite these findings, the thesis focuses most 

heavily on the positive cases, identifying a “93% greater propensity for single-family 

residential foreclosure in comparable neighborhoods than in historic districts.”38 

 

This past thesis recognizes issues with small sample sizes, given that most of the 

neighborhoods studied contained fewer than 1,000 single family homes at the time of 

writing, and one, the Diamond Street local historic district in North Philadelphia, 

contained as few as 38. A total of two residential foreclosures during the study period

gave a foreclosure rate of 52.6 per 1,000 properties, while the next highest neighborhood 

had ten foreclosures in total, for a rate of 16.5 per 1,000.39 The author acknowledges but 

does not attempt to correct for this limitation, or for demographic differences among 

neighborhoods. This project does, however, offer a strong framework from which further 

studies could build. While its focus is on homeowners and not renters, this type of 

approach looks at the actual implications of changing property values for Philadelphia 

residents, extending beyond broadly framed economic impacts to address more nuanced 

dynamics. 

 

General studies of displacement and residential stability explore systemic 

conditions, in some cases focusing on theoretical groundings and in others, on particular 

policies and their implications for homeowners, renters, and/or developers. Ingrid Gould 

Ellen and Katherine O’Regan’s chapter “Gentrification: Perspectives of Economists and 

Planners” in The Oxford Handbook of Urban Economics and Planning offers a 

theoretical structure through which to discuss models of neighborhood change, citing 

models forth by both planners and economists from the mid-twentieth century onward.40  

 

A 2017 article by Lance Freeman and Jenny Schuetz, “Producing Affordable 

Housing in Rising Markets: What Works?” takes a critical look at major U.S. housing 

programs, including the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) and Housing Choice 

Vouchers, as well as at developers’ inclusionary zoning models, to unpack what 

affordability means in these contexts, and particularly how long it lasts. The authors

delve into precisely what gentrification looks like when considering renters as compared 

to homeowners, writing 

If gentrification does not necessarily lead to increased rates of direct 
displacement, it poses for localities at least two other challenges related to 
housing affordability. First, if gentrification causes exclusionary displacement, 
which the available evidence suggests, the housing affordability problem boils 
down to the location of housing that is affordable… Declining affordability in 
gentrifying neighborhoods could prove disruptive for poor residents and for the 
businesses and services that relied on those residents as clientele (Meltzer, 2016; 
Parker, 2016)… Beyond housing affordability, gentrification can also engender 
feelings of being “pushed out” among long-term residents. As used here, pushed 
out refers to the disempowerment felt by long-term residents in reaction to their 
neighborhood changing in ways over which they had little control or say and are 
ultimately not intended for their benefit.41 

These considerations, which are often expressed in the literature around 

gentrification and displacement, must be brought more fully into the historic preservation 

discourse, including into discussions of historic designation and property values, where 

concerns of NIMBYism are widespread but less frequently discussed in academic 

 

 

contexts within the field.  

Related Studies 

While studies of the association between historic district designation and property values 

make up the bulk of the analyses described in this thesis, additional types of projects are 

also worth looking to in order to better understand the role of data collection and analysis 

in the field of historic preservation. Architectural surveys, typically conducted on a 

citywide scale, rely heavily on data management; project developers must decide which 

building characteristics to track, and then develop a system to collect and store large

quantities of data in an organized and accessible manner. These studies can be 

comprehensive surveys of all historic resources within a municipality (or at another 

geographic scale), or they can focus on a particular building type, construction method, or 

time period. In recent years, best practices in survey approaches have been developed 

around data management softwares and approaches, with SurveyLA and the Arches 

software developed by the Getty Conservation Institute emerging as a best practice.42 

While the process of architectural survey relies heavily on data collection and 

management, recent academic articles that incorporate data analysis into their findings 

include work in historic preservation as well as allied fields (like city planning and 

economics) that have historically relied more heavily on data-driven approaches. 

For example, a study by Stephanie Ryberg-Webster and Kelly Kinahan of the 

Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit’s impact on housing affordability and 

displacement looked at twelve cities, selected based on data accessibility and the authors’ 

familiarity with each, and with an eye toward legacy cities with weaker market 

conditions. Their chapter within Preservation and the New Data Landscape, “The 

Possibilities and Perils of Data-Driven Preservation Research: Lessons from a Multiyear 

Study of Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits,” offers detailed information about 

quantitative approaches without getting bogged down in their explanations. The authors 

refer to hot-spot analysis to identify spatial clusters, tests for spatial autocorrelation, and 

 

42 See Janet Hansen and Sara Delgadillo Cruz, “Big City, Big Data: Los Angeles’s Historic Resources” and 
Matthew Hampel, “Managing Historic Complexity: Practical Lessons from Tech-Forward Historic 
Resource Surveys,” both in Preservation and the New Data Landscape, for more information on current 
approaches to architectural survey.

the use of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index to assess market concentration.43 Footnotes 

offer additional insight into the particular approaches employed in the study.44 In drawing 

conclusions from their quantitative findings, the authors interpret their results to develop 

a meaningful narrative without overstating the significance of their findings. They 

acknowledge substantial limitations in the data and offer recommendations for further 

study.  

A closer analysis of six legacy cities included in the initial group of twelve also 

includes a cluster analysis, in which neighborhoods in each city are classified into one of 

eight groups depending on a range of characteristics. These eight groupings are 

categorized into one of two higher-level clusters identified as stable neighborhoods or 

ones experiencing high levels of distress. This method, in which all neighborhoods within 

a city are classified into one of several clusters, could provide an opportunity for an 

alternative approach to understanding historic designation and property values; this 

possibility is explored further in “Limitations and Opportunities for Further Study” in 

Section 4 of this thesis. 

 

 

 

43 Hot-spot analysis examines the spatial density of a variable, often in a visual manner. Spatial 
autocorrelation refers to the positive or negative association between objects or events that are physically 
near to one another, with greater proximity associated with a stronger association; this relationship can be 
measured and/or included in a model as an additional predictor variable. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index 
is used to measure the market share of a business in relation to others in an area.

LOCAL CONTEXT 

Just as differences among municipal historic preservation ordinances mean that local 

historic district designation looks different from one city to the next, it is also important 

to recognize additional factors that impact local real estate trends. In Philadelphia, the 

Philadelphia City Planning Commission, the Philadelphia Historical Commission, City 

Council, the Zoning Board of Adjustment, the Department of Commerce, the Office of 

Housing and Community Development, and the Office of Property Assessment together 

constitute most of the governmental forces whose actions directly impact and reflect 

current trends in planning, preservation, and development. 

 

 

Philadelphia2035 

Philadelphia recently underwent a comprehensive planning process. The product, 

Philadelphia2035, includes a Citywide Vision in addition to eighteen district plans. Each 

of these is built on three interconnected themes: Thrive, which addresses economic 

development and land management, Connect, which includes transportation and utilities, 

and Renew, which deals with historic preservation, open space, and the public realm. 

Housing priorities outlined in the Citywide Vision and carried through into district plans 

include the stabilization and upgrading of existing housing units, as well as ensuring that 

units are available at a range of price points throughout the city, in order to reduce 

concentrations of poverty, expand options for people seeking housing, and build on 

existing neighborhood assets.45

Updated Zoning Code 

Following a 2007 voter referendum, Philadelphia’s zoning code was rewritten for the first 

time since 1962. The new code, which was developed by the Zoning Code Commission 

(a temporary body created for this purpose) and implemented in 2012, had the following 

goals as its framework: 

-  Provide consistency and understandability of the zoning code. 

-  Make future construction and development more predictable. 

-  Encourage high quality, positive development. 

-  Preserve the character of existing neighborhoods. 

- 

Involve the public in development decisions.46 

Today, zoning remapping occurs when a stakeholder – a community group, the local 

district council member, or the Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC) – 

requests that current land uses in an area be surveyed and that zoning be reevaluated, 

either because current land uses do not match zoning, or because changes to land use and 

zoning may be appropriate. PCPC staff create maps of existing conditions and proposed 

zoning, and after presentation at a public meeting and endorsement from the PCPC, 

proposed zoning changes are introduced to City Council and presented to the Mayor. 

Following a public hearing, a rezoning bill is voted on by City Council and sent to the 

Mayor for signature.47

Registered community organizations (RCOs) play a central role in the process, as 

the entities that are required to be informed of proposed zoning variances, and that 

communicate directly with property owners located within 250 feet of any requested 

variance that will be heard by the Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA). Furthermore, they 

are often directly involved in developing remapping proposals. While the current RCO 

system was established within the 2012 zoning code changes, many organizations that 

serve as RCOs existed long before the formalization of their relationship with zoning in 

Philadelphia.48 

As part of the Philadelphia2035 process, the entire city was remapped according 

to the newly adopted zoning code.49 In each district plan, recommendations include 

zoning to reflect existing and desired land uses (called “corrective” zoning in the plans) 

as well as “zoning to advance the plan,” which are changes to align zoning with proposed 

and desired land use.50 The Zoning Code Commission created three new zoning districts 

– CMX2.5 for neighborhood commercial areas, IRMX for industrial-residential mixed 

use, and SP-AIR, a special purpose airport district – while reducing the overall number of 

zoning districts.51 

Citywide rezoning as part of the comprehensive planning process was intended to 

reduce the number of appeals submitted to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, which saw 

an average of more than 1,500 appeals annually between 2008 and 2012. While the

additional information on changing legislation related to the role of RCOs in zoning from 2012 to 2017.

percentage of requested variances that were approved has held steady at around 90 

percent from 2008 to 2017, the ZBA has seen a decrease in appeals overall, meaning that 

the actual number of variances granted has gone down since the new zoning code was 

implemented. Because the percentage of zoning permits approved by right increased from 

an average of 65.5 percent of all applications in the four-year period leading up to the 

new code to 71.7 percent in the following five years, the ZBA has seen fewer appeals 

overall in recent years.52 

 

Property Assessment 

An audit of the Philadelphia’s Office of Property Assessment’s methods, conducted 

following a 2019 assessment in which property values increased by an average of 10.5 

percent, found major inconsistencies in the process.53 In particular, properties under 

$100,000 were found to be over assessed, and assessments for one- to four-family homes, 

commercial properties, and industrial properties did not meet industry standards. 

Additionally, similar properties (even on the same block) were not assessed consistently, 

meaning that otherwise similar neighboring properties might have widely disparate 

assessed values.54 

Issues with property assessments are not new to the City. In 2014, Philadelphia 

instituted the Actual Value Initiative (AVI), which is intended to match assessed value to 

market value for properties citywide. The Philadelphia Inquirer study conducted in 2008

found assessments to be off by an average of 39 percent at that time. The Inquirer’s more 

recent study of the property assessment process found more than 165,000 single family 

homes (representing one third of all such properties citywide) to be over assessed, and 

133,000 to be under assessed, with lower assessments generally favoring higher-valued 

properties (Figure 4).55 The official audit conducted by J.F. Ryan Associates found 

similar issues, supporting widespread concerns over problems with the assessment 

process and results.

While the J.F. Ryan Associates audit outlined major problems in the assessment 

process and results, it did not offer actionable recommendations for improving the 

system; City Council has issued its own set of recommendations, however, including to 

hire new leadership and additional staff in the Office of Property Assessment, and to 

work with external appraisal firms to improve the process and results.56 

 

Ten Year Property Tax Abatement 

Philadelphia’s ten-year tax abatement was established in the late 1990s to incentivize 

development in the city, which had been losing population since the mid twentieth 

century. Given high construction costs in the city, the abatement helps incentivize 

developers to invest in Philadelphia, as it means that the increase in property value 

associated with new construction or substantial renovation is not taxed for the first ten 

years after an investment is made. 

While the tax abatement applies to all real estate in Philadelphia, critics of the 

program argue that it disproportionately benefits properties at the high end of the market 

– properties valued at more than $700,000 represent seven percent of those qualifying for 

the abatement but more than half of the value of the tax benefits.57 Proponents of the 

program claim that the tax abatement encourages investment in the city that contributes 

to a larger tax base, while critics argue that the benefits are primarily experienced by 

developers, rather than to the public at large. A 2018 proposal to increase property taxes

in response to the School District of Philadelphia’s 105-million-dollar deficit led to 

renewed debate over whether the tax abatement should be discontinued or phased out.58 

Given that the majority of Philadelphia voters oppose the abatement (according to 

a spring 2019 poll by the Philadelphia Inquirer) the program’s critics have offered a 

range of recommendations, from ending the abatement altogether, to phasing it out, to 

targeting specific types of development. This last approach could distinguish based on 

property type, value, location, or other factors, including, potentially, favoring 

rehabilitation over new construction.59 

 

Philadelphia’s Housing Action Plan 

The City’s first official housing plan, Housing for Equity: An Action Plan for 

Philadelphia, was published in 2018. Central to Philadelphia’s housing strategy is the 

idea that a wide range of housing options, at a variety of price points, is needed to serve 

current and future residents. Given that the city is expected to add 25,000 new households 

over the next ten years, new housing units will need to be created through a combination 

of new construction and housing rehabilitation. Housing for Equity places particular 

emphasis on both affordable housing and the rehabilitation of existing structures and

proposes a target of 3,650 new housing units to be created and 6,350 units to be preserved 

each year.60 

Between 2008 and 2016, Philadelphia lost units at the lower end of the market 

and gained units at the higher end, exacerbating challenges faced by lower income 

households that were already overwhelmingly rent-burdened (Figure 5, on the following 

page).61 According to the 2013-2017 American Community Survey five-year estimate, 

nearly half of all Philadelphia households experienced rent burden, spending at least 30% 

of their income on housing costs; of those households, 58% experienced severe rent 

burden, spending at least half of their income on housing. This burden is felt most heavily 

by lower- and middle-income households: a full 85% of Philadelphia residents earning 

less than $35,000 annually experience rent burden, compared to less than 4% of 

households earning at least $75,000. Furthermore, although households earning less than 

$20,000 annually experienced a slight decrease in rent burden from 2009 to 2017, rates of 

rent burden grew substantially among households earning between $20,000 and $75,000 

over this period (Figure 6, page 36).62

61 While HUD (and this thesis) uses a threshold of 30 percent of income going to housing costs to define 
rent burden, this measure is an oversimplification of the issue. See Michael Stone, “What is Housing 
Affordability? The Case for the Residual Income Approach,” Housing Policy Debate 17:1 (2006), 151-184 
and Edward Glaeser and Joseph Gyuorko, “How Do We Know When Housing is ‘Affordable’?” in J.R. 
Tighe and E. J. Mueller, eds, Affordable Housing Reader (London & New York: Routledge, 2013) for more 
information. 
62 U.S. Census Bureau ACS 2013-2017 Five Year Estimate. According to HUD’s definition of rent burden 
(more than 30% of income spent on housing), an apartment renting at 800 dollars per month would be 
affordable to a household earning 32,000 dollars annually, while one at 2,000 dollars per month would be 
affordable to one earning 80,000 dollars annually.

Certified Local Governments 

Philadelphia is one of more than two thousand municipalities that are part of the National 

Park Service’s Certified Local Government (CLG) program, meaning that they follow a 

set of state and federal requirements, including through having an historic preservation 

commission and local ordinance, and facilitating public participation in the local 

preservation.63 Among other benefits, being a CLG means that locally designated 

income-producing properties (both individually-designated as well as contributing 

properties in local historic districts) are eligible for federal tax credits under the Federal 

Rehabilitation Tax Credit program, which requires that a property designated on the

Designation in Philadelphia 

The Philadelphia Historical Commission (PHC), which is part of the City’s Department 

of Planning and Development, maintains the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places, 

reviews building permit applications for changes to listed properties, and advises property 

owners and the public about preservation techniques and resources. While PHC staff 

approve more than 90 percent of permit applications (often through an iterative process 

with the property owner, developer, and/or architect) and without needing to move to a 

committee vote, more complex and/or contentious projects are presented for review at 

bimonthly public meetings.64 

After an extended period of very limited local historic designation, both on the 

district and individual property scale, six local historic districts have been designated 

since 2017. While part of this change has been attributed to a staffing increase in 

Philadelphia’s Historical Commission and greater efficiency due to changing municipal 

regulations, local advocacy efforts have also had an impact. 

Looking more broadly at political power in Philadelphia, the strength of the city’s 

councilmanic system plays a central role in the designation process; in 2004, 

Representative Jannie Blackwell of District 3 raised concerns over potential adverse 

effects that designation might have on low- and moderate-income residents within her 

district. As part of this process, Representative Blackwell proposed a change to the city’s 

historic preservation ordinance that would have given city council increased oversight of

the designation process; this discussion set a precedent that local historic districts would 

be challenged going forward, effectively discouraging further attempts at designation.65 

 

Philadelphia Historic Preservation Task Force 

Established by Mayor Kenney in May 2017, the Philadelphia Historic Preservation Task 

Force recently completed an evaluation and recommendation process for four key areas: 

survey of historic resources, incentives for preservation, regulations for preservation 

outcomes, and outreach and education. The task force, which consisted of 33 members, 

including preservation professionals (both academics and practicing professionals) as 

well as developers, community advocates, and city representatives, explored the impacts 

of local historic designation, as well as the potential for changes to the city’s preservation 

ordinance that could offer additional protections to properties and/or new incentives to 

owners of contributing buildings in local historic districts, as well as to individually listed 

buildings. 

Of particular note was a discussion about potential changes to local district 

designation that would offer more tailored designation levels, depending on individual 

districts’ characteristics and the input of area residents. Similar in some ways to the three 

classifications of designation in the England (Grade I, Grade II*, and Grade II), such an 

approach would allow for more flexible regulations and incentives in districts that might 

not require the full level of regulation that is offered through what is often perceived to be 

the current “one size fits all” approach to local designation in Philadelphia. Drawing from 

65 Jannie Blackwell lost in the May 2019 primary to Jamie Gauthier, after more than 25 years in office. 
Gauthier, who most recently served as the Executive Director for Fairmount Park Conservancy, will run 
unopposed in the November election.

the use of Neighborhood Conservation Districts, which offer an opportunity for 

community groups to develop guidelines for new construction with input from the 

Philadelphia City Planning Commission, such an approach could potentially mitigate 

resident and homeowner concerns about new construction, while loosening restrictions 

related to building alterations, even of historic properties. 

In considering the incentives that would be associated with different types of local 

designation, the Task Force proposed that districts with more stringent regulations should 

also offer greater incentives to owners.66 While this might encourage more restrictive and 

highly protective designation, it is important to consider which types of districts would be 

more likely to receive this level of designation compared to less restrictive forms. If 

higher wealth communities are more likely to designate to the level with both greater 

restrictions and higher incentives – because such neighborhoods may be more likely to be 

designated on the basis of architectural significance and aesthetic value than other 

historic districts – then these communities would have access to more financial capital 

through incentives than those that could benefit more from additional support. 

Additionally, the Task Force recommended that all buildings within local historic 

districts be categorized as contributing, noncontributing, or (a new category) significant, 

to more fully capture the variation within a given district. While these categories would 

guide the level of design oversight to be placed on individual buildings, a block’s overall 

character would also be considered in establishing appropriate levels of regulation.67

QUANTITATIVE APPROACH 

This study pairs three sets of physically and demographically similar neighborhoods to 

create three separate linear regression models, all with the same sets of predictor 

variables.68 Unlike other economic impact studies on historic district designation that 

compare designated and undesignated properties across an entire city, this approach 

highlights the diversity of local historic districts within Philadelphia and looks to draw 

closer comparisons between similar pairs of neighborhoods. This method, which could be 

considered either as a set of three case studies or a modified randomized block design 

using hedonic regression, uses sales transactions data from the City of Philadelphia, with 

sales prices as the dependent variable.69 It attempts to mitigate some of the issues 

associated with directly comparing disparate neighborhoods, as each of the three pairs 

(and their associated models) consists of two similar neighborhoods, one designated and 

the other not.70 

While typical hedonic regression pricing approaches include building and 

neighborhood characteristics as variables, that approach does not offer the flexibility to 

assign different coefficient values to a single variable depending on other predictor 

variable values (in this case, a categorical variable identifying the particular 

neighborhood or local historic district in which a property is located). By running 

separate regressions for each neighborhood-district pair, it is possible to identify whether 

 

68 This report uses ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which is the most commonly used and intuitive 
type of linear regression. 
69 The methodological approach used to create the model follows the loose structure of a randomized block 
design, albeit without randomization, as the “treatment” of historic designation is not assigned randomly 
within each pair of neighborhoods but is rather based on designated district and recognized neighborhood 
boundaries. 
70 Each of the three designated neighborhoods correspond to local historic districts that are also listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places.

there may be opposing trends among the three groups. For example, one neighborhood 

pairing may have seen an increase in transaction values between 2001 and 2007, whereas 

another pair’s transaction values may have remained steady – the three separate 

regressions can account for these nuances in a way that a single model would not. 

This chapter is designed as a proof of concept, with the recognition that an 

analysis of transaction values from a subset of a single city is not sufficient to establish 

broad findings. Nevertheless, it addresses gaps in previous studies and sets the stage for a 

more rigorous approach moving forward. Most importantly, it makes room for a more 

nuanced understanding of and conversations around the potential associations between 

local historic district designation and property sales prices or value. 

Beginning with a brief summary of how linear regression models work, this 

chapter then moves into a detailed explanation of how neighborhood pairs were 

identified, and variables selected. The results are interpreted for each of the three 

pairings. For clarity, these pairings and their associated models are referred to as the 

Center City model (for Society Hill and Bella Vista), the Fairmount model (for Parkside 

and Strawberry Mansion), and the Schuylkill-Northwest model (for Manayunk and East 

Falls). Finally, limitations are addressed and recommendations made for further study.

individual residential property transactions.71 The resulting function consists of a y-

intercept and several variables, each with its own coefficient that weights that variable’s 

contribution to the overall transaction value, holding all other variables constant. By 

plugging values into the equation for each variable, one obtains an expected transaction 

value for a given property at a particular time. 

A general linear regression model can be written as: 

 = 

0 +

Here, y represents the dependent variable (residential sales price), 

0 is the y-intercept,

and 

i represents the coefficient for each independent variable from 1 through k. An 

𝛽𝛽

interpretation of 

i (for i > 0) is that for each one unit increase in the predictor variable, 

𝛽𝛽

the value of the dependent variable is expected to increase by 

i units, holding all other 

𝛽𝛽

predictors constant. For example, if the number of bedrooms is a predictor variable in a 

𝛽𝛽

regression model, then for each additional bedroom, the sales price can be expected to 

increase by the coefficient’s number of dollars, holding everything else constant. 

Note that the line of best fit, which is given by the main equation above with the 

error term removed, does not represent the exact relationship among the variables for the 

full population, but rather an approximation of that relationship using the available data.72 

Because it is impossible to reduce transactions to a finite set of measurable variables, the 

linear regression equation cannot perfectly predict each transaction’s exact price. 

Furthermore, a model that could do that would be said to be overfit, meaning that the

model’s coefficients would be too closely aligned with the existing data, and the model 

would erroneously treat anomalies in the dataset as meaningful. 

To test a model’s performance, one can remove a portion of the full dataset’s 

observations before building the model using the observations that remain, which are 

collectively called the training set. By then running the model on the testing set (those 

observations that were removed), one can see how well the model performs on data that it 

has not yet seen. In the case of this project, one could randomly select ten percent of all 

property transactions in each of the six neighborhoods to remove, build the models using 

the remaining transactions, and then enter values for the predictor variables in each of the 

transactions that were initially removed. 

By comparing the transaction values as predicted by the model to actual 

transaction records, it would be possible to see how well the models perform on those 

transactions that were not used to build the model. This would be done by looking at the 

final term in the regression equation, which is the residual, written as 

. The residual is 

assumed to be normally distributed and have a mean of zero. In the form of an equation, 

𝜀𝜀

the residual for each individual observation (sales transaction) i is: 

Where ŷi is the expected transaction value based on the equation above, and yi is the 

actual (observed) transaction price. 

 

Understanding Regression Outputs 

The regression output includes values that allow one to evaluate whether the relationships 

among variables are significant. The F-ratio test evaluates whether there is likely to be an 

εi = yi - ŷi

association between the full set of predictor variables and the dependent variable. The p-

value gives the likelihood of obtaining the observed f-value if the null hypothesis (

) is 

true. In this case, the null hypothesis is that none of the predictors is associated with the 

𝐻𝐻0

dependent variable, and the alternative hypothesis is that at least one predictor (not 

necessarily that of local historic district designation) is in fact associated with the 

dependent variable of transaction value. A p-value of <0.05 means that there is less than a 

five percent chance that the null hypothesis is true given the observed data; this would 

allow for the rejection of the null hypothesis, meaning that there is likely to be an 

association between at least one predictor in the model and residential sales prices in 

Philadelphia. 

The process of building a model is an iterative one, with predictor variables added 

and removed as they are checked for statistical significance. While some variables, like 

building square footage or the number of bedrooms in a house, are fairly common to see 

in other studies of property values or transaction prices, others might not appear in other 

models as frequently. Variable selection can depend on many different factors, including 

predictive strength (as measured by the regression output), data quality (meaning that 

certain variables may be more likely to contain errors), and ease of interpretation.73 

The r-squared value given as part of the regression output indicates the portion of 

the dependent variable that can be explained by the collection of predictor variables 

included in the model. This number, which ranges from zero to one, offers insight into a 

model’s predictive power, as a value of one would indicate that the model predicts all 

73 In Philadelphia, the building construction year is an example of a variable that may be more likely to 
contain errors, given the use of 1915 and 1925 as estimates where precise records do not exist (see Figure 
12 on page 64).

variation in transaction prices. In the social sciences, an r-squared value of 0.5 or higher 

is generally considered sufficient to indicate moderate correlation, although models with 

lower values (of around 0.3 or 0.4) are still used.74 An r-squared value of 0.5 can be 

interpreted as meaning that 50 percent of the variance in the dependent variable can be 

explained by the set of predictor variables. 

P-values associated with each predictor variable are also part of the regression 

output. Asterisks appear next to each as a quick visual check for significance, although 

variables can be included even if they are not statistically significant. Furthermore, a 

variable’s significance (and its coefficient) will change as the model is adjusted. Adding 

or removing one variable will affect the others in a model, which is why one might try 

several different configurations before settling on the final model.75 

 

Neighborhood Selection 

In contrast with existing studies on historic districts, in which all designated properties 

(or all properties within a local historic district) are compared with all other properties in 

a city, this project directly compares three pairings of physically and demographically 

similar neighborhoods, using sales transactions data from the City of Philadelphia. This 

approach mitigates some of the issues associated with directly comparing disparate 

neighborhoods, as each of the three pairs consists of two neighborhoods that are similar 

in both physical form and socioeconomic characteristics. 

 

74 In more theoretical contexts, an r-squared value of 0.8 would generally indicate a strong model, and 
values could be even higher than that. 
75 Additionally, variables (some or all predictor variables and/or the dependent variable) can be transformed 
using mathematical operations to normalize their distribution. This process is not used in this thesis, largely 
for simplicity and clarity.

Selection Criteria 

There are a total of twenty one local historic districts in Philadelphia, although two of 

them – the Historic Street Paving Thematic District (designated in 1998) and the Ridge 

Avenue Roxborough Thematic Historic District (designated in 2018) – are geographically 

dispersed and were not evaluated as part of this study (Figure 7, on the following page). 

Of the remaining nineteen, a subset of districts was selected for further study, based on 

the total number of properties included within each of their boundaries, and with 

geographic, demographic, and physical diversity in mind. 

Selection criteria for the three designated districts included: 

-  A sufficient number of properties located within each district; 

-  Consistency among the three districts as to whether they also overlap with a 

nationally designated historic district; 

-  Substantial differences in character among the three districts, including 

geographic dispersion, a range of socio-economic identities, and the overall 

character/level of architectural integrity in the historical district itself; 

-  Potential neighborhoods to serve as non-designated pairing for each. 

While these criteria may have initially seemed overly broad, they addressed key needs for 

both consistency among and differences between the three pairings. More importantly, 

they left room for more informal knowledge of Philadelphia to inform the final pairings.

Data source: City of Philadelphia 

 

In thinking about potential non-designated pairings for selected designated 

districts, the following criteria were considered: 

-  Geographic: distance to Center City 

-  Access to amenities: presence of universities or other major institutions nearby; 

proximity to Fairmount Park and/or smaller neighborhood parks 

76 The Historic Street Paving Thematic District and the Ridge Avenue Roxborough Thematic Historic 
District are not shown, as they are both noncontiguous. Note also that Parkside is a locally designated 
historic district, despite the fact that its boundaries are smaller than those used in the model.

bridges or tunnels

-  Neighborhood stability: homeownership versus rental rate; length of tenure in 

the neighborhood; student presence 

U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2013-2017 data provided core 

demographic data, albeit with the limitations that come with using census tract 

boundaries to approximate study areas. Physical neighborhood characteristics were 

observed through publicly available shapefiles as well as in-person observation. 

 

District-Neighborhood Pairs 

Although there are substantial limitations to using census tract boundaries to gather 

information around households and housing units in the six selected 

districts/neighborhood geographies, U.S. Census Bureau data is a readily accessible and 

interpretable dataset. The boundaries of the Manayunk historic district proved 

particularly challenging however, as they do not align with census tract boundaries 

(Figure 8). Despite these limitations, census tract data, a polygon-based shapefile of 

Philadelphia buildings, and knowledge of the local context provided the basis for 

determining the three sets of matched pairs to include in the analysis. 

Society Hill, Manayunk, and Parkside historic districts are representative of the 

diversity of the city’s local historic districts, and two of the three (Society Hill and 

Manayunk) were designated prior to the start of the study period; the third, Parkside, was

Hill designated in 1971, and Manayunk and Parkside in 1983. For the purposes of this 

study, Parkside’s boundaries are extended beyond those of the local historic district to 

include the National Register Historic District boundaries, as the local district’s 

boundaries do not produce a sufficient number of property transactions for the regression 

analysis.

Although it would ideally be possible to consider only those local historic districts 

that are not also nationally designated, the limited number of local historic districts in 

Philadelphia makes this impossible. Additionally, because National Register Historic 

Districts are not mapped by the National Register of Historic Places, and because most of

their nomination forms are not digitized, there are barriers to identifying the boundaries 

of National Register Historic Districts in sufficient detail. Furthermore, a focus on local 

designation allows for both a greater attention to owner-occupied residential properties as 

well as an approach that acknowledges hyperlocal factors that are at play in evaluating 

local historic districts, as described earlier in this thesis. 

Bella Vista was selected as a match to Society Hill because of its geographic 

proximity, physical characteristics, and lack of other planning or preservation tools that 

might have muddied the comparison. Given that many of Center City’s residential 

properties are in designated historic districts, there were only a few possibilities for this 

pairing. Queen Village, which might have otherwise been selected, is a designated 

Neighborhood Conservation District. 

Parkside and Strawberry Mansion were identified as a strong pair early in the 

process. Both neighborhoods include grand twins and larger buildings that front 

Fairmount Park (on either side of the Schuylkill River), as well as more modest 

rowhouses elsewhere in the neighborhoods. A robust presence of long-term residents and 

active community organizations characterize the neighborhoods. Both also suffer from 

historical disinvestment, and experience issues related to tangled titles (especially due to 

ownership not being formally transferred to family members with the owner’s passing), 

aging-in-place, and a lack of resources for building maintenance. 

The pairing for Manayunk was more challenging, as the comparison 

neighborhood that was ultimately selected actually does include a local historic district. 

For the purposes of this study, East Falls’ boundaries were drawn to exclude the 

properties located within that district, as other possible comparables were too different

characteristics for full set of neighborhood pairs appear in Figure 9, on the following 

page. 

 

Data Preparation 

The City of Philadelphia’s Department of Records dataset of real estate transfers, 

released on OpenDataPhilly in January 2018, forms the core of this analysis. A total of 

3.75 million observations representing transactions recorded since December 1999 are 

included, with information related to grantors and grantees, assessed and fair market 

value, and transaction and recording data, among a total of 48 variables. 

 

 

Data Sources 

In addition to the real estate transfers dataset, the model incorporates a building footprint 

shapefile from the Department of Records as well as a property data shapefile from the 

Office of Property Assessment. While not used in the final model, American Community 

Survey 2013-2017 five-year estimates obtained through American FactFinder and 

additional datasets (all available on OpenDataPhilly) were used to illustrate similarities 

within and differences among the three sets of neighborhood pairs. 

Data Cleaning 

Initial data cleaning in the open source statistical software and programming 

language R included the removal of unnecessary fields and the standardization of others, 

leaving a total of 23 variables remaining. Property sales occurring outside of the six

property transactions.77 Within each neighborhood, observations representing sales not 

considered to be arms-length transactions were removed from the dataset, leaving only 

those transactions likely to have been made by unrelated buyers and sellers, and sold for 

fair market price. In practice, this was done by excluding records in which the sales price 

or market value is below 1,000 dollars. Transactions of commercial, industrial, or vacant 

properties were also removed (Figure 10).

77 This was done through a spatial join of the transaction data to a shapefile created for this project using 
Azavea’s neighborhood boundaries and local district boundaries. The areas included for Parkside and East 
Falls were modified slightly, as described in the body of this report, and in the following footnotes. 
78 The boundaries used in this model include the local historic district but extend beyond it, to ensure a 
sufficient number of observations. 
79 While there is a local historic district associated with East Falls, the area included in the model does not 
overlap with this district.

Variable Selection and Omission 

The overwhelming majority of variables considered for the model are associated with 

individual parcels, rather than with census tracts or neighborhoods. While census data 

was considered in the neighborhood selection process, tract boundaries are arbitrary, 

reducing gradual shifts in an area’s characteristics into sharp artificial boundaries. 

A Department of Records shapefile offers data on building height and density, 

which was used in the identification of appropriate neighborhood comparisons. These 

variables were aggregated based on neighborhood boundaries as defined in a shapefile 

created by the Philadelphia-based geospatial technology firm Azavea, and some were 

used in the final model, with all transactions within a single geographic zone receiving 

the same values. Although neighborhood boundaries, like census tract boundaries, are 

arbitrary, larger neighborhood zones flatten out some of the more abrupt transitions that 

occur on the census tract level. Additionally, because Azavea’s neighborhood boundaries 

were used to determine the boundaries of the non-designated pairings, data aggregated to 

this level more accurately reflects the reality of those geographies. While the challenges 

in defining neighborhood boundaries in Philadelphia have been explored in recent news 

articles, Azavea’s boundaries frequently appear in planning reports and local news 

sources, and a better source for determining neighborhood boundaries in Philadelphia 

does not exist.80 

The imbalance in numbers of transactions between geographic zones is 

considered acceptable but not ideal, as the geographic zone with the fewest transactions,

Manayunk, includes 156 transactions distributed over the nineteen-year period. 

Transactions are grouped into the following sets of years, with the groupings included in 

the regression model as dummy variables: 1999–2003, 2004–2008, 2009–2013, and 

2014–2018, to reflect patterns in the U.S. real estate market over time.81 By analyzing 

change over time, it is possible to begin to tease out whether historic designation might 

be associated with increased or decreased sales prices (relative to similar areas), as well 

as potentially with increased or decreased stability in sales prices, given that the U.S. real 

estate market experienced a major shock during this time period. 

 

Data Analysis and Results 

A series of three linear regressions were run, one for each of Center City (Society Hill 

and Bella Vista), Fairmount (Parkside and Strawberry Mansion), and Schuylkill-

Northwest (Manayunk and East Falls). In order to allow for a more direct comparison 

among the models, and by extension, among the coefficients associated with the local 

district designation in each, the same set of predictor variables was included in each of 

the three models. These variables are: 

-  Type of property (multifamily, single family, mixed-use) 

-  Central air conditioning (a binary variable) 

-  Exterior condition (a numeric variable on a scale of 1 to 5, as evaluated by the 

Office of Property Assessment) 

 

81 A dummy variable is a variable that gives a value of 0 or 1, depending on whether the statement is true. 
For example, a transaction occurring in the year 2005 would have values of “0” for the variable 1999-2003, 
“1” for 2004-2008, “0” for 2009-2013, and “0” for 2014-2018. The coefficients associated with each of the 
variables assigned to 0 do not contribute to the predicted transaction value for a given observation, while 
the remaining variable’s coefficient does.

in Center City, a $34,600 decrease in the Fairmount neighborhoods, and a $8,400 

increase in the Schuylkill-Northwest neighborhoods. This set of values is not meaningful, 

however, given major limitations in all three models. Of the three models, Center City is 

the only one for which the p-value associated with the historic district variable indicates 

that the variable is statistically significant. Despite this indication of significance, even 

the staunchest advocates for the positive association between historic district designation 

and property values would be hard-pressed to argue that designation is associated with 

such a large increase in sales prices. 

Because this project’s goal is not to develop a strong model, but rather to lay the 

groundwork for more thoughtful and cautious use of data, this is as far as the modeling 

itself is taken. The following section of this report, which explores limitations and 

opportunities for further study, delves further into these issues. 

 

 

Limitations and Opportunities for Further Study 

As described above, a limited number of observations and a limited set of predictor 

variables means that these models are not particularly robust. R-squared values of 0.5117, 

0.3974, and 0.6012 for the Center City, Fairmount, and Schuylkill-Northwest pairings, 

respectively, indicate that the predictor variables explain between 40 and 60 percent of 

the variation in sales prices, depending on the pair of neighborhoods in question. Despite 

this, the historic district designation variable is only statistically significant in the Center 

City regression, but not in the others. 

The model explored in this thesis is meant as a preliminary exploration of how 

one might think more creatively about developing quantitative studies in historic

preservation, and certainly not as a definitive model to be used going forward. The 

following concepts and approaches should be explored in greater depth, while 

acknowledging that quantitative findings will always be at best just one piece of a 

broader discussion around historic district designation, and rarely, if ever, determinative 

in and of themselves. 

 

Spatial Autocorrelation 

A major limitation of these models, and one that is common to most of the studies 

surveyed for this project, is that the spatial relationships among data points are not 

explicitly considered. This relationship, known as spatial autocorrelation, is based on 

Waldo Tobler’s First Law of Geography, which states “Everything is related to 

everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.”82 Typically, data 

displaying autocorrelation display a positive spatial relationship, meaning observations 

located near to each other have similar values for a variable; in this example, property 

transactions physically near one another are more likely to be similar. 

Although there are multiple ways to test for spatial autocorrelation, the technique 

of Moran’s I is the most common. This approach calculates a value that typically ranges 

from -1 to +1, with values close to -1 indicating negative spatial relationships, values 

close to +1 indicating positive spatial relationships, and values close to zero indicating 

that there is likely no spatial relationship in the data.

Douglas Richardson, et al., eds. (John Wiley & Sons, Ltd, 2017).

To correct for spatial autocorrelation, a spatial lag or spatial error model could be 

used to more explicitly account for the spatial component of the data. Both of these types 

of models are meant to account for the role of spatial relationships in the data that are 

incorrectly included in the error term in linear regression (given as 

 in the equation on 

page 44). In a spatial error model, the residuals from OLS regression are regressed on the 

𝜀𝜀

residual values of nearby observations, thereby separating the OLS regression residual 

into the part that displays a spatial component and “random noise,” which is part of any 

model that is built using a finite number of observations. In a spatial lag model, the 

values of the dependent variable at nearby observations are included as a separate 

predictor variable in the model. In the case of this project, this would mean including the 

average transaction value for some number of nearby transactions a predictor variable. 

 

Use of a Training and Testing Set 

A stronger model would ideally be built using only a subset of the data available, so that 

it could then be tested on the observations that were removed earlier in the process. A 

comparison of the values predicted by the model with the known values would be used to 

evaluate the model’s strength, and to determine whether it performed better on a 

particular subset of observations (i.e. higher or lower valued properties). This was not 

attempted for this project due to the limited number of transactions in several of the 

selected neighborhoods, as it would have further reduced the size of the model’s training 

set.

A Matched Pair Approach 

A matched pair approach, in which each transaction would be matched with a similar one 

(both temporally and spatially), would allow for greater precision but would potentially 

suffer from an insufficient number of data points, particularly if neighborhood pairings 

were continued to be used. As described by Wiley in The Impact of Commercial 

Development on Surrounding Residential Property Values, “Matched samples increase 

the precision of the comparison between subject and control group observations at the 

expense of lower statistical power (due to fewer observations). The results are noticeably 

sensitive with respect to choice of radius and matching criteria.”83 

 

 

Thoughtfulness in Assigning Labels 

While the three neighborhood pairs selected for this thesis represent three 

different neighborhood typologies, they were intentionally not labeled as high income, 

middle income, and low income (or wealth) groups, as this would have been an 

oversimplification of their conditions that would have added an implied layer of 

judgment to the interpretation. Instead, if one wanted to explore dynamics among 

different income groups or rentership levels, it could make sense to assign every 

residential census tract into the city to one of several groups on the basis of that single 

variable, both to lessen the discomfort with flattening neighborhoods into a single 

defining characteristic as well as to increase the number of observations to be included in 

the model.84 

83 Wiley, The Impact of Commercial Development, 15. 
84 Here, “residential census tracts” is meant only to exclude a very limited number of census tracts, 
including those in which the city’s two airports are located.

Looking Beyond Local Historic Districts 

In addition to the city’s 21 designated local historic districts, additional geographic areas 

have been nominated for designation over the years. These areas, including 33rd Street 

along East Fairmount Park in Strawberry Mansion (included in this thesis as an 

undesignated neighborhood) and Spruce Hill in West Philadelphia, offer compelling 

potential comparison groups, as they are areas that have been formally recognized for 

their historic value (by virtue of being considered for designation), but are not impacted 

by the oversight given by actual designation. 

A study incorporating both local historic districts as well as non-designated 

neighborhoods that have received other form of recognition for historical significance, 

including through Neighborhood Conservation Districts (e.g. Queen Village), or Main 

Street programs (e.g. Tacony) could offer additional information, although the limited 

amount of data available may make this challenging. Additionally, one could explore 

differences in trends within designated historic districts with properties immediately 

outside of them. This would allow for greater control over differences between the groups 

than the approach taken in this report. 

 

A Note on Data Collection and Quality 

Any quantitative model is only as strong as the data that is used to build it. Data quality 

issues include both inconsistencies and inaccuracies within existing city datasets as well 

as a lack of data collection, particularly related to historic resources. As more cities, 

including Philadelphia, begin to plan more seriously for comprehensive historic survey, it 

will be important to ensure that data management practices allow for smooth integration

of past survey work into the process, and for data to be consistently maintained and 

updated over time. 

Beyond a grounding in quantitative methods from a theoretical standpoint, 

historic preservationists would benefit from a deeper understanding and appropriate use 

of locally available datasets. In Philadelphia, datasets offering property- and parcel-level 

data can contradict one another, adding challenges beyond theoretical data analysis and 

modeling. For example, parcel boundaries drawn by the Philadelphia Water Department 

differ from those from the Department of Records, neither of which corresponds directly 

with property records from the Office of Property Assessment (OPA). Even beyond the 

difficulties in combining separate datasets, inconsistencies within a single source can 

introduce uncertainty into the accuracy of individual variables. Recorded building 

construction years are approximated when they are not known and rounded to the nearest 

decade (Figure 12, on the following page), but they are also sometimes fully incorrect. 

While a construction date that is off by a year or two does not pose major issues, the 

OPA’s dataset reports that there are fewer than 9,000 residential buildings in Philadelphia 

constructed before the year 1900; an in-depth survey of the neighborhood of Strawberry 

Mansion found at least 1,700 such properties in an area of less than one square mile.85 

These types of issues are outlined more broadly in the chapter by Andrew Dolkart in 

Preservation and the New Data Landscape.86 

 

85 Research conducted as part of a studio course in historic preservation, fall 2017. In addition to the 
properties included in this count are at least 4,000 properties constructed between 1895 and 1910, also 
within Strawberry Mansion.

Perhaps more concerning in the case of this project (which relies on property sales 

data over a twenty year period), data entry errors can mean that even transaction years are 

incorrect – a quick look into recent property transactions in Philadelphia revealed at least 

one property with a transaction date in the future (with 2019 given instead of the actual

POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 

From a policy perspective, the value in using a quantitative approach is based on its 

flexibility and potential for applicability in a range of city contexts. This also means, 

however, that it is impossible to capture the full nuance of what it means for a place to be 

designated and regulated as historic. Although an understanding of hedonic regression 

methods can and should be an expectation among professionals working in preservation 

planning, these approaches cannot be used as the sole or primary defense for preservation 

policy. Claims that designation will lead to positive economic outcomes open the 

discussion up for opposing findings that could then overpower other, potentially positive 

outcomes, including ones that are not economic in nature. 

 

Perhaps most concerning is the possibility that quantitative studies conducted on 

the neighborhood scale (as is done in this report) could be used as part of the evaluation 

process for an individual area under consideration for historic district designation. Such 

an approach would lay the groundwork for designation to become a tool only applied to 

particular types of neighborhoods, perhaps those in which households already have the 

resources to invest freely in physical upkeep.88 

 

 

Looking Beyond Property Value 

A deeper understanding of the dynamics at play in different types of neighborhoods could 

be used in the development of more targeted tools to support communities in locally 

designated historic districts. For example, if a more robust model were to find differences 

88 This concern is also apparent when considering that different levels of incentives could potentially be 
tied to different types of local historic designation, if less restrictive forms of designation were to be 
introduced.

in the association between designation and property values in owner-occupied compared 

to renter-occupied residences, policymakers could strengthen an argument for a 

specialized set of incentives that could better respond to residents’ (whether property 

owners’ or renters’) needs.89 

 

Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credits and Designation 

As outlined in Section 3 of this thesis, the Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit program 

(also known as the Historic Tax Credit or Historic Preservation Tax Credit program and 

abbreviated as HTC) is a major incentive for historic designation on the National 

Register. This program, which offers a twenty percent income tax credit for qualifying 

rehabilitation projects of historic buildings, has contributed to a total of more than 44,000 

rehabilitation projects since it was established in 1976, corresponding to nearly 97 billion 

dollars of investment in historic properties. In fiscal year 2018 alone, 6.9 billion dollars 

of private investment was spent on projects ranging in size from under 250 thousand to 

more than 25 million dollars.90 

 

The benefits offered through the Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit program (as 

well as the State Historic Preservation Tax Credit program, which is currently available 

in 35 states, including Pennsylvania) are a major incentive for historic district 

designation, as designation unlocks the potential for tax credits for incoming-generating 

properties. In the neighborhood of East Parkside, for example, the potential for tax credits 

 

89 As described on page 13 of this thesis, this distinction would be almost impossible to make on a property 
level, although an approach similar to the one used in this thesis could be used to separate local historic 
districts into groups based on overall rentership versus owner occupancy rates.

led resident and developer James Brown IV and the Parkside Historic Preservation 

Corporation (PHPC) to get Parkside designated to the National Register of Historic 

Places in 1987, making it eligible for historic tax credits that Mr. Brown used to help 

make his investments financially viable, shaping investment patterns in the neighborhood 

over the past forty years. 

Because of the close connection between designation (on the National Register of 

Historic Places, but also on local registers in certified local governments) and historic tax 

credits, concerns are sometimes raised that designation might incentivize the conversion 

of owner-occupied houses into rental properties. While there is not anything inherently 

negative about rental properties, these concerns are sometimes tied to a changing 

neighborhood character, whether through the introduction of large developers or through 

a fear of lower income households moving in, as well as to a perception that renters may 

be less invested in their neighborhoods than are homeowners. A recognition of these 

concerns, and of their implications, is central to understanding the true impact of historic 

district designation, beyond its impact purely on property values. 

 

Rising Value, Affordability, and Displacement 

As Freeman and Schuetz point out in “Producing Affordable Housing in Rising 

Markets,” incentives for producing affordable residential units for homeownership 

typically stipulate only a limited period of affordability, with fifteen years for the 

required initial compliance period in the case of LIHTC, for example.91 With this in

mind, advocates for housing affordability are increasingly calling for programs that either 

support renters (as these are less often term limited, whether they follow the household, 

as in voucher programs, or are tied to the property) or for ones that extend the period of 

affordability for ownership properties.92 Such programs in the latter group might include 

community land trusts and limited equity cooperatives.93 

In their data-driven study of the Federal Rehabilitation Tax Credit program 

(HTC), Ryberg-Webster and Kinahan recommend greater integration among affordable 

housing incentives and HTC; while housing developers often use LIHTC and HTC 

together, they combine the HTC program with Section 8, Section 202, and HOME less 

frequently – this is a missed opportunity that could potentially shift with increased 

integration among affordable housing programs and incentives for historic preservation; 

while such a process would no doubt require substantial challenges from both the 

regulatory and administrative perspective, it would have the potential to have a real 

impact on the role of historic preservation in affordable housing development.94 

 

Renter Protections 

Renter protection, in the form of stronger state or local legislation, could both improve 

physical conditions in rented units as well as offer protections against rapidly rising rents 

and/or formal or informal evictions. While the concept of renter protections is not 

generally seen as a tool for historic preservation (but instead one for housing 

preservation, which generally refers to the preservation of affordability), recent shifts in

the discipline of historic preservation are beginning to recognize how interrelated the two 

truly are. The decoupling of one from the other (historic preservation from housing 

preservation and affordability) is a false dichotomy that flattens a complex relationship 

and contributes to concerns that historic preservation is about the built fabric and 

aesthetic qualities above all else.95 

Given the dynamics of ownership and rentership described throughout this thesis 

and in the affordable housing literature, it is imperative that historic preservation 

advocates begin to engage more with this issue. While rental units introduce the potential 

for changes to buildings’ physical fabric, and to uncertainty more broadly, greater 

alignment between historic preservation and housing preservation will strengthen the role 

of each. Philadelphia recently introduced a bill to allow accessory dwelling units (ADUs) 

in historically designated properties, a move that could support homeowners (as ADUs 

must be part of owner-occupied properties) by offering an additional income stream, 

while expanding the stock of affordable rental housing.96 

 

Final Thoughts 

Through an in-depth case study, this thesis has aimed to demonstrate both the need for 

deeper engagement with quantitative methods as well as an appropriate level of 

skepticism of their potential role in developing and critiquing policy decisions. This case

study, which explored the complicated association between local district designation and 

transaction values in Philadelphia without glossing over the messiness of the data and 

findings, aims to illustrate the need for future practitioners to become more comfortable 

sharing and interpreting complex findings. An understanding of quantitative methods 

cannot and should not replace policy expertise, but should rather supplement it – while 

there is a danger in relying too heavily on quantitative findings (particularly considering 

how they are so rarely as clear cut as they may initially appear), widespread gains in data 

literacy will add new tools from which historic preservationists can draw, ones that are 

already part of the common language in adjacent fields.

Dear Council Members,

DePasquale, Louie; Clerk
East Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District Study

As a life long resident in my home at 49 Gore Street, I wholeheartedly support the East Cambridge Neighborhood 
Conservation District Study. My house was built in 1820 and, as you may already know, is in the National Register of 
Historic Places. Many supporters have written and referenced many documents in direct contradiction to our 
opponents' unfounded claims, so I feel no need to expand on that area further.

My claim is simple: There is absolutely no reason why the Study should not go forward. To deny the many neighborhood 
residents who simply want to protect the character of their surroundings from overdevelopment by large, 
nonconforming structures even the study process for determination is neither fair nor sensible. To prioritize the desires 
of those who choose to distort the facts and intentions of those of us who treasure our homes and character of our East 
Cambridge neighborhood would be inexcusable of you as our representatives. I respectfully urge you to support this 
study.

Sincerely,

Audrey A Cunningham
49 Gore Street

Hello,

Alex Wang <awswim@gmail.com>
Sunday, October 18, 2020 11:32 PM
Clerk; City Council
October 19, 2020 City Council public comment - POR 2020 #230

I am writing support of POR 2020 #230 to expand COVID-19 testing in Cambridge. On October 9, I waited over 6 hours 
in-person to receive a COVID-19 test, in an experience that ended up being more miserable and fatiguing than my 
actual illness.

My wife has risk factors for COVID-19, so when I started experiencing a runny nose and sore throat on a Thursday 
afternoon, I immediately isolated in a different part of my home and looked to get a test the next day.

I read through news from the Cambridge city website and daily update email, which explained testing options. The 
online guidance made it seem like getting test results quickly at a CHA or city-run site was not an option. No 
appointments were available until October 23. If for some reason I was able to get walk-up service, which was not 
described, the website said results were typically turned around in as many as 5 days. So I walked to the CareWell 
Urgent Care in Inman Square to get a test.

I arrived at 12:20pm and stood in an outdoor line of around 30 people inside the CareWell parking lot. For the first 2 
hours, the line kept moving, with them taking 4 people at a time. Once I was in this "final 4," the line stopped moving 
altogether for another two hours. No CareWell people provided an update. During this time, I saw over 20 people 
either leave the line or get turned away because they had reached capacity at 3:30pm.

After four hours, I was finally moved inside, where I waited 45 minutes in the lobby with as many as 8 other patients. 
The asymptomatic people in my group received tests during this wait, as they did not need to see a doctor and paid 
$160 out of pocket to get tested. I was then admitted to an exam room, swabbed 30 minutes later and then waited an 
additional 60 minutes to see the doctor without any staff entering the room to let me know what was going on. When 
the doctor finally arrived, he indicated that he had been delayed because one of the patients in the building at the same 
time as me tested positive. After a brief conversation, I finally left the building at 7:00pm, more than 6 hours later.

Although I was fortunate to test negative, it was a very harrowing experience which made me anxious. I spent more than 
two hours inside a building with people with later-confirmed COVID-19 infections, which could have put me at even 
more risk by getting tested. I think someone suffering from a strong illness or someone not able to stand for long 
periods of time cannot wait for a test like this, and winter weather will make the wait even more difficult.

Sites like CareWell Urgent Care need more doctors to handle the number of cases they are seeing - the doctor who saw 
me explained that they went from around 30 customers per day last year to 150-180 per day today. They need more 
doctors to inform patients of results and to keep the line moving during lunch breaks, and they need more staff to tell 
patients what is going on through this process. Please fund testing capability at these sites, whether public or private.

I urge you to add more testing sites, advertise these more aggressively to residents, and allow for walk-up testing.

Thank you,
Alex Wang
45 Market St.

Time to Change the Narrative about Cambridge Conservation Districts

At the last public meeting held this past March, the chairperson of the Cambridge Historical Commission study 

group adjourned the meeting early to stop a raucous discussion focused on the wording of the very first 

paragraph of a draft describing the goals of an East Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District. The 

wording in question had to do with what is first. Is it people first? Is it buildings first?

Is it people first? Opponents for creating a conservation district emphatically emphasized people first. And 

they had a very specific definition of people first people – they are renters, young people with families, those 

who would qualify for affordable housing and Kendall Square high-tech workers. To quote one of the 

opponents, “People make history – not buildings.”

Is it buildings first? Proponents for creating a conservation district seemed to jump right past people first to 

focus on buildings first and what would be the architectural guidelines for the neighborhood. Many were 

longtime homeowners in East Cambridge. Were they putting buildings first simply to accrue more power and 

get even richer as the people first people claimed?

I believe we can change the narrative if we recognize that a conservation district is stewardship first. It is 

about taking care of our East Cambridge neighborhood so that we can continue to experience its rich social 

and architectural past. Stewardship is a shared responsibility - young, old, renters and homeowners alike. The 

basis is much more than “the desire of an older generation to preserve the neighborhood from their 

childhood” (Cambridge Day Opinion Oct. 7th). This neighborhood’s history goes way past anyone’s childhood. 

The oldest buildings date from the early 1800s. The street grid we walk, bike and drive on today was laid out 

209 years ago – just 35 years after the Declaration of Independence was signed. 

Stewardship is all about treating East Cambridge with care and respect in order to conserve it for those who 

come after us. Proponents of a conservation district fear that the neighborhood will be overwhelmed, and its 

history erased, because of its proximity to Kendall Square and Cambridge Crossing. Real estate is about three 

variables - location, location and location. Location is driving up housing prices and rents in East Cambridge.

Opponents’ false claims to the contrary, making a portion of East Cambridge a conservation district will not 

accelerate housing prices and increase rents. The unprecedented commercial development surrounding East 

Cambridge is equivalent to the speed of light for property values, and a conservation district will not make it 

go any faster. 

4.21.a

If opponents for creating an East Cambridge Conservation District think stewardship is not in their or anyone 

else’s best interests, then the division becomes between those who value the neighborhood’s history and 

want to conserve it and those who do not. I hope this is not our future. In place of everyone now lining up for 

the political battle between people first! and buildings first!, we can change the narrative to be about 

stewardship first! and accept the responsibility to work together to meet both first objectives within an East 

Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District.

Best,

John

Re: City council agenda- Fresh Pond golf course

Thank you for the information, Anthony. I found the agenda .

If it makes any difference, I would like to express my support for City Manager DePasquale's recommendation that the 
Fresh Pond Golf Course continue operating as it currently does, and it should not open the golf course to general 
recreational use during the golf season.

Subject: City council agenda- Fresh Pond golf course

Hi Kate,

Thank you,

Sam

My friend mentioned to me that the city council would be discussing a proposal to close the Fresh Pond golf course on 
certain days to allow general walking, etc. He said that the council would be discussing it on Monday October 19, is that 
correct? I tried looking for that meeting's agenda, but couldn't find 
it: http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Default.aspx

I'd like to learn more about the proposal--do you have any information on it, or could you point me in the right 
direction?

Quadrangle Northwest Zoning Petition
Cambridge Highlands-CCF Response (2020-10-14)-FINAL.pdf; AOD-1 Rezoning Petition 
(2020-10-14)-FILED.pdf

Regarding the latest iteration of CC&F’s zoning petition, which is now before you, I have the 
following comments:

1) In their newest petition (attached), they have continued to include the following sentence:
“The Planning Board may include as a condition to an AOD-1 Master Plan Special 
Permit a time limit of ten years or longer for completion of the entire master plan, which 
deadline may be extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and may 
include conditions attached to different phases.” You must limit the project to a 
maximum of ten years. Any longer than that and they should be forced to seek new 
approvals. This can’t become another North Point: a dusty half-finished project 
mothballed for a decade or more.

2) In their written response to the Highland Quad Committee’s letter (also attached), they 
state that, in regards to signing a Letter of Understanding to ensure that they actually 
build what they promise to build, “we will follow the direction of the Council on this 
matter.” The direction of the Council must be clear: we need a signed Letter of 
Understanding.

3) Why do we need an MOU? Mainly because they still are not promising to build a 
bridge. Indeed, their latest application to the Conservation Commission includes site 
plans that make no mention whatsoever of a bridge. I can only assume that they don’t 
actually plan to build it at all.

4) Given that they have no purchased 4 additional acres within the zoning district, they 

should be required to provide a pro forma showing the value increase the proposed 
up-zoning will have to their property. I assume that it would be more than enough to pay 
for a bridge, the much needed reconstruction of Smith Place, a linear path along the rail 
corridor at the northern edge of their property as called for in the Alewife Plan, Blair 
Pond mitigation, a new fire station, and/or anything else the City desires at that location.

5) And yet again, they continue to disguise this property owner’s petition in the form of 
a citizens’ petition. This does an extreme disservice to any citizen who has actually

give up this charade? Honestly, it’s embarrassing, if not illegal. And if they won’t, then 
the citizens who signed the petition should be forced to show up and present the petition 
to the Ordinance Committee and the Planning Board themselves.

Thanks for allowing me to share my thought on this seemingly never-ending petition process. 
Good luck in your deliberations. Hopefully you can bring forth amendments to address these

Response to Cambridge Highlands-Quad Committee’s Requests to AOD-1 Petition 

Cambridge City Council (“Council”) 
Cambridge Highlands-Quad Committee (“Highlands”) 

 
To: 
Cc: 
From:  Cabot, Cabot & Forbes (“CC&F”) 
Re: 
 
 
Dear City Councilors: 
 
As you know, on May 14th, 2020, the Cambridge Highlights Quad Committee issued a letter 
outlining eleven points for consideration by the CC&F and the Council during its review of the 
AOD-1 Zoning Petition (“Petition”).  We have studied the Highlands’ requests and offer the 
following responses and clarifications. 
 
We welcome your comments and look forward to working with the Highlands and the Council 
towards resolution of Highlands comments. 
 
 
1.  50 ft-wide no-build green zone is set-aside and planted with minimum 8 inch diameter 
at breast height (DBH) trees between Highlands residential abutters’ property lines 
and the Alewife Quadrangle Northwest overlay district with CCF’s buildings and 
building height step-backs of 35’, 45’ and 55’. (Current zoning allows a 25 ft-wide buffer, 
which is too close to a residential area of small-sized homes.) 

 

We agree that creating a buffer between the Highlands neighborhood and the AOD-1 district 
is central to considering any development proposal within the overlay district.   
 
Through its reference to the guidelines within Alewife District Plan, the Petition 
contemplates not only buffering the neighborhood with robust landscaping, but also with 
locating non-active residential uses nearest the Highland neighborhood (as opposed to more 
active commercial uses, which are targeted further east towards Smith Place). 
 
Through its reference to Section 20.95.2(1)(a) of the current zoning ordinance, the Petition 
explicitly maintains the setback zones that increasingly limit maximum building height 
approaching the neighborhood: 25’ no-build area, then 35’ to 45’ buffer to the 80’- 85’full 
height areas as recommended within the Alewife District Plan.  At 35’, the closest allowable 
height to the Highlands neighborhood would approximately match the height of the homes 
that border the AOD-1 district.   
 
The Petition seeks alignment with the Envision Alewife District Plan, and therefore does not 
currently increase the 25’ no-build area; however, we have communicated this request from 
the Highlands to the City’s Planning Staff and Planning Board for consideration.  That said, 
even if this change is not adopted in the zoning, it is something that we can accommodate in

The diagram below is a closer view of the increased no-build zone from the residential 
district closest to Loomis Street.  Please note that the townhomes along Loomis Street were 
not built in the residential district, and so the proposed no-build zone intersects with those 
existing buildings.

We agree that implementing landscaping in the no-build area is a good strategy to enhance 
the buffer between the AOD-1 district and the Highlands neighborhood.  
 
Subject to further design review by the Planning Board and the Fire Department (to ensure 
adequate fire access), we would like to work with representatives of the Highlands 
neighborhood to develop a planting plan that includes an appropriate buffer plan where the 
property line borders the Highlands neighborhood.  This planting schedule would be created 
during the special permit process subsequent to the Petition approval, would comply with 
the Cambridge Approved Species List, and would seek to minimize the urban heat island 
effect of the proposed development as a whole.  Below is a conceptual diagram of how the 
Mooney Street special permit proposal could propose to implement screening and a 
landscaping buffer for the Loomis Street townhouses.  Please note this diagram assumes that 
the 50’ no-build zone is implemented, as requested by the Highlands.

2.  Include the developer’s 4-ft elevation above ground level and the height of rooftop 

infrastructures/mechanicals in the total heights of all buildings and the public parking 
garage.  

 

 

This neighborhood is generally prone to flooding and therefore any redevelopment should 
appropriately incorporate resiliency measures to account for extreme weather events.  The 
City’s evaluation of best practices is ongoing, however the current recommendation as 
stated within the Alewife District Plan is to raise the first floor elevation of the proposed 
buildings at or above the 2070, 10-year storm-surge/sea level rise elevation, which in the 
case of Mooney Street is approximately 4’ above existing grade in some locations.  So that 
proponents are incentivized to utilize these best practices (and are not penalized as a result 
of implementing these designs), the Alewife District Plan also recommends excluding this 
~4’ from the calculation of height, and the Petition is consistent with this approach.  
Mechanical penthouses are not included in the definition of height as is consistent with City-
wide practices; however, per the zoning ordinance and design guidelines within the Alewife 
District Plan the penthouses would be setback from the roof line and screened from 
pedestrian view.  Finally, the objectives of the Alewife District Plan to foster the creation of 
light industrial and consumer-facing businesses with the requisite minimum 20’ floor-to-
floor height on the ground floor would run counter to Highlands’ request to include the 4’ 
elevation of Moody Street and rooftop mechanical rooms in the height limits. 

 
3.  No motor or autonomous vehicle access to Highlands currently or in the future.  
 

Confirmed that no motor or autonomous vehicle access to the Highlands is currently 
planned now or in the future.

4.  Blair Pond Reservation. Blair Pond Reservation is public property owned and managed by 

DCR. CCF and other owners of the 26 acres will: 

a.  Contribute annually to a conservation fund overseen by DCR. 
b.  Work with Blair Pond Association and DCR to: 
i.  Prepare for and manage increased usage  
ii.  Improve and maintain the site  

c.  Provide an accessible dog park away from the Blair Pond Reservation to minimize 

the impact of dogs on the Blair Pond Reservation.  

Generally, we agree with these comments.  Blair Pond is a great amenity for the area that 
appears to be somewhat underutilized by the public.  We would like to see Blair Pond meet 
its full potential for enjoyment by members of our proposed community and the 
neighborhood at large.  All of the above suggestions are certainly possibilities; however, 
before committing to specific mitigation we need to coordinate with DCR who owns the 
land.  We anticipate starting this dialogue during the special permit process, subsequent to 
the Petition review. 

 
5.  Independent hydrology study of runoff and other impacts of site elevation on the 

surroundings; flood mitigation plan 

a.  Use integrated best management (used on the golf course at Fresh Pond to protect the 

public water supply) and environmentally safe salting (winter) 

b.  Use permeable paving materials and xeriscaping 

The City has hired an independent peer reviewer for the project, we look forward to working 
with that company to affirm our approach to these issues. 
 
We are not familiar with the specific practices used at Fresh Pond but would welcome 
review upon receipt of those specifics, but we are committed to using Best Management 
Practices (BMP), which includes periodic inspections of catch basins, water quality units, 
detention systems and flood storage areas.  Effective street sweeping procedures and catch 
basin maintenance in early Spring shall be used to mitigate the effect of sand accumulation 
on site.  We have many areas where we are planning for permeable pavers and xeriscaping 
throughout the plan – these locations will be finalized during the special permit process. 

 
6.  Independent shadow study of impacts of building heights 
 

Our shadow studies are shown in the diagram below.  The blue color highlights the shadows 
cast by our proposed project, which shows that no new shadows are cast on the Highlands 
during the year. Any peer reviews/independent studies are typically completed during the 
special permit process, subsequent to the zoning petition, at the request of the Planning 
Board.

7.  Seek input from abutters concerning 

and the Highlands-Quad, i.e.: 

a.  Proposed bridge amenity bridge connection over MBTA tracks between the Triangle 

i.  Shuttle, bike, pedestrian, handicap, motorized bikes, scooters  
ii.  Bike share amenities on CCF property and Alewife T station and on the 

 

northern side of bridge. 

iii.  Bridge ownership and maintenance 
iv.  MBTA approval 

b.  Independent traffic study including bike path connections 

 

To date we have held several meetings with the Highlands neighborhood and other interest 
groups to introduce our proposal and answer any questions.  Prior to submitting for the 
special permit, we would solicit feedback within additional public meetings about all 
project-related considerations, as well as the bridge. 
 
As a prerequisite to special permit filings, the Cambridge Traffic, Parking & Transportation 
Department reviews and independently certifies the scope and final form of the proponent’s 
traffic study. 

 
8.  Property management 

a.  Pre-construction baseline survey of abutters’ properties; communicate with residential 

abutters about construction schedules 
 
Confirmed. 

6 

Packet Pg. 477

 

b.  Noise reduction: 

i.  Install low-noise technology automatic garage door openers, motors, fans, and 
other noise-generating equipment; maximum noise decibel level to comply 
with noise ordinance 

ii.  Trash/recycling, commercial deliveries, commercial and residential moves, 

etc., to comply with city noise ordinance 

iii.  Locate dumpsters and rooftop utilities (pools, HVAC, vents) away from 

abutters; screen rooftop mechanicals  

iv.  Onsite 24/7 property management and security 
v.  Control dust and dirt during demolition and construction to protect workers 

and abutters in high-wind conditions 

 
All proposals and project designs will comply with the City noise ordinances and 
adhere to the City’s design guidelines for mechanicals (which include setbacks and 
screening), etc.  This level of detail has not yet been developed and we expect that 
these types of considerations would be included in the special permit process, 
subsequent to the zoning petition. 

 
c.  Lighting: 

 

i.  Show lighting plan and reduce exterior, interior, security lights and signage 

especially on buildings facing abutters and Blair Pond; 

ii.  Set and enforce buildings’ turn off and turn on lighting times for after-hours, 

weekends and three-day weekends; 

Similar to above, this level of detail has not yet been developed and we expect that 
these types of considerations would be included in the special permit process, 
subsequent to the zoning petition.  We fully intend for the lighting plan to be sensitive 
to the community and in particular the open space and residential districts to the west 
of the AOD-1 overlay. 

 

9.  Site planting and management plan 

a.  Greenery and tree planting to comply with the city’s climate mitigation and tree 

b.  Install benches, tables, play spaces,  paths, and similar structures to residential and 

canopy recommendations 

commercial tenants and the public 

 
All proposals and project planting and management plans will follow the City’s zoning 
ordinance.  We aim to reduce the urban heat island effect through various measures, 
including a robust landscaping program.  Additionally, we have preliminary plans showing 
an enhanced pedestrian friendly streetscape environment, including the features noted 
above.  This level of detail has not yet been developed and we expect that these types of

considerations would be included in the special permit process, subsequent to the zoning 
petition. 

 
10.  Home ownership  provides another housing option in addition to the City’s 20% 

affordable housing mandate 

We acknowledge the desire for home ownership as well as rental housing; however, in this 
location we believe that rental buildings would benefit this project by providing institutional 
controls on the maintenance of the property. Currently the residential buildings are 
contemplated as rental. 

 
11.  File a signed Letter of Understanding with the City that directly ties the zoning 
changes to the completion of the proposed development and public benefits 

 

 

We will follow the direction of the Council on this matter.

I oppose PO. #9

I oppose P.O. #9 as being almost as much B.S. as the Affordable Housing Overlay. We have had conservation districts, 
historical districts, and zoning in Cambridge for decades and housing was still affordable. What has made housing 
unaffordable is a multi-decades housing bubble resulting in skyrocketing housing costs. 

A back door policy to prevent conservation districts will do nothing to reduce rents. Anyone who thinks this needs to 
study what happened at Alewife. All you will get is more expensive market-rate mega buildings. Don't fall for this scam.

CDD removed zoning and conservation protections from Alewife and gave them enormous density increases. The result? 
Some of the most expensive housing in Cambridge, a 500-sq ft unit rents at $2,500 to live in a box over the turnpike on 
contaminated land that floods. And unlike mom and pop homeowners, the rich owners of these mega-buildings don't 
need to lower rents in a bad economy. They make so much money that they could have a 50% vacancy rate and still not 
have to lower their rents.

CITY COUNCIL- AGAINST NCD FORCED HOUSING STUDY
CC- ECCD conservation district October 8 20.docx

Please find attached my letter opposing the request that the Historical Commission be required
to do another department's work RE: do an analysis of the potential effects on City housing affordability
in a conservation district...so that the council may "holistically evaluate the matter".

I do not think the council qualified to understand the cultural value of a conservation district
let alone study the true underlying causes of rent escalation and housing issues to begin with.

October 19, 2020 + City Council + AGAINST PO #9- (#218) 
 
Dear City Council, 
I am writing AGAINST PO #9, asking the Historical Commission to include a housing analysis in 
their Conservation District study.  This is not in commission’s purview. It is the job of the 
housing department and CDD to determine.  What this should be about is community 
preservation in the shadow of big development, the courthouse, parking garage and Galleria. 
After all, it is developers who will benefit the most with free range poaching as we lose more 
Cambridge history to gentrification. Encroaching Kendall Sq is the real culprit affecting property 
values and rents. 

Conservation Districts are not frozen in amber. Unlike Historical Districts, they are flexible.  
Guidelines allow infill, additions, renovation and interior change while protecting and 
documenting compelling architectural character for future generations. This is important. We 
only have to look at Boston’s West End during the Urban Renewal of the 50s and 60s 
spearheaded by politics, business, institutions and bio/ tech. The neighborhood of 
predominantly Italian, Jewish, and Portuguese immigrants were moved out for towers they 
couldn’t afford. Jane Jacobs discusses this in “The Death and Life of Great American Cities”.  

North End, a cherished neighborhood, was to be wiped out as well, but wasn’t. At one point, 
Cambridge’s own City Planning Director had the attitude that housing older than 50 Years was 
bad housing and should be replaced.  Mid-Cambridge Conservation District has not dampened 
rents, additions or renovations.  Senior citizens were still evicted from a mid-rise building slated 
for market-rate rentals.   

Developers, in the name of progress and commercial pressure, buy contingent blocks of houses 
in anticipation of big square buildings.  When dumped in landfill, those older houses contribute 
to the carbon footprint.  East Cambridge is not stagnant but is a living document identifying and 
preserving the social and growth patterns of an immigrant neighborhood even recognized in 
Envision.  Why are long-time property owners who struggled to purchase, who inherited like 
one councilor has, who live in modest houses in vintage communities being marginalized? If 
anything, these enclaves tend to stabilize both sky-rocketing rents and property values.  It is 
new construction that is raising rent.  

What seems implicit in this order is the pitting of factions against each other with a pre-
determined outcome by elements who have hijacked our local government. There also seems 
to be an agenda behind this request making one wonder if the Council can be objective enough 
to “holistically evaluate” the value of historical records and existing material culture?

We depend on the City Council to work for ALL citizens and neighborhoods, their environment, 
history, context, social issues. If activist members want to solely focus on housing, perhaps they 
should work for a non-profit and leave the broader governance to other more even-handed 
elected officials. These East Cambridge blocks are important in documenting how Cambridge 
developed and by whom. They are also sources of stabilized rentals and properties.  

We do not need to throw the baby out with the bath water.  We have an opportunity to really 
look at why housing isn’t working. We need to keep 3-family houses from being returned to 
single-family everywhere.   

 He who tells the story is more important than government in looking at history.  A 
Conservation district has nothing to do with escalating rental and housing prices which is 
happening city-wide regardless.

Yetman, Paula; Charles Scott Doty
FW: Cambridge Brands Curb Cut request  Follow up with Neighborhood associations

Dear Cambridge City Council Members;

Cambridge Brands at 810 Main Street attempted to follow-up with the Area Neighborhood 
Association and have received the following responses:

• The Margaret Fuller House (Several attempts via phone to reach the Margaret Fuller 

House via Dr. Kimberly Massenburg were made without success).
• Area4 Neighborhood Association(See email Correspondence below)
• Essex Street Neighbors responded via email without objection

We hope you respond favorably to our curb cut request and recognize that we made good 
faith attempts to reach out to area Associations.

As the last remaining candy manufacturing plant in Cambridge of the original 66, your support 
with our building project is greatly appreciated. This final step in securing our building permit 
will help ensure the longevity of the iconic candy brands of Junior Mints, Charleston Chew, 
Sugar Babies, Junior Caramels, Tootsie Roll Mini Bites and Tootsie Fruit Chew Mini Bites 
produced in Cambridge. As the employer of 180 employees in the City of Cambridge we hope 
to make these needed upgrades to keep our operation thriving for many years to come. 

Most Sincerely;
Paula Yetman
Plant Manager
Cambridge Brands Inc.

NO on POR 2020 #218

'I don't understand you,' said Alice. 'It's dreadfully confusing!'
'That's the effect of living backwards,' the Queen said kindly: 'it always makes one a little giddy at first--'
'Living backwards!' Alice repeated in great astonishment. 'I never heard of such a thing!'

Dear Councilors, City Manager, City Clerk, and CHC Executive Director,

I find policy order POR 2020 #218 to be confusing, built on false premises, and dangerous.

I'm writing in support of proceeding with the East Cambridge conservation study period as planned, including the COVID-19 
extension. Adding additional hurdles to an already difficult and established process risks folding the interests of non-resident 
developers into the mix, rather than focusing on the interests of Cambridge residents.

Despite well-researched evidence to the contrary, a small group of vocal protestors claims that the designation of a conservation 
district would reduce housing affordability in the neighborhood. Whether wittingly or not, their efforts serve to protect the
economic interests of developers, who have no interest in the heritage of the neighborhood, but who benefit from unencumbered 
access to a field of houses in close proximity to Kendall Square and Cambridge Crossing. These they flip for profit. This leads 
not only to astronomical rent increases and displacement, but permanent neighborhood disfigurement.

Housing affordability is a critical concern that happily dovetails with the goals of the initiators of this study, who seek to protect 
their neighborhood from artificially inflated property value while preserving its unique character. The only interest that is not 
aligned here is the developers' interest.

My objections to this policy order:

•

•

•

•

The argument that a historical designation increases home values and rent in the neighborhood and surrounding 
neighborhoods does not hold water in East Cambridge, where real estate is being aggressively driven up by prime 
location and the influx of renters and buyers with inflated salaries from local biotech firms.
There is no clarification as to the identity of the "community partners" with whom the City Manager should "confer" in 
order to make committee meetings more participatory. Furthermore these meetings are already mandated to be open to 
anyone to attend and participate in.
The use of the word "mitigations" on the potential effects on affordability is presumptuous and misleading, as the 
conservation designation itself would be a mitigation against the devastating effects of development upon East 
Cambridge affordability.
For an academic and professional analysis of the potential effects on city housing affordability based on current 
research on Cambridge and beyond, please see the Cambridge Day article presented by Suzanne Blier, a Harvard 
professor, who has taken the time to investigate and refute the spurious claims of a blogger.

• As for the legal implications of extending the conservation study period, the COVID-19 pandemic has demanded that 
nothing in 2020 proceed "business as usual". It is only fair that we extend this process until we have the resources 
available to devote to it.

It would be great if you could explain how this policy order came to be, when we already have a process for the designation of a 
conservation district in place. Who are the stakeholders who are attempting to influence you to add additional hurdles to the 
determination of the preservation value of a neighborhood?

Please vote NO on this nonsensical policy order.

Thank you.

Alexandra Whisnant

Residents Alliance letter supporting stronger Eviction Moratorium

Perez, Lori

From:
Sent:
To:

Subject:

Importance:

High

Dear Mayor and Councilors,

I am writing for the Cambridge Residents Alliance supporting a stronger Cambridge Eviction Moratorium (Policy Order 
#10/ #232).  We have been asking for stronger tenant protections for years, and certainly protection from eviction 
would be our top priority.  We are worried that the end of the state eviction moratorium, along with the weakness and 
complexity of the federal eviction moratorium, could lead to numerous evictions here in Cambridge.  The new state 
program will not be available quickly enough to help income-eligible tenants, so preventing eviction is even more 
important.  And eviction tends to disproportionately impact people of color and low income people.

We urge the Council to pass PO #10, which calls for working with the Legal Dept. to include enforcement language that 
prevents landlords from trying to force tenants out before a Sheriff enforces an eviction.

If this is passed, we ask that updated info on Cambridge’s eviction moratorium be mailed to all tenants and landlords.

On other tenant protection issues, I would also note that I am a landlord of a two-family, and have not yet received the 
city’s postcard (CMA #235) about the existing Cambridge eviction moratorium and the new tenant protection rules that 
began on 10/14.  We request that full written copies of that policy, not just postcards, be mailed to both current tenants 
and landlords.

We would also like to the Council to request an update from city staff on how much demand for all types of housing 
services has increased during the pandemic, and how that demand has been met (or not), including for legal 
services.  The Council may need to allocate more funds to assist tenants.

On other matters on tonight’s agenda, we strongly support the Truck Safety Ordinance for trucks used by city vendors 
(CMA #234), so as to make city streets less dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians.

We feel the manager’s position (CMA #228) on requiring covering or art in empty storefronts is not adequate.  We 
continue to support the Council’s request to create a registry of empty storefronts, so the problem of empty storefronts 
can be tracked and root solutions can be developed that help retail.

Sincerely,

Lee Farris, President
Cambridge Resident Alliance

POR 2020 #218 - minor mistake in amendment

I believe that there was a minor mistake in the final clause as amended. The order had two dates -- the first was October 
19th, the latter was October 3rd. The vote seemed to be to replace the October 19th with October 26th; I believe that 
the date that was updated was the latter (October 3rd), at least as shown in the meeting portal.

(I'm sure that the City Manager's office would understood the intent either way, but just wanted to follow up.)

"That the City Solicitor provide a legal opinion by October 19th on the legal implications of the Historical Commission’s 
decision to extend the study beyond one year following the acceptance of the designation petition as listed in Article 3, 
section I of the enabling legislation, as it relates to the approval of building permits by the Historical Commission past 
October 26, 2020"

10/19/2020 City Council Meeting – Public Comments  
 
Nicola Williams, 8 Brewer Street 
 
I fully Support P.O. 231 - As an immigrant, I can appreciate and relate to these issues to call 
for an end to immigration detention and separation from families.  
 
City Manager's Agenda #14, CMA 2020 #236: I am in support of the long overdue revised 
ordinance for the Table of Uses zoning of retail uses and home.  
 
• 

It was decades out of date in the types of businesses it recognized. This could help 
eliminate some of the regulatory confusion that adds to the cost of opening new 
businesses.  
I share the view of the CLF Government Committee - This proposal has slimmed down 
many of the groupings which caused problems in the past, but it still leaves the issues of 
businesses in Residential C retiring variances for just about any use other than the one that 
is in there. This means that most of Huron Avenue, Western Avenue, and Cambridge Street 
west of Inman Square businesses would still need to seek variances in many instances 
which will accelerate the conversion of those neighborhood businesses into solely 
residential as that is a much easier transition than working to get a variance for a use 
change.  

• 

•  Good to see regulation on A Retail Residential Kitchen permitted to produce Cottage 
Food Products, as regulated by 105 CMR 590.001(C), as it may be amended as I have 
been advocating this for years with my work with food justice. 

 
SOME MAJOR THINGS MISSING – 1) Addressing co-working spaces and 2) farmers 
markets. For farmers markets, I see a proposed provision in the footnotes for temporary 
outdoor retail and consumer uses that “no special permit is required for Temporary Outdoor 
Retail or Consumer Service Uses on municipal-owned land,” but what about a farmers market 
on private property? 
 
City Manager's Agenda #6, CMA 2020 #228: Vacant Storefront Registry 
I noticed it has a memo on the Vacant Storefront Policy, which has no fines for vacant spaces. It 
just requires windows be covered with art or paper or "coming soon" signage.  This is an 
opportunity to actively promote businesses that are active. When the time is right, we also need 
to put some teeth in this policy and require fines equivalent to the amount of tax that the City 
would be receiving as part of the penalty. This could be after a specified period of vacancy. 
 
I fully Support Policy Order #10, POR 2020 #232: Cambridge’s Eviction Moratorium – 
Please consider ways to strengthen the eviction moratorium. 
 
Fully Support POR 2020 #234 -That the City Manager is hereby requested to instruct the 
Finance Department to provide a dollar amount and percentage of money used by every 
department to address racial and economic equity in the 2022 Fiscal Year Budget, highlighting 
additional areas to be considered and that the City Manager present plans for implementation in 
the 2022 Fiscal Year Budget.  
I am glad to see the POR 2020 #204 on the docket and eager to see this data.

RE: POR 2020 #218 
I hope the Neighborhood Conservation District conversation does not hijack the 
important work of the Council as the Affordable Housing Overlay did for almost 2 years.  
 
Neighborhood conservation is about preserving what attracted me to this city. The 
manageability, walkability, history and culture. It is about community preservation.  
 
The NCD Commissions are not perfect, just like many  other appointed commission in this city. 
We should be advocating for more diversity, socioeconomically, race, ethnicity, gender and 
sexual orientation. There are also differences in Historical District and Neighborhood 
Conservation Districts and some public education is needed here to deal with the confusion that 
is out there.  
 
We have so many deep rooted issues to address such as studying how to build more 
equitable development and addressing racial inequities and disparities.

It has come to the attention of the City Council that esteemed poet and resident of 
Cambridge, Massachusetts Louise Glück has been awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in 
Literature; and

of the most prominent poets in American contemporary literature; and  
  
Louise found a growing audience in the United States and abroad with notable works 
including The Triumph of Achilles, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award 
for Poetry (1985), and The Wild Iris, which earned Ms. Glück the Pulitzer Prize for 
Poetry (1993); and

Dylan as the only other American-born poets who have won the prize; and

over and my heart was broken. / Then I moved to Cambridge.”; now therefore be it

WHEREAS: 

On September 22, Donald Trump issued the “Executive Order on Combating Race and 
Sex Stereotyping” from the White House, which seeks to tamp down on cultural and 
diversity sensitivity trainings in workplaces across the country as a part of his efforts to 
drive wedges between people and shore up support among his base; and

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

relationships between people of differing backgrounds and experiences, yet this 
Executive Order falsely promotes the idea that such trainings are divisive and full of 
“un-American propaganda”; and    
 
The fallout from this Executive Order has had a chilling effect, as the New York Times 
reports, for example, that at the University of Iowa, “…fearing a loss of federal 
research grants, paused programs across the university, including training for 
university employees on race or sex stereotyping and scapegoating,” and it remains to 
be seen what impact this order may have on Cambridge and in what ways our 
community can work around this order; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the City Solicitor’s 
Office and other relevant departments to determine what impact the Executive Order 
on Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping may have on the City of Cambridge and its 
community partners, what options the City may have to work around this order, and to 
report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS:  WHEREAS, pursuant to M.G.L. c. 23M (the “PACE Act”), the Commonwealth has 

established a commercial sustainable energy program known as the Massachusetts 
Property Assessed Clean Energy Program (“PACE Massachusetts”) to provide a 
financing mechanism to private owners of commercial and industrial properties for 
certain qualifying commercial energy improvements; and 
 
The PACE Act was passed in 2016, and as of July 2020, the financing became 
available for qualifying buildings; and 
 
Twenty-eight Massachusetts municipalities have opted into PACE Massachusetts (as 
of September 29, 2020); and 
 
Cambridge is behind on its goals of reducing community emissions and establishing a 
PACE program could incentivize property owners to make energy improvements; and 
 
The City of Cambridge Climate Protection Action Committee discussed the PACE 
program in their September 2020 meeting, and believe that it would be beneficial to 
Cambridge to consider entering this program; and 
 
The City’s Envision Climate and Environment Plan lists expanded use of PACE as a 
possible action to take to meet sustainability goals; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record as supportive of PACE and requests that City 
Manager work with relevant city departments on how Cambridge might participate in 
PACE Massachusetts pursuant to the PACE Act including exploring all options for 
incentivizing participation, and further be it 
 
That the City Manager is requested to report back to the City Council in a timely

WHEREAS: 

The Purchasing department is responsible for putting out bids and securing contracts 
for Cambridge, buying millions of dollars of goods and services each year with 
taxpayer dollars; and 
 
The Purchasing Department ensures that “...all purchases of goods and services are 
made in accordance with State law and City Ordinance and are open, fair, competitive,

The Purchasing Department already has specific requirements or suggestions, such as 
encouraging participation of and outreach to minority, local and women-owned 
businesses, and a living wage requirement for all labor, in an effort to use taxpayer 
dollars in an equitable manner; and 
 
The City’s commitment to fighting for sustainability and ensuring all employees a 
living wage should be borne out in the dollars we spend; and 
 
Every taxpayer should be confident that all money spent by the city supports fair and 
equitable labor practices, wages, safety standards and health standards and complies 
with our country’s and state’s environmental standards, rules, laws and regulations; 
now therefore be it

Eversource has recently contacted Cambridge residents and commercial abutters about 
upgrades to a substation on Wheeler Street and to a facility owned by the energy 
company on New Street; and 
 
Eversource should seek to answer questions including what steps are being taken to 
address flood risk in the Alewife area, how fencing around the sites will be improved 
and maintained, the anticipated timelines for construction at the two sites, and any 
potential impacts to the easement near the substation; and 
 
Recent plans by Eversource for a substation in East Cambridge were complicated by 
frustration on the part of residents and the City Council due in part to communication 
issues; and 
 
A presentation and discussion by Eversource with neighborhood stakeholders and City 
staff to address these questions would allow residents and staff a time to ask questions 
and consider how the upgrades will affect City plans for the area; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to work with staff and Eversource 
representatives to set up a public meeting with residents on how the City’s 
understanding of present and future citywide energy needs and local flood risk, as well 
as plans for the surrounding neighborhood, are addressed by Eversource.

RESOLVED: 

On October 29, 2019 the United States Senate formally adopted a resolution 
recognizing the Armenian Genocide, condemning the killing of 1.5 million Armenians 
by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923; and 
 
The history of the genocide plays a critical role in the recent attacks in the Republic of 
Artsakh; and 
 
On September 26, 2020, Azerbaijan's military forces launched an attack against the 
Republic of Artsakh, including that country's capital city, Stepanakert, and that attack 
has already taken innocent civilian lives; and 
 
The United Nations has called for a ceasefire around the world due to the COVID-19 
pandemic, but Azerbaijan has renewed its warfare, violating its ceasefire agreement 
with Armenia, causing death, terror and destruction; and 
 
Since the September attack, Armenia has declared martial law, ordering civilians to 
shelter, and civilian lives continue to be in danger, with the bombing of civilian 
settlements, missile, and drone attacks; and 
 
In addition to the century of conflict and loss of life in this region, the current eruption 
of violence has resulted in the reported loss of more than 700 lives, and the destruction 
of civilian infrastructure, which left unaddressed, could spark wider regional conflict 
with international repercussions, extending beyond the region and its allies; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City of Cambridge stands in solidarity with the people of Armenia by urging 
the immediate re-establishment of a ceasefire, adherence to a humanitarian truce, and 
reconvening of diplomatic negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan; and be it 
further 
 
That the City of Cambridge urges the Trump Administration to utilize all diplomatic, 
economic and political means to compel Azerbaijan to engage meaningfully in the 
peace process to achieve a sustainable, lasting peace to ensure territorial integrity and 
sovereignty.

Throughout the summer and into the Fall, CHA has continued to offer free testing

WHEREAS: 

Cambridge has a long and proud history of welcoming immigrants of all backgrounds 
into our community; and 
 
Over the course of centuries, immigrants in the United States have contributed to the 
very fabric of the country through their work across various sectors; and  
 
Research and studies have confirmed that our diversity makes us stronger, and thus the 
diverse and immigrant communities that make up the United States are an asset; and 
 
The United States has had a long and proud history of welcoming immigrants, and 
providing asylum to those fleeing violence or persecution in their countries of origin; 
and 
 
The United States has historically served as an international leader in protecting 
refugees and advocating for human rights; and 
 
The treatment of immigrants and the separation of children from their parents at the 
border and in the interior of the country is inhumane, unconstitutional, and goes 
against the United States’ long-standing ideal of upholding and advocating for human 
rights; and  
 
There are more than 2,000 immigrants detained in the state who cannot afford a 
lawyer, and as immigration arrests rise across the state, guaranteeing due process and 
access to legal representation has become even more urgent; and 
 
Immigrant families and their children are detained in unacceptable conditions, in many 
cases without adequate food, water, or access to necessary hygiene and sanitary 
products; and 
 
The unsanitary conditions and lack of access to adequate health care is causing migrant 
men, women, and children in these detention centers to get sick and seven children 
have died after being in Border Patrol custody; and 
 
The US has held nearly 70,000 immigrant children in detention in 2019, and minors 
detained without their parents in these detention centers often receive inadequate 
education, mental health services, and other care; and over 1,000 children per year 
have been sexually assaulted; and

The detention of immigrants and their children during the COVID-19 pandemic has 
and will cause irreversible damage to the health, well-being and very lives of 
immigrants and their families, especially since there are no separated quarantine 
quarters or isolated areas for COVID-19 positive individuals; and 
 
The Department of Homeland Security’s response to COVID-19 has been inadequate – 
in addition to ignoring the health crisis within facilities, they are also putting the public 
health of all communities at risk by transferring people across the country and 
overseas, including moving people from pandemic hot spots to detention centers with 
fewer documented cases of COVID-19 - it’s vital that they immediately release people 
from detention to protect their lives, and to flatten the curve; now therefore be it 
 
That the City of Cambridge condemns the inhumane treatment of immigrants at our 
borders and in the interior of the country especially during the COVID-19 pandemic 
which creates a breeding ground for disease in detention centers and places immigrants 
at significant risk; and be it further 
 

come to our borders have a right to due process and to the full and fair opportunity to

immigrant families and the release of migrant children and parents from detention, and 
also to afford these families due process by allowing them the full and fair opportunity 
to seek protection from the United States.

The City of Cambridge recently invested time and financial resources to restore the 
Harvard Square Kiosk and surrounding plaza, which form the heart of Harvard Square; 
and 
 
During that same time period two people were tragically victims of fatal traffic 
accidents in Harvard Square; and 
 
The City of Cambridge announced a new “quick-build separated bike lane” due in part 
to these accidents, but these efforts primarily entail painted lanes on asphalt and do not 
fully address the concerns around cyclist and pedestrian safety in Harvard Square; and 
 
A six-inch raised curbed and planters appropriately spaced will more safely separate 
bicycles from cars, slow down traffic, and strongly discourage pedestrians from 
crossing mid-block; and 
 
Additional and functional planting areas in place of the painted asphalt areas will more 
significantly beautify the Square and be more consistent with the City’s investment in 
the Kiosk and Plaza restoration efforts; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager is hereby requested to instruct the Commissioner of Public 
Works to utilize continuous planting strips along bike lanes and at all reduced roadway 
areas in Harvard Square rather than painted buffer zones in Harvard Square to fully 
address bike and pedestrian safety in Harvard Square.

The City of Cambridge prides itself on its history of socially conscious and progressive 
values, and is known as a leader on issues such as racial equity, LGBTQ protections, 
environmental issues and social services; and 
 
One of the City’s goals is to assist people of all backgrounds through allocation of 
financial resources and educational opportunities; and 
 
Black people and people of color in Cambridge experience gaps in wealth, health, 
educational achievement, business ownership and more, compared to white residents; 
and 
 
The City of Cambridge invests significant resources to address racial and economic 
equity, however, the amount of programming and allocation of financial resources is 
not readily apparent; and 

City agencies such as the Department of Public Works, Inspectional Services, Traffic 
and Parking and other public resources are often allocated based on public demand, 
which may not distribute resources in an equitable manner; and 

The perception of uneven distribution of resources and under-representation in 
community decision making processes from diverse and low-income stakeholders 
requires the City Council to ensure equitable distribution of resources; and 

The 2022 budgeting process will begin this month of October; now therefore be it 

That the City Manager is hereby requested to instruct the Finance Department to 
provide a dollar amount and percentage of money used by every department to address 
racial and economic equity in the 2022 Fiscal Year Budget; and be it further 

That the City Manager is hereby requested to instruct the Budget Department to 
highlight in the 2022 Fiscal Year Budget what programs the city offers to address 
racial and economic inequity; and be it further 

That the City Manager is hereby requested to instruct the Budget Department to

WHEREAS: 

RESOLVED: 

It has come to the attention of the Cambridge City Council that Judge Roanne Sragow, 
who has served exceptionally as First Justice of the Cambridge District Court for 22 
years, has been relieved of her position; and 
 
As First Justice, Judge Sragow has served the Cambridge community firmly but with 
compassion, vision, and leadership which has earned her the trust and respect of not 
only those who serve the law, but those who come before her court; and 
 
Judge Sragow has led the Homeless Court at First Parish Church in Cambridge, 
gaining national attention, and more importantly, changing the lives of hundreds of the 
most vulnerable members of the community; and 
 
Judge Sragow's mental health sessions for defendants has provided those struggling 
with mental health issues the support and caring they need, resulting in positive 
outcomes for both the individual and the community; and 
 
During this time of the Covid-19 pandemic, which only further increases the life and 
death struggle for those who are unhoused in our community, as well as those who are 
struggling with mental health and substance use issues, removing Justice Sragow at 
this time is particularly cruel and dangerous; and 
 
Removing Judge Sragow further hurts the Cambridge community, which is still 
struggling with the illegal removal of the Cambridge District Court from our city; and 
 
Justice Sragow has consistently advocated for the return of the Cambridge District 
Court to Cambridge, at times putting her at odds with her superiors, which further 
clouds her removal and suggests retaliation; now therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record in opposition to the removal of Judge 
Roanne Sragow, First Justice of the Cambridge District Court; and further be it

RESOLVED: 

 
ORDERED: 

That the Cambridge City Council call for Judge Sragow to be reinstated to her position 
and remain in Cambridge where she has served exceptionally for the past 22 years and 
has become an integral member of the community and where she has worked closely 
with city departments, local clergy and non-profits, to care for our most vulnerable; 
and further be it 
 
That the City Clerk send a suitably engrossed copy of this order to Governor Charlie 
Baker, Lt. Governor Karen Polito, who Chairs the Governor's Council, and to Chief 
Justice Dawley and Chief Justice Carey on behalf of the entire Cambridge City 
Council.

Vice Mayor Mallon turned the floor over to Ms. Farooq and Mr. Roberts for a presentation.  Ms. Farooq 
stated that two parts to the materials that were submitted to the Committee (ATTACHMENT A).  The 
first is zoning CDD has been talking to with the Economic Development and University Relations 
Committee about for some time and in which there has been a lot of interest from the retail small business 
community as well as the business associations. She said that it has come up as a priority during their 
work with the Small Business Advisory Committee that was set up during Covid and it and responds to 
the changing need of retail and small businesses and making sure that the City’s zoning is up to date to 
accommodate retail in today’s world.  She said that they have formulated zoning recommendations after 
the last discussion on the conceptual pieces with the committee.  She said that the second piece is some 
zoning text amendments related to home-based occupations, particularly focusing on residential kitchens 
and cottage food production.  She said that CDD has had initial discussions and it was noted while this is 
something that they have heard of, from the staff perspective, they would caution stepping carefully into 
this as this is looking at activities in people’s homes and it can have an impact on abutters and this is 
something that the Inspectional Services Department hears about from time to time.  She asked the 
Committee to keep this in mind.  She stated her hope that Mr. Singanayagam will speak about 
enforcement challenges that are encountered.   
 
Jeff Roberts gave an overview of the PowerPoint presentation (ATTACHMENT B).  He stated that this is 
a brief presentation and it is a continuation of the discussion from the prior Economic Development and 
University Relations meeting.  He said that since that time, CDD has spent extensive effort working both 
within CDD, ISD, the City Solicitor’s Office, and the Department of Public Health to complete a set of 
suggested zoning text amendments.  He said that the hope is to talk through it and then have an 
opportunity to answer questions and receive feedback.    
 
Vice Mayor Mallon welcomed Ranjit Singanayagam and Sisia Daglian from ISD to answer questions 
specifically around the cottage food business and home-based occupation issue that is before the 
Committee today.  She stated that ISD has some concerns related to this change and will be happy to 
answer questions.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that no one had signed up for Public Comment.   
 
Councillor Toomey made a motion to close Public Comment. The roll was called and resulted as follows:

and Public Comment was closed. 
 
Councillor Zondervan thanked Mr. Roberts for the presentation which addresses many of the issues that 
were asked about.  He said that he would like to talk about the parking proposal.  He stated that he does 
not understand the reduction.  He said that this contains a lot of qualifiers. Jeff Roberts stated that he 
switched the slide to show the zoning text.  There is an existing section of the zoning that says as an 
exemption to parking requirement, any non-residential use that would require 4 or fewer spaces and there 
are other qualifications about being in a building with over 10,000 square feet or less, then the parking 
requirements are waived.  This is adding another piece to that exemption.  He said that it is similar to the 
provision that exists in Harvard and Central Squares which effectively says that if you have an existing 
building that is in place and a use moved out of the building and a new use moves into the building, that 
use is not required to build new parking spaces as a result of moving into that building.  He said that this 
is the issue that many businesses face right now; they move into an existing building, if it is a restaurant 
that is moving into a building that used to be an office and it might trigger an additional parking

requirement and the choice is to either building parking spaces on site or go to the BZA to get relief. 
Councillor Zondervan said that all that is being added is the provision that the other provisions are pre-
existing and will continue.  Councillor Zondervan said that he fully supports this amendment. He said that 
supports more analysis as it relates to parking requirements. 
 
Councillor Nolan thanked Vice Mayor Mallon and City staff for their hard work.  She said that while she 
is in support of adding categories, do we really need 31 categories.  She asked if it can it be made simpler 
in the interest of being more streamlined.  Mr. Robert said that this is the crux of a lot of discussion.  He 
said that there are always different ways to structure a use definition if one was starting from scratch.  He 
noted that they are working with a system of use regulations that has been in place and has resulted in 
what we have presently.  The more changes that are made, the more the potential for unintended 
consequences.  He said that they were trying to amend the use definitions to be as close to what is in place 
currently while at the same time addressing specific concerns that have been raised.  By cleaning up the 
definitions, the City Council can decide how it wants to regulate particular uses.  This allow future City 
Councils to have the same discretion.  Nancy Glowa added that legally, it is important to describe and 
define each use that the City Council wants to be a permitted use.  She said that under zoning law, any use 
that is not specifically categorized as an allowed use is not allowed.  She said that the Zoning Ordinance 
does not have the kind of flexibility that Councillor Nolan is suggesting.  Councillor Nolan stated that she 
is hoping that we could consolidate the list of uses by grouping those that are similar.  She asked if it is 
normal for a city to have 31 uses.  Ms. Farooq said that staff attempted to look at where things could be 
consolidated but were cautious about where there were distinctions.  She said that there is a series of 
requirements that may relate to a provision of food in a particular location that are distinct from other 
services.  She said that it is helpful to have those separate.  She said that part is regulation and part is 
impact. Councillor Nolan said that it is complex to look at.  She said that there is a distinction on home- 
based businesses related to the number of people allowed.  She said that she is curious as to why 
businesses are treated differently.  Mr. Roberts responded that as it relates to the home-based occupations, 
they were taking most of the lead from current zoning.  He said that current zoning only calls out offices 
and massage therapists.  Again, it has to do with the nature of that type of a home-based use. They did 
want to effectively change the current zoning to have offices have some ancillary employees on site.  
They were trying to start with existing zoning and add on parts that are meant to be added.  He said that 
they had to decide what were the general limitations.  Councillor Nolan said that she is not sure that 
makes sense as it is odd not to treat all professionals the same.   
 
Nancy Glowa added that the idea of an accessory use comes out of the longstanding practice of what 
would be a customary home-based use.  If you have a law practice or other professional office, 
historically that has meant an assistant as opposed to several attorneys. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that procedurally, the committee could move the potential zoning text 
amendments out of the Economic Development and University Relations Committee to the full City 
Council for referral to the Ordinance Committee and Planning Board for a full process.  She noted that 
she would like to see more community engagement at the Ordinance Committee level as this is an 
important conversation and the public has not been heard from. 
 
Councillor Carlone said that this is well thought out proposal that makes sense.  He said that one benefit 
of all retail type of uses listed is that developers or agents can see immediately what is allowed.     He 
asked if the same kind of work will continue in other use areas.  He asked about capacity.  Ms. Farooq 
said that CDD currently has other priority items from the City Council so those are ahead of anything else 
in the workplan.  She said these are foundational aspects of the zoning ordinance so there is a lot of work 
that goes into developing and modifications.  She said that if the City Council wants CDD to tackle other 
aspects, they would be ready to take on such aspects ahead of other items.  Councillor Carlone said that 
he believed that we were looking over all of the uses.  He said that he is talking about disconnecting two 
uses in the same category.   

Packet Pg. 542

7.1

 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked about the changes in the parking requirements for clarity.  Mr. 
Roberts said that the suggested change is an addition to an existing section which provides an exemption 
for small scale non-residential uses.  In addition to the current exemption, it would exempt new parking 
requirements for any non-residential use in an existing building.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon thanked CDD and the City Solicitor’s Office for their work.  She stated that these 
amendments line up perfectly with what was discussed at the prior meeting.  She said that she looks 
forward to forwarding this to the full City Council and the Ordinance Committee for a deeper 
conversation.  As it relates to the parking requirements, she said that parking requirement that we are 
changing in Section 6.32.1 was the number one thing that was discussed as an impediment to opening 
quickly by businesses.  Mr. Roberts said that during the process of reviewing what were the most typical 
regulatory burdens for small businesses, one of the things most likely to land a new business in front of 
the BZA for some type of relief, parking relief was at the top.  He said that when a small business needs 
to get relief from the BZA is a relief from parking requirements.  Iram Farooq asked Pardis Saffari to 
speak to this because she has spent a lot of time with businesses and the challenges that they encounter.  
Pardis Saffari stated that it is one of the top issues of concern.  She said that a lot of it has to do with the 
fact that a lot of new businesses want to be hybrid and having to go to the BZA for parking relief is an 
impediment.  She said that the expansion of recommendations as well as the new hybrid uses will help 
with that.  Vice Mayor Mallon said that the parking burden and requirement is one of things that 
businesses talk about the most as it relates to getting through the process.  She said that this type of 
change has been very thoughtful.  She stated that there are sad stories about retail that would be exciting 
that would enliven retail corridors but they decide to move elsewhere where regulatory requirements are 
not as stringent.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that she would like to talk about the home-based cottage food industry and the 
change in home-based businesses.  Ms. Farooq stated that the key issue with regard to the home-based 
businesses is that they are in urban settings which means that they are fairly close to next door neighbors.  
She explained that ISD will be the entity most conversant to the challenges in this regard.  Ranjit 
Singanayagam stated that a home-based cottage food business would have to get a Food Handlers Permit 
and an inspection of the property from ISD.  He said that if they are going to provide a kitchen with a 
stove, the Fire Department will be involved.  Vice Mayor Mallon said that she is curious about permitting 
process, inspections, etc.  She asked what ISD is thinking about in terms of permitting and oversight.  Mr. 
Singanayagam said that they will inspect a home-based food business as they do any other food 
establishment.  He noted that if there are no complaints, they are inspected yearly.   
 
Councillor Nolan asked what lessons can be learned from other cities and towns and their experiences 
with unintended consequences. Mr. Singanayagam said that he has spoken with staff in Arlington who 
said that they inspect the property and issue Food Handlers licenses. Councillor Nolan said that she is 
supportive of this endeavor. 
 
Councillor Carlone said that he assumes that the ISD and the Fire Department are primarily fire 
suppression and perhaps the series of stoves beyond one residential stove. He said that if you are selling 
to the public, you are not generally working with one stove, is that correct?  Ranjit Singanayagam said 
that if they will install another stove, that will involve plumbing inspectors. These things must be 
considered as well.     
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that it seems that Arlington has this part of their zoning, but she imagines that 
there are other cities and towns that ISD can continue reach out to as it relates to best practices.  She looks 
forward to the continuation of this conversation.

7.1

Councillor Toomey asked Ms. Glowa that if a business is in a residential building, would the homeowner 
and abutters be notified that a tenant has applied for a permit for a home-based food business.  Ms. Glowa 
stated that the owner would be notified if they were installing an additional stove. Nancy Glowa added 
that a lot of these issues involve legal issues.  She explained that anytime there is an application for 
zoning relief, the owner of the property is required to sign off on the application itself.  With respect to 
something that is allowed as of right, it would typically need owner consent. As it relates to 
condominiums, it relies on condominium documents.  
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that she is hearing from the Committee is that it would like to forward both 
zoning amendments to the full City Council for referral to the Ordinance Committee and Planning Board. 
She said that they should be sent separately because it sounds like the Home Occupations proposed 
zoning amendments may be trickier and need more meetings than the Retail or Consumer Services 
Establishments proposed amendments.   
 
Councillor Zondervan made a motion to send both proposed zoning amendments to the full City Council 
with a favorable recommendation.  The roll was called and resulted as follows:

Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, Chair Councillor 
Patricia M. Nolan Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-

Councillor Quinton J. Zondervan 

In City Council October 19, 2020 

 
 
The Economic Development and University Relations Committee held a public hearing on           
Thursday, July 30, 2020 at 10:00 a.m. in the Sullivan Chamber to receive an update on the Retail Land 
Use Initiative and Retail Table of Land Use Update. 
 
Present at the hearing were Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Toomey, Naomie Stephen, and Paula M. 
Crane, Deputy City Clerk. 
   
Present via Zoom were Councillor Nolan, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor Zondervan, Iram 
Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, City Solicitor Nancy Glowa, Jeff Roberts, 
Zoning and Development Director, and Pardis Saffari, Senior Economic Development Manager. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon convened the hearing and welcomed all present.  She read the Governor’s Order 
regarding remote participation and the Call of the Meeting.  She requested a Roll Call to indicate a 
quorum for the hearing.   
 
The roll was called and resulted as follows:

and a quorum was present.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon read from a prepared written statement.  She said that updated the Table of Land 
Uses has taken an incredibly long time and that the delay in implementing changes since these changes 
were first proposed in 2015 has cost the small business community considerably.  The Table of Land 
Uses must reflect the changing face of retail, and during COVID-19, we must ensure maximum flexibility 
for small businesses, and eliminate or reduce hurdles within the City. She said hammering out the final 
details and delivering a new Table of Land Uses will help allow retail districts thrive and ensure a healthy 
economic recovery.

7.3

Vice Mayor Mallon introduced Assistant City Manager Farooq. Assistant City Manager Farooq said that 
updating the Table of Land Uses was more complex than they anticipated. Subsequent to the 2015 
assessment of the Table of Land Uses, they created a Retail Strategic Plan which led the City to prioritize 
the retail components of the Use Table and work to ensure it aligns with the changing face of retail.  
Assistant City Manager Farooq introduced Jeff Roberts, Pardis Saffari, and Solicitor Glowa. Assistant 
City Manager Farooq explained they have been working closely with the Inspectional Services 
Department, as they have helped develop, and will eventually help enforce, the updated Table of Land 
Uses. 
 
Pardis Saffari and Jeff Roberts gave a summary of the PowerPoint presentation (Attachment A).   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that the presentation was comprehensive and summed up a lot of the work that 
has been over a number of years.  She said that she is pleased to have the discussion.  She recognized that 
Councillor Carlone and Mayor Siddiqui were present via Zoom. Vice Mayor Mallon invited the City 
Councillors to ask questions. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that it was an excellent presentation.  There is a lot of detail in the 
definitions and he wonders why we need all these regulations for zoning.  What is the driving force to 
maintain this very complex, inflexible Table of Uses?  He said that he understands that there are licensing 
requirements around food and alcohol, and noise restrictions, but there are many regulations that help 
govern how businesses operate.  Why do we need to restrict where a restaurant can be located?  How did 
this detailed level of location regulation evolve? Jeff Roberts acknowledged that there is a Zoning 
Ordinance and it is necessary to state affirmatively in the code what kinds of uses are allowed in what 
places.  We must have zoning of some sort, and the question from a policy perspective is what that zoning 
should be, how permissive, how restrictive, and in what areas.  Retail, because of its history in 
Cambridge, has more restrictive zoning than if it were being zoned totally new today.  It does lay out a set 
of rules which have shaped the kind of retail environment that we currently have and that a lot of 
businesses, property owners, and residents rely on to create some predictability in what is and what is not 
permitted.  There is a question on adjusting regulations to treat retail uses more permissively.  There has 
to be something in zoning that says, “this is what we mean by retail use” and “this is how we categorize 
them.”   He said that anything done in zoning must be appropriate within the statue.  There are broader 
state limitations on how far one can go with different zoning approaches.  We need zoning as a part of 
practice, and the City Council can decide what it should look like from a policy perspective, within legal 
bounds.  
 
Assistant City Manager Farooq said that zoning is a dance between providing flexibility and providing 
predictability.  Predictability is important for those who might want to open a business and even more so 
for abutters.  She said that zoning consistently responds to the needs of that particular time, protecting the 
property owners and tenants, as well as inhabitants of the area.  She said that greater permissibility within 
the more core business districts and more predictability near residential districts would perhaps serve the 
interest of everyone.  That is one of the themes in the formulation of this proposal.  She said that many of 
the granular complaints before the Inspectional Services Department is the impact of the abutting use of a 
business on next door neighbors, particularly residences.  
 
Councillor Zondervan said that the impact is what is important, and the zoning is a complicated way to 
get it.  Impact seems to be a simpler way to address concerns, and that this does not need to necessarily be 
tied to zoning.  His preference is being maximally flexible, especially as COVID has increased need for 
small businesses.  Why do we need any parking requirements going forward?  Why not say that there is 
no parking requirement and if the business cannot work without parking, it will not be located there.  
Assistant City Manager Farooq said that she does not have a response, as these are issues for the City 
Council to consider.  Businesses may also have thoughts on this subject as well.  She said that this is one 
of the issues that comes up again and again as a challenge for retailors.  Jeff Roberts added that they are 

Packet Pg. 616

7.3

trying to incorporate strategies.  They are looking at small retail in existing business area type conditions 
rather than new retail where parking requirements come into play more.  There are parts of the City where 
we have adopted zoning where minimum parking requirements for commercial use after working closely 
with traffic planners.  He said that he would want information from transportation planners before 
eliminating baseline parking requirements everywhere.   
 
Councillor Zondervan said that his preference is to move in that direction.  He said that these 
conversations take place to work toward eliminating all the minimum parking requirements and lowering 
maximum parking allowed to align with City goals for moving away from being car oriented.  If people 
are arriving in private vehicles, they should park in public garages, rather than business-specific parking. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that he is glad to see that proposed changes are about simplifying 
uses.  He asked the Solicitor, re: abutting uses, if there another reason for it?  Why have all these 
distinctions and zoning districts?  Can we favor local businesses with zoning over chains and corporate 
establishments?  Solicitor Glowa responded that it is not legally permissible although she would like to do 
more research.  She said that generally you cannot regulate who owns property, but you can regulate the 
uses permitted.  The case law is clear that is not permissible to prohibit large chains.  We should focus 
more on the uses that we want allowed or permitted.  She said that the general starting principle with 
zoning is that things are not allowed unless stated, and that people must seek a special permit or a 
variance to go outside those parameters.  Having zoning that allows people to do whatever they want 
would deprive others of the ability to regulate things they do not want.  The principle of zoning is to 
balance uniformity and consistency so that people can rely on, so that when a district is designated as 
primarily residential or primarily commercial, they know what uses to expect. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that it seems a couple of uses, such as Fast Order Food, are not 
working as intended.  It would be easier to say we do not want corporate chains, rather than trying to 
define fast order food. 
 
Re: abutting use, can Assistant City Manager Farooq provide examples of people not wanting certain 
types of businesses?  Assistant City Manager Farooq said that Solicitor Glowa may have more examples.  
Complaints tend to be not at the inception of something.  She said that over time, the neighbors tend to 
complain about too much noise from a business or odors.  One example was on Prospect Street where 
there used to be a retail bakery/café. There was a desire to put in a coffee roastery and people were 
concerned about the odors.  She said that we need to look at what will happen if a use is allowed and if it 
makes sense at a particular site.  She said that in other areas, if it is more on a corridor, such a business 
would be fine.  She said that this may be a reason to have some level of stratification to allow to think 
through the impacts in certain areas.  Zoning allows the regulation of performance.  Solicitor Glowa said 
that over the years the City has seen everything from noise, odors, general activity.  At times there may be 
complaints about accessory uses in a residence for a home business.  There could be more traffic coming 
and going.  Airbnb is a good example of this.  Drop offs at all hours of the night.  Little things start 
bothering people.  She said that a lot of it comes down to quality of life issues in residential areas.  What 
impact the activity has on the community. 
 
Jeff Roberts said that it is true that there are often complaints that come about when a new business is 
established.  The cannabis stores story relates to community perception and the relationship between the 
city permitting cannabis and then from specific neighborhoods is not unusual.  Councillor Sobrinho-
Wheeler said that he feels the same as Councillor Zondervan about parking requirements.  He said that it 
will be interesting to hear the perspective of business owners.   
 
Councillor Nolan said that as a new member she is thrilled that this is before the committee.  She said that 
she hopes that these can be pushed forward as soon as possible.  She said that she is committed to moving 
this forward as soon as possible.  Seems clear to her.  She said that re: timing and cost estimates, she 

Packet Pg. 617

7.3

believes that they underestimate the true time and the true cost.  She said that the real question is to limit 
the impact on neighborhoods is traffic, odors, etc. Why is there any use delineation? If we are trying to 
limit impact, can there not be a simplified chart?  She would vote for a radically simplified zoning.  She 
asked if we can consolidate all uses into one chart with no distinctions whatsoever, or consolidate 
categories.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said CDD walked through why zoning is important.  She understands desire for 
maximum flexibility, especially to support small businesses as COVID changes things dramatically.  She 
asked Assistant City Manager Farooq and Jeff Roberts if they have additional thoughts.  Assistant City 
Manager Farooq said that they will take that response back to staff as we move to the next level. 
 
Councillor Nolan said that she wonders if there are other cities that are doing Land Use reform.  Berkeley 
was mentioned during the presentation, but are there any others?  Jeff Roberts said that many cities are 
looking broadly at their entire zoning, not their retail code.  He said that Berkeley is the one example 
mostly aligned with what could be done in the City of Cambridge. Other municipalities have sometimes 
expanded their use categories. 
 
Councillor Nolan is glad to see discussion related to consolidating categories.   
 
Councillor Carlone saluted CDD staff for the excellent presentation.  He said that the approach is right on 
target.  Without zoning you will not maintain integrity and value of districts.  He said that zoning 
reinforces what is unique about Cambridge and then tries to enhance it.  Implementing an urban design 
plan cannot be done without zoning.  On Slide 48 this is an excellent way to simplify and be more 
realistic about retail needs.  What do specific neighborhoods need, what do they ask for in district zoning?  
He said that he remembers when Dunkin Donuts wanted to come between Harvard and Porter Square 
when there were eleven other locations within two miles, and the neighborhood fought against it.  Want to 
make things simpler but what gives a neighborhood character are unique shops.  You can say you can 
limit zoning to small shops.  There are ways to focus on what you want and what you don’t want on 
individual strips.  He said that re: schedule, assuming feedback is given, it will go to Ordinance 
Committee.  As Chair of the Ordinance Committee, the schedule has been delayed given unknown 
ordinance committee meetings upcoming.  What are the hopes for delivering a package to the City 
Council?  Assistant City Manager Farooq stated that they are focused on this topic and would like to 
advance it soon.  Hope is that if they get the City Council general blessing on the proposed zoning 
direction, they will go to the next step in creating zoning language.  She said that once they have the 
zoning language and forward it to the City Council, there will be the entire rezoning process which could 
take approximately 6 months, at least 4 months.  Jeff Roberts echoed Assistant City Manager Farooq’s 
timeline.  He noted that the nature of this work makes it hard to put to an exact timeframe.  The internal 
review and testing process with ISP is going to be key.  They will move forward in earnest to get it done 
but the timeframe by Assistant City Manager Farooq is good, but it may take longer to ensure that what is 
being delivered will work.  Councillor Carlone said that he knows that this will take time because zoning 
is complicated, and he gives enormous credit for the presentation.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that what is being done with this zoning update is complicated in its’ trying to 
simplify.  She moved to public comment. 
 
Jason Alves at 11:36 am. Stated that he appreciates the advancement and that it has come up a lot at the 
Small Business Task Force.  Great to hear that everyone wants maximum leniency.  Any trip to the Board 
of Zoning Appeals is delayed and expenses get held up because of this.  He said that when a use is 
deleted, what happens if this particular type of business is in existence in the City?  Would not want to see 
them have difficulties if they wanted to expand their businesses.  Re: accessory uses, it is an odd thing.  
He said that it seems that there are other ways to regulate problems that will arise with accessory uses.  
Re: Hampshire Street, it is not in a business zone and there are a lot of small, commercial spaces with a 

Packet Pg. 618

7.3

lower cost of entry.  He does not know how these businesses will be protected in these zoning changes.  
Encouraged by the notion of removing parking requirements.  
 
Councillor Toomey made a motion to close Public Comment. The roll was called and resulted as follows:

and Public Comment was closed. 
  
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked Assistant City Manager Farooq and Jeff Roberts about how implementing a 
zoning model similar to Berkley’s, where restaurant uses have just three categories: carryout food store, 
quick service restaurant, and full service restaurant, could work in Cambridge and if that example that 
could be implemented?  Jeff Roberts said that if you go to the detail, it seems complicated, but it would 
mean taking restaurants, fast order food, and other food services uses, and making it one item in the Table 
of Uses.  It would all fall into the same use category in the zoning ordinance.  That means that how it is 
regulated around the City would have more consistency.  Could look at other kinds of limitations, like 
size, so long as they can be easily understood by businesses and easily applied by zoning.  Vice Mayor 
Mallon asked if this would replace or consolidate Zoning Ordinance Section 4.35 subsections E, F, and O 
or just subsections E and F?  Jeff Roberts said that what Berkeley did was separate more sit-down 
restaurants and bars from fast order food establishments and combined those together.  In our case, it 
would combine O with E and F.   
 
Councillor Zondervan said that he did not hear a convincing argument for why we are approaching this 
zoning the way we are other than historical legacy.  He is reminded of last term when there were issues 
with wood-fired restaurants generating a lot of smoke, and that ultimately was not a zoning issue.  How 
do we formally explore this alternative of regulating based on impact?  What is an alternative regulatory 
regime based on impact requirements a business must meet to be able to exist there? Would like to 
formally request a draft or proposal we could consider as an alternative.  Assistant City Manager Farooq 
said that they hear the committee’s feedback on the desire for simplifying further with greater flexibility 
around retail uses.  She said that in terms of a completely different alternative approach, when they try to 
create something that is a significant change, it is usually not a quick and simple endeavor, especially 
with something as complicated as zoning.  We could be setting ourselves on a much longer path if we are 
to consider a completely different alternative approach.  It could be done, but it cannot be done in a matter 
of weeks or months.  Her recommendation would be that they take the committee’s feedback and modify 
conceptual proposal, as opposed to completely re-thinking the ordinance in the interest of advancing the 
changes further.  If an alternative path is preferred, they will take lead from the City Council.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said a complete reimaging would be time-consuming and small businesses simply do 
not have that time.  CDD is understanding that the committee wants to allow for maximum flexibility and 
that their revisions will speak to that.  This initial proposal came five years ago. There is a time sensitivity 
in making sure this gets done.  This is a necessary need in moving through COVID, and into and past the 
recovery phase.  Vice Mayor Mallon suggests that CDD take the committee’s recommendations and come 
back with something that the committee will be happy with, to advance to the full City Council.  She said 
that CDD has heard from business associations across the City that they are in favor of moving forward 
with this approach.  If Councillor Zondervan is making a formal motion for an alternative proposal, there 
would need a vote.  But that would not be the direction that she votes moving forward. 
 

Packet Pg. 619

7.3

Councillor Zondervan said that he agrees with Vice Mayor Mallon and Assistant City Manager Farooq, 
and he is not suggesting that they start over.  He is looking beyond what is being done and he appreciates 
the proposal before the committee.  Appreciates that CDD is hearing that the committee wants more 
flexibility.  He is not making formal motion but asking that we move in that direction going forward.   
 
Councillor Nolan supports Vice Mayor Mallon’s statements and moving forward as quickly as possible.  
She said that as CDD comes back, the committee is hoping for another kind of revamping, and that 
should be kept in mind, so these revisions do not impede further revamping in that direction.  
 
Vice Mayor Mallon thanked CDD for the presentation and proposal.  She said that CDD has the 
committee’s blessing to move forward in this direction.  She said that the committee wants CDD to move 
as quickly as possible with maximum flexibility in terms of parking requirements, new uses, definitions, 
and how we are delineating our food uses.  
 
Regarding home-based businesses, Vice Mayor Mallon said that residents would like to see this 
addressed.  She said that CDD including some language on this would be very helpful and would ensure 
equity.  She said it will be helpful to get some feedback from Denise Jillson, Michael Monestime and 
Jason Alves around parking, consolidation of food establishments, and anything else.  This should be a 
larger discussion, and future conversations at the Small Business Advisory Committee Meeting will be 
helpful. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked Solicitor Glowa to answer Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler’s questions around 
restricting certain ownership.  Solicitor Glowa opined that she would need to provide a thorough 
response.  She would like this information received by the committee. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon thanked all those present for their attendance. 
 
On a motion from Councillor Zondervan to adjourn the hearing, the roll was called and resulted as

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
At the School Committee’s last Regular Meeting on October 6th, Superintendent Salim gave this 
presentation to provide a back-to-school update before reopening our school buildings on Tuesday, 
October 13th. We heard from many educators and families during and prior to Public Comment about 
their excitement as well as concerns. My School Committee colleagues and I took their statements to 
heart as we did several walkthroughs of the school buildings to see how well they were prepared for 
reopening. We were impressed by all the measures taken to provide a safe environment for our educators 
and scholars.  
On Tuesday, October 13th, we welcomed back some of our youngest learners and students in specialized 
programs for in-person classes. My colleagues and I visited school buildings that morning to greet 
students and their families as they excitedly entered their new classrooms. I was able to stop by the King, 
Morse, and Peabody schools. Now that we have students back in school, we must continue following our 
protocols for wearing masks, staying socially distant, and staying home if we feel sick. Please check out 
CPSD’s “What Should I Do? A Daily Health Checklist and Responses to Different COVID Situations” as 
well as this Overview of Safety and Health Plans to see the various measures CPSD has taken to prepare 
for safe in-person learning. 
In addition to engaging with the families of our in-person learners, I have joined CRLS’s #HerVote club’s 
#HerVote project with the Radcliffe Institute to help continue shaping the way we understand women’s 
role in our democratic processes. I encourage you all to also download and print this template, to write 
your own response, and share it with us on Twitter and Instagram with the hashtag #HerVote.  
 
I signed a proclamation last week to recognize October as Dyslexia Awareness Month in Cambridge. City 
Hall was lit up red from Tuesday, October 13th through Friday, October 16th. I have also separately filed 

Packet Pg. 676

8.1

resolutions on this with the City Council as well as the School Committee. 
Due to rain, our next Family Resource Fair on Saturday, October 17th has been rescheduled to the 
following Saturday, October 24th. It will still be from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the Cambridge 
Public Library lawn. This will be a quick grab-and-go event for answering back-to-school questions and 
sharing resources.  
 
The School Committee’s next Regular Meeting will be at 6:00 PM on Tuesday, October 20th, 2020. 
The agenda is available here. I have submitted a motion asking that the school administration provide the 
School Committee with monthly data on the number and percentages of students facing chronic 
absenteeism at each school so that we can better identify and support our most vulnerable youth.  
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.  
 
 
 

 

Respectfully,
