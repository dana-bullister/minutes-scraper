Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, H Theodore 

                  Cohen, Louis Bacci, Jr., Mary T. Flynn, 

                  Hugh Russell, Tom Sieniewicz, and 

                  Corrine Espinoza 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, the appointed 

hour having arrived, we're going to call this meeting of the 

Cambridge Planning Board to session.   

          So a reminder to everyone present, the meeting is 

being audio and visually recorded.  So we will start this 

evening with an Update from Community Development, and Jeff 

are you on?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks, Madam Chair, I'm filling in 

today.  So just for the -- I hope all of members enjoyed 

last week off, and tonight we have one public hearing.   

          The second public hearing that was scheduled for 

tonight, just for anybody in the room who came for that 

hearing on the 686 Mass Ave cannabis proposal, that will be 

-- we have a request to postpone that, so we'll be talking 

about that later, but in case you're here, that will be

discussed at another time. 

          Looking ahead, good news, we also have next week 

off from -- there's no Planning Board meeting next Tuesday, 

everybody vote in the primary, if you haven't already. 

          On March 10, we have our next meeting.  We have 

public hearings scheduled on a zoning petition to amend the 

definition of family, which was interesting, and we also 

have a continued public hearing on a case that -- 

development proposal at 97 Cambridge Park Drive, which was 

previously heard and is coming back.   

          We do have a hearing scheduled for March 17, that 

will be a hearing on a retail cannabis proposal for an 

Economic Empowerment applicant at 701-703 B Mount Auburn 

Street, that's out near the -- where the Star Market is, 

near the border with Watertown, I believe. 

          And we also have as a General Business item some 

updates related to the MIT/Kendall Square SoMa development, 

so looking at -- there will be an amendment having to do 

with some of their transportation mitigation and an update 

on some of their building and site design and open space 

design. So that's March 17. 

          And then March 24, we are looking at having

hearings on -- so that's the date that we expect pending the 

Planning Board vote later tonight -- we expect to have the 

1686 Mass Ave cannabis case back on March 24.   

          We also have a public hearing on a proposed hotel 

development at 727 Mass Ave in Central Square. 

          And then March 24 we also are planning to have at 

this point a -- it's not a public hearing -- a 

preapplication conference on the Cambridgeside PUD proposal.  

So as part of their zoning, before they apply for their 

special permit, they have to come in for a preapplication 

review with the Planning Board, as well as one with the City 

Council and their required community meetings.  So we'll be 

doing a lot of meetings. 

          We are hoping to -- since that's a few meetings in 

a row, we're hoping to have March 31 as a nonmeeting date.  

So we won't be scheduling any new hearings for that date, 

but obviously if things start to slide on the calendar, we 

may have to open that up again, or continue things that need 

to get move or continue.  So that is an update on the 

schedule. 

          Just a little bit of an update from activity at 

the City Council on zoning.  The City Council received the

Planning Board recommendation on the incentive zoning rate 

that was discussed the last time.  They moved to pass that 

to a second reading.   

          The Ordinance Committee, while they were making 

their recommendation recommended that it be changed -- that 

initial rate change be amended from $19.10 to $20.10.  So 

it's gone up a little bit, and that was the version that was 

passed to a second reading. 

          Last night, they were also -- so still on the 

agenda is the Alexandria Grand Junction Overlay Zoning, 

which the Planning Board made a positive recommendation on, 

and the Harvard Square Zoning Petition, which the City 

Council made a positive recommendation -- or the Planning 

Board made a positive recommendation on. 

          So the City Council may be acting on those at the 

next meeting on March 2.   

          And the Ordinance Committee will have its hearing 

on the family zoning definition on March 17.  And last night 

also the City Council referred to the Planning Board a 

revised, resubmitted version of the Affordable Housing 

Overlay.  So we'll be scheduling a hearing on that in the 

near future.

          I think that does it for updates.  I guess the 

only other thing is we have upcoming meetings with the 

Climate Resilience Zoning Task Force on March 4, and then 

again, we have another meeting on March 19 to discuss 

recommendations.  So those of you who are on that task force 

will be seeing a lot of me in March. 

          I think that's all we have for now.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Great.  Thanks, Jeff.  

All right.  You're going to hold off on adopting any new 

meeting transcripts this week, so we can move right into our 

public hearing for 6:30 p.m., Planning Board special permit 

#359, and for #75-109 Smith Place.  Are you starting us off, 

Mr. Rafferty?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yes, ma'am.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right, thank you.    

JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you, good evening Madam Chair and 

members of the Board.  For the record, my name is James 

Rafferty, R-a-f-f-e-r-t-y.  I'm an Attorney with offices 

located at 907 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge.   

          I'm appearing this evening on behalf of the Davis 

Companies, the applicants of tonight's project.  Seated in 

the front row is Chris Chandor, C-h-a-n-d-o-r.  Mr. Chandor

is a Senior Vice-President with the Davis Companies, and 

he'll be providing some background information to the board 

tonight. 

          Gretchen -- his colleague, Gretchen McGill, M-c-G-

i-l-l, Vice-President for Construction at Davis Companies, 

is also present.  The Project Architect, Christopher Leary, 

L-e-a-r-y.  Mr. Leary is seated in the front row, and our 

Traffic Engineer Lorenzo Dantas, D-a-n-t-a-s from VHB is 

present, as well as a number of these civil and support 

engineers on the project.   

          The project -- the whole process, frankly, has 

been somewhat interesting, because there are a few unique -- 

this is occurring at a unique time in this district.   

          Smith Place -- I'm sure the Board is well familiar 

with Smith Place, and if you went out there today, it really 

has all the characteristics of its last 40 or 50 years.  

It's mostly industrial -- a lot of vehicular truck traffic 

associated with deliveries.   

          But due to a variety of factors, perhaps the 

market conditions more than anything else, this section of 

Concord Avenue is undergoing transformation as we speak.  

The timing of the transformation coordinates nicely with the

planning efforts in this area.   

          This application has been a little bit challenging 

because the zoning ordinance refers applicants to the 

Concord Alewife Plan, and the special permit criteria that 

are supposed to guide the Board's decision is based on the 

2006 plan. 

          What's become a more operative document is the 

Envision Alewife Plan that was the product of the three-year 

planning study conducted by Utile.  And I will say that 

we've been able to -- thanks to a lot of assistance and 

direction from the Community Development Department staff -- 

be able to kind of keep a foot in each camp.   

          Legal requirements associated with the special 

permit require us and the Board, frankly, to make findings 

under the Concord Alewife Plan, but I think it's fair to say 

there's nothing in the Envision Alewife Plan that 

contradicts that, but there are a few areas where they're 

not completely aligned. 

          The memo from the CDD staff I think does a good 

job of identifying those areas where that is occurring. 

The other thing that's happening out here is that this site, 

this project, this building, really is very much a pioneer.

          It was challenged by the staff when we first went 

in, and we've probably been talking now for at least since 

this June -- I was going to say this summer -- since June 

when we first came in with the proposal, and the applicant 

came early with a sense of what the zoning allowed, and a 

pretty good sense of the marketplace.   

          Because as you'll hear from Mr. Chandor, The Davis 

Companies has the advantage of having a number of properties 

in this area.  And some of them are contiguous to this site, 

and they're I think a pretty appropriate candidate to kind 

of set the table for what comes next.   

          We've been joined by Brian Fallon.  Mr. Fallon is 

a Senior --      

          BRIAN FALLON:  President.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  President -- oh, there you go.  

President.  So -- and he first found his way to the 

Quadrangle years ago when he had the bold idea of replacing 

housing on Fawcett Street, a building now called, "The 

Atmark."  And in those days, those of us who have been 

around Cambridge a long time kind of scratched our head and 

thought, "You really think people are going to want to live 

there?"

          But, you know, as you came to think about the 

site, as Brian pointed out to me, if you told someone you 

had a site that was walking distance to a Whole Foods, a 

cinema, restaurants, and all that, and across the street 

from an eight-acre reservation, the recreational 

opportunities at Fresh Pond -- but Atmark did set the tone 

for multifamily housing in that district. 

          And Brian was working with a different company at 

this time, but it was under his leadership and his direction 

that that residential project was created. 

          So Davis Companies is back tonight, seeking an 

Article 19 special permit.   

          And in addition to the Article 19 special permit, 

given the size of the project, given the project's location 

in the Alewife Overlay District, there are special permits 

that are being sought to allow for increases in height and 

FAR, and modifications in setbacks based upon the criteria 

set forth in the Overlay District. 

          The site itself, like all aspects of this, is a 

little complicated from a zoning perspective, in so far it's 

in two different base zoning districts.  So one is the 

Office 1 District.

          The other base is the Industrial B2 District.  

Both of those base districts, then, are part of larger 

Alewife Overlay Districts. 

          In the Office District, it's the Alewife Overlay 

3.  The Industrial District, it's Alewife Overlay District 

1.  So it really -- it takes a lot of math.  That's why we 

have good architects and engineers to figure out exactly 

what -- how all of this shakes out in terms of the allowable 

FARs. 

          What's not going to be apparent tonight, but I 

think really is worth the Board having an appreciation of -- 

is what this building looked like back in June.  It was a 

building -- it was a perfectly fine building, but candidly, 

it was a building surrounded by surface parking.   

          And when we met with the Planning staff, I knew we 

were in trouble because there were so many people in the 

room I thought to myself, "There are more people here than 

we currently -- ordinarily see at meetings like this."   

          But between the Department of Public Works, the 

Traffic Department, Community Development and the Planning 

people, Davis and particularly Mr. Fallon, were challenged 

to talk about not what this is now, but really directed us 

13

to the Alewife Plan. 

          The plan in June hadn’t yet fully come out, but it 

was pretty clear from the recommendations in the early 

drafts what the priorities were, particularly as it impacted 

proposed infrastructure, street connections. 

          So the building itself has been moved to -- many 

aspects of the building have changed, all with an idea 

towards putting the building and the project in a position 

to be able to in some cases facilitate the advancement of 

the plan, and in all cases to do nothing that would preclude 

what's coming forward.  That kind of became the guidepost 

for the redevelopment here. 

          So the project changed architecturally.  From a 

design perspective, there were some changes, but the most 

significant site improvement was the introduction of below-

grade parking, and what that meant for the site into the 

landscape opportunities. 

          And then the overall urban quality of the street.  

We've got a significant portion of our presentation devoted 

to the street itself, the street width as you probably know 

Smith Place is kind of in the middle of the block.   

          You come in from Concord Avenue and you have a

narrow opening where the Burger King is and the pool supply 

guy.  And there's no need to be speed bumps out there, 

because they've got great traffic coming with the number of 

potholes and --           

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]      

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  -- things in that road.  There's 

no one going too fast in that street.  There's also an 

absence of sidewalks.  There's a real absence of any type of 

organized pedestrian or bicycle circulation.   

          This project is going to be the first step to 

making a lot of those things happen.  So we're eager to 

share with you tonight what those components are. 

          So like I said, Davis Companies has a unique 

opportunity given the holdings here, and Mr. Chandor just 

wanted to give the Board a little context of what they own 

and why they see this as the first step.  They hope to be 

back here with other buildings, buildings they currently 

own.  So be nice to them, and they'll return shortly.  Thank 

you for your time.  We look forward to making the 

presentation.     

          CHRIS CHANDOR:  Thanks, Jim.  Chris Chandor, 

Senior Vice President of Development at Davis Companies.

I'm not going to take up a lot of time here talking about 

The Davis Companies.  I think most of you know who we are; 

we are a private equity firm here in Boston.  We have a lot 

of holdings in Cambridge, not just on this screen, but in 

other areas in and around Boston and Cambridge. 

          But I did want to up to this slide up on the Board 

to show you -- to reiterate what Mr. Rafferty said a moment 

ago, that we are a long-term player in this neighborhood, 

and we are committed to the success of the -- not just of 

this project, but of our other holdings in the neighborhood 

and future sites that we are still holding for development.   

          John Davis had owned the property in this 

neighborhood for a while.  That's the orange Mount Auburn 

Professional Hospital site that you see there, kind of near 

the lower left side of the page.  That's a doctor's office.  

It's been there for a long time.  It's a long-term lease, 

it's not going anywhere. 

          The rest of the yellow sites are more recent 

acquisitions.  We did start buying property in this 

neighborhood back in about 2012.  We're a believer in the 

long-term vision of this neighborhood of the growth that’s 

coming.

          We've seen the dimensional that's popping up 

around this neighborhood, the whole transit-oriented 

development, the live-work-play concepts. 

          We've seen what's come out Envision Cambridge, and 

we're a believer of how this area can grow to be -- you 

know, maybe not as big as East Cambridge, but certainly 

evolving from where it's been.   

          About three years ago, we started work here after 

some of the leases began to burn off with the 75 Moulton 

site, renovating an existing 37,000 square foot single-story 

warehouse into a modern lab building without changing the 

footprint.  That building is fully occupied today, with a 

tenant in there who's doing very well.  Gretchen worked on 

that project. 

          Our 10 Wilson project was our second project in 

the neighborhood in this immediate area.  That is an 

existing three-story building that has been -- undergone 

core shell renovations again without changing the footprint 

of the building.  That building is already more than 50 

percent leased, and we're very enthusiastic about our 

results there.   

          I would be remiss if I did not mention 35

Cambridge Park Drive, across the way in the Triangle.  That 

was a renovation in a building which I'm sure you're 

familiar with, that is now complete and fully leased.  So 

again, very, very successful with all the lab tenants that 

are clamoring to get into this neighborhood. 

          The 75-109 Smith project that we're here to talk 

about tonight would be our third project, and as Mr. 

Rafferty alluded, we still have the 40 Smith site to get to.  

There's a tenant in there with a number of years left on 

their term, but we do hope to be getting to that, and really 

seeing through the revitalization of this neighborhood. 

          25 Spinelli and 10 Foster are also a couple of 

other sites that we own.  We're working on some plans for 

both of those buildings right now, but none that are quite 

ready for primetime yet. 

          So I want to keep us moving, so I'm going to turn 

it over to Chris Leary from Jacobs to get into the nitty-

gritty on 75-109, thank you.     

          CHRIS LEARY:  Thank you, Chris.  My name is Chris 

Leary again, from Jacobs, and I'm leading the architectural 

team that's designing the building.  So I'm going to walk 

through with the following slide some of the planning

concepts that Mr. Rafferty described, and then we'll get 

into some more detail about the function of the building, 

the program and the architecture of the exterior. 

          So just to start by way of orientation, the 

buildings have been hidden right now.  If you recognize the 

context, Concord Ave -- Smith Place makes its way out kind 

of weekly behind the Burger King.  But if you go up Moulton 

Street or Fawcett Street, those feel more like real streets. 

          And what we observed, and it's pretty plain to 

see, is that the streets to the east of our site are fairly 

well-defined, but obviously don't really continue today 

through our site and to the west.  So a lot of the 

conversations with staff were about that. 

          What is there today are three structures and two 

pieces of property.  The building to the left is a single-

story warehouse structure, for lack of a better word.  The 

building to the right has a four and a half, and there's a 

structure in the back, which is a utilitarian shed building.  

And you can see some photographs on the right of what's 

there today. 

          Here's some dimensional information just by way of 

context.  This is all in the dimensional form of the

application, but just to highlight, there's approximately 

32,000 square feet of building on the site today.  We're 

proposing 142,000 square feet of GFA.  We're under the 

maximum allowable FAR.  We're slightly under the 55-foot 

height limit.   

          The setbacks all work, as you can see.  We're 

exceeding the open space and permeable requirements, and you 

see some of the bike and parking numbers proposed down 

below. 

          So let's start with the planning, because there 

were a number of meetings with staff.  And this was perhaps 

the most significant evolution of the project.  It's 

probably a little clearer here than the last drawings we 

were looking at.  You can see Wilson Road and Fawcett are 

very well-defined until they meet Smith Place, and then 

essentially stop.  But there's a vision that those two 

streets will continue along. 

          Those streets are also -- especially Smith Place -

- quite narrow.  There, as Jim said, the sidewalks are ill-

defined, the curbs.  And so, there's a thought that those 

streets should also be wider and have proper bike lanes and 

sidewalks as well.

          And as we work with staff, there were some 

proposed by staff dimensions of what these streets should 

look like.   

          So the proposal was to respect the existing 

centerlines of the rights of way of Smith Place, Wilson Road 

and Fawcett Street.  And then there were two slightly 

different street widths proposed.   

          And those purple lines in the drawing represent 

where the building faces would want to be to accommodate the 

pieces of the street section that I'll show you in a second.   

          And so, you can see that some of the buildings 

like 40 Smith Place -- eventually over time, the new 

buildings will hopefully evolve along those lines.  10 

Wilson is pretty close to being in alignment with those.  

But this really set up to the left the alignment of where 

you want to put this building on 75-109. 

          And I'm going to -- if you didn't follow the 

orientation, I'm going to turn 90 degrees, because the 

building is more convenient shown left to right.  But, 

again, those purple lines represent where the building wants 

to be relative to those new street sections.  And the line 

on the bottom of the page, which is to the east, we're a few

feet behind that. 

          And then on the north and the south, the building 

at the lower floor is behind those lines, and up above 

creeps into that dimension just a little bit.  But we 

reviewed that with staff, and I'll show you in a second some 

drawings that probably make more sense of that. 

          So this is a section through Smith Place.  And 

this is what we would envision day one if Smith Place were 

left in its current alignment.  I'm going to show you a 

future version of this in a minute. 

          So what you're seeing here is the current width of 

Smith Place.  The building to the right is the 10 Wilson 

existing building, and the sidewalk and yard.  And we've 

elevated our building up at elevation 22 foot 6, in respect 

to the current wisdom about where we should be, relative to 

possible climate change and flooding. 

          And in the interim, we're proposing that the 

landscape blend up from the sidewalk to the building to meet 

that dimension.  We're also proposing trees that eventually 

will become street trees.  

          The ultimate vision of the project as the 

neighborhood develops is that the street width would evolve

to allow for travel lanes, parking, sidewalks, bike lanes --  

all of the proper things we would want in a complete street, 

and would also allow for an elevated sidewalk up against the 

building at the higher elevation that’s proposed again in 

response to the climate change and resiliency. 

          And this has been part of what will be unique 

about this neighborhood is just because of the topography 

and where the buildings sit relative to high water, that in 

order to make a situation where people can interact with the 

building as a pedestrian, there's a proposal this elderly 

sidewalk up against the building. 

          And so, you know, day one there's not a lot of 

pedestrian activity out there.  Our vision, again, would be 

that the landscape would make up that grade difference.  But 

in the future, as the neighborhood developed and retail 

became viable, and the streets were completed, that we could 

realize this cross section here. 

          And then going around to the south side of the 

building, as Wilson is continued -- again, that boardwalk or 

elevated sidewalk could be continued along that face of the 

building as well, in that street alignment.  You see the red 

line, which is running through the building?  That was the

ideal street width that we talked about with staff.   

          One thing about a laboratory building, it wants to 

be on a certain grain, a certain module, and I'll show that 

in a minute.  And so, we proposed that we would respect that 

line with the glazing line at the lower floor, and the 

building would slightly overhang by about three feet.  And 

as we talked to staff, that seemed to be acceptable 

compromise. 

          Some features of site, so what you see here is the 

building as it would be built day one with the current 

alignment of Smith Place and Adley Road, even though it is a 

road with a street sign, it's a Private Way -- and then you 

see off to the right that the other streets don't continue -

- what we would have day is the parking, the surface parking 

would be behind the building.   

          The loading is behind the building.  There's a 

generous bicycle room that accommodates about 50 bicycles 

and showers that would be accessed around the back of the 

building; this red route here shown in the plan. 

          In addition, we would have a Bluebikes station out 

front and ten?  transient spaces out front for visitors.  So 

this is the circulation routes of how cyclists would

approach the building.   

          Trucks, a necessary feature for a laboratory 

building, we located the loading docks around the back of 

the building, so that you can't see them from the street, 

and all of the maneuvering of the trucks happens on the 

site, so that the trucks would enter on and off Smith Place 

by the same driveway that the vehicles -- the cars enter.    

          And there's enough room to get around the building 

and make the various maneuvers the trucks would need to make 

to back into the loading docks for trash and deliveries.   

          This is a diagram of how the vehicles would enter 

the site -- again, similar using the driveway.  There's a 

small amount of surface parking behind the building.  But 

most of the parking is underneath.   

          And in case you're wondering again what this issue 

of resiliency and high water, we are massaging the grading, 

so that the entrance to the garage is up above high water to 

protect it from flooding. 

          This is what it would look like below the 

building, where a majority of the parking is located, and 

how we would accommodate our charging stations, our HOV 

parking spaces.  And again, a majority of the parking is now

under the building. 

          So this is a vision of what might happen in the 

future, as Smith Place is widened.  You would realize the 

sidewalk.  The elevated sidewalk along the face of the 

building that would be up with the plane of the floor of the 

building, you can see that elderly sidewalk wrapping around 

Adley Road.   

          In the future, that would allow, again, the retail 

to be at that level.  You're seeing Adley Road completed and 

Fawcett Street completed.   

          And we've designed the parking so that a 

connection could be made off Adley Road, and a connection 

could be made off Fawcett Street in the future.  So I'm 

going to pause for one second.  So those were the general 

concepts of how we located the building.  Any questions 

there?  Or it can hold until the end?  Okay, I'll keep 

          Okay, so a little bit about the inside of the 

building.  The program of the building is a core and shell 

laboratory building.  The insides will be largely left raw 

for tenants to occupy and fit out in the future as they see 

going.   

fit.

22

          We intend the building to be suitable for life-

science tenants, perhaps office tenants.  At the ground-

floor, the gray represents the surface of the building -- 

the loading docks, the various mechanical rooms, the bike 

storage, the restrooms, and the blue represent the tenant 

areas. 

          With 18 feet floor to floor on the ground floor, 

this could accommodate a wide variety of uses from future 

retail or restaurants if the market demanded to laboratory 

or office space, or even some lighter manufacturing space.  

You know, it could be there at the ground floor. 

          We're also seeing the main lobby.  There's a lobby 

off of Smith Place in the center of the building that goes 

through the building and to the back in the rear entrance. 

          The upper floors of the building, very 

straightforward.  It's a center core, flexible building.  

You know, we try to design these floor plates like modern 

lofts, to be as flexible as possible.  There is a grain and 

a rhythm that lines up with laboratory planning and office 

planning.   

          But again, you know, day one the second and third 

floors would simply be raw shell until the tenants come

along. 

          And then up on top of the building, there is a 

penthouse, and you can see from the model as well that a 

portion of the penthouse, shown here in purple, is enclosed, 

and a portion of that rooftop area will be screened from 

you, but will have some of the mechanical equipment that we 

would prefer to be outside. 

          You know, sometimes when we design these buildings 

in Kendall on top of an eight or 10-story building, the 

penthouses are rather large.  With three stories we're able 

to spread things out a little bit and make that lower. 

          This is an elevation of the front and the rear.  

I'm going to talk a little bit more when you get to the 

rendering in a second.  But the general idea of the building 

was to recall a simple industrial building.   

          We're trying to do some interesting things with 

the structure of the ground floor, and otherwise keeping the 

structure pretty simple. 

          These are the side elevations.  And again, I'll 

talk about the rendering in a minute in some more detail, 

but we're intentionally making the north and south façade 

more opaque.

          We're trying to find that right balance of the 

right amount of glazing for daylight, but not too much 

glazing to penalize the energy performance of the building. 

          And also, often the way laboratory spaces work 

out, we actually like to have a solid end wall at the end of 

the row of laboratory benches. 

          One of the things that was highlighted in the 

staff comments, and we wanted to make clear, is the ground 

floor of the building will have a very flexible storefront 

system.   

          Day one those will be windows, but over time those 

windows can be reconfigured with tenant entrances, so if 

there were retail spaces, or a tenant use on the ground 

floor that wanted individual entrances, you can see that on 

all four elevations those can be accommodated with as many 

doors as you see here. 

          And then getting near the end here, as far as the 

architectural expression of the building, again our vision 

was a very simple industrial loft building.  We wanted the 

building to float above the ground, to have a little bit of 

interest and kind of structural expression.   

          And so, we're trying to do something a little 

29

interesting here with the structure of the ground floor and 

really express these diagonal members. 

          And you can see here transferring out a column, so 

that the ground floor of the building is intentionally very 

open, very glazed, and doing something interesting 

structurally. 

          The upper floors are very simple and repetitious.  

And again, the end walls are opaque, except at the middle. 

          And then the building is long.  It's, you know, 

over 350 feet long.  And so, what we have done is we've 

broken up the building into a center bay, and we're 

recessing about five feet to either side of this central 

bay, and then picking up the repetitious laboratory modules 

on either side. 

          We have shown this in a package, and I'll show you 

these materials in a second -- the materials that we're 

proposing for the building.  So here -- let me step away 

from the microphone for one second -- so we can hand these 

materials around here in a minute. 

          The bulk of the building -- you know what, I'm 

going to go back.  At the base of the building, the darker 

metal, the columns in these diagonal members that are

supported here, we are proposing a darker, aluminum color.  

This actually is not the scaled structure, it's the aluminum 

cladding on top of it, on top of the fireproofing.   

          And then the metal above would be similar to this 

lighter silver.  And this is the color that we would imagine 

in the window systems of the upper windows, and the material 

that labeled, "D" here between the window systems would be 

this lighter silver material. 

          The ends of the building, and these larger frame 

elements here at the entry and at either end, we're 

proposing material you've probably seen before called, 

"Tactile." This is a high-performance cast-concrete product.  

It's -- we like it because it's light.  But it has a nice 

quality to it.  There's different colors and textures.   

          And we have two colors before you today, where 

it's hard to see these materials in the artificial lighting.   

          So at some point we will have mockup, and we're -- 

we've been debating about whether we use one or both of 

these, or even make a pattern out of them on the end of the 

building.  But it would be something in the range of these 

materials here.   

          I have a sample of the glass here, if you'd like 

31

to see it as well.  The goal with the glass is to get a 

fairly neutral-colored glass, not too blue, not too green, 

but, you know, in the right amount of tint just to make the 

solar performance work.  But this is as close to clear 

lensing as we can get. 

          And then lastly, I'm going to step up -- can you 

hand me the mic for a minute?  The model actually comes out 

of the base.  I'll pass that around as well, so that the 

articulation of the front entrance piece and here may be a 

little clearer looking at the model. 

          Yeah.  So that is actually the conclusion of our 

presentation.  So again, the three things that we wanted the 

share was the planning ideas behind the alignment of the 

building and how it would relate to future streets.   

          The interior workings of the building are actually 

pretty straightforward as a core and shell building, and a 

little bit about the simple industrial loft architecture 

that we were trying to evoke with the materials and the 

design of the outside.                        

          JIM MONTEVERDE: Do you want to mention --  

          CHRIS LEARY:  Oh, yeah, thank you Jim, thank you 

for reminding me.  So conclude with these, there's an

extensive memo from CDD staff that we went through.  And 

Jim, thank you for reminding me.   

          So I wanted to highlight the things that were 

noted in that memo.  So the first point, aligning the 

buildings to accommodate the future planned street 

alignment, and looking at potential for future entry doors 

all along the base of the building.   

          The spaces of the ground floor are, again, highly 

flexible with 18-foot floor to floor height, could 

accommodate light manufacturing or retail.  We've limited 

the glazing on the south façade -- again, aligning the 

designed energy performance of the building with the program 

on the inside. 

          We've located the ground floor above the 10-year 

flood plain.  The electrical equipment also is outside, but 

it's also above the flood plain. 

          The landscape area is exceeding 20 percent of the 

site.  There was some commentary about planting trees in the 

east setback in the future road alignment.  That certainly 

could be done.   

          A majority of the parking is under the building.  

We've screened the loading dock and the surface parking from

the street by putting it behind.  

          The penthouse, again, is modestly convenient.  

It's set back.  We've included the Bluebikes station.  We've 

shown you the phasing plan here for how we would connect 

with the future street alignments, and there was a comment 

about the roofing material.   

          It certainly would be a light white or nearly 

white roof membrane, to mitigate the urban heat island 

effect, and that was shown in our -- the LEED narrative that 

went to staff as well.   

          Some things that were noted in review that we 

wanted to highlight -- again, planting trees in the building 

setbacks, working around the future road alignment; we are 

trying to navigate the topography day one with the 

topography that will be there ultimately, but certainly 

planting can happen in those setbacks.  There was a request 

to cooperate with the north abutter to look at the alignment 

of Fawcett Street.  We can certainly talk about that. 

          The quantity and spacing of the street trees, that 

can be flexible, and we can certainly accommodate whatever 

patterning of street trees is desirable. 

          There was a request for permeable paving.  We can

21

22

talk a little bit more about that if we want in detail.  

There are some challenges with permeable paving in our 

environment, particularly with regards to sanding and 

salting in the winter, but we can certainly talk about that. 

          And then the last slide here, on the architectural 

design goals and review, providing capacity for future 

canopies above the future elevated walkways, that's 

certainly something that could be incorporated into the 

storefront design.   

          And there was a request to look at some additional 

articulation in the penthouse.  We could look at that 

optionality.  We're always debating whether to make it 

simple so that it recedes, or to express it.  But we could 

certainly look at options for that as well.          

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Do Board 

members have questions for the applicant at this time?  All 

right.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Madam Chair, there was just one 

item that I neglected to mention, but it showed up here at 

the end, and its referenced in the report.  As the Board is 

well aware, in addition to all of the moving parts out here, 

there is a zoning petition that has been refiled by our

abutter.   

          And representatives of The Davis Companies have 

been in discussions with that abutter to understand 

opportunities for collaboration -- most prominently the 

extension or the potential extension of Fawcett Street.   

          As I'm sure the Board recalls, a key 

infrastructure component of that rezoning talks about the 

possibility of a pedestrian footbridge at the end of the 

street.   

          That is something that obviously would benefit the 

district as a whole, and that The Davis Companies is eager 

to participate in.  I think we're anticipating some form of 

participation, depending on how that proceeds. 

          So there is, in addition to everything else 

occurring with the Envision plan, we do -- are looking at an 

abutter that I think candidly is not anywhere near as close 

as we are to putting a shovel in the ground.   

          But same principal applying, not doing anything in 

this project that would conflict or prevent that project, 

which probably has a larger footprint in terms of advancing 

elements of the plan.  So we are engaged in collaboration on 

that.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  So 

this is a public hearing.  There was a signup sheet, but no 

one has signed up.  So if there's anyone present who wishes 

to be heard on this matter, now would be the time.  Can I 

see a show of hands if there's anyone present who wants to 

speak?   

          Seeing none, okay.  Board members, then what we 

have before us tonight, as was noted in staff memos, is kind 

of because there is not a PTDM plan approved for this 

project, we are not going to be able to act on this tonight, 

but we can tee up all the kinds of issues we'd like to hear 

more about, see more on -- anything like that, give an 

indication of what we think of the project.   

          But this is the time to have those discussions and 

prep the applicant, so that when they come back to us next 

time, we can get them all done in the next meeting, once 

they have that plan approved, and we can hopefully move 

forward.   

          Yes, Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I wonder if it would help if, 

separately, Joe Bar and Erik Thorkildsen come up and so we 

can ask some questions of them?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  If it would be 

helpful to the Board, we can do that.  Erik, do you want to 

come up first, since we have heard about some of the design 

already, and we haven't even touched on the Traffic and 

Parking yet?  We'll let Joe go next after that.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.  We do questions, or 

should I just --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So why don't you go 

ahead and summarize what your discussions with the 

applicants have been so far.  And, you know, I know you've 

written us a very detailed memo.  Any points you want to 

highlight from that memo and then add to the extent Board 

members have questions, they can pose them.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Okay.  Well, yeah, I won't go 

over everything, because you perfectly well read it.  But 

yeah, so we worked pretty closely, especially locating the 

building, so as to allow for these future street alignments 

that were worked out as part of the Alewife District Plan, 

both in terms of alignment of streets, proposed new streets, 

and the actual sectioning of the street in the various 

zones, bike lanes, curb, sidewalk, elevated sidewalks, all 

that -- just basically following on the Alewife District

Plan. 

          So in the building there's a lot of things that -- 

the underground parking minimizing surface parking, all 

those kinds of things -- hiding loading docks behind 

buildings, all the kinds of things the Alewife District Plan 

is looking for.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  So in terms of moving farther, 

even father into what the Alewife District Plan is looking 

for, what we would really like to see is Smith Place, as 

much as possible, revised according to the section proposed 

as the project is constructed. 

          The elevated sidewalk, the way the zoning is, 

under current zoning, the elevated sidewalk can't go in 

because the zoning requires a certain amount of front yard 

green space.  But you could do the curb, the bike lane, the 

buffer, locate the street trees in the right alignment, and 

the sidewalk. 

          And so, that would be really great, because as 

projects happen incrementally, you know, the street will 

sort of get fleshed out in that way. 

          And the street trees are pretty close to the 

39

alignment that the Alewife District Plan is suggesting -- 

slight adjustments.  It's a little hard to tell without, you 

know, simply superimposing graphically a proposed plan.  But 

that could all be worked out.  It just needs to be -- it 

needs to happen.   

          The issue of coordinating with the owners to the 

north would be great, to avoid having two -- in effect two 

driveways right next to each other on either side of the 

property line. 

          As you probably know, the property line between 

the two properties is about centered on Alewife -- I mean 

Fawcett Street.  So, you know, we're basically wanting to 

avoid that sort of split. 

          Let's see, tighter spacing of street trees.  If 

possible, further reductions to the amount of surface 

parking and keeping total parking to the minimum and more 

screening of the surface parking by landscape or whatever 

features. 

          And then finally, I could come up with some other 

-- go on with some other issues if you'd like, but finally 

and the most important one, the Alewife District Plan 

recommends that a courtyard be created on façades that are 

40

longer than 200 feet to divide them into two parts. 

          And initially the Alewife District Plan was fairly 

specific about how big that had to be, and it's not so 

specific anymore, but some sense of a courtyard that creates 

a sense that they're two pieces of building with a recess 

between them would be really -- would be in accord with what 

the District Plan says. 

          One other thing, didn't see the Bluebike station, 

and that will -- I'm sure will come up as projects are 

reviewed.  But, you know, those are probably the high 

points, and the other items are in the memo if you have any 

questions.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess just as a comment, I would 

say this is perhaps the most challenging, difficult meshing 

of requirements, and its terribly important that Mr. 

Rafferty has already said, to get things going in the right 

direction from the new planning that's been done.  And I 

think your memo is really superb.   

          But I had a couple of questions.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And this -- if you look at the 

actual plan that's up before us, it doesn't show the center

bay, which projects about five feet across, blocking the 

elevated walkway.  And so that might say, "Well, yeah, maybe 

we should push that whole façade in those three bays back 

farther, as the plan would."  

          And I was wondering, is there another solution 

which actually projects the façade another five or six feet 

closer to the street, allows the walkway essentially to walk 

through the base of that wall --    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Mm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- at more or less full width, and 

creates enough of a projection so that it creates the 

division into smaller volumes?  So that's some of the 

questions.  That's something you think is worth pursuing?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Hm, that's a good one.  Wasn't 

my intuition.  We hadn't really discussed.  The way the 

guidelines, or the Alewife District Plan is set up, it's the 

idea of creating as much as possible continuous street walls 

and then recesses behind them, and then the kind of fleshing 

out of that by the landscape, the zone of street trees and 

so on. 

          So I'd be a little concerned about making a 

projection because it sort of could feel as though the

building is poking into your perceived zone of the public 

realm.  We can look -- you know, a perspective of you 

looking down the street I think would be a good test of 

that. 

          So maybe not another question, but I'd be a little 

bit leery of it, just intuitively.  You know, sort of 

thinking of sort of standard -- not necessarily standard, 

but Cambridge situations where you have a sort of a street 

wall, and you have a residential courtyard or something that 

kind of breaks up the volume of the big building, rather 

than pokes it out.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Mm-hm.  And the other question sort 

of picks up on one of the similar points in your memo, which 

is the space between a mechanical penthouse and front wall 

is labeled as a place for potential tenant exhaust fans?     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Right.     

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And I'm just curious, once they get 

there, they have to be screened, and then --    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  How do you deal with that?  Now 

that's an architectural question, but I'd sort of start 

putting it on your plate as questions that I think are 

43

important for you to follow up on.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.  We noticed that when we 

were looking through it, there was something in the text 

that said, you know, the parapet's high enough and you're 

sort of viewing angle is low enough, you maybe won't see 

them that much.  And the parapet is not very tall, at least 

in the section.   

          So just sitting here tonight, looking at the 

building section, I was wondering the penthouse, the scale 

is at about 40 feet back from the front façade.  It may be 

worth pulling it forward some amount -- 20 feet or 

something, if that would allow that potential future 

equipment to be within it.   

          That might look better than having a bunch of 

smaller things out front that will be a little bit hard to 

know what they're going to be like, because they're going to 

happen over time. 

          I think it would be worth, you know, considering.          

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So, again, I'm going to throw 

another option on the table, which would be to create some 

regular fenced bays that might aid in the articulation of 

the penthouse --

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- and lower the --    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- to deal with that other issue 

that is of the ground wall.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Right.  Yeah, that would also 

be worth looking at.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

questions for Erik?  No?  All right.  Thank you very much.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  We're good, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Joe, do you want to 

come and summarize for us where we're at with the traffic 

study and appropriate mitigation measures?     

          JOE BAR:  Sure.  Joe Bar, Director of Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation.  So, I guess as the applicant 

mentioned, or I think maybe one of the Board members 

mentioned, there is no approved PTDM plan, so obviously the 

Board can't act yet.  And I think there are some aspects -- 

so some of the mitigation will -- and some of the 

commitments I think will come out of the PTDM plan.   

          So I would anticipate that we would try to 

summarize some of that information in a subsequent memo to 

45

the Board, so that you have all that information in front of 

you, even if it's being decided through a different process.   

          I guess just stepping back for a second, I guess I 

would say a couple things about the project in general.  One 

is that from the initial plan that we saw and has been 

described by the applicant, and also, by other staff, you 

know, the site plan has made significant progress, including 

locating much of the parking underground, although obviously 

we'd always prefer that all the parking be located 

underground. 

generally calls for.   

          And that is what the Alewife District Plan 

          So, in going along with that, and I think this is 

articulated in our memo, you know, the applicant is 

proposing a 1.1 parking ratio.  The current minimum for the 

district is 0.95.  The proposed minimum, if zoning 

recommendations from the Alewife District Plan were adopted, 

is 0.8. 

          So we've had a number of back and forths with the 

applicant about those numbers.  I was -- although they have 

certainly indicated that they would -- that the market and 

other factors compelled them to stay at the number they're 

46

12

13

15

16

18

22

at, I think we would always prefer that applicants at least 

go to the -- I mean, it's obviously we can't ask them to go 

below the minimum that exists currently without those 

recommendations having been made into the actual zoning 

language.   

          But we would certainly encourage them to consider 

whether there's a way to get down to the parking minimum and 

still have a viable project. 

          Particularly, I would argue they would disagree 

with a situation like this where they have significant 

interest in the continued development of the area. 

          And I think in our minds, certainly from a 

transportation perspective, the continued development of the 

area is dependent on nonautomotive access, and providing 

less parking will help ensure that going forward. 

          But again, that's I think, as our memo lays out, 

we intend to continue those discussions, and I have every 

confidence that we'll come to a mutually acceptable solution 

in terms of the amount of parking that's going to be 

provided. 

          But obviously if the number came down, it would 

certainly help potentially eliminate some of that surface

parking, and maybe there's some sort of stepwise fashion 

that that can happen in, which is something that we have 

done for the 101 Cambridge Park Drive project that the Board 

is also in the process of reviewing. 

          So I guess those are my main comments.  I guess 

the only other thing I'd say is that I do agree and think 

it's really important, as Erik laid out, that we -- they’ve 

made a lot of accommodations for the street layouts that 

were laid out in the Alewife District Plan, and I would hope 

that, you know, Smith Place could be built as much as 

possible in the configuration we would like to see as this 

project is built out.   

          That will, obviously result in a strange -- one of 

those strange situations -- that I've seen, mostly in 

Pennsylvania, where, you know, you have a street that's sort 

of narrow and then wide and then narrow again.   

          But if we don't build it now, it will become -- 

you know, it will be hard to rebuild it later, you know, 

with grading and drainage and other things -- you know, 

trying to widen it at a later date is a much more 

complicated project than it might seem at first glance, 

although I think all the Board members are aware of those

complexities. 

          And then I guess just in terms of mitigation, I 

would say that we're -- you know, we have an addition to 

whatever's in the PTDM plan.   

          We have some financial contributions that are in 

line with the recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, 

as well as generally in line with the recommendations that 

are in the 101 Cambridge Park Drive memo.   

          And then, you know, the installation of the 

Bluebike station is an important element of this, and I 

would agree with Erik that we kind of need to -- it's best 

if we can figure that out at least in general terms, the 

location about now.  Because despite some of the flexibility 

with Bluebikes, it's often hard to figure that out later 

once the site plan has been finalized. 

          So those are I guess my main thoughts.  I'm happy 

to answer questions or not.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do Board members have 

questions for Joe?  Yeah.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  This is general, I didn't do 

the math, but if you went down to 0.95 parking, how many 

parking spaces?     

49

          JOE BAR:  Let me see if I -- now you're going to 

test my math.  I don't -- it's roughly, I think it's roughly 

-- it's about 15 spaces that would be eliminated, I believe.  

Double check that.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And we went down to, was it 28?     

          JOE BAR:  That would be a roughly similar number 

to be eliminated.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  About another 15?     

          JOE BAR:  Approximately.  And again, I'm going to 

double check that, and I'll let you know.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  All right, I was just --    

          JOE BAR:  I could be remembering this wrong.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And either for you or for Jeff, 

do we have the ability to go down to 0.8, or we cannot and 

that would require a variance --    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- at this point?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I believe that if 

they want to go under the minimum, they can do that in 

conjunction with another special permit.  Is that correct, 

Joe?     

          JOE BAR:  That's correct.  It would be a special

permit ordinarily to reduce the parking requirements below 

the minimum.  It's a special permit from the BZA, but since 

it's already at the Planning Board, it could be applied for 

as a special permit from the Planning Board.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And I guess I would just -- 

although as I said, I think we're very supportive of going 

down to the 0.95.   

          I think if we were -- if you were actually -- if 

the Board was suggesting that they would want the applicant 

the potentially apply for further reduction, I think we'd 

need to -- we'd want to look at that carefully just in terms 

of balancing, you know, the amount of parking with the 

expected trip generation.   

          So I'm not saying that's not a good idea, but I'm 

saying we haven't really -- we've really thought more about 

the 0.95 than the 0.8 in terms of what we think -- you know, 

what we've analyzed in terms of our internal discussions.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  I don't remember 

whether this was in your memo or in the narrative.  It talks 

about being a 20-minute walk to the Alewife Station.  Is 

that -- do you think that's an accurate?

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Under current conditions, yes.  

Obviously, we'd hoped that at a point in the future there 

would be a pedestrian crossing at the tracks.     

          JOE BAR:  Right, yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes, but under current 

conditions.     

          JOE BAR:  Under current conditions.  And I 

actually spent the summer working at the building on 10 

Fawcett Street.  And I can say from personal experience that 

it is a long trip, and not necessarily the most pleasant, 

depending on the way.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.  And the buses on 

Concord Ave run frequently?     

          JOE BAR:  During the peaks, they're -- each bus, 

there's two bus routes -- I would say at the top of my head 

probably about a 15 to 20-minute headway, not always evenly 

spaced between the two routes, although the MBTA is actually 

working on a plan to try to resolve that problem where, you 

know, you can sometimes have each bus coming, like, two 

minutes apart, and then a big gap in between.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And do either of those routes 

go to the Alewife Station?     

52

          JOE BAR:  No.  They both go to Harvard Square.  

There is the Alewife TMA Shuttle, that I believe is part of 

the PTDM plan.  The applicant would propose to be part of 

that, and so, that potentially would provide shuttle service 

to the Alewife T station.   

          But given the existing congestion on the state 

roadways that that shuttle uses, it's not necessarily clear 

that -- there are certainly definitely -- there are 

definitely times of day when it's actually still faster to 

walk than to sit in traffic.  So --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Didn't we get a comment from Anne 

Stewart, an email, did you see that?     

          JOE BAR:  I did not.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I asked Liza to forward it to you, 

but she must not have.     

          JOE BAR:  Well, I mean I was away last week, so 

it's possible that it's buried somewhere in my e-mail.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And so, one of the questions, her 

question, was, would it be advantageous to install a full 

signal at Smith Place and Concord Avenue at this time, or is

that something that should wait until my piece of it might 

wait until the street gets realigned, so you don't spend a 

few hundred thousand dollars twice?     

          JOE BAR:  I would say that at this point with this 

project, it probably -- and we haven’t looked at a signal 

warrant, but just sort of off the top of my head, I would 

not expect that this would lead to a need for a signal at 

Smith Place.  There are also, as part of the 55 Wheeler 

Street project, they will be installing a signal at Fawcett 

Street.   

          So if people were looking for a way out onto 

Concord Ave at a signal, they would have the option of using 

Fawcett Street to get there. 

          I would say that, you know, looking at both this 

applicant's future potential plans that they mentioned in 

their introduction as well as the, you know, area to the 

north that's, you know, the subject of, you know, rezoning 

discussions, that somewhere along the way it's highly likely 

that we would wind up with a signal at Smith Place and 

Concord Ave as well, but I don't necessarily think this is 

the project that triggers that.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  The -- it's not clear to me if 

54

you were recommending rebuilding the full width of Smith 

Place at this time in front of this parcel.   

          It seems to me that would make sense, because the 

applicant owns three-quarters of the frontage, and let's get 

a piece that's done and finished.     

          JOE BAR:  Yeah, and I guess what I would say is 

that I think it's a -- it would be desirable to build it -- 

to build out the railway.   

          In terms of how it's actually operated, it may 

make sense to continue to have it be a relatively narrow, 

you know, painted as a relatively narrow street with a -- 

you know, with a cross-section that's consistent with the 

rest of the street, but with better sidewalks and better 

bicycle facilities, but have that -- again, partly just for 

drainage and sort of constructability reasons.   

          I think it'll be more difficult to come back and 

add the rest of the street than it will be to build it as, 

you know, as desirable width initially, if that makes sense.         

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Then, I measured on I believe that 

map the distance to the T station now, which was 22 inches 

using the scale on the map --    

          JOE BAR: [Laughter]

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- and how far would it be if you 

went across the Cabot, Cabot & Forbes, or maybe the Cabot, 

Cabot & Forbes/Davis pedestrian bridge, which is 11 inches?  

So you cut the trip in half.  Does that impact the moats at 

all?     

          JOE BAR:  I would say yes, because the difference 

between let's say that's roughly a 20-minute a 10-minute 

walk, a 10-minute walk is well within -- particularly for 

rail transit -- is well within a reasonable walk for people 

to, you know, get to and from somewhere.   

          A 20-minute walk starts to become -- you know, 

kind of is at or beyond what I would consider to be the 

normal bounds of walking.   

          Not that people don't do it, and particularly -- 

and there's definitely parts of Cambridge where walking is 

perhaps more -- slightly more pleasant experience than this, 

where I think people do walk that far to get to a T station.   

          But in this environment, I think that that -- a 

20-minute walk is a significant impediment.  And that's why, 

I think, you know, the city in general has been pursuing the 

some sort of additional crossing of the railroad tracks.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess my fourth question is, as I

rode my bicycle around there yesterday, I was experiencing 

extreme traffic.   

          Is it possible that the city could put it in their 

priorities to maybe put an overlay on either Wilson Road out 

to Concord Avenue, so as to, you know, as we rebuild New 

Street to help the new housing development down there?  You 

know, I think there's a limit to what you can ask the 

proponent to do, but I think it might be of benefit.     

          JOE BAR:  I'll certainly pass the suggestion along 

to the city engineer.  But I do -- I mean I think it's a -- 

in all seriousness, it's an important point for all access 

to the site that, you know, it's a little bit the Wild West 

out there right now, as we try to sort of, you know, make a 

more formal, organized street grid and have, you know, 

people -- new people coming in to the area. 

          I think it is important that, you know, the city 

also do what needs to be done, even if it's only sort of 

temporary improvements to make it at least safe and 

comfortable to get there, whether you're walking, biking or 

driving.   

          And so, I don't know exactly what that looks like, 

but I think we do need to think about those kinds of things 

57

as this area is sort of entering into what seems to be a 

more active phase of development farther to the west.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

questions for Joe?  All right.     

          JOE BAR:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Wait.  Wait.  Mary?         

          MARY FLYNN: Yeah.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mary changed her 

mind.         

          MARY FLYNN:  I don't know if it's for you or for 

Erik, but I'm just curious about what the plan is for street 

lighting along this rote.  Is it just going to be overhead 

lighting or more -- you know, for traffic or more pedestrian 

lightning, or have you decided yet?     

          JOE BAR:  I certainly don't know the answer to 

that question.  I don't know, Erik, if you have any insight 

into that?     

question.    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  I don't, but it's an excellent 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Erik, you know you 

have to come to the mic.

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  All right.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Even if you're just 

saying you don't know, and it's an excellent question.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  It will be a short answer.  I 

don't know the answer.  But it's an excellent question, and 

really important.  So, you know, that would presumably be 

part of the reconstruction of the street, at least for this 

segment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Correct, right.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Why not now?     

          MARY TAYLOR:  Yes, that's why I asked the question 

is I didn't see anything that looked like lights on the 

plan, and it seems like you want to know that now.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.  All right.  

Yep.  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And another question, I think 

for Joe.  And I just don't remember.  Is there an intent for 

Wilson Street to connect to Fawcett Street?     

          JOE BAR:  I don't believe -- and I'm not 

remembering every aspect of the plan.  I don't believe that 

there is.  I think that's still going to sort of be that 

elbow.  Because the intent is that there is a linear park 

59

along the sort of diagonal former railroad alignment.  

          And I think that would potentially increase the 

difficulty of this.  I think we'd like to smooth out the 

sort of weird little kink at that elbow, but I don't believe 

the connection -- an additional connection to Fawcett at 

that point.  But maybe Erik's going to tell me I'm wrong.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  It depends on where you're 

talking.     

          JOE BAR:  Yeah, no that --    

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  It --    

          JOE BAR:  Yeah, okay.   

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  If you pass this point.     

          JOE BAR:  So I'm wrong.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Here's the --      

          JOE BAR:  Not the first time.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I mean, I was just looking to 

make the walk perhaps a little pleasant.  And if one could 

walk straight down Wilson to -- all the way to Fawcett --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  So the Alewife District Plan 

shows extending it east from the elbow, extending Wilson 

east on the elbow and connect to Fawcett, yes.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So it is --  

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Ignore everything I said.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- a bicycle lane that was to 

Wheeler Street?   

          JOE BAR:  Yeah.  So there's also the -- you know, 

there's also the -- it's roughly in line with the extension 

of Wilson.  It's also the road that will connect Wheeler and 

Fawcett that is partly built as part of the Atmark project, 

and we'll be building hopefully very soon for construction 

access, and then eventually as a connection to Wheeler 

Street.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And I know there were some 

discussions about extending Terminal Road?     

          JOE BAR:  So yeah, there's a thought of extending 

Terminal Road to connect to Wheeler Street.  We actually 

need -- there are some studies that we need to do on that.  

Wheeler Street is committed to some amount of funding to 

help with some of the studies and analysis. 

          If and how that gets built is still an open 

question.  The existing terminal is actually a state 

facility that's owned by DCR.  So there's just some 

complexities there, and then the bigger complexity is how we

work our way through the sort of narrow window between the 

Eversource transformer site and the existing buildings, the

figured out yet.    

studies.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's the need for 

          JOE BAR:  That's the need for studies.  And I 

think the studies start even before we think about the 

actual alignment with more of a circulation question about 

will this help or hurt in terms of cut through traffic and 

sort of taking traffic off of Alewife Brook Parkway in a 

good way, as opposed to taking traffic off of Alewife Brook 

Parkway in a bad way, but -- if that makes sense.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I guess from more of a 

pedestrian point of view, whether if the bridge -- whether 

someone from this site could basically walk straight through 

Alewife Brook Parkway, rather than going down Concord Ave, 

which we can do at some point.      

          JOE BAR:  I think you can do it now, but you have 

to climb over some --                 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Sorry, I can't hear you.

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Oh.     

          JOE BAR:  -- to do it.  Yeah, you actually can 

travel from Wheeler Street to Terminal Road on foot.  

Whether you're on private property or not and trespassing, I 

can't say for certain, but it is the -- all I know, there 

was one year when the Cambridge half marathon actually ran 

that route, and they got the barrier taken down for the day, 

          We're getting a little far afield here.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou, did you have a 

but anyway. 

question?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes, I guess it's maybe 

Joe's question, I'm not sure, so while he's here.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Adley Road?   

          JOE BAR:  Yes.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  The future plan seems to be 

much better.  I like the access.  When I was there yesterday 

afternoon, it seemed like the perfect spot to have an 

entrance, with parking in the rear.   

          I guess my question is to both sides, would that 

63

work without the Fawcett Street entrance?  And that's I 

guess probably going to go to the proponent.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Yeah, I think it's more for the 

proponent.  I will say that Adley Road -- you know, as I 

think was mentioned -- is a Private Way.  It's -- without 

getting into any details, it's been the subject of some 

challenging conversations between the neighbors.   

          And so, until that -- I would say, and obviously 

the proponent should weigh in as well, but I would say until 

that's sort of resolved in it’s a fully public way, I would 

think it could be very challenging to have that be the only 

access point.   

          But perhaps in the future there's an opportunity 

to, you know, close down one end and have it open from one 

side that I -- obviously, again, the proponent would need to 

--        

right --  

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Currently, we don't have any 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Can't.       

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I'm fine.

point, currently -- we looked at it closely.  In the 

scenario that we're building, and title examination reveals 

we don't have any rights in Adley Road.  So we couldn't put 

a driveway there now, so -- and it is a Private Way.  It's 

not even clear who's got rights in it.   

          Properties behind it do, and we're not sure how, 

frankly, that fits in with what Cabot, Cabot & Forbes has 

proposed, because that is the principal with a of access, 

and perhaps the only way of access to those condominium 

storage things at the end of Loomis Street that were 

developed and are now -- word has it are un -- presumably 

under agreement with the Cabot, Cabot & Forbes development. 

          But that's the principal way in and out.  So we've 

-- we have envisioned a scenario where we could, if the 

opportunity presented itself, put the traffic out onto Adley 

Road and not have to have the curb cut on Smith Place.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, it would avoid a lot 

of pavement --    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Exactly, it would, yeah.     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- in that strip.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  We find ourselves in the same 

scenario in both sides.  We don't have any rights in the

extension of Fawcett, and we don't have any rights in Adley.  

But I think on the Fawcett site, I think there's more 

mutuality in terms of the property owner there seems to have 

a plan where they do see themselves extending into that 

area.  So we think that's a more realistic opportunity in 

the somewhat near term.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

questions for staff?  All right.  Then let's go to comments 

and suggestions for the applicant, the things you want them 

to look at, work on, think about before they come back to us 

next time, so that we can make all the necessary findings?  

Tom?             

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Thank you.  Just briefly, my 

review of the materials I was coming in here wondering why 

we're looking at a suburban site plan.   

          But what I was of course surprised about and in 

reviewing with you was also understood was what we were 

looking at here is in fact really good planning. 

          I was anticipating proper alignment and proper 

constructions of the street, and I think this is fantastic.  

It affirms the processes that we've gone through here in the 

city, and that's so we could work and focus on staff as well 

66

as with the applicant.   

          So the plan also includes the elevated sidewalk 

that is referenced in the Alewife Plan, and the planting of 

street trees now, which is in a correct location, which is 

also terrific and also proper planning and anticipates the 

future that we all want to see. 

          Relative to things that I think the applicant 

should work on, being that he is going to have the come back 

on the architecture -- actually the architecture I like.  On 

some level, it's strong and just really straightforward and 

simple, and reminds me actually of one of my favorite 

buildings in Cambridge, which is the Polaroid headquarters 

on Memorial Drive, which is just kind of doggedly 

symmetrical around a tower structure, rather than an indent.  

          But the strong and straightforward also might be 

accused of being dull.  And so, I would really like to 

understand the way in which the tenants might begin to 

affect the elevation to give it something unexpected.  

That's referenced and the plan is fully set up to do that.  

          So I think the canopies also might help, but I 

will leave that up to the architect to figure out how that 

works.

22

          So lastly, the -- as I was looking at the findings 

that they're required to make, the one part where the 

applicant seems to come up short in my opinion actually is 

in the open space, and just building on a line of 

questioning that my colleague here opened around what's the 

appropriate parking ratio.   

          Of course, we were unable to determine that 

without the data in front of us and the analysis.  But if 

you can find a way to -- because a bridge might be coming in 

-- reduce the number of cars, if we took about 15 cars out, 

we could reduce the surface parking where the truck doesn't 

maneuver, and that could be a piece open space that would 

conserve the tenants.   

          After all, they're life science tenants.  They 

understand the ways of the world and appreciate nature.  

That could be a place that actually could be a positive 

outdoor piece of landscape in my opinion, and I'm referring 

to the surface park in the left and the rear of the 

building.   

          The diagram here -- understanding that you have to 

maneuver the trucks at this one portion, which maybe could 

be liberated once we understand the actual need for parking.

22

          So that's where I am.  I've generally been very 

positive on this plan, it's not voted a max on the FAR, like 

we often see, and we consider it very, very reasonable, a 

very carefully thought out proposal with a very strong 

business plan.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I respect my colleague very 

much.  My opinion is almost completely opposite, so I'll go 

now.  So things that I'm thinking about for here, so I'm 

kind of thinking of the overall questions, and having a 

vision for Kendall West or a mini Kendall is not at all 

attractive for me.  I think that that would exacerbate 

economic problems, and create a host of public health 

concerns. 

et cetera. 

          In terms of economics, a large percentage of 

Cambridge people are facing unsupportable costs, due to the 

increased housing prices, right?  So you've got people 

overburdened paying 50 percent of their income for housing, 

          Having this great vision of another Kendall would 

make that worse, and that means that we increase housing 

insecurity, food insecurity, educational inequality, et

          So I don't see this as good for the environment, 

good for public health or good for equity.  I only see it 

being financially beneficial to a very distinct or -- 

specifics about why I have those concerns with public 

health:  I'm worried labs have a very high carbon footprint.  

So environment wise, I'm concerned about that for the 

specific project, but then again for that whole vision. 

          I'm worried about potential pollutants, 

environmental health and safety.  I'm thinking about the 

recent article in the paper about more industrial sewage 

violators -- East Cambridge, MIT, Harvard and candy maker.  

Even when we have these great companies that are trying very 

hard to be careful, we will still have things like sewage 

violations. 

          And when I look -- I don't know who's controlling 

the images up there, but you're right by Fresh Pond, right?  

So I would be curious to know about how does sewerage work 

around there if we had a mistake and some environmental 

pollutants went into the sewage, does that just go right 

into Fresh Pond?  Does it go into a water processing plant?  

What happens?

     If we had normal, everyday use pollutants that were 

concerned to be at an acceptable level, but we had flooding, 

if there was, you know, water washing down the streets, I 

don't know enough about the grades there, would the water 

rush down to Fresh Pond, what happens?   

          But these are things I'm concerned about, not just 

what would happen regularly, but what would happen if there 

were a mistake in the lab or what would happen if there were 

a big storm and no mistake in the lab?  Those are the 

concerns -- some of the concerns I have. 

          I'm concerned public health wise about the public 

health impact of traffic.  There are a lot of articles about 

how the fine particulates from tailpipes are very dangerous 

to -- especially children and elderly -- people's health.   

          And we -- every time I go to Alewife, all I think 

about is how it's just a parking lot of cars, right, parked 

on Alewife Brook Parkway.  The public health effects of fine 

particulate matters are at a very small radius.  So it's 

like anything 0.3 miles away from the traffic.   

          But when you look at the map there of Alewife 

Brook Parkway, you've got lots of housing popping up over 

there, Finch Apartments.

          We're proud that we have a lot of inclusionary 

zoning in our city now, but that also means that you've got 

a lot of folks who are going to live in apartments very 

nearby Alewife Brook Parkway who don't have a choice of 

moving anywhere else.  So these are the kinds of things that 

concern me. 

          So other specifics that I'm concerned about -- 

just in general is it wise to have a bunch of labs in a 

flood plain, and I'm concerned about how this particular 

development would affect the entire town of Cambridge.  Is 

the water supply safe, if it's building a bunch of labs and 

adding a bunch of traffic in place that is 100 percent going 

to flood? 

          I appreciate the trees, which will help with some 

of the environmental concerns.  I appreciate that permeable 

space was far greater than required.  But there was also 

something that concerned me in the presentation, where one 

was talking about how the permeability was -- that there 

were problems with that.   

          So I think it would be useful for it to be really 

clear in the next presentation whether we're saying there 

will be a certain percentage of permeable space, or whether

we're saying that we can't achieve that because of certain 

problems. 

          I'm curious about what happens to underground 

parking lots during the floods.  Again, just thinking about 

Fresh Pond.  Would water be held and captured under the 

parking lot; would it go out down the street?  So those are 

the kinds of things that I care about.  And I'm also -- in 

the presentation, I felt confused.   

          We're talking a lot about what happens on day one, 

and what the vision for the future was.  So it would be 

really important for my decision-making process to know if 

we're deciding on the day one things, or if we're making 

decisions based on future things.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, thank you.  

Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I would agree with Tom that the 

planning has resulted in a good proposal.  I also think his 

notion about a useable open space for those 14 cars are is 

terrific, and I think these sketches show a bunch of trees.   

          I think the more trees the better, and even though 

a single tree represents an infinite improvement over the 

present state, it's shocking that we lost something like 20

percent of the trees in the city in the last decade or so.  

And the only way to get back is to plant trees wherever you 

can.  It makes sense.   

          So, as sort of a procedural comment, the city's 

main laws bring up a number of issues.  And I think the way 

to proceed is the way many applicants do -- is that in their 

resubmission, they go point by point through each point 

that's been brought up, and get you thinking on what you can 

do, maybe pieces that aren’t possible to do.  And just lay 

it out there. 

          And then that's a way to answer some of my 

colleagues' questions.  I think, you know, again, just 

bringing up big picture issues, and so what are you doing to 

-- in your project or in your management or whatever, to try 

to address those issues?  It's important to -- well, answer 

the little things I want to see next time.   

          If the loading dock is in the flood zone, so I 

want you to tell me that yes you can floodproof it so that 

it doesn't go beyond the places where the trucks might be 

able to sit if there's water there. 

          The basement plan is a nice concept, but none of 

the stairs or the elevators in the basement are in the same

place that they are on the first floor.   

          And while I have recurrent sort of dreams about 

buildings that have elevators that go sideways, that's just 

-- so I think you just need to correct that.  I don't think 

it affects the number of cars or anything, but I think it 

just needs to work.   

          I don't know what the back-screen wall materials 

are.  I think it's kind of -- it's boring, the rooftop 

enclosure, and it's an opportunity to be somewhat less 

boring.  I think dark paintings don't disappear as medium-

colored paintings.  Think of, like, a dark, cloudy day as 

something you can blend into.  We do have a few of those. 

          There's no information on the spandrel glass, 

which I assume that's what those slightly different gray 

things above the windows are spandrel glass.   

          But I'm going to try to hold your feet to the fire 

on your entire elevation of the buildings.  Because this 

building is sort of retro.  Maybe that's what Tom was 

saying.   

          But in our climate situation, we don't build walls 

of glass facing east and west, and then say in your need 

report that you could put Venetian blinds on the inside, and

that's so that people won't be affected by the glare.  

Because that’s not a very good strategy.   

          And we started to push on this several years ago 

with some success, and people trying to reduce the amount of 

glass, particularly in the east and west, where you can't 

effectively screen.   

          And so points I would notice:  You know, you have 

a lot of glass actually below counter height.  This is a lab 

building.  You're going to be looking at the backs of lab 

cabinets, there may be cords hanging down, or whatever.  

It's going to -- people tend to design their buildings, tend 

to not have any visible glass at counter height, because it 

produces a mess.   

          And again, that's very high glass walls, 

continuances breaks -- you know, people have been putting 

in, like, large mullions, patterns of mullions.  There are 

some very inventive solutions there, could be happening at 

          I think you have to accept that this building is a 

North Point. 

               st

part of the 21  century, and find the expression that 

reduces the response of climate change and the challenges 

we're facing.  I didn't see a narrative in Net Zero.  I

would convert this building to Net Zero.  It's like I would 

think you just take all the windows and you put silver paper 

or like aluminum foil.   

          There was a building at Harvard which has a glass 

wall facing east and west that would indicate laboratory, 

and aluminum foil in all of its windows.  It was built in 

the late '50s.  It had the aluminum foil, well, for like 20 

or 30 years.   

          So that's not I think the retrofit we want.  The 

city, I don't think it's actually what you want to do, but I 

think you've got to do more.  Because as Tom said, this is 

fundamentally a very good project, it just needs -- this 

piece needs some more work.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, generally I agree with a lot of 

what my colleagues have said.  I do appreciate the 

forethought everyone has put in -- both the proponent and 

city staff, and making sure that this building will fit into 

the future plan for the area, in a way that makes sense, 

both from a planning perspective and economically. 

          I totally agree with Hugh in terms of the 

environmental impacts.  I have to say I really like the

façade but, you know, I mean it's one thing to like 

something and realize that it's -- you know, you can still 

realize that it's not environmentally appropriate. 

          So I don't know what the solution is, but it does 

seem like the amount of glass needs to be reduced a little 

bit.       

          And I didn't like sort of the plainness of the 

sides.  I couldn't tell, I think it was the architect who 

mentioned that maybe there would be a combination of the 

potential pattern of the different tiles that were shown.  I 

think looking at something like that would be interesting, 

to see if that would add a little bit of life to the 

building. 

          The biggest point that I want to make, it's one 

that Tom made, which is reducing the parking -- and Ted made 

it as well -- I think we should try to reduce that parking 

ratio as much as possible, and I agree that area of open 

space would be not only appropriate, but I think something 

that would be enjoyed by the tenants and possibly just other 

people in the area as well. 

          So I would very much like you to take a look at 

that.  I would like to see if we can -- a lighting pattern

for that street would look like, and so we know what the 

impacts are there. 

          Yeah.  And I think -- you know, Corinne does raise 

a lot of very good questions.  I think it's just tough, 

because, you know, this is one building, and there is sort 

of this overarching framework that the city has put 

together, and it's hard to expect one building to meet all 

of them or address every single issue that might be 

problematic citywide. 

          So I think Hugh's approach of going through the 

memos, and the City Engineer had a very detailed list of 

sort of resiliency measures and an action plan that would be 

put together over the course of the planning process and 

prior to getting the building permit, and just thinking 

about through some of those things. 

          It doesn't really necessarily address any issues 

regarding housing and concerns like that, but it certainly 

does give you a sense of -- you know, what happens when 

there is a flood in the area and you people need to either 

shelter in place or try to get home.   

          So I think having a better sense of, like, where 

you're headed and the directions on some of that would ease

at least some of your concerns. 

          And the City Engineer can probably answer a lot of 

Corinne's questions, as well.  So perhaps maybe at the next 

meeting we could have the City Engineer here as well.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yeah, all in all, I think 

you're on your way to a good project.  First off, I made 

kind of a little bit of a list here, but yeah, this unbroken 

façade -- it needs some help.  It calls for a courtyard.  

We'd like to have something that resembles a courtyard 

somewhere in this façade. 

          I'd like to see if you can work as hard as you can 

to reduce the parking, try to get it all under the building.  

          The other question -- another question I had was, 

what are you going to do to the existing utilities?  The 

place is ringed by very heavily laden utility poles.   

          I don't know how that's going to work with your 

planting scheme and so forth.  We need some kind of insight 

into that.  I don't think it works well. 

          The blank walls on the north and south face would 

be nice to get some kind of articulation instead of these 

blank spaces.

          The glazing, yeah, I agree with my colleague Hugh.  

So below, height, now it's reaching up higher, and even more 

stuff hanging in these lab windows.  It seems to be a waste 

of time to glaze.  It would be nice to have something done 

in that area, and possibly some sun shades.  That would help 

bring some action to the side of this building, maybe.  Just 

options, something. 

          The screening, I'm happy to see that it's solid 

screening.  I don't like the transparent screen.  I'd like 

to see if we can't work on some articulation and screening, 

and possibly the proposed hospital screen.  See what that 

would look like.  I don't know if you can step this, or what 

you think it would be required.   

          And I guess my other request would be to see if we 

can get as much of the future site work done on this site.  

The realigning of the roads and the rest of this could take 

a very long time. 

          And it would be very helpful to get some of this 

in place, and as much of it in place as we could, and deal 

with those issues.  Because this will be kind of a 

laboratory experiment on some of the future work.  So it 

would be good to get down the road on that a little bit.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I agree with most 

everything my colleagues said.  I think it really is an 

excellent project -- certainly will help to transform the 

area, which in addition to having difficulty driving over 

it, it is really not very visually appealing. 

          I actually rather like the façade.  It reminds me 

of some of the grand old factory buildings, and some of the 

old mill buildings.  I don't really see the need for a 

courtyard here, but I realize that Envision sees that as a 

positive.   

          I rather like the glazing that Hugh does make a 

pretty compelling argument of why it's not necessarily 

appropriate here.  And so, I think if there was some 

compromise that could be reached, it would certainly be well 

to look into it. 

          The penthouse is quite large.  I mean, there was a 

comment that it was -- because it was big, they could spread 

it out when it was small, but it's a third of the size of 

the building, if not half the size of the building.  So I 

would like to see, you know, it being handled in a way that 

really is aesthetically pleasing.

          Also I think the comments that Erik made about -- 

Erik and you were making about the possibility of there 

being other equipment in front of the penthouse, that that 

be dealt with in some manner.   

          I agree that it's possible to go with some sort of 

pattern on the north and south façades would be nice, or 

some sort of other articulation of something, than just a 

flat façade. 

          And certainly, I would like to see a reduction in 

the parking, probably down to the 0.95, which then would 

allow increased landscaping in the back. 

          And yes, whatever can be done to Smith Place and 

the other streets right now I think ought to be done.  Those 

are my only comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I don't have a 

lot to add.  I'm delighted at how many people have already 

told you to reduce the parking.          

          COLLECTIVE: [Laughter]    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I would have gone to 0.8.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think I've heard 

from my colleagues on the façade, some people want to see it 

broken up, some people like it how it is and aren't sure, I 

83

think we at least need to see what those options look like. 

          And I personally would like to see them not just 

from the perspective of the elevations that we've been 

presented, but, like, the reason the Alewife -- Envision 

Cambridge Alewife Plan -- as defined those was to break it 

up for pedestrians, so it didn't feel like one continuous 

wall, as you were walking along it.   

          And it can look like a really handsome building 

from afar, but if you're walking along a 300-foot wall, it 

might feel less welcoming. 

          So for me that would be important to making -- to 

either saying, yes, "Oh, we revised this and it now works" 

or, "We haven't revised this, and here's why it worked to 

begin with." So that I need to be convinced on. 

          I am sure that in terms of working on the parking 

and permeability and open space, you have a lot of good 

resources within the staff on creative ways to address that 

in a phased manner if need be.  That's certainly something 

that can and has been done in the Square. 

          I would echo what colleagues have said about 

appreciating how much work has already gone into making this 

aligned with the articulated goals of the city and the 

84

Envision Plan.   

          Having spent many, many meetings at those working 

groups, this is, you know, essentially what folks expected 

in at least this part of the Quadrangle, and to see it well 

aligned and planning for, and making sure not to get in the 

way of future improvements is outstanding.   

          I do agree that anything we can do as this 

building is being built to build out Smith Place fully with 

all the amenities, it needs to have, be they trees or street 

lights, what have you, hold up through construction, would 

be great.   

          But, again, I'm sure that as you continue your 

discussions with the city departments on what's appropriate 

now, they will get into more detail on that and are better 

equipped to know what's appropriate and what not.   

     I think that's all -- unless anyone has any last-minute 

things to add?              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I guess I have two last-minute 

things.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  One is, clearly if you have 

permeable automobile paving, you collect the water and you 

85

infiltrate it, that means the spirit -- you may already be 

planning to do that.   

          And the other one there is a leakage pavement, 

which I think would be something in the area of $2.8 million 

dollars, which will leverage something like it does in the 

units of affordable housing.  We should at least recognize 

that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  Okay.  Those 

are good recommendations for things to report back on next 

time.  Jeff?  Anything else we need to cover her?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think we got plenty to work on, 

so.  We're certainly willing to work and meet with the 

proponents and discuss all these issues, and then work on a 

time to come back.    

very much.       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Terrific.  Thank you 

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.  If you could quickly exit 

the room, we have a very quick administrative matter to 

address hopefully, before adjourning.  So I'm not going to 

recess us before.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes. Okay.  So we're

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The request was to extend to March

          JEFF ROBERTS:  We'll still send out the notices 

and everything, but --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- you can put that on the record.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So do I have a 

motion to continue that hearing to March 24?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So moved.

is unanimous.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, I don't know if I'm allowed to 

vote.  I wasn't at the hearing.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  She wasn't at the 

hearing.  So all -- unanimous for all members eligible to 

vote, okay.  Now, do we also -- we need to extend the 

deadline for filing a written -- okay.  And what are we 

88

needing to extend that to?         

          JAMES STEINHILBER:  So the original deadline is 

March 9, and we have consent from the applicant to extend it 

to April 30.
