As requested, we are responding to the above-referenced City Council Policy Order POR 2019 #388 and 
City Council Order #O-8, which relates to phone scams and fraud, determining patterns to better direct 
outreach efforts, to strengthen current education programs in an attempt to avoid future instances of 
scams and fraud targeted at the senior population.  Our agencies understand the importance of educating 
those who live in Cambridge of the various scams and fraud and continue to reach out to the community.      
 
The Consumers’ Council (CCC) works in cooperation with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office 
to provide consumer rights information and assistance in resolution consumer disputes by informal 
mediation.  Through our consumer information and public assistance hotline, the CCC fields consumer 
inquiries to empower residents to be smart consumers and problem solvers through self-help strategies 
and social media.  The CCC continues to provide workshops and speaking engagements upon request and 
distribute flyers to inform consumers of this office as a resource to resolve issues along with assistance on 
how to remedy financial situations related to fraud and scams.  Our Shred Day event held twice a year is 
also used as an opportunity to distribute materials and information to the 300 plus residents.  
 
The Cambridge Police Department consistently monitors and places special attention to reports of scams 
and fraud. To make residents aware, CPD uses a multifaceted approach to generate widespread awareness 
in hopes of preventing future victimization around these issues. Scams are always evolving, but 
disseminating information to residents through door-to-door campaigns each spring, Citizen Alerts, social 
media and traditional media, and posting updates on our website have enabled messages to spread within 
and well beyond our jurisdiction.  CPD staff are always available to educate seniors on scams, crime 
trends and safety information during meetings or forums at various buildings and organizations. Our 
Senior Outreach Officers attend monthly meetings at the Senior Center the first Thursday of each month 
to address questions our senior residents may have and to update on any crime trends, including scams 
and fraud. They also conduct year-round presentations at senior housing facilities. They recently held a 
“Scams Targeting Seniors” workshop at CCTV in September 2019.

Response to Policy Order and Resolution List POR 2019 #388 
City Council Order O-8, dated September 16, 2019

The Council on Aging staff continually reminds residents to always be vigilant and on the lookout for 
scams.  We have incorporated the educational component of how to protect and what to look for in scams 
in all aspects of our day to day delivery of services to residents.  Our Scam Awareness Forum in February 
2019 by Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan and Senior Resource Fair held in September 2019 
provided a plethora of information to seniors.  Current monthly Town Meetings and workshops along 
with a new outreach program to buildings that house seniors will continue to get the word out.  Through 
the publication, Newslines which is delivered to many drop off locations in Cambridge, available online 
and mailed to consumers, we have been very proactive in reaching the community.    
 
In order to strengthen current educational programs, the Consumers’ Council, Police Department and 
Department of Human Services Council on Aging are collaborating to hold two events to promote 
awareness and education for residents to protect themselves and avoid future instances of scams and 
fraud:   
 

•  During National Consumer Protection Week, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) helps people 
understand their consumer rights and encourages consumers to make well-informed financial 
decisions.  
 
On Thursday, March 5th at 12 p.m., the Senior Center will be hosting a National Consumer 
Protection Week session on the latest scams victimizing Cambridge residents with a focus on

City Manager, Louis A. DePasquale  
Police Commissioner, Branville G. Bard, Jr. 
January 16, 2020 
Awaiting Report 19-120 – Idling Vehicles  

Dr. Branville G. Bard, Jr. 
Police Commissioner 
 
 
To: 
From: 
Date: 
Ref.: 
 
The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report #19-120, whereby the City Manager  
was requested to confer with the Police Department to provide an account on directing enforcement 
resources towards Bishop Allen Drive and other corridors with lots of vehicular idling, and to work 
with rideshare companies to adopt idling reduction technologies and practices. 
 
The Police Department has taken the following measures in response to this order: 
 

  The leadership of the Patrol Division has reminded all uniformed personnel about the laws 

regulating idling and the importance of enforcement. 

  Working with the Department’s Traffic Analyst, we are in the process of developing a list  

of additional locations that have a large volume of idling commercial and TNC 
vehicles. Including, but not limited to, the following locations: 
 

o  Massachusetts Avenue in Central, Harvard and Porter Square 
o  Cambridge Street from First Street to Inman Square 
o  Kendall Square 
o  Huron Avenue 
o  Concord Avenue 

 

  This information will be shared with the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department for 

additional “No-Idling” signage consideration in the most concentrated areas.  

  Directed Enforcement assignments are being incorporated into the department's "Park and 
Walk" program and officers will be dispatched at various times between other calls for 
service. 

  The department will utilize officers conducting enforcement under Highway Safety grants  

to incorporate idling enforcement into their patrols.

We recognize that outreach and education are key aspects of any prevention strategy. The Police 
Department will coordinate with the law enforcement divisions of the rideshare companies and other 
city agencies that have existing relationships with representatives of the rideshare companies to make 
them aware of our concerns, and to develop anti-idling educational materials and public awareness 
campaigns.  
 
Our outreach efforts will include asking schools to distribute warnings at school drop off and pick  
up locations, and encouraging businesses to post “No-Idling” signs in their parking lots, etc. 
 
The Police Department will also explore other existing relationships with partners such as the 
Metropolitan Planning Council to demonstrate that this a regional concern and not just a local 
concern. 
 
In order to measure the success of the department’s outreach efforts, we will evaluate the number  
of warnings and tickets issued and closely monitor our target locations for improved compliance. 
Signage, written and verbal reminders, and encouragement are all important components of any 
program designed to promote behavioral changes. 
 
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions, information 
needed or concerns regarding this matter, please let me know. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr. 
Police Commissioner

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for

number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the 
“Order”), which ordered that a petition be submitted to the General Court of the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

VICE MAYOR DEVEREUX 
COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN 
COUNCILLOR CARLONE 
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge is working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of its 
response to the climate crisis; and 
 
An estimated 43% of emissions in Massachusetts come from transportation, and 
driving personal gasoline-powered vehicles causes a large portion of those emissions; 
and 
 
The City of Cambridge’s Climate Action Plan states that in order to reach our 
sustainability goals, the City must actively pursue innovative methods to reduce 
vehicular emissions; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Many gasoline nozzles come equipped with a “nozzle talker” that could easily hold a 

small label; and 
 
Requiring these labels at the gas pump will provide consumers with information about 
the impact of fossil fuel consumption directly at the point of purchase, which may 
encourage them to reduce their consumption and use alternative forms of transportation 
when appropriate; and 
 
The fight to reverse climate change requires that everyone take action to change their 
behavior, and the City must underscore the fact that each individual’s behavior can 
make an impact on the environment and on public health; and 
 
In City Manager’s Agenda #13 of October 17, 2016, the City Solicitor opined that such 
an ordinance would violate neither the First Amendment nor the Commerce Clause, as 
long as it contains “purely factual and uncontroversial” information; now therefore be 
it 
 
That the proposed amendment to article 8.12.010 of the Municipal Code (as attached) 
be referred to the Ordinance Committee for hearing and report before the end of 2019; 
and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor and the 
appropriate staff to review the language of this draft amendment and to report back to 
the City Council in advance of the Ordinance Committee hearing.

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours,

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

14% of students in Cambridge Public Schools who have an Individualized Education 
Program (IEP) are identified as having Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which is 
over 200 children in Cambridge; and 
 
Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), especially children, may find it 
overwhelming to be in stressful situations, such as those that require Police attention; 
and  
 

 
WHEREAS:  Many individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) find sensory items help them 

remain calm by providing an outlet for energy; and 
 
Some municipalities in the United States, such as Clearcreek Township, OH, 
Brunswick, OH, and Frankenmuth, MI, have equipped First Responders with “sensory 
bags” filled with items to be used when responding to a scene involving someone who 
has Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); and 
 
These sensory bags contain items that can keep an individuals’ hands busy, reduce 
noise, and help them communicate with First Responders, which can make for a better 
experience when a person with ASD is faced with a stressful situation; and 
 
Cambridge Police Officers receive Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) training during a 
40 hour Crisis Intervention Training, but could benefit from having additional tools to 
keep residents who have ASD calm during Police interactions; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with the Cambridge Police 
Commissioner and other relevant departments to determine the feasibility of 
purchasing sensory bags for Police vehicles as a pilot program; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the Council in time for the FY21 budget.

can ensnarl commuters through numerous light cycles; and 
 
For those who reside on Whittemore Avenue or one of its connecting streets, access to 
this residential neighborhood is cut off from 3:00PM to 7:00PM even to abutters, 
causing further consumption of time, fuel, and road space as residents are forced to 
drive through the Massachusetts Avenue intersection; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with all relevant city and

Avenue from Alewife Brook Parkway to include an exception for abutters.

WHEREAS: 

Public transportation offers a crucial service to Cambridge residents, as 28% of 
residents rely on public transportation to get to work, and a quarter of a million public 
transportation rides start or end in Cambridge each day; and 
 
The cost of public transportation can be burdensome for low-income residents, 
especially after the MBTA fare increases during Summer 2019; and 
 
The City already supports transit access for low-income residents by, for example, 
providing free MBTA passes to eligible Cambridge Rindge and Latin School students, 
but increasing the scope of transit justice efforts could benefit vulnerable communities; 
and 
 
Other municipalities across the United States, including Lawrence, MA, Kansas City, 
MO, and Olympia, WA, have found success with implementing free public 
transportation pilot programs, experiencing increased ridership, quicker boarding, more 
efficient and timely route coverage, and positive community feedback, and the Boston 
City Council is considering a fare-free bus route; and 
 
Cambridge has a vested interest in encouraging public transportation use, as increasing 
ridership and decreasing car trips aligns with the City’s Climate Action Plan, and 
overarching commitment to sustainability; and 
 
Furthermore, free public transportation would support the Envision Cambridge 
mobility goals on equity and accessibility, as well as climate mitigation and resilience; 
and 
 
Creating a pilot program for one bus route that has a high level of ridership and high 
connectivity levels within Cambridge, such as the #1, #68 or #69 routes, could grant 
meaningful insight on the feasibility of expanding free ridership in the future; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to confer with relevant City 
Departments, and, where relevant, the MBTA and counterparts in other municipalities 
for routes not wholly in Cambridge, on the feasibility of instituting and funding a fare-
free pilot bus program; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that families and administrators of the 
Amigos School, 15 Upton Street, feel that Upton Street is in need of sufficient traffic-
calming interventions to better ensure the safety of students, caregivers, staff, and 
residents; and 
 
Examples of potential traffic-calming interventions include: 1) adding a posted School 
Zone sign (with blinking lights and flashing speed limit numbers during morning 
arrival and afternoon dismissal times); 2) increasing the presence of uniformed police 
to incentivize drivers to reduce vehicle speeds while driving on Upton St.; 3) the 
addition of a speed-bump or other speed-lowering infrastructure on Upton St.; and 4) 
the addition of a posted Do Not Enter sign at the Pleasant St. end of Upton St. 
(entering from Magazine St., exiting onto Pleasant St.) that would designate Upton St. 
as a one-way street for a time period of one hour, to coincide with the morning drop-
off period (i.e. 8:00 AM – 9:00 AM, or a slightly expanded time frame, e.g. 7:30 AM - 
9:30 AM), on school days only; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Director of the 
Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department on the potential for implementing 
sufficient traffic-calming solutions on Upton Street, including but not limited to those 
mentioned above, and report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely matter.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL 

 

January 23, 2020 

To the City Council: 

I am resubmitting the Welcoming City Ordinance, complete with amendments that the Cambridge Police 
and Massachusetts American Civil Liberties Union agreed on. I did not include proposed changes that 
the Police and ACLU did not agree on, nor did I include amendments that require more information from 
the Cambridge Police.  Below is a summary of the proposed changes that we will discuss in committee. 

In Section D, federal requests for information, the Police Department representative stated that the police wish 
to cooperate with federal agencies outside of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.  The ACLU 
representative Laura Rotoldo did not object to this change, provided the police state the agencies they want to 
work with for criminal enforcement, and only cooperate when they are able to show probable cause. 
 
Section E, encountering persons driving without a license, the police requested we strike this section. The ACLU 
believes this section is integral to the purpose of the Welcoming City Ordinance and should not be taken out.  I 
agree with the ACLU. 
 
In Section F, notice to individuals subject to ICE interventions, the police believe this section is too broad.  The 
ACLU asked for clarification on what paperwork the police would not want shared with a person issued a 
summons or arrested. 
 
I also received a public inquiry on Section I, raids and other immigrant enforcement actions. A resident was 
concerned that this section enables Cambridge Police to support ICE during raids, even if in a supporting 
function.   
 
I am willing to consider amendments to the ordinance, provided we pass the strongest laws protecting our 
immigrant population possible  
 
Sincerely,

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
RESOLVED: 

Congress enacted the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in 1975 in order to offset the 
burden of Social Security taxes on taxpayers with low-income, to supplement wages 
and provide a direct cash refund to households; and 
 
Since its enactment in 1975, the EITC has lifted millions of families above the poverty 
line, maintaining a high participation rate relative to other programs designed to serve 
those with low-income; and 
 
Each year, millions of employed Americans and thousands of employed Massachusetts 
residents are eligible for the EITC, but do not realize that they qualify or know how to 
claim it; and 
 
The Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee (CEOC) is a certified IRS VITA 
(Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) site and provides free tax preparation with 
electronic filing, which can return taxpayers' refunds in 10 days or less; and 
 
The CEOC provides this service in English, Spanish, Haitian Kreyol, Amharic and 
Portuguese at its 11 Inman Street office and at sites throughout the Cambridge 
community in order to make the filing process easy for all tax filers; and  
 
The CEOC completed over 2,500 tax returns in 2019, resulting in over $5.1 million in 
state and federal refunds, including over $1.5 million in EITC; and 
 
The CEOC also assists tax filers in applying for SNAP and other public benefits, 
including health insurance and ITINs (Individual Tax Identification Numbers), and 
provides financial education and coaching, individual credit counseling, and FAFSA 
preparation assistance to support families in achieving economic security; and 
 
The EITC increases revenues in Cambridge and boosts the overall economy; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record proclaiming January 31, 2020 as “Volunteer 
Income Tax Assistance and Earned Income Tax Credit Awareness Day” in the City of 
Cambridge, and that working individuals and families in Cambridge be encouraged to 
recognize the benefits of the EITC and utilize the CEOC’s free tax preparation services 
to claim the credit and avoid for-profit tax preparer fees.

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR 

Sumbul Siddiqui 
Mayor 

 
To: 

 

Cambridge City Council 

From:   

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor 

Date: 

 

January 23, 2020 

To the Honorable, the City Council: 

Subject: 

Communicating information from School Committee Meeting January 21, 2020 

The School Committee and administration held its first Community Meeting on January 21, 2020, inviting 
input from staff on the FY21 School Department Budget Priorities. I have attached the presentation for your 
review. A similar Community Meeting and presentation will be held this Saturday, January 25 at 10:00am 
at  the  Cambridge  Senior  Center,  850  Mass  Ave.,  for  parents  and  caregivers.  The  input  from  the  two 
Community Meetings will be reviewed at the upcoming School Committee Budget Retreat on Tuesday, 
January 28 at 6:00pm in the Dr. Henrietta Attles Meeting Room.  

During  the  School  Committee’s  Regular  Business  Meeting  on  Tuesday,  January  21,  Superintendent 
Kenneth  Salim  provided  an  update  on  the  Committee’s  priorities  for  2019-2020;  this  presentation  is 
attached. It should be noted that the CPS school district has committed to 1) improve the investigation and 
response system for racist incidents and other inappropriate behavior reported by students regarding adult 
staff members; 2) design mandatory staff strategy on anti-racism and racial equity issues; and 3) center the 
voices of families of color, while actively engaging with parents and caregivers around issues of equity and 
racial equity. Additionally, on January 30 CPS will launch a new newsletter focused on equity, with regular 
updates surrounding these commitments.  

At last Tuesday’s meeting the School Committee also approved a motion calling for a School Committee 
Retreat with district administrators and the Building Equity Bridges leadership team. The purpose of this 
retreat will be to provide an opportunity for developing a shared understanding of the work raised in each 
of the twelve areas outlined by the Building Equity Bridges movement, as well as recommend policies that 
strengthen the district’s racial equity and anti-racism work. I will be providing future correspondence on 
how the City Council can best support this work in partnership with the School Committee. Please contact 
me with any questions or concerns. 

Respectfully, 

 

 

Sumbul Siddiqui

Developing the Budget | CPS Equity Definition
Our budget process seeks to align our resources to the District Plan and to ensure 
that our commitment to equity for all students guides decisions about resource 
allocation.

7.1.b

EQUITY

RACIAL EQUITY

Racial equity 
means the absence of 
institutional and 
structural barriers 
experienced by 
people based on race 
or color, that impede 
access, 
opportunities, and 
results.

Equity means that 
each student, 
regardless of race, 
ethnicity, nationality, 
gender, gender 
identity, disability, 
sexual orientation, 
religion, or 
socioeconomic status 
will have access to the 
opportunities, 
resources, and 
support they need 
to attain their full 
potential.

Achieving racial 
equity requires 
proactive and 
continuous investment 
in communities of 
color, who have 
endured centuries of 
systemic oppression. 
CPS is committed to 
dismantling structures 
rooted in white 
privilege, to hearing 
and elevating 
underrepresented 
voices, and recognizing 
and eliminating bias.

CPS Equity Definition: Adopted August 2018

7.1.c

EQUITY

RACIAL EQUITY

Equity means that each 
student, regardless of 
race, ethnicity, 
nationality, gender, 
gender identity, 
disability, sexual 
orientation, religion, or 
socioeconomic status 
will have access to the 
opportunities, resources, 
and support they need 
to attain their full 
potential.

CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

Racial equity means 
the absence of 
institutional and 
structural barriers 
experienced by people 
based on race or color, 
that impede access, 
opportunities, and 
results.

Achieving racial equity 
requires proactive and 
continuous investment in 
communities of color, 
who have endured 
centuries of systemic 
oppression. CPS is 
committed to 
dismantling structures 
rooted in white privilege, 
to hearing and elevating 
underrepresented 
voices, and recognizing 
and eliminating bias.

Initial Anti-Racist Actions 
in progress

On December 20, we communicated our 
commitments to three initial actions.  

1.

Improve investigation & response 
system for racist incidents and other 
inappropriate behavior reported by 
students regarding adult staff members.  

On January 30, CPS will launch a new newsletter 
focused on equity, sharing more details on a broader 
set of specific actions. 

Each month, we will provide regular updates on  
progress and ways for stakeholders to be involved. 

● Addressing current policies and practices

2. Design mandatory staff training strategy 
on anti-racism and racial equity issues.  

● Building staff and district capacity 

3. Center the voices of students and 

● Community engagement and capacity 

families of color, while actively engaging 
with our broad community of parents and 
caregivers around issues of equity and 
racial equity.

The Ordinance Committee will meet to conduct a public hearing on a proposed municipal 
ordinance entitled “Prohibition of Natural Gas Infrastructure in New Buildings”. 

 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for coming to the Ordinance committee meeting. The Ordinance 
committee has a quorum. We are joined by me the chair, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Zondervan, 
Councillor Carlone, Councillor Siddiqi, various city staff and a whole bunch of people in the public. The 
call this meeting is the Ordinance committee will meet to conduct a public hearing on a proposed 
municipal ordinance entitled prohibition of natural gas infrastructure in new buildings. Everyone should 
have, at least, all the council should have two sets of documents in front of them. There are also 
documents in the back. One is, on the front of it, titled Ordinance committee, it says committee meeting 
agenda. There are four items in that, that's got the call of the meeting at the top. And the other one, it 
starts off with a City of Cambridge office of the city solicitor letter, and that is dated today, December 11, 
2019. So those are the two sets of documents. The first set the ordinance committee, committee meeting 
agenda, one, those are all things that the clerk had in time to put on the agenda. The other ones he did not 
get in time to put on the agenda but they will be part of the record.... And at some point... I am looking for 
the first time now at the December 11, 2019, law memo from the law department. We will probably take a 
break to read that. But we're going to start with a comment by me that the meeting is being audio and 
video recorded. There are attendee and speaker signup sheets. If a member of the public does not wish to 
speak, please indicate "no" on the speaker signup sheet that's on the table to the left of that barrier as you 
look at it. If members of the comments have written... if members of the public have written comments, 
please ask them you to leave them with the city clerk or to email those comments to the city clerk. The 
format of the hearing will be as follows the petitioners will be heard first, in this case, sort of the lead 
behind this is Councillor Zondervan. We have city staff who can provide their input. After both 
Councillor Zondervan and city staff councillors will have the opportunity to... I didn't see you Councillor 
Mallon over there when introduced everyone, I apologize, I can't see that far with my glasses on or read at 
the same time. And then after that clarifying questions, we will go to public comment. Public comment is 
limited to three minutes per person. And then we will close public comment and bring it back to the 
committee for discussion. It is a two hour meeting. So we will be done at four o'clock if not earlier. So, 
with that being said, I'm going to suggest that we take five minutes to read the law departments memo.

And then when all the councillors are looking up, I'll assume that we're ready to go on to hear from 
Councillor Zondervan. Councillors finished reading the legal memo yet? Okay, so after you finish the law 
department memo, Councillor Zondervan if you would take a few moments and explain this and I believe 
also you wanted to read your email as well. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Mr. Chair, and through you, to my colleagues and members of the public. First, I would like 
to frame this conversation a little bit and say why we're here and why we're trying to ban burning of gas in 
new buildings. Earlier today, one of my friends and Cambridge resident, Sue Donaldson, was arrested, 
protesting the Weymouth compressor station, which as you may know, is compressing gas to move it 
through pipelines at high pressure and is an example of new gas infrastructure that's being built in our 
state. When we know that burning natural gas causes climate change, and is primarily derived from 
fracking, which causes all kinds of environmental destruction, as well. Also, earlier today, Time magazine 
announced that the Person of the Year for 2019 is Greta Thunberg, is a 16 year old climate activist, who 
was traveling the world mostly by sailboat and train to let people know that this is a very urgent issue and 
that if we fail to take action, her future and those of people her age is... is forfeit. So we have in 
Cambridge a That's your action plan. And I'm parts partially responsible for its existence. And it is a very 
good plan. And it will make a big difference in our response to climate change. And it anticipates that 
future buildings will be net zero emissions, meaning that they will not contribute to climate change 
through their operation. So if we are already planning to do that, and if our scientists are telling us that we 
have about 10 years to drastically reduce our emissions, and we have our young people striking and 
protesting, and we have our old people protesting and striking and getting arrested. Why on earth would 
we build another building in Cambridge that burns natural gas? And if we were to do so, we would know 
that we would have to rip out that gas burning infrastructure in the very near future, which wouldn't make 
any sense. So this summer, Berkeley, California was the first municipality in the country, to my 
knowledge, to pass a ban on gas combustion in newly constructed buildings. And I have taken that 
language from Berkeley and adapted it, to the best of my abilities, to Massachusetts with the help of my 
colleague, Councillor Siddiqi. And earlier this fall, Brookline, Massachusetts passed a very similar 
warrant article in their town meeting that is also based on the Berkeley language originally, although they 
did make some amendments to it. So I'll give you a quick overview of the proposed ordinance and it is 
relatively simple. It's only three pages long. And it applies to the building... the inside of the building, it 
does not attempt to regulate the utilities or the pipes that would be running to the building. This is all 
behind the meter regulation and we do not believe that it interferes with the building codes or the energy 
codes in any way. And it basically says natural gas infrastructure shall be prohibited in newly constructed 
buildings. That's the main provision. And then it does have some exceptions. So it it says it may be 
permitted in newly constructed buildings if it's not physically feasible to construct a building without 
natural gas infrastructure. So, if a developer were to come forward with a building proposal, and it simply 
wasn't possible to build that building without having gas consumption in the building, then it would be 
allowed under this ordinance. And it also has a public interest exemption as well. So that if someone were 
to say, build a hospital, and were to say that it requires burning gas to operate a hospital, and our city 
could find that it was in the public interest to allow this hospital to be built and to burn gas, despite the 
existence of this ordinance. And if there is an exemption... it does have... it's very narrowly tailored so it 
would allow for gas to be provided to that specific appliance or use in the building but not, suddenly, 
generally to the building as a whole. That's pretty much it in terms of the proposed ordinance, and they'll 
be some time for... for a few questions. I'm sure. We did receive some letters that I would like to share as 
well. We received a letter from Harvard University that asks some questions. We asked... we received a 
letter from the Chamber of Commerce that asks us not to pass this ordinance. We received a letter from 
Jacob Knowles, an architect with a lot of experience building, all electric and net zero buildings. That was 
very supportive of The proposed ordinance. And then we received a communication from the 
Massachusetts Coalition for Sustainable Energy. And I did a little bit of research on that organization. 
And I sent a letter to the clerk, which I believe... it's available on the agenda, but he didn't want to send it

to all of you because of the Open Meeting Law. So I want to just read my memo really quickly so that 
you're aware of what it says. Dear Mr. Wilson, please convey to my colleagues on the council the 
following information. The Massachusetts Coalition for Sustainable Energy, despite its name is in fact a 
front group for natural gas interests, as can be seen from their website, specifically the text below. And I 
won't read all the text but the important part is, it says expanding or natural gas access the most affordable 
and cleanest alternative is the best way to backstop our transition to renewable energy. So from that 
language, expanding our natural gas access, and the most affordable and cleanest alternative, both of 
which are false statements, we can see that this group is in fact fronting for the natural gas industry. And 
then I also included a couple of articles in the media that further make that case. So that concludes my 
remarks for now. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much Councillor.  Does any councillor have a clarifying question for Councillor 
Zondervan? Councillor Siddiqui. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui   
Thank you, Mr. Chair through you. I wanted to quickly provide an additional note on what Councillor 
Zondervan said. We had a prior meeting to this, where we discussed this topic. And something that came 
up was this question of, in my opinion, how... how can we do something that is practical and ideally, 
make it work for everyone? And the closest example we have to us is Brookline. So I think we did talk to, 
we did say, you know, we... we want to know how it's worked in other cities, what are the differences, 
and so forth, because I know in Brookline, there's been... their bylaw has exemptions as they are setting 
up... they would like to set up a new board for hardship waivers, you know, med labs are exempted, and 
so forth. So I think what we don't see from the proposed language is that this is a step forward in the 
conversation. There's a lot more conversation to be had on how this... what it could look like. And so we 
now have some more feedback from [sic] the solicitor's office. So I think this... there's folks who've 
submitted testimony say... saying don't pass this, don't pass that. There's really... we're trying to think 
about what it could look like and go from there. Because it is a very complex issue and something that all 
of us care about. So I just wanted to put that out there. I think people are like, oh, we're going to pass this 
ordinance today. Just want to let people know that it's... there's a huge interest in this and that there's a lot 
of... there's some details that we have to figure out. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you other clarifying... Councillor Mallon. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Through you, just to build on what Councillor Siddiqui was saying, I have been 
spending a few days looking at Brooklines' Article 21 and their suggested bylaws that are now being 
reviewed by the Attorney General's office. And there are some significant exemptions in there that, you 
know, I think this is a conversation we're starting and having with the community, but in speaking with 
Brookline board members, they have over 30 meetings with various committees and external stakeholders 
to get to a place where there wasn't.... There wasn't anybody that came and spoke against this bylaw when 
they voted on it. I think that's a testament to the tremendous amount of community support and effort that 
they put into figuring out the exemptions that might work, figuring out how this could work in the best 
interest of the impending climate change and what we need to do to get to reduce our emissions by 2050. 
The state standards, I think this is a really critical conversation, but I do want to underscore what 
Councillor Siddiqi said and allay some fears. This is a starting point and I appreciate the Councillors that 
have put this forward in particular, I think... I...when I looked at the the ordinance language that was, you 
know, based on Berkeley, it does feel a little light. So I think this is a great place for us to talk about what 
that looks like to fill it in for here in Cambridge and what we need to do to move forward. And I want to 
thank the City Solicitor for putting together this idea that we need to have a home rule legislation because

I know the pushback in Brookline has been that this undermines a key purpose of the state utility law 
ensuring that residents can access a gas service and only the state can regulate utility. So it will be 
interesting to see what the Attorney General does come back with on Brookline, but I think it's important 
for Cambridge to be pushing on this, as the Attorney General is looking at that. So I look forward to the 
conversation today. I look forward to the many conversations that will come after this to put together 
something for Cambridge that will really work. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you. Other clarifying questions? Okay, does anyone from the city staff, I think particularly Miss 
Glowa from the Solicitor's Office, want to come and give a brief overview of what the city staff thinks 
about this? 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. The only thing I wanted to add is that cities have the authority under state law to 
pass ordinances without approval by the Attorney General. But town's bylaws must be approved by the 
attorney general. So I just wanted to clarify for this body that the Brookline bylaw is not in effect. We 
have spoken with the attorney general's office, they are presently reviewing it. They don't anticipate a 
decision until March or so. But I just wanted to clarify that to the extent that there may be any 
misperception about whether that was precedent that could be useful to us, because until the AG has 
spoken, I don't think it meets that standard. And otherwise, I think the legal analysis is pretty 
straightforward. I'm happy to answer questions. But it is our analysis that it is... would likely be found to 
be preempted by state law. If this were challenged in court. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development   
Through you Mr. Chair. I just wanted to add one item that we had spoken about when this was discussed 
in Committee, which is going... just looking at the California example. And one of the major differences 
between Massachusetts and California is that at the state level, California is looking at all of the various 
building types and essentially making determination of what building types, at what point, are able to be 
able to essentially function without the gas connection. So the building... that building profile analysis is 
being done at the state so that then communities are able to reference those. So if you look at the... the 
ordinances that are adopted in California, they are essentially not making all buildings subject right away. 
And in some ways, as Councillor Zondervan pointed out, our net zero action plan lays out a pathway for 
us, but then we also have an assessment process before the requirement gets triggered for each of the 
building types. But we don't have a state agency in Massachusetts that is either currently doing that 
analysis that is happening in California and nor is... nor do we know that there is that intention at the state 
level. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Your last statement Ms. Farooq was very powerful that there is no 
study going on. And we know with the plastic bag ban and other issues that many of these things have to 
start in the towns and the cities to get action. In fact, the state in California didn't seriously look into this 
until word of Berkeley was coming forth that they knew these meetings had started. And I think that's 
what we're trying to do today is to get the process going, sending out a strong message just like in 
Brookline. You know, I suffer from asthma. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
 I'm sure there's a question.  Clarifying one there.

Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Didn't I ask question. The question was, when did California begin and I guess I answered it. I apologize. 
But is it not true? I'll make it into a question. Thank you, Mr. Chair, my fellow chair. I'll make it into a 
question. Isn't it true that it has to start somewhere and the state is nowhere near where we are or 
Brookline is in this issue? 
 
Iram Farooq   
Through you, Mr. Chair, I'm not sure that you... I think you... this is a rhetorical question. I can't speak for 
the state. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Well, you mentioned that the state is not looking into this. So I'm just asking this... isn't this the way it's 
supposed to begin? And as someone who is affected by the quality of air I'm tired of waiting for a state 
that has to be pushed. So my question is Isn't this the way that it's done that the cities and towns push on 
subjects that are needed locally? From a planning point of view? All right, I'll change the question. What 
is the staff's opinion about the merits of pushing this proposal forward? You have a strong environmental 
staff who are advocating change. And what is their opinion on on this matter, as their leader? 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Can, can I interject? I don't know that that's a clarifying question. We'll get the policy questions later. But 
questions... 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
I was looking for a question in my comment to satisfy your request. I'll wait. Thank you.  
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thanks.  Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And I do have a couple of questions about the legal opinion. And forgive me since 
I'm not a lawyer. So some of these might be a little simplistic, but it's my understanding from reading the 
memo that the requirement for a home rule is triggered by, by to essentially two objections, one that we 
cannot regulate the utilities in our city. And two that, we cannot supersede the building codes. And so I 
would appreciate a little bit of explanation on both of those because it's my understanding that we're doing 
neither. So if you could clarify on why this would be interpreted as regulating utilities since it only 
impacts the inside of the building, and then second, why it would be interpreted as superseding the 
building code. Since we are not requiring specific equipment or specific building techniques, we are 
simply prohibiting a certain type of equipment which I believe we have the power to do. So we 
undoubtedly prohibit all kinds of stuff in our buildings like lead paint or something else that I don't know 
about. So I'm just trying to understand the legal theory a little better as to how these... this ordinance 
would conflict with those two provisions. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
Through you, Mr. Chair, I think it's a little hard to answer with the kind of technical analysis or detail that 
I think you're asking. This has more to do with general principles of preemption, and the fact that the state 
regulates public utilities, and the State Building Code regulates construction of infrastructure related to 
provision of utilities. So, for example, on page three, we talked about the inspection and regulation of 
buildings being done through the building code. And the... that would include building permits that you 
would need to get for this kind of infrastructure. So if we had this ban, it would be a local regulation that 
would prohibit somebody from getting a State Building Code permit that they would otherwise, 
presumably, assuming they meet the other criteria, be permitted to get under the State Building Code

scheme. So because the state does regulate the issuance of building codes, sorry, building permits for 
those functions, that would be the type of preemption that courts would usually look upon. And the same 
thing would be true with respect to public utilities that the state has indicated an intent to regulate the 
provision of utilities through public infrastructure and how it's delivered, how it's sold, how the 
infrastructure works, and all of those things. So I, I apologize, I can't really get into more technical details 
than that. But I do believe that, looking at the cases that we've cited that pertain to these issues, generally, 
and our understanding of how a preemption analysis works under legal principles, we feel that 
unfortunately, that that's not within our Home rule powers at this time. As I said, if it's the council's wish, 
we could certainly prepare a draft Home rule petition for the council to consider. But I don't believe at 
this time that it's within your Home rule authority to regulate these two areas. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Great, thank you. So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying it doesn't so much technically 
depend on what we're trying to do. But... but just more generally, that these areas are regulated by the 
state and so we can't interfere with a regulation at all. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
Through you, Mr. Chair. I feel like they're two questions to the second question. Yes, we can't interfere. 
To the first question. It might matter what you're trying to do. And that's where, you know, the devil is 
often in the details. So we would look at what... what it is, in any given circumstance that the council was 
trying to do at a local level and see whether there was preemption by the state. In terms of this ordinance 
that we reviewed, it appears that it would conflict with the state preemption of these areas. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks. It sounds like that's particularly related to the building permit issue. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
Three, Mr. Chair, I think it's both the building permit issue and the regulation or restrictions upon the 
provision of public utilities specifically here natural gas. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks. Yeah. But again, this is my non legal opinion but we are not interfering with provision of natural 
gas to the building were simply prohibiting its use inside the building. Regarding the... the building 
permit, would it be less preemptive if we didn't denied a building permit but prohibited the gas 
infrastructure in some other way in that... in that construction So, for example, I was reviewing section 
15.12.020, which seems to regulate in our municipal code... that seems to regulate issuing a permit for gas 
and plumbing work during construction. So we could for example, say that we will deny any such permits 
that involve adding or modifying gas in new construction. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
Through you Mr. Chair. Respectfully, I think that is along the same lines of what... what this ordinance is 
already proposing to do, which is restricting the ability of that property occupant to use natural gas.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
So I have one question and it is sort of along the same lines that Councillor Zondervan was asking. And it 
goes to how far we can go before we're preempted by the thoughts on utilities. And I don't know if we 
have this but if we were to pass an ordinance that said something like you can only use low flow 
showerheads. Would that be the sort of thing because water is utility? I understand that we we run our

own utility, but in theory is that the sort of thing that a municipality couldn't do because that impacts a 
utility that's governed by the state. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
Mr. Chair, I'm not an expert in all things technical, but I do believe there is some regulation about low 
flow shower fixtures already at either the state or federal level, at least in terms of how they're sold and 
some instructions on... that they are meant to be sold that way. I don't know. I'd have to look at whatever 
it is the council was proposing. And then we'd have to analyze it against the backdrop of the existing legal 
framework to be able to more specifically answer that question. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Okay. I apologize for the hypothetical, but I didn't get this until not that long ago. So I didn't have enough 
time there. Either do my research or prep you to do yours? And then a related question, as you talk about 
Home Rule petition. Can you just outline what the aspects of a home rule petition are. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
A home rule petition will be a petition to the legislature saying that the municipality wants to be permitted 
to do something that would otherwise be prohibited under state law. And for the legislature to give 
authorization to that municipality or if there was more than one, those municipalities to have that 
legislation, even though it only affects that one or number of municipalities, not all municipalities 
statewide. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you. And does that mean that the legislature votes on it, as the Senate and representatives and then 
the governor signs it or vetoes it, and then it's subject to an override, like other legislation? 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor   
I don't know about the override part, but the rest of that is the process. Yes. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Okay. Thank you. Other clarifying questions? Okay, seeing none will go to public comment. Public 
comment is an opportunity for people to share their thoughts on this issue. Please, don't share your 
thoughts unless you're speaking so no clapping, no booing, no snapping. We want everyone to feel 
comfortable at the podium sharing their opinions. We have a number of people signed up, the time limit is 
three minutes per person. If I call your name and you've decided that you don't want to speak please don't 
feel any obligation to do so. The first up is Susan RedLich, followed by Bill Actly from Eversource. It 
looks like... I think I might of got the last name wrong. Followed by Kathy Leflash and I will wave my 
arms and do something other dramatic, otherwise dramatic when you've got about 15 seconds left and 
then you will stop at three minute. Okay. Introduce yourself, where you live and then start speaking. 
 
 
Okay, thank you. I'm Susan RedLich. I've lived in Cambridge for over 30 years and I'm a environmental 
planner with a background in public health. I'm currently active in the group mothers out front and 350 
Massachusetts. I would like to add to your deliberations the importance of working out this proposed 
ordinance for reasons of environmental justice. By allowing the continued use of default methane gas in 
new construction, the city is in effect placing the burden of respiratory illnesses on the most vulnerable 
populations here and elsewhere. Wells, pipelines and compressor stations are disproportionately located 
in low income minority and marginalized communities, where they may leak gas, endanger health, while 
producing no local benefits. Gas combustion, for example, and kitchen stoves generates oxides of 
nitrogen that increase asthma risk and aggravate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It also releases 
CO2. The documented health effects of these toxic contaminant releases cannot be avoided by people

living in these communities. In addition, the indoor releases from kitchen stove gas top... kitchen stove 
gas carries an airborne contaminants that exacerbate asthma. We would be forcing children who might 
live in new affordable housing stock here in Cambridge to be exposed to these dangers. As a recent article 
in the New England Journal of Medicine makes clear physicians consider the expansion of natural gas 
infrastructure to be a grave hazard to human health. Despite the specific contaminants, details of the 
specific contaminants are document in a letter from the Greater Boston physicians for social responsibility 
to Governor Baker. Okay. Despite the letter and letters from 100 Massachusetts Boards of health about 
the health risks of natural gas, state agencies and Governor Baker have not been responsive. All the more 
reason for municipalities such as Cambridge to act as elected officials, the council has a power to prevent 
more emissions and to do it with speed, a distinct advantage over the utility industry response time. Last 
week, the UN environmental protection... environmental program report made clear that the only way to 
stay below the 1.5 degrees threshold of global temperature rise is to make dramatic emission reductions of 
methane and CO2 by at least 7.6% per year. When I was born, the global mean amount of atmosphere of 
CO2 was 310 parts per million. By the time my daughter was born, the figure was 354 parts per million. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much Your time is up. Next speaker is Bill Ackley, followed by Kathy LaFlash. 
Followed by John Bunopane, make sure the mic is on and you have three minutes, introduce yourself and 
speak. 
 
 
Okay, thank you very much and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today. And your focus on 
clean energy. I'm here representing Eversource energy, a natural gas and electric utility. It serves 1.7 
million customers here in Massachusetts, begin by stating that we are unequivocally aligned and fully 
support the move to cleaner... and cleaner energy future and share your goal of working to reduce carbon 
emissions. We have demonstrated this not only words but in actions. We are the number one provider of 
energy efficiency in the nation, which is the foundation for how we get to where we need to get to a 
greenhouse gas reductions. We're delivering 70 megawatts of clean utility scale solar across 22 sites in 
Massachusetts. We're expanding EV charging stations, advancing battery storage technology, partnering 
with [sic] to deliver up to 4000 megawatts of offshore wind. And today Eversource has announced its 
industry leading goal to be carbon neutral by 2030. We're investing also in the resiliency and 
modernization of electric grid and enabling clean distribute energy to be optimized and delivered to all 
our customers. Our responsibility as a regulated gas electric utility to ensure our customers have safe, 
reliable, affordable and increasingly cleaner energy to meet their needs. From the hottest summer day to 
the coldest summer night. We have an incredible team of men and women working here for Eversource 
that are on the job 24 seven to make this happen. With this we have a deep understanding of what it takes 
to meet our region's energy demands, and the complexities and independencies required to be successful. 
With that we are raising concerns this ban as proposed will have serious unintended consequences, both 
economically as well as environmentally higher costs both to electric and gas customers, affecting the 
local economy. Having increased demand on electric generation grid that is not keeping up with the Clean 
Energy capabilities, and even on the coldest winter today, we are forced to use more oil and coal to meet 
our demands. Natural gas is the most affordable, reliable and flexible option for our customers' heating, 
hot water, cooking and other needs. It has played an important role in achieving the progress we made this 
far to reduce carbon emissions. And current efforts are underway to optimize utilization of things like 
renewable natural gas, and pursuing pilots to reduce use during the demand days on peak cold days. We 
commend the city's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and the fact that this has increased the dialogue 
necessary to address climate change. I am respectfully requesting and urging the city to consider more 
engagement and collaboration, a perspective on collaboration exists for Eversource where in the last 
several years we've engaged the mothers out front. The result of those collaborations have moved us to 
new regulations in Massachusetts to affect higher middle leaks and accelerate to repair them. And 
recently, assessing developing and now proposing formally a pilot. For district geothermal heating in and

cooling in the state of Massachusetts. Natural Gas still has an important role to play as a... as part of the 
balanced approach to these efforts, especially as new technologies continue to make it cleaner and more 
efficient. This proposed zoning ordinance will not only help us achieve... will not help us to achieve our 
goals. We request you to consider a more balanced approach. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Okay, thank you very much. So next up is Kathy LaFlash followed by... Kathy LaFlash followed by John 
Buonopane, followed by Daniel Wong. And when you've got 15 seconds left, I'm going to waive this 
white piece of paper in front of me. So you know you have 15 seconds left and then you can stop at three 
minutes. 
 
 
Thank you. My name is Kathy LaFlash. I'm the president of the New England Gas Workers Alliance. We 
represent hundreds of utility workers from Boston to the Berkshires. We are an opposition of the 
proposed amendment regarding the prohibition... prohibition of natural gas infrastructure in new buildings 
being considered before the council. The Alliance is an umbrella organization of local unions. Our 
primary mission of this organization is to improve safety and working conditions for the members of our 
local unions, to improve reliability and efficiency in gas... in gas operations and to protect the public, first 
responders and our environment. We applaud the city for their action on the pressing issue of climate 
change and agree it's an existential threat to our cities and towns. Our members are committed to working 
with elected officials and advocacy organizations to reduce the environmental impact of natural gas. 
There are many opportunities to improve the safety and efficiency of natural gas infrastructure in 
Massachusetts. However, the amendments before the council will disproportionately impact some 
residents, while accomplishing a little of an impact to climate change or improve the conditions of our 
natural gas infrastructure. Natural gas is a clean burning fuel. It is safe, reliable and efficient, if properly 
maintained and staffed. Mass already has the cleanest and lowest carbon producing power generation 
systems in the nation. Primarily because of natural gas. Natural gas is twice as clean as coal and produces 
almost half of the carbon dioxide it does as when it's burned. Using it to generate electricity can 
dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to power plants fueled by oil coal because 
natural gas requires a minimum processing and can be efficiently delivered by pipelines, its production 
and delivery consumes less energy than many other fuel sources. It's a mistake to lump natural gas in with 
oil. While natural gas is not as clean as solar or wind. It is the cleanest fossil fuel energy source available. 
New technologies such as carbon capture is available to make natural gas even cleaner. The decision to 
ban natural gas connections in Massachusetts also makes little sense because of the power it is replaced in 
schools, hospitals, restaurants, homes and businesses by electricity, which is the Commonwealth is 
generated for the most part by fossil fuels that at higher cost to the community. The decision will further 
exacerbate Cambridge's affordable housing problems. By increasing construction costs for new 
construction, it would chill affordable development. The result of this will impact Cambridge's poorest 
residents at the most. Mandating a switch to electricity for heat, hot water and appliances will be very 
expensive for homeowners, business and renters. Massachusetts has already had the highest energy prices 
in the nation. For example, the American Gas Association pointed to federal protections, allowing an 
average northeasterner's home heating electricity this winter would cost $1391 as compared to $712.  
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Your time is up. The next up is John Buonopane. Followed by Daniel Wong, 
followed by... there's a Ginger Ryan that signed up but did not say whether she wanted to speak or not. 
Yes or no? No. Okay, followed by Audrey Schulman. And I'll do this high tech wave the white paper 
thing when you've got fifteen seconds left.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you members of the committee. My name is John Buonopane. I 
represent a number of people who work at different gas utilities throughout the state. I'm also a 
representative... representative of the New England Gas Workers Alliance, so I'm going to kind of maybe 
repeat a few things that Kathy just said. But I have to say when it comes to the effects of climate change, 
we understand that people want to do something now.  Want to do something drastic. We care about the 
environment. Our members care about the environment. Them and they're in their families live on this 
planet, just like everyone else. So we do care about the air people breathe in the environment that we live 
in. But we think a long term balanced energy approach is the right answer. It's what we would call a just 
answer, an effective answer. Banning an energy source, like natural gas is not the right answer. Treating 
natural gas use the same way as home heating oil, or coal is warm. And you probably know the natural 
gas is a much cleaner energy source than home heating oil and coal. I don't say this sarcastically. But I'm 
not sure where this city is on home heating oil. I know throughout the Northeast, I believe home heating 
oil accounts for over 40% of home heating energy. So I think it's wrong to compare the two and I think 
it's wrong to single out natural gas. I think the focus should be on exploring different types of technology, 
different ways to address climate change, the focus should be on the areas where we can all work 
together. I think it will be much more productive. And in the end, I think we'll all get to the right place. 
We don't have to do something where you could potentially put a lot of people out of work. And that's a 
real possible impact. When when you're talking about ordinances like this. You don't have to do 
something that may substantially increase how people heat their homes or heat the hot water. This isn't 
California. People use a lot more energy in the winter time. We all know that, we understand that. I know 
I've seen numbers where... that the cost is double when you're comparing Gas and Electric. So I really 
hope you rethink this and take a look at maybe going another way and taking a different approach. Thank 
you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Daniel Wong, followed by Audrey Schulman, followed by Melissa 
Ludtkey. And you have three minutes. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you Mr. Chairman and Council members. Daniel Wong longtime resident of Cambridge currently 
living in Inman square. I'm so proud of this city. We lead on so many issues, particularly in the climate 
space. In 2009, the city council declared a climate emergency and this is another opportunity for us to 
follow on that action. It is a climate emergency. We do need to take drastic measures. Not only for 
ourselves, protect our own health for people with asthma, people could be developing asthma to prevent 
flare ups that have been happening in Andover, or it happened in North Andover, Lawrence and 
Brookline, but also for the future. As one of the youngest people who have spoken today. I'm extremely 
concerned about how, myself, my friends and their kids and my friends who are even considering not 
having kids, because they're so concerned about the climate. I urge the council to work together with 
other advocacy groups like 350, mothers out front in Cambridge to make this as aggressive as possible, 
because it is that urgent and that serious. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Audrey Schulman, followed by Melissa Ludtkey, followed by Patrick 
Barrett. 
 
 
Hey, I'm Audrey Schulman. I'm the co-executive director of HEAT. It's local nonprofit in Cambridge, we 
work to reduce emissions by driving systems change. I've worked in Cambridge doing, you know, for 
HEAT, for 12 years now, and lived here for 30 years. I've personally worked on 10% of the nonprofits in 
Cambridge to reduce their emissions and trained over 3000 volunteers, most of them in Cambridge. We 
are a learning organization and we love to be wonky. And we've become experts on energy efficiency,

solar, gas leaks, and now geothermal. I would say that this, you know, I do all this work for my kids. And 
I agree with the previous speaker that this work is urgent because of the urgency though and because of 
the national attention that these first few towns that pass a gas... a ban on the East Coast are going to have, 
we have to do this right. We have to ensure success and happiness for all in this move to electrification of 
buildings. Brookline had over 30 public meetings, I strongly suggest that the city does also and that they 
convene stakeholders to be able to, you know, address all the concerns, to make sure that we do this in a 
way that everybody is happy with. And heat would be happy to convene that, if that is, you know, I know 
the Cambridge energy alliances is here. But if there's any desire, HEAT would be happy to convene those 
stakeholders to have these discussions. We want to make sure that we do this right. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Melissa Ladtke. Followed by Patrick Barrett, followed by Jason alves. 
 
 
Hi, I'm Melissa Ladtke. I'm a member of Mothers Out Front. And I wanted to just thank Audrey for her 
comments site. I think that sense of convening us as a community, as, as many communities in this city, 
to, as they say, do this right, is essential. And I welcome that as both a citizen of this city and also a 
member of mothers out front. I'm also a writer. And as such, I didn't write anything before I arrived. So 
I've just made a few notes and I want to speak to those observations. The word existential, as a writer, I 
don't believe should ever be followed by the phrase, "but here's the reason it shouldn't happen." 
Existential is really a serious word and we ought to take it seriously. We can't just be throwing it around 
because it's the new word on the block for climate change. And say, Yes, we feel it's existential but here 
all The reasons why we shouldn't act on it. Existential literally means it threatens our existence, as a 
species, not our planet's existence, our planet will do fine once our species gets out of the way and stops 
doing the things we are doing to hurt it. I live in an all electric house. I live with an energy saver heat 
pump. The reason that I can afford to do that, because I also live on social security and a tiny pension 
from years of working, is that I also live with energy efficiency. I've taken out my dryer, I hang up my 
clothes. I've taken out my dishwasher. I wash them by hand. I know there's controversy about that. I turn 
off lights, I pull out plugs. I'm able to make it work because I care. I care about what's going to happen for 
my child. A few other observations, natural gas, let's stop using that word. Let's start talking about it as 
fracked gas because that's what it is today. Go look at any of the lines where they have crossed. This is 
not my grandmother's gas. This is fracked gas. This is something that is impacting the people enormously 
where it is being fracked out of the ground. And it doesn't stop along the way. Bob Ackley knows and... 
knows about the leaks. He's been working with us to fix the gas leaks. People know about what happens 
at this compressor station and why people are being arrested this morning in protest of what's going to 
happen to children around it. So I just want to leave you with the thought that yes, let's convene 
conversations let's do this right. But also let us not give in to the pressure that we are going to feel now 
that people understand. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much, your time is up.  Next is Patrick Barrett, followed by Jason Alves, followed by 
Nancy Donahue. 
 
 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My name is Patrick Barrett, 41 pleasant Street.  I'm not gonna say much more than 
what other people have said on this ordinance. Although having read it a few times now, there's some 
things that I have questions for this board in terms of implementation. You may not know but Eversource 
Electric and Eversource Gas are two different entities. Eversource gas is actually a delight to work with. 
They are on time, they are efficient, they are problem solving oriented. Eversource Electric is a different 
animal. Typically, they'll pull nothing more than 800 amps system through the through a network power 
before you have to start using things like switch gear and pad transformers. These add exorbitant cost to

buildings but in areas that are already developed, like all of Cambridge, it becomes problematic when you 
have to start increasing the load on a building to accommodate switch gear to accommodate pad 
transformers where the dimensional requirements are no 20 by 30, 50 foot clearances. And that's not to 
say that a ban on gas is an absolute "no". But the way that has been phrased in a way has been drawn up, 
it's extremely problematic in the current world. Building in Cambridge is problematic enough, but 
oftentimes you have to balance utility usage in a building to make sure that you have enough load in the 
building to accommodate the things that are going inside it. Most of these buildings were predate building 
code regs now so they're all underpowered or underserved as the code would suggest. So updating them 
becomes extremely expensive. Oftentimes, in a larger building, you have a need for emergency power. If 
the emergency power is not coming from electric as you know power is coming from either gas or diesel. 
I don't see the word diesel in this ordinance least not that I've seen it. But if you're suggesting that I should 
forego a clean pipe to a small generator on the rooftop of my building to a ground floor, multi tank diesel 
system that is an order of magnitude more expensive, unsightly and if you want diesel engines on the 
ground floor, I can't imagine that something... an outcome people interpreted or wanted to happen. You 
know, Brookline is already past this and is running to issues. Berkeley, and I think this is where the 
language all comes from. They're just two different animals. I think this is something so... previous 
speakers have said that we can talk about... get to a point that makes sense, but the devil is in the details 
and a lot of the details are missing. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Jason Alves. Follorwed by Nancy Donahue followed possibly by Tom 
Lucey and then by Sarah Gallop. 
 
 
Hi, Jason Alves.  I am the executive director of these Cambridge Business Association, 877 Cambridge 
Street. I think that it's safe to say that I have not encountered a small business owner that doesn't 
acknowledge the climate crisis that's before us. But I think that they do have some questions about how 
this proposal would effectively take place. You know, other cities and towns have already outlined some 
exemptions, I think for Cambridge and what we have here, it's unclear how exemptions or what what 
body is going to give the exemptions. I think that restaurants, off the top of my head, are probably a group 
of small businesses that would be negatively impacted by this. I often think about, you know, currently on 
Cambridge Street, we have a hole in the ground where the sunset cafe used to be and this is something 
that they, as this building is rebuilt, that they would be subject to this. So how would a person building a 
space with first floor commercial, get an exemption when they... for a restaurant when they probably don't 
have any lease signed in there. So that's just something that's a... how does something like that get get 
rectified? I'm also on the climate zoning Task Force. And there are two things that we talk about a lot on 
our task force. One is, how do we get things... How do we get business back to normal after some kind of 
an event? I would think that having gas infrastructure has a role to play and getting things back to 
business as usual, when some kind of an event like that, how do we keep warming stations open, cooling 
stations. You know, those are the things that we're talking about in that and how does that conflict with 
removing an entire energy source from the city and in new constructions that we're hoping are going to 
kind of fill those roles, so something that you should keep in mind there. Also more and more we're 
talking about moving things out of basements, and again, if we're thinking about buildings that have first 
floor commercial space, already, there are requirements that the city puts on what can go in a basement, 
what needs to be on the first floor parking by parking, for instance. So bike parking is already impacting 
first floor retail space. If we don't know what these electrical systems are going to look like to run entire 
buildings, presumably, they're not going to allow them in the basement because we don't want them in the 
basement, they're going to end up on the first floor. So what does that do to our first floor retail spaces 
that we also want to have and support. And then finally, in the... one of these sections here, I know we 
keep saying this is going to impact new construction. But if you look at 15.10.040, Section D, it's the only 
space that doesn't mention anything about new construction. So it seems that it would prevent an existing

building from taking advantage of incentives to convert from an oil heat to a gas furnace. And I think that 
there's probably a cost associated with making someone go electric over a gas conversion. So just a 
couple things to keep in mind as this gets worked out. Thanks. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. The next up is Nancy Donahue followed possibly by Tom Lucey, followed by 
Sarah Gallop and then what looks like a Steve Lee's or Less from NGA. 
 
 
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee my name is Nancy Donahue and I'm the director of 
government affairs for the Chamber of Commerce here in Cambridge. We would like to go on record in 
opposition to the petition before you, prohibiting natural gas infrastructure in new buildings. Cambridge 
is known as a leader in innovation. The work being done in our buildings is transformative to society. If 
this proposal were to pass would be very detrimental to the life science and laboratory research 
community. Also we all promote small business, the chamber, the city, we encourage people to shop 
local, shop at our local restaurants, eat at a local restaurants if passed this would be very detrimental to 
small business. The chamber supportive of the city's efforts to combat the footprint of carbon emissions. 
However, the amendment and petition before you is not the solution. So if we could all work together to 
find a solution. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Tom Lucey, followed by Sarah Gallop followed by what looks like 
Steve Lee's from NGA. 
 
 
Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Tom Lucy, Harvard University. We submitted some testimony that's in 
everyone's package. So I'm just going to encourage everyone to take a look at that. And give you a couple 
of minutes of your lives back. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Sarah Gallop followed by Steve Lee's from, I think NGA, followed by 
what looks like Jim Brown from Avon Hill Street. 
 
 
I'm Sarah gallop from MIT. I'm co director of government and community relations and I thought I had 
three more minutes to write Tom so... I... We had a brief opportunity to look at the proposed ordinance 
but we haven't really had the time to prepare a technical response to the suggested ban. But as is our 
custom and practice with the city, we would be very pleased to roll up our sleeves, engage some of our 
faculty experts on these matters and take a close look at their proposal with you. In that way we can all 
fully understand its objectives and implications. And indeed, that's really the best way that I think that we 
can all work together and the city... I think one of the most terrific things about the city is that is typically 
how you work. You know, sometimes people joke about the process in the city, but you really do vet 
topics and issues. And I just want to encourage you to do the same thing here. This is a critical topic for 
all of us. I think there's no lack of passion or commitment to our shared goals around... related to climate 
change. I think everyone in this room feels the same way. I think people want Cambridge to be a leader. 
MIT wants to be a leader, Harvard does, people in the city do. But I hope that we can tackle this together 
as we do so many other things. What I was actually working on when Tom took my three minutes away 
was a list of all the things that we're working on. I'm not going to read it to you. But it is just incredibly 
impressive how we come together and take on these issues. And I hope we'll do the same thing on this 
topic as well. Thank you very much.

Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Steve Lee, followed by Jim Brown, followed by John Pitkin. 
 
 
Good afternoon, thank you. My name is Steve Leahy I apologize for my handwriting and do better next 
time. I live in Belmont. But I'm with a group called Northeast Gas Association we are a nonprofit trade 
association in Needham. We represent natural gas distribution companies, interstate pipeline companies, 
LNG importers. I'm here today to echo some of the previous comments and express some current 
concerns about this ordinance, but I welcome the outreach for stakeholder collaboration, we welcome the 
opportunity to be part of that going forward. I'm going to provide some quick background on natural gas. 
Natural Gas distribution companies in the Commonwealth distribute gas to about 1.6 million customers 
every day. Natural Gas demand and the Commonwealth has continued to rise, with more than 200,000 
new residential customers added in the last 15 years. Today, more than half of all mass homeowners use 
natural gas consumers in Massachusetts have continued to choose natural gas. I recognize the intent in 
this ordinance to accelerate the electrification of the economy in light of climate change. The transition to 
clean energy is underway. However, I would respectfully request the city consider some drawbacks to this 
immediate proposed switch as presented the ordinance. Gas is the most affordable home energy heating... 
heating source in the US and in Massachusetts. [sic] ER statistics USEIA statistics both clearly 
demonstrate that natural gas is the least expensive energy option lower than propane, lower than heating 
oil, lower than electricity. For residents of Cambridge on a fixed income or low income natural gas is a 
truly beneficial heating option. For businesses managing budgets gas is a helpful prime energy source 
Cambridge residents deserve to be able to continue to choose this highly affordable energy option. You 
also know that when it comes to promoting energy efficiency, Massachusetts is a leader in electric 
efficiency but also natural gas efficiency, our state accounts for less than 2% of all the gas customers in 
the US. But we invest 18% of all natural gas efficiency dollars. I mean, it's incredible. Punching above its 
weight but Massachusetts does, and that means it's managing demand, we require less infrastructure, 
using the infrastructure we have most efficiently. Well, customer growth in the gas system has been 
occurring. methane emissions attributed to gas systems in the Commonwealth have continued to go 
down... down by 67% over the last 25 years according to Mass DEP. This is real progress. Furthermore, 
Massachusetts, according to state officials, is on track to meet its legal requirement for carbon reductions 
by 2020 is mandated by the Global Warming Solutions act. Natural Gas by offsetting other fuels in power 
generation, home heating over the last decade and more has been a key part of this progress. I recognize 
your city's public policy may lead you to want to incentivize citizens to a certain energy path. We think 
it's better for everyone. However, if Congress focuses on incentivizing and resources rather than 
restricting and we look forward to collaborating with you in the future on this, thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is John Pitkin followed by... sorry, and that... Next up is Jim Brown, 
followed by John Pitkin and followed by Steve Nutter. I'm going to blame that one on the previous 
speakers handwriting. 
 
 
Hello, I'm Jim Brown, 20 year resident of Cambridge. I work for the Department Environmental 
Protection in the wetlands Conservancy program for 24 years, and my job was to preserve the resources 
and the safe living in the Commonwealth. It is baffling to me that Cambridge would not adopt a policy of 
no new gas hookups or gas hookups for new buildings. It is not an easy policy to adopt. I would invite all 
of you to watch the webinar on its adoption in Brookline. There has to be some concessions on both sides. 
There's a lot of legal wrangling. But they achieved a "walls in" success that leads to no new hookups. 
Takes a little compromise. And, but there is success and achievement and I also want to say there are 
some dramatic examples of implementation and retrofits. There... and now we have an ongoing 
movement of banning natural gas in new buildings in a dozen US cities.  Berkeley, as we have heard was

the first, Seattle is contemplating this move. And here on the east coast dozens of other cities are 
considering this move, including Newton... Newton, and Cambridge. Cambridge has been a beacon in the 
pursuit of sustainability. And some examples are single use plastic, increasing tree canopy and managing 
compost. So the real question is whether this city is going to be a part of the drive towards renewables and 
sustainability as well as quite simply a beacon to stand up against the evils of the fossil fuel industry. 
There's been a lot made of how clean natural gas is. But again, natural gas is not natural. It's fracked gas, 
and it causes earthquakes and it pollutes the subsurface and makes people's lives difficult in the areas 
from which it is obtained. You may have read in the newspapers in the last couple of days that Greenland 
is now losing ice at a rate seven times that of what it was in the 1990s. James Anderson at Harvard, has 
said that once the glacier for Greenland disappears, there will be a 20 feet rise in sea level, which will in 
fact....  
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Your time is up. Next speaking is John Pitkin followed by Steve Nutter, followed 
by Joseph McGuire. 
 
 
John Pitkin about a 50 year resident of Cambridge and I'm on the board of green Cambridge. I have to 
agree with Audrey Schulman and others who have said that it's important to do this right. I want to speak 
to the necessity of doing it. And I have... will end with a question for the city solicitor. We had it was 
more than 10 years ago now that Cambridge recognize that there is a climate emergency. Now 11,000 
scientists around the world upside a statement agreeing there is a climate emergency. The Oxford English 
Dictionary has recognized climate emergency as the word of the year. My question is, at what point does 
the city have emergency powers... the powers that change its ability to make regulations. And I want to 
add a little bit of one detail to what Jim Brown said about the Greenland ice melting. I learned something 
last night that will perhaps give, make it more graphic the nature of the emergency that we're in... that we 
really are an emergency. Greenland is losing ice now at a rate of 250 billion tons of water a year. That is... 
now to help you visualize that imagine a herd of elephants, 2000 elephants, marching into the sea. 
Imagine one of those going into the sea every second for a year. That's how much ice is going off of 
Greenland. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Next up is Steve Nutter followed by Joseph McGuire, followed by Ed Woll. 
 
 
Hi, I'm Stephen Nutter. I am the executive director of Green Cambridge. Our role and our our mission is 
to make a more sustainable Cambridge for everyone. And that includes not just Cambridge but also work 
towards other communities as well. I'm a member of the Climate Protection Action Committee, which 
helps facilitate and the net zero action plan. I just want to say that the existing infrastructure that we have 
in place, there's a lot of sunk investment. There's a lot of jobs. And that's really important. We want to 
see... we also want to see that that collaboration move forward. And I really appreciate the sentiments 
expressed about that. But we have to stop its growth. We live in a broken system. I have natural gas in my 
home as do many of you. But... But I didn't choose it. And if I was building a new building today, I 
definitely wouldn't choose it. I think it's our job to show leadership towards fixing... towards fixing it. 
This is really personal for me actually. They say natural black gas is cleaner. That... That may be true, but 
it's not a clean process. I'm not from here. I grew up in West Virginia. My... both of my grandfather's 
were coal miners. 100 years ago, my great grandfather worked for the gas company. I've seen firsthand 
what extractive industries do to communities and livelihoods. My home state is now largely under the 
control of these extractive corporations. Whole mountain tops have been blown off. Fracked gas has 
destroyed the groundwater, poisoning the people and the land and forcing them off the property. The 
growth of natural gas, fracked gas, has directly destroyed sensitive habitat... habitats for both animals and

people in woods that I used to play in. This existential crisis has already come to West Virginia. And 
many other states and communities. Imagine if some activity like fracking destroyed Cambridge's water. 
If you couldn't drink the water coming out of your tap, we've had over a century of cheap energy fueling 
the rise of carbon in the atmosphere. After a drop in emissions this year, it's now back on the rise. And 
even with the incredible efforts of advocates, companies and staff here in Cambridge, and all over the... 
all over the world, we still see this rise. We have to see... we have to change faster than may be 
comfortable, and it needs to start now. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Joe McGuire, followed by a wall followed by Matthew Shreiner. 
 
 
Good afternoon. I'm Joe McGuire from Alexander real estate equities, offices officers at 400 technology 
square. I just want to state that Alexandria continue is to be a strong supporter of the city... city 
sustainability and net zero and climate change programs. We've been very active in support of many of 
these Task Force, including the Net Zer, which I spent time with Councillor Zondervan on. We take it 
seriously. We want to state that we want to have an impact. We believe that over the coming years, that, 
that, that we need to be net zero. There's been a lot of work that isn't that is... that has occurred with the 
net zero Task Force. In terms in terms of moving to net net net zero for new construction. We've got some 
deadlines that are kind of coming up in 2025 and 2030 for new construction, being being net zero. And 
we're making efforts to be net zero ready for... with our effort, efforts in construction today. The city's 
electric grid is going to need Time to respond to... to the demands that will be placed on it. It clearly... 
with energy intensive... intensive businesses, such as laboratories, we need energy. And if it's switching 
from one source to the other, that's not as efficient and electricity is not as efficient and maybe cleaner if 
it's sourced properly, but we will see a new norm that is going to it's going to be necessary. We'd 
recommend that the city convened a task force of local stakeholders to study the full electrification of 
buildings in potential prohibition of new natural gas service and to incorporate this group's findings and 
recommendations into an ongoing net zero planning related policy for the city. This step will be 
consistent to how, for example, the city of San Francisco is approaching this top topic. Alexandria will be 
pleased attempt to help connect the dots and with other progressive US cities that were located in as well. 
We operate and are looking to be great building owners and in a great community and want to be great 
neighbors. So, again, we'd like to... like to have this studied and move forward in that fashion. And again, 
there are commitments that are out there that are leading us to net zero, whether it be residential, 
commercial, or laboratories over the upcoming 10 years. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Ed Woll, followed by Matthew Schreiner. 
 
 
Thank you. My name is Ed Woll at 79 Dana Street. Thank you for the opportunity to speak today. I'd like 
to focus first on the notion of preemption. I don't know of a bill in Massachusetts that requires a building 
to have gas, or requires me to cook with gas or heat my hot water with gas, or heat my house or cool my 
house with gas. So I think that's the focus that one ought to take on preemption. So when you ban gas, 
you aren't overturning any law in Massachusetts. So take a look at it that way. Also, I think it's time that 
the building industry needs to learn how to build without gas. That's what our focus ought to be. They 
should know how to do it. They're behind the times if they don't do it. There are a lot of contractors out 
there who know how to build heat pump systems and put in induction stoves and to put in heat pump hot 
water heaters. That's a good industry to promote. Third, there are other ways to ban gas to. There are 
many pending bills before the legislature right now, whose goal or result of which would be getting rid of 
gas and getting off gas. There's the future bill. There's 100% renewable energy both of which has been 
endorsed by this city council. There's also the tax exemptions for heat pumps and storage that are pending

before the legislature, both of which have the objective of making it easier for people to get off gas. 
There's also the road map bill, the carbon fee and increasing wind power. All of those have a goal of 
getting off gas. Now also 91 cities and towns in this state don't have gas. So in effect, they already ban 
gas. So we can follow them to we don't have to gas... have gas here. Now from a personal standpoint, we 
don't cook with gas anymore. We don't heat our hot water with gas there to six unit condos across the 
street that have entire heat pump systems. Doesn't that tell you something, doesn't that tell you that people 
are moving off gas. So let's help them move a little bit faster. And also, we should consider the gas ban 
carefully. We need more hearings on it. There are lots of people affected by it. But in the meantime, we 
can go ahead and support the bills before the legislature that moves us toward the goal of getting off gas. 
That's our immediate focus, no matter what we go ahead and pass here as a gas ban. It will probably be 
appealed. And why do we wait and not support those other bills in the meantime? Another factor is I walk 
home from the subway around Cambridge, I think about what I'm walking over. And as I do, I think about 
Merrimack Valley. I want to stop thinking about that. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. Next up is Matthew Schreiner. And that will conclude our signup sheet so if there 
are other people, you can speak after Matthew. 
 
 
Thank you. So for the opportunity to speak, my name is Matthew Schreiner. I live on 26 Crozier Road. 
people here know the scale of the crisis. We've already committed to substantial warming from fossil 
fuels we've already burned. We keep hearing that new estimates are constantly worse than the previous 
ones. There are plenty of suggestions that we slow down our conversion to handle various problems. 
What I'd like to see is one time that we do more than we had to, I fear we will never hear... that will never 
happen, as a slogan says, keep fossil fuels in the ground. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. That concludes our signed up speakers. If you have not spoken yet and would like 
to speak you can just form a line behind the podium and come introduce yourself and you will have three 
minutes per speaker if you haven't already spoken. 
 
 
Good afternoon. I did actually sign up signup sheet so there may be one missing, a signup sheet missing. 
My name is Karen Luther and I'm the executive director of the Northeast hearth Patio and BBQ 
Association. We represent hearth retailers, and the related industries including chimney sweeps, installers, 
maintenance companies and entities having interest in commercial hearths. I'd like to record our 
opposition to the proposition that the prohibition of banning natural gas infrastructure in Cambridge, we, 
however, are completely aligned with climate action and slowing negative climate change. By moving to 
banning fossil fuels, larger strain is put on our electric grid. In Massachusetts over 50% of homes heat 
with natural gas, 27% heat with oil. Dependence on electric utilities and increased reliance on these 
utilities is a weakness. Electric delivery systems are still above ground and sometimes fail. This is when 
people like wood, our gas. During last year's gas moratorium and the National Grid lockout development 
across the state came to a halt. In the Cambridge area there are over 94 specialty hearth retailers. In 
addition, there are also those who service wood gas pellet stoves in their chimneys such as plumbers, 
electricians, sweeps and installers. All of these businesses would be affected jobs will be lost with this 
ordinance. In 2017, businesses with fewer than 100 employees had the largest share of small business 
employment. Businesses employing fewer than 20 employees experienced the largest gain, adding over 
20,000 net jobs. Banning new fossil fuel infrastructure in buildings does not achieve the stated goal of 
protection from fuel leaks, explosions or air pollution. It is important for buildings to be healthier, safer 
and more efficient. However, passing this measure will do nothing to upgrade existing infrastructure or 
protect residents from potential leaks. It will exacerbate an economy that is just starting to rebound and

eliminate small businesses that call Cambridge home. For these reasons, Northeast Hearth patio and BBQ 
Association urges you to oppose this idea. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you. And it turns out you hadn't fact signed up a long, long time ago and overlook you I apologize. 
And the next after you is Joseph [sic]. 
 
 
Yes, I was the next one up. Thank you. Thank you for the opportunity today. Good afternoon. My name is 
Joel Etter. I am the senior wholesale account manager for hearth and home technologies. We are a 
manufacturer of fireplaces and stoves. I'm also the president of the Northeast Hearth Patio barbecue 
Association. We represent hundreds of hearth dealers in Massachusetts as well as over 1200 art dealers in 
the northeast. We're also in agreement that we need a solution to climate change. We just don't agree with 
this solution of banning natural gas and other fossil fuels. The hearth industry is one of if not only locally 
owned and operated industries left in the United States and certainly in Massachusetts. Over 200 local 
businesses provide local jobs, keep more money in the local economy. Not to mention they give 
charitable to towns they support. This industry is the last small business in Mass. It needs to be treasured, 
protected and secured. Because it's made up of all small businesses, there is no unified voice. We're here 
to speak for these local businesses. Our industry has gone through extensive regulations to reduce 
emissions. In 2015, the EPA NSPS code mandated that all wood pellet appliances had to be at 4.5 grams 
of particles per hour or less. The new code starting in May 2020 will reduce that to 2.0 grams. 
Unfortunately, this will only affect change if a consumer purchases a new appliance. The real issue is in 
existing appliances that are presently in the home. The consumer falls in love with their old wood stoves 
and needs an incentive to remove it. By offering a change out rebate incentivize the consumer to remove 
the very old inefficient appliances that can give off 60 to 70 grams per hour. This is shown to massively 
reduced emissions. Whole town change are conducted in 2007, in Libby Montana, replaced 1100 old 
polluting stoves with wood pellet, gas and electric heating appliances. The following year, the average 
wintertime particles levels dropped outside by 28% and inside by 72%. This research was done by the 
University of Montana. The electric plants industry will tell you that they don't have appliances that will 
work with power surges or on low wattage electric companies will tell you that the current grid will not 
support the influx of this power surge. California is a great example with the blackouts. Finally, please 
consider the ramifications to Mass small businesses that will be put out of business by moving solely to 
electric, wind and solar and ignoring the importance of wood, gas and pellets as renewable fuels. Thank 
you for the time.  
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you very much. I'm pretty sure that is the last of the signed up speakers but if you have not spoken 
yet, and want to speak, approach the microphone.  Seeing none. I'll entertain a motion to close public 
comment. So moved. All right. Councillor Zondervan suggested that we asked Ms. Peterson, the deputy 
city manager to talk a little... Hopefully this isn't a surprise... to talk a little bit about the city's recent 
school construction projects and how they approach this issue. 
 
Lisa Peteron, Deputy City Manager   
Yes, through you Mr. Chair. I'm [sic] so as... as. .. I'm sorry, I came in late to the hearing, that I'm sure as 
you've been talking about when the net zero action plan was adopted, the early... the first entities are... 
that are responsible for sort of compliance is new construction for municipal facilities. So we really were 
planning since when the net zero plan was adopted to really look at compliance for new buildings. It 
started with looking at the Martin Luther King school to see what would it take for it to be a net zero 
facility. So we installed geothermal there. We also needed to install a gas boiler and that facility as well 
based on the size of the site. When we got to 859 Mass Ave, which is really a family shelter, so more of a 
residential. We were able to go to a totally renewable site... source. And we were not able to install

geothermal. We had some issues with that but we installed the VRF systems, variable refrigerant flow 
systems and then when we were able to go to the King Open school, which just opened and we're very 
proud of that, we were able to go to 100% geothermal for that facility as a 273,000 square foot facility. 
It's entirely heated in cold by geothermal. It does have emergency backup in there that we have a small 
diesel tank, bio diesel that we're using, but really it's the hookup so if we lost for some reason, the, the, the 
geothermal you wouldn't want to lose all your plumbing or anything inside. So there's a hookup that we 
could bring in... diesel fuel if we needed to, from a truck and to be able to heat the building. We would be 
looking at that same as we're looking towards the Tobin school and we're looking at the Tobin Montessori 
Vassal Lane Upper School that we're just in the feasibility study for... we are looking at it being a total net 
zero emissions building as well. There will be some... which we're looking at geothermal. If we don't have 
enough space for geothermal, we may need to do the VRF system as well or there may be a combination. 
And we will be looking at the... the backup power options of what we do by needing, in an extreme 
circumstance, of needing to bring in diesel fuel. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thank you Miss Peterson. Questions for Miss Peterson. Okay, so, any comments, Councillor Zondervan? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to assistant... city manager Lisa Peterson for that. And Marty 
Walsh today in Boston announced that all municipal new construction will be net zero carbon as well. So, 
again, we see that leadership matters that the City of Cambridge going first and its municipal construction 
is leading to change elsewhere in in other communities. And it is time that we do the same for private 
construction. I've been experimenting at my house, which is not new construction. It's built in the 1980s. 
So relatively new, but not super new. And I want to highlight the importance of reducing the amount of 
energy that's consumed. A lot of people have spoken. And by the way, I really appreciate the public 
comment all of it to the challenges of bringing in more power and I completely agree. And that's a huge 
problem. And we, we can't afford to do that. So I've been able to reduce overall energy consumption at 
my house by 30 percent and reducing gas consumption by 65%. So in other words, I reduce the gas 
consumption and I did not increase the overall energy consumption. And because I was able to put in 
solar, I'm running 60% of the house on solar energy, which means that I'm also not increasing the amount 
of electricity that needs to come to my house on the grid, I have reduced it. So we really need to think 
different. And that means thinking about how we reduce the overall energy that we consume. And as you 
just heard, from the deputy city manager, we're able to do the same thing in our schools and in a 
residential family shelter that we built here in Cambridge. So we have the technology to reduce our 
energy consumption, reduce our gas consumption and begin to electrify so that we can depend on 
renewable electricity. I also want to highlight the issue of jobs and, and justice, this absolutely has to be a 
just transition. And it cannot come at the expense of people's livelihoods. In terms of gas consumption, 
this ordinance is banning gas in new construction. We still have tremendous legacy infrastructure that 
needs to be maintained an upgraded over the next several decades. So there should be lots of jobs in the in 
those areas, because we need to be fixing all those gas leaks and replacing all those leaky pipes under, 
under our streets. We also will be creating new areas of job opportunities including geothermal as you just 
heard. That is a very important technology that we can use to heat and cool our buildings that require 
similar kinds of expertise that our gas workers currently have. And then last but not least, there is an 
opportunity for what's called bio gas, which is methane, the same chemical as natural gas or fracked gas. 
But it is obtained from the decomposition of organic matter. I just saw a report that the state of California, 
the majority of its methane emissions are from landfills. So those landfills are just sitting there leaking 
methane from organic material that was buried in them. We could be capturing that methane and burning 
it using our existing infrastructure, which is the best thing to do because methane is a much worse 
greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. So when we burn that methane, which turning into carbon dioxide, 
which is has a lesser impact on the climate. So there are plenty of opportunities in terms of jobs around 
gas, and truly natural gas, which is bio gas as opposed to the fracked gas that we're using right now. So I

think this is a an opportunity, again for Cambridge to take leadership. I appreciate the comments about 
making sure we get this right. And I completely agree, and we have the time and space and the expertise 
to do that. But we cannot take off the pressure. We cannot say this is an existential crisis, but we can't do 
that. So I think we have to move this ordinance forward today to the full Council. We won't have time to 
process it until the next term begins. And we will have many more conversations about it before it's 
actually adopted, and I look forward to to the process. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
 Thank you Councillor Zondervan. Other comments Councillor Mallon. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon   
Thank you, Mr. Chair through you. I want to thank all the speakers that came to speak, some very 
passionately about their personal experiences and how this climate crisis is affecting them especially. So 
thank you to everyone that came and spoke today. I do want to answer some of the questions that were 
raised today. In terms of the Brookline proposal, someone brought up the affordable housing and how that 
would affect affordable housing going forward. And Brookline provides a waiver and appeal process 
specifically for affordable housing projects and for affordable housing in particular, knowing that their 
capital funds may be limited to make investing in systems with lower operating costs in the long run 
infeasible. And to speak to some of the other exemptions that Brookline worked through. These are some 
that we could consider here in Cambridge, we could consider all of them, we could consider some of them 
based on some conversations that I hope we continue to have in the future. Their exemptions include 
backup generators, that was something that was brought up by an earlier speaker. All cooking and gas 
stoves, labs and medical buildings, any buildings over 10,000 square feet that had a centralized hot water 
system, and portable appliances like grills and barbecues. So those are all exemptions that Brookline got 
to in there bylaw, through the 30, the 30 meetings and the three months that they dedicated to this 
particular process. To speak to the load on the electrical grid, that was a concern that came up with some 
emails and some public speakers today that we have been having a long conversation in this chamber 
about our electrical load and what does that mean if we are shifting to the electrical grid and away from 
gas at the same time when we are wondering how we are going to build another substation in the city. 
And one of the frequently asked questions in Brookline's ordinance or bylaw is that it speaks right to that 
it says that this bylaw will affect too few buildings too slowly to affect the electrical grid. So I think that 
that's something for us to keep in mind. Although that does sound a little sad that it's affecting too few 
buildings and to slowly. But I think in terms of the electrical grid and the move away from natural gas to 
the grid, I think it's something that we need to keep in mind. I think all of the public comment tonight that 
we heard really underscores the need to have more conversations, to get a clearer picture of costs, impacts 
and how to implement this here in Cambridge. And I want to thank Audrey Schulman for offering HEAT 
to convene these meetings. I'm sure that there's a lot of people here in the audience tonight, that would be 
available for those meetings. And so I just wanted to say thank you to her. I would offer a note of caution 
for the future and putting forward language. This isn't the first time where we've put forth language from 
another city that has sort of shocked people. In that, here it is we're done. We're... this is the final 
language. And I think it's, it's a hard thing to do when you think about Cambridge as a city full of people 
who love process and want to have that conversation and want to feel like they are part of a change. So I 
want to caution us in the future for just putting forward language from another city and sort of saying this 
is the thing to work from. I think it's possible for us to have had these conversations prior to today and put 
together a really good ordinance that people could feel good about and we could amend on the floor. I 
don't think that this is ready for prime time. And moving it out of the ordinance committee today. I think 
there's a lot of work to do and I think it's good work to do, I think as an earlier, public comment or said, 
you know, we do need to move more quickly than we're comfortable with. I think that is a fact. But it 
doesn't remove the need to be thoughtful, and work with all of the stakeholders who are going to be 
implemented or affected by this, whatever we decide on. So I look forward to us figuring out a way to

involve those stakeholders and come to some agreement very quickly. But I don't think that this is ready 
for prime time and moving out of the ordinance committee today. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Thanks very much, Madam Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux   
Thank you, and thank you to everyone who came today. I wanted to make sure that people have taken the 
time to read the letter that we received from Jacob Knowles, who Councillor Zondervan, referenced as 
director of sustainable design in Brighton. It rebutts a lot of what we heard about what is feasible and isn't 
feasible. And one thing on the impact on the electrical infrastructure that he says is that it wouldn't result 
in additional demand on the electric grid, due to the fact that conventional buildings typically have high 
peak cooling loads in the summer that require a large electric electrical infrastructure. So he gives several 
examples of large and small but a few quite large buildings that his firm and others have worked on, 
including two buildings that are owned by Harvard, one by BU, Cornell, Boston Arts Academy. Someone 
else said that we have the technology. We certainly do, what we what we are lacking is the will. I am 
listening to public comment and hearing the sort of two diverging... You know, sets of opinions today I 
think I felt as close to despair as I've ever felt sitting in this chamber just because... we, we don't know. 
Our time is up as Councillor Kelly kept saying time's up, time is up. We do not have time to, to 
overprocess this to reinvent the wheel with every single thing that we do so I would move this forward. 
And I would still concurrently hold stakeholder meetings to work on details and implementation to carve 
out some very minimal exemptions, but I think that we all need to learn to live more like Melissa Ludtke 
and less like business as usual. I don't think we have time for a long term plan for this. We don't have the 
long term. And when we talk about unintended consequences, I think it's really ironic because we are 
living in a world of totally unintended consequences had we realized 200 years ago or when, however 
long it was when, when the industrial age invented all of this wonderful power with fossil fuel, that this is 
what we would be facing today. That's that, that we're living the unintended consequence. So I don't see 
how any unintended consequences could be worse what I see as a world that is really, really scary. The 
however many elephants are plunging into the sea in Greenland. So sure, let's have let's have meetings. 
Let's make people more comfortable with the radical changes that we have, but I don't want to kick this 
can down the road. One thing that does comfort me knowing that I won't be on the council for future 
discussions is that the two new counselors I am very confident will support this very strongly. Both Jivan 
Sobrino-Wheeler, and Patty Nolan are very committed environmentalists and I have every faith that they 
will back this up. So I think we do need to move it forward. It doesn't have a deadline does it. So there's 
nothing to prevent us from moving it forward. And from immediately getting to work with MIT. Thank 
you, MIT and Sarah. Thank you, Alexandria. Thank you HEAT. Thank you mothers out front. Thank 
you, people who have offered to step up and try to come up with a reasonable implementation plan. And 
thank you most of all to Councillor Zondervan for putting this before us. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Councillor Carlone. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Knowing buildings the way I do it's clear that in the next phase of this work, we 
will have... in fact, the city approach to this is that different building types are more quickly adaptable to 
implementing such a program, then let's say others that are high energy... labs. But given all that I was 
very impressed by Ed Woll's public comments, and he's right about the building code, which I've studied, 
not in depth on this issue, that it doesn't say yes or no on an energy source. I realized the state law 
complicates that, to some extent. My whole feeling about this other than living with it is it's time for a 
shot across the bow. And this is only the beginning. This isn't going to happen next week. But it's saying 
we're serious about this. And I there's no doubt in my mind that we're behind. And we got to move

forward as quickly as we can. And this will help that. So I'm in full support of moving it to the full 
Council. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui   
Thank you a clarifying question. So the conclusion of the opinion states from the solicitor's office, that 
I'm of the opinion that prior to adopting the proposed ordinance, the city must first submit this... first 
submit and the state legislation must pass special legislation [sic] empowering the city council to prohibit 
natural gas infrastructure. And so wondering what we're moving out of committee. So and at the end is It 
says the city council so desires would be happy to prepare a draft home rule petition for the city's review 
and consideration. So to just... I want to be clear, when... if we move this out, are we moving out... And 
this is to you Councillor Zondervan and to the solicitor are we moving out and saying we would like you 
to draft a Home rule petition. Or... I'm trying to understand the process because it's... so we should be 
clear on that. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Before anyone answers, we have two minutes before the meeting ends. I would entertain a motion to 
extend this meeting until 4:15. So moved all in favor, aye. Okay, this meeting will last until 4:15. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Mr. Chair through you to my colleague. The question of a homebrew competition is is quite a 
vexing one and before I answer that question actually, I would like to speak to the to the issue of process. 
The Berkeley ordinance was passed this summer. And so we only became aware of it at that time. I 
worked to put forward this ordinance with help from some of my colleagues. And we had health 
Environment Committee discussion about it that was quite extensive. And that signaled quite a bit of 
support for this type of approach. We... I put in the language and it has taken until now to have an 
ordinance committee hearing on it. It's also taken up until now to get a legal opinion on it, which we 
didn't receive until an hour before the meeting. So it is by no means a, you know, this is it. This is the 
final product, let's adopt it. But as we've seen from this process, we don't make progress unless we put 
something forward and begin to think it through and ask questions and start to answer them. If... we can 
talk forever. We had a climate emergency declaration in this chamber 10 years ago. We could have 
banned it then. But we didn't. So we're having the conversation now. And I do not in any way apologize 
for the way that I introduced this ordinance. And I will do it again, many times until we take proper action 
on climate change, which is an existential issue. To answer the question on a home rule petition, if indeed 
we asked the solicitor to prepare a Home Rule petition, to allow this ordinance, doing so would 
essentially admit that we do not believe we have the power to regulate gas combustion in buildings in 
Cambridge in this way. I do not agree with that presumption. Second, if we asked for a Home Rule 
petition, we are undermining Brookline and any other community in the Commonwealth that seeks to 
regulate gas combustion in the same way that we do. And third, last but not least, such a Home Rule 
petition will never pass. So it would just be a grand waste of time. And it would only, if it were the pass, 
which it won't, it would only allow Cambridge to do it and then Brookline would need one. And then 
Boston would need one and Newton would need one. That is not a sensible approach. So what I think we 
need to do is move this ordinance forward, pass it into law. If we are legally challenged defend the 
ordinance. And in that action, we will prompt the state legislature to do its job and to regulate gas, which 
it should have done a long time ago and needs to do now. So I would like to make a motion Mr. Chair 
that we move this ordinance to the entire Council. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Okay, there's a motion on the floor that we can discuss. Does anyone want to discuss this motion? Madam 
Vice Mayor.

Vice Mayor Jan Devereux   
I just as soon vote on it. But I think I agree with Councillor Zondervan's legal strategy, if that's the right 
word for it. I mean, I think we have come to a point where cities can assert that we have emergency 
powers. And I agree with some of the analysis that we are... the walls in approach is within the building 
code. And I think it's a fair... fair shot that we can defend that. So given that it is an emergency, and it 
would undermine other cities and slow the whole thing down if every one of the 341 cities and towns in 
the Commonwealth had to go through this process, and if it would move the state legislation that is 
pending forward, get that more urgency than I think it's something that Cambridge can and should do. So 
can we vote on the motion? Since we only have 10 minutes left. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
We can, as soon as comment on it is over. Do I see other comments. I am almost entirely the opinion of 
Councillor Zondervan with maybe a little bit more frustration that it takes the meeting being called for the 
city solicitor to give us a report. And it takes someone from the public to point out, in retrospect, some 
obvious flaws like gas hookups for emergency backup. Honestly, I don't have the expertise to answer that 
stuff. But if it takes moving legislation to the point where it's about to be passed to get the city staff to do 
what I consider its job in a proactive manner, then that's what we'll do. Now, unfortunately, I won't be 
here next term, to keep that going. But I agree with councillor or the Vice Mayor that others will. And 
there's a lot of frustration with me at least said it takes having an ordinance committee meeting to get 
before we even have the chance to read it. A legal opinion on whether we can do this or not. So yeah, 
otherwise, I agree with absolutely everything Councillor Zondervan said. Councillor Siddiqui. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui   
Just a comment, I think, after this motion, if you have a motion prepared already, but doing a motion on 
working with the city manager to convening some of these concurrent conversations with stakeholders as 
we... into the January, February March period... as we move this forward. Thanks. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
I have a question for you, Councillor Zondervan. Is this with a favorable recommendation or 
recommendation or a negative recommendation? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Favorable? 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Okay, so we have a motion on the floor to move this ordinance. And as has been clarified before, this isn't 
a zoning ordinance. So it doesn't go through those planning board and other timeline related process 
issues. So it could sit on the council's agenda for a long time or the council could pick it up and pass it. So 
with that, there was a motion on the floor to forward this proposed amendment to the city 
ordinances with a favorable recommendation all in favor say aye. Aye. Nays? 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon   
Mr. Chair, Nay. I would like to be recorded as "no". 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
We have one "nay" and four "yeses". All right on that note, did i miscount one "nay" and five 
"yeses". I did miscount one "nay" and five "yeses".

1.  That the City Manager is requested to direct the City Solicitor, Community Development, 
Public  Works,  Inspectional  Services  and  any  other  related  departments  to  review  the 
proposed  amendments  regarding  the  prohibition  of  Natural  Gas  Infrastructure  in  New 
Buildings. 

RESULT: 

REFERRED TO THE CITY COUNCIL WITH A FAVORABLE 
RECOMMENDATION 

 

 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
So with that, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn. That's not a motion to adjourn. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Councillor Siddiqui made a second motion. 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui   
The motion... my colleagues can jump in.  That the city... that the city manager is requested to 
convene stakeholders to give comments on this proposed amendment. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
So on that motion... 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux   
May I just propose a slight wording change on the implementation of this proposed amendment because I 
think we've heard comments today and they were for and against. And I think we need to get to the point 
where we're talking about we're going to do this and here's how. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development   
So on that motion, last term, we had a whole discussion about how the city council could actually hold 
meetings and provide food and whatever for that. And, again, it's not going to be me who's doing this. But 
I would recommend that someone on the city council do that rather than kick that responsibility to the city 
manager. So I will vote no on this motion, but the motion is on the floor, to ask the city manager to 
convene meetings to talk about this zoning or not this zoning proposal, this municipal ordinance proposal. 
Okay, you look critical Councillor Mallon. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon   
I'm wondering if this would be a good place to talk about this in the Health and Environment. If we don't 
want the city manager to convene a group. I'm not sure about that suggestion, but I leave it up to my 
colleagues but I just wonder if... if we're going to be convening these groups, doing it in a City Council 
Committee might be better. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you Mr. Chair through you to my colleagues. I agree that we can should and will have further 
committee hearings on this topic. I also think it is useful to ask the city manager to also set up a process to 
get input and help us figure out how to implement this provision. So I think we can do both things and we 
can bring the information together in the council and have a good outcome.

So I am going to reiterate. I think that's a bad idea. And we we kicked the leaf blowers to the city 
manager's office and as far as I know, nothing, that was months and months ago. So I don't know how this 
is different from that. And if the council wants this to happen, I think the council should keep control of 
this.  Vice Mayor. 
 
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux   
While we've had two tasks forced... task forces formed by the Mayor this term; one on rent, you know, 
displacement and the other on the arts. We don't have a mayor yet for next term, but I suppose this motion 
could direct both the city manager and the future Mayor to work together to co-convene the appropriate, 
you know, body of experts to work on this. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Councillor Zondervan or was it you, all right? Councillor Mallon. 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon   
If you don't mind I... when I was speaking with Brookline today, what they did was they used existing, 
not city council committees, but advisory committees to answer specific questions around costs impacts, 
working with unions for [sic] example. I'm wondering if there's a way to use our existing advisory 
committees to kind of do that outreach at the same time we're doing it in the city council. So as to... as 
Mr. Chair has suggested that the city manager's office might not be best equipped to handle this in the 
rapid way that we would like to.  I would  like to hear my colleagues thoughts on that. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
Councillor Zondervan. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Mr. Chair, I think we can figure it out in the council. I don't think we necessarily need to put a 
motion on, on that right now. And we have in the past done things through the city manager's office and 
the council at the same time, we're doing it now with the resilience Task Force. And, and we're doing it in 
other areas. So I think it's, it's sufficient to ask the city manager to convene stakeholders and then we in 
the council in the next term can of course, do the same thing and work with the city manager to 
coordinate on exactly how and when and where that happens. So I would like to read the full motion for 
my colleagues. The motion is to ask the city manager to convene stakeholder meetings to make 
comments on the implementation of banning gas. 
 
Councillor Craig Kelley   
So on that, any comments? All in favor, aye? Nay? Me. All right, so that's another five to one vote. 
And  on  that  note,  I  would  entertain a  motion  to adjourn?  Okay,  so  moved.  And  we'll  see  some  of  you 
back here at 5:30 for the Harvard Square meeting. 
 
meeting adjourned at 4:12 PM

Fwd: Letter in Opposition - Proposed Ordinance: Prohibition of Natural Gas 
Infrastructure in New Buildings
MSCE Letter - Proposed Municipal Ordinance.pdf

Please convey to my colleagues on the council the following information:

The Massachusetts Coalition for Sustainable Energy, despite its name, is in fact a front group for natural gas interests, as 
can be seen from their website, https://massforenergy.org/, specifically this text (see in bold):

"We believe in Massachusetts’ energy future — where renewable sources such as wind, solar and hydro meet the needs 
of our families and businesses. Until the reliability and capacity of those renewable sources have increased, we are 
forced to use carbon intensive fuels like oil and coal to make up our energy shortage. Expanding our natural gas access 
— the most affordable and cleanest alternative — is the best way to backstop our transition to renewable energy."

There are other articles in the media that describe this coalition and their true interests, including this 
article: https://commonwealthmagazine.org/opinion/beware-coalition-sustainable-energy/ and this 
one: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/natural-gas-coalition-massachusetts_n_5a8f2563e4b0528232aa904e

Quinton Zondervan, Cambridge City Councilor 
Cambridge City Council 
 
 
Dear Councilor Zondervan and all members of the Cambridge City Council, 
 
As a building industry professional and current Massachusetts resident and past resident of 
Cambridge, I thank you for considering a natural gas ban in the City of Cambridge. Climate 
change is arguably the greatest environmental, financial, and societal threat of our time, 
therefore, it is imperative that we adopt regulations that ultimately achieve negative net 
emissions. I am the Director of Sustainable Design at a major mechanical engineering firm in 
Boston and have extensive experience with electrification of buildings in Cambridge and the 
greater Boston area. 
 
In Massachusetts, commercial and residential building operations (including on-site combustion 
and electricity consumption) result in nearly half of the total annual greenhouse gas emissions.1  
Most buildings constructed today will still be in operation long after the 2050 deadline by which 
Massachusetts must reach 80% carbon neutral (per the Massachusetts Global Warming 
Solutions Act).2  Therefore, it is imperative that we take action now in order to reach our 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission reduction goals. 
 
Electric buildings relying on heat pumps result in lower GHG emissions today and will result in 
even lower GHG emissions in the future, as more renewables are connected to the electric grid.  
We must ban new gas infrastructure, if we expect to have a carbon neutral building stock in the 
future.  Therefore, I am writing to urge the City of Cambridge to develop and promulgate a ban 
on new natural gas infrastructure. 
 
As an expert in Net Zero Energy buildings, I have the expertise to demonstrate that eliminating 
natural gas from buildings, combined with strategies that reduce heating and cooling loads 
offers many advantages including: better health and comfort, lower total cost of ownership, and 
greater resilience and that 100% electric buildings are achievable today. 
 

Health Advantages 
100% electric buildings improve public health by reducing combustion emissions, 
thereby reducing both indoor and outdoor exposure to carbon monoxide, particulates, 
NOx, SOx, and elevated CO2 levels.  Combined with strategies that reduce heating and 
cooling loads, 100% electric buildings also offer improved occupant health and comfort 
through strategies such as greater control of indoor temperature due to increased 
insulation, enhanced humidity control via improved exhaust air energy recovery, 
improved indoor air quality due to filtered mechanical ventilation, reduced risk of mold

to natural light and views.   
 
Financial Advantages 
Studies, such as The Economics of Zero-Energy Homes (Rocky Mountain Institute),3 
and the Zero Energy Buildings in Massachusetts: Saving Money from the Start (USGBC 
MA),4 demonstrate that 100% electric Net Zero buildings carry a negligible construction 
cost premium and result in significantly lower total cost of ownership.  For example, 
when building construction is financed through loans or bonds, 100% electric Net Zero 
buildings typically save more in operating cost than the marginal uptick in loan or bond 
payments, resulting in positive cash flow from day one.  Additionally, 100% electric Net 
Zero and Green Buildings have enhanced asset value, reducing financial risk to 
developers looking to turn over properties.  
 
By reducing the total monthly cost to own or rent, 100% electric Net Zero housing offers 
greater affordability, and thereby would help to address the housing crisis currently 
affecting low-income families in the Cambridge and greater Boston area. 
 
Resilience Advantages 
100% electric buildings with reduced heating and cooling loads offer greater resilience 
through reduced demands on emergency infrastructure through “passive survivability”, 
whereby the envelope performance allows habitable conditions even when no active 
mechanical systems are operational.  In addition, there is the opportunity for on-site 
renewable energy and storage systems to provide power to select building loads for 
periods of longer power outages. 

 
Due to these advantages, many communities in Massachusetts are interested in natural gas 
bans and electrification of buildings.  Natural gas bans would give those communities the 
opportunity to begin reducing GHG emissions now, getting us closer to meeting our climate 
goals as outlined by the City of Cambridge and Governor Baker. 
 
100% Electric Buildings Today 
100% electric buildings are achievable today: as a building industry professional and expert in 
electrification of buildings, I have witnessed and engaged in the design and construction of 
residential and commercial 100% electric buildings at many scales and budgets, including a 
broad range of building uses and architectural styles.  Homeowners, businesses, institutions 
and developers are now taking advantage of the benefits of100% electric buildings at all scales.  
This has lead to exponential growth in the number and size of Net Zero buildings in recent 
years.5

An example from my firm (BR+A Consulting Engineers) is the Boston Arts Academy, a 150,000 
square foot high school being built in Boston.  This example is particularly valuable as a 
precedent because it is a zero lot-line building, which made a ground-source heat pump system 
more challenging than sites with available open space.  Therefore, this 100% electric building 
relies entirely on air-source heat pumps (variable refrigerant flow or “VRF”) for heating and 
cooling of all spaces and ventilation air at the air handlers.  A detailed life cycle cost analysis 
proved that this 100% electric solution results in a net present savings, compared to a stretch-
code minimum design. 
 
Another well-known example of a 100% electric building (although not part of BR+A’s portfolio) 
that relies on air-source heat pumps is the Cornell Tech dormitory on Roosevelt Island in New 
York.  It is a 26-story highrise that relies entirely on variable refrigerant flow (VRF) heat pumps 
for heating and cooling. 
 
We also designed Harvard University’s first and second 100% electric Zero Net Energy 
buildings: Harvard House Zero and Harvard Artlab.  House Zero relies on a ground-source heat 
pump and Harvard ArtLab relies on air-source heat pumps.  Both of these buildings do not have 
a natural gas connection and have each operated through at least one winter season. 
 
Another 100% electric building from my firm is the Boston University Center for Computing and 
Data Sciences, a 350,000 square foot, 19-story building being built in Boston.  In this case, we 
took advantage of a small alleyway behind the building, and a portion of the area beneath the 
building, to install a geothermal bore field.  This building will rely entirely on ground-source heat 
pump chillers to heat the building, with electric boilers as a back-up system.  There is no fossil 
fuel connection to the building, in alignment with Boston University's climate action plan.  A 
detailed construction cost analysis proved that this 100% electric solution results in a net 
construction cost premium of only 0.1%, compared to a stretch-code minimum design.  This was 
achieved by implementing strategies that reduce load and HVAC system size and mechanical 
space requirements within the building, offsetting the majority of the cost premium to install the 
geothermal bore field. 
 
Beyond these few examples, there are many more examples of successful and cost effective 
100% electric buildings in cold climates.  And, more important than individual examples of 100% 
electric buildings, there are precedents for municipalities banning natural gas.  On the West 
Coast, many municipalities have banned new natural gas infrastructure.  And, Brookline recently 
passed a natural gas ban.  With a natural gas ban, Cambridge has an opportunity to continue its 
legacy of national leadership on climate action. 
 
Impact on Electrical Infrastructure 
100% electric buildings that take advantage of high-efficiency heat pump systems and other 
measures that reduce heating and cooling loads (such as high performance envelopes and high 
efficiency ventilation heat recovery systems) result in equivalent or lower peak loads on the 
electric grid, compared to conventional buildings.  This is due to the fact that conventional 
buildings typically have high peak cooling loads in the summer that require large electrical

infrastructure.  This integration approach to load reduction, high performance systems and 
electrification helps ensure that the electrical infrastructure can develop in a reasonable manner 
to support the shift away from fossil fuels to 100% electric buildings.   
 
Conclusion: In Support of the City of Cambridge Natural Gas Ban 
Based on my professional experience with successful 100% electric buildings, I am confident 
that a natural gas ban in Cambridge is easily accommodated for new buildings and gut 
renovations with today’s technology.  A gas ban, particularly in combination with building 
systems that reduce heating and cooling loads will ultimately enhance public health, result in 
financial savings to building owners and tenants, improve resilience, and support economic 
growth in the City of Cambridge. 
 
I recognize that the details of the natural gas ban will require a concerted effort to develop, and 
should include input from building industry professionals and stakeholders within the City of 
Cambridge.  Exceptions for unique uses, such as laboratory and hospital buildings should be 
considered, particularly for back-up heating and standby power needs, while recognizing that 
these unique building types must also greatly reduce their reliance on natural gas and work 
towards eliminating natural gas in the future. 
 
Overall, the many advantages of a natural gas ban make it a clear win for the City of 
Cambridge.  As a building industry professional and expert in 100% electric buildings, I support 
the development and adoption of a natural gas ban and urge you to take action on behalf of the 
people of the City of Cambridge and our broader community. 
 
Sincerely,

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

The Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee 
will conduct a public hearing to discuss ways to ensure that the Cambridge Carnival will take place 
in 2020 and beyond. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan 
Welcome everyone, we're going to get started in a second. Okay, so this is a committee hearing 
by the Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations 
Committee. I will read the call to the meeting: we will conduct a public hearing to discuss ways 
to ensure that the Cambridge Carnival will take place in 2020 and beyond. This hearing is being 
televised. We do have a quorum: I'm joined by my co-chair, Councillor Carlone, as well as 
committee member Councillor Siddiqui.  So before we get started, just wanted to make a couple 
of quick announcements. Michael Monestime from the Central Square BID wanted to join us but 
unfortunately he won't be able to be here tonight. He sent us a message that said "I'm sorry my 
daughter has a performance tomorrow at her school. I want to be known that we have met with 
Nicola and the bid will support the Taste Of Carnival and Carnival itself in any and all ways 
possible.  And we also have a message from Jason Weeks, who is unable to attend, but he's 
also sent a message that says "I've been working with Nicola Williams, Mike Monestime, and 
David Kale, on Taste Of Carnival for next spring in the Cultural District. We will continue to stay 
involved and provide partnership and assistance where needed. For the annual festival, 
Cambridge Arts has served as a partner in past years. We will continue to work with the 
organization to provide support going forward. So again, just wanted to share those messages. 
And then from the community, we received communications from Our Revolution Cambridge, 
the Cambridge Residents Alliance, and Sheli Wortis sent us a letter as well that appears on the 
December 16, 2019 regular meeting agenda for the City Council. So those are all in support of 
the Carnival and continuing. So what I would like to do is welcome the city staff and start with a 
message from our Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Representative. So if you could introduce 
yourselves and share with us your your thoughts. 
 
Betsy Allen 
Good afternoon, everyone. Councillor Carlone, thank you for the invitation as well. So I want to 
thank everyone for being here and for the opportunity to speak. In the context of this hearing, I 
feel it's important to clarify that as the City's Director of Equity & Inclusion, my work is internally

directed in that I collaborate with all employees to embed principles of diversity, equity and 
inclusion into everything that we do and how we carry our duties in service, sort of, to our 
diverse public. Let me start by stating that we, from the first day I was here and really from 
previous knowledge, that we are unequivocally and unquestionably committed to diversity. We 
are also firmly committed to the principles of equity, inclusion, and equal access to resources. 
All of this is our firm belief that if we cultivate an environment of equity, inclusion and diversity, 
that only serves to provide the excellent unparalleled customer service that we feel our public 
deserves. So, that’s really at the core- customer service- is really at the core of everything that 
we do.  So we talk a little bit about equity. We believe that equity is allowing impartial access to 
opportunities and resources and support to everyone. And for years, the city has been 
committed to DEI projects (that’s the shorthand I'm going to use, so I don't have to keep saying 
diversity, equity and inclusion, so DEI). But in 2017, we really ratcheted up our efforts when we 
launched the Cambridge Equity and Inclusion Initiative. This initiative is headed by the Deputy 
City Manager Lisa Peterson, and it has the full backing, support, engagement, and participation 
of the City Manager Louis DePasquale.  The reason we started with this Leadership Initiative is 
that we feel that by focusing on our top leaders, they will then permeate and help us embed the 
diversity principles into our operations and making sure that we are serving the public in the 
most inclusive, equitable and excellent way possible. And so I don't want to keep going on and 
on, you can always ask questions later. But we feel that in order for all of our efforts to be 
sustainable, adaptable and have accountability, we must have the structure to support that. And 
so we've partnered with an organization to do what we're calling a “recruitment hire and 
promotion project”, to look at how we're doing recruitment promotion, and hiring, to make it more 
equitable and more inclusive. And so, one of the other things I wanted to mention is that as part 
of our initiative, the city's top leadership, including the City Manager, Commissioner Bard, Mr. 
Kale and the chief here, they all have been through identity awareness training, race and 
structural racism training. They've been through microaggression training. In January we'll have 
an expert come in to do a full day training on microaggression for over 70 staff members, and 
also an implicit bias training in the spring. In addition to that, we have bi-monthly learning 
sessions about how to build cultural competencies and inclusive leadership skills. Everything 
that we do is about serving the public better. It's about providing that equitable customer service 
that our community deserves. With that, I want to thank you for inviting me and I appreciate the 
opportunity to speak. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you so much. We really appreciate the commitment to DEI that has been shown. And so 
what I'd like to do next is we'll hear from Nicola Williams from the Carnival Committee. And we'll 
do about 20 minutes of presentation and then we'll hear from the City Manager and the Police 
Commissioner on the end of the Carnival, what happened, and then how we can move forward 
and then we'll have an opportunity for public comment and then we'll come back to some more 
discussion about making sure that Carnival 2020 takes place. 
 
Nicola Williams  
Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Carlone, and Councillor 
Siddiqui for being here. Appreciate it as well as the Manager and city staff and Commissioner 
and the community, including members of the Carnival Committee, on the coldest day of the 
year. I'm glad to be here. Oh, thank you for Councillor Mallon as well. So what do we intend to 
accomplish today? introductions, history of Carnival, I'm going to go through that very quickly. 
History of Cambridge Carnival, our programs and then I’ll focus more on preserving our legacy 
and the future of Carnival. So we hope to have a better understanding of Carnival in general, 
and learn about our 27 years of history, and plan for our next steps. So this is our Carnival and 
when I say our Carnival, our theme is planned by the people for the people. That's how all

carnivals are planned across the world. It's a grassroots community-led event. Our mission is to 
produce an annual festival, and organize year round cultural events, and sharing the diversity of 
Cambridge and South American cultures with the community, and, you know, support cross 
cultural understanding, and we do that through our annual festival, and accompanying events. 
Carnival across the world represents a celebration of freedom and diversity. Cambridge 
Carnival is one of the largest festivals in Cambridge and the longest running festival celebrating 
the Caribbean and African Diaspora. Our festival stakeholders to make this work are Mas Bands 
which are the costume groups, steel bands, and our artists. And it's held in Central Square 
Cultural District since its beginning. That's definitely been the heart and soul of Carnival- Central 
Square.  A snapshot of Carnival across the world: You have it in your document but there are 24 
carnivals across the US, and around the same number across the UK. Germany has one and 
many countries internationally, France etc. have carnivals. The largest Carnival in the northern 
hemisphere is Toronto. And then we we have Notting Hill, New York, Boston. So we have 
carnivals all over the world and most of them are free. The one in Miami does charge a fee. It's 
contained in a big stadium. But most of them are free. London did a study, I did actually do 
some did some work for the mayor there on their largest cultural event which is Notting Hill 
Carnival, and the study identified it generated 93 million pounds for the City of London. The 
Toronto Carnival generates $400 million for the city of Ontario.  So how we began, we were 
formed in 1992 with community members. It was important that Cambridge celebrates its 
Caribbean heritage, because a number of community members who were of Caribbean descent 
wanted to acknowledge Cambridge's long history of Caribbean people. Especially those from 
Barbados who settled in the early 1900s in Cambridge. Other ethnic groups came along, 
Caribbean groups and South American groups afterwards, but the largest representation of the 
Caribbean population in Cambridge is from Barbados. If you kind of ask most people have been 
here for generations, their lineage is from Barbados. It was actually sanctioned by (back then) 
Mayor Reeves. He appointed me as a community representative to help this group of people 
who wanted to start a carnival, and I've been part of it ever since. The city matched funds that 
the carnival committee raised, $1500, and that's how we started. It's based on Trinidad and 
Brazilian models with an international focus and we raised money through the jamborees that 
we did in Carl Barron Square. And over the years, we've sort of evolved we've moved from 
Central Square to Kendall Square, because we outgrew it. And so the first 10 years we were in 
Central Square, and we ended up in Kendall Square in 2005. Our current programs- we have an 
annual International Festival and Parade. We have community collaborations with various 
community groups identified. We do a lot of community engagement through the River Festival, 
Mayfair, Hoops and Health, Oktoberfest, and Honk! Festival. We have the Cambridge Youth 
Steel Orchestra initiative, which is a brand new initiative. We've done a Taste of Carnival before, 
and thanks to the city support we are able to bring it back.  Carnival operations- we are 
committee of mainly volunteers. Most of our funding comes from vendors, a little bit from 
sponsors. We used to have more sponsorship in the past but that has waned over the years. 
The city covers core services such as public safety, police, fire, and traffic. We are seriously 
under resourced. Ideally, a festival budget should be $150,000. We heavily rely on volunteers, 
interns, and in-kind planning services to organize this event. A committee of about eight to 10 
people plan this year round with a lot of in kind services. Our performers receive honorariums 
based on what we're able to raise, and it's grossly less than what the Cambridge River Festival 
and other festivals offer for artists. This is a snapshot of festival programming. Our Youth Steel 
Pan Program was awarded a one time grant of $40,000. We actually have a couple more pans 
to be delivered that were made for us, valued at $20,000, for our community in perpetuity.  The 
Taste of Carnival event, thanks to the support from the City Manager, and in collaboration with 
the Arts Council and the Cultural District it will be February 29. So details to follow.  So I'm going 
to focus now on a sustainability plan for Carnival for 2020 and beyond. So why do we need a 
Carnival in Cambridge? Well, Cambridge Carnival is an important and key cultural event that

needs to be recognized as such in the Central Square Cultural District. Our city seeks to 
promote diversity and celebration in all cultures, and to support and stimulate the public purpose 
of inclusivity for the city of Cambridge. So the Carnival is extremely important. When it was 
cancelled this year, I can't tell you how many youth have come up to me and they, you know, 
are very upset still and don't understand. But it's kind of like when you don't have something, 
then you realize how much more valuable it is. And certainly the community came out to raise 
their voices about the importance of Carnival. So, we need to sustain it. How do we preserve it 
and what resources would be required? So, Caribbean immigrants contributed to the history of 
Cambridge for the first hundred years, as evidenced by the individuals represented in the 
African American trail in Cambridge, and this legacy needs to be recognized and honored. Prior 
to 1992 there was no significant festival that represented the art, history, and culture of the 
significant Caribbean population in Cambridge. The Cambridge Carnival founders with the help 
of Mayor Reeves and the city launched this event. Its purpose is to unite the diverse Cambridge 
community through art, culture and celebration, and recognize freedom and the emancipation of 
slavery, which is celebrated annually for the last hundred and 85 years in the form of Carnival 
masquerade industries worldwide. Cambridge Carnival is an important and key event for the 
city. The committee believes that by improving the quality of the festival, we will improve the 
safety. Very few events in Cambridge focus on African and Caribbean culture. And that became 
very clear during the cancellation. So, sustainability. a commitment from the council to preserve 
this historical event will require a few things. First, sanctioning a comprehensive public safety 
plan for Cambridge Carnival. We do have one in place and a forum in 2005 actually started that 
process. But we believe it's time to revisit that and develop a comprehensive safety plan. Other 
cities like London, New York, and Toronto have public safety plans specifically for carnival. So 
there are reference points that we can tap and learn from. And also Boston has a process as 
well. So I think it would be something that we could benefit from. Improving the quality of the 
event is also another opportunity to sustain the event. And support for more participation from 
Cambridge residents, especially youth, who really want to get involved but don't know how. But 
but they certainly vocalize their disappointment when it doesn't happen. And employing the 
necessary resources to sustain the festival and the culture, long term. Public safety- so, the 
Cambridge Carnival Committee currently coordinates with the Cambridge Police Department. 
We have a separate meeting for the festival. And like I said, a public safety plan- an expanded 
one- is needed for Carnival at this time. We encourage our police to coordinate with law 
enforcement officials in carnival cities such as Boston, New York, and Toronto. And we also 
would like the city to commit the necessary public safety resources, to have them in place, so 
we can continue. So on improving the quality of the event. There are a couple of things that we 
could do. We need to pay our artists and performers fair and equitable fees. We need to 
increase the number of live performances by local artists. We feel by relying less on what 
someone else provides at the carnival for entertainment and having a more controlled process 
of organizing and deliberate public performances (live performances) will improve the quality of 
the event. We need to expand our kids fest program which offers free activities for our kids. We 
need a year round professional and production staff for the carnival. We don't have a 
representative that can be in command central all day, which is required from the police 
department, because we are under resourced. So that's an important part. And we need to 
expand the costume camps. We used to have them in North Cambridge and different parts of 
the city. But we'd like to expand that.  Cultural preservation: in order to preserve the legacy and 
cultural contributions of the Caribbean community, we feel that it would be great and important 
to have a Caribbean Cultural Center. We're almost 30 years old. The center will provide a 
permanent home to house our programs, including our steel orchestra. We don't store our pans, 
we have 20 pans that are stored in Boston right now. We can do community workshops, have 
meeting space, we kind of borrow space from banks, etc. to meet and it will provide a functional 
space as well.  Last slide. So we've identified some of the resources required to facilitate and

sustain the carnival. First, we need authorization of the necessary resources to develop and 
employ a comprehensive safety plan, through authorization of a line item in the city's budget. 
Our festival really would take about $150,000 for the festival to make sure that we offer fair fees 
to our artists and employee staff. $50,000 would support our steel orchestra program, and 
$50,000 will help develop new costume camps for our youth in Cambridge. There is precedent 
for a line item. The city has line items for various festivals like the River Festival, the City Dance 
Party, and other activities. We are looking for a commitment to identify and secure a Caribbean 
Cultural Center, a permanent home to house carnival. We're not expecting that to be immediate, 
but it's something to consider when community benefit opportunities come up. There is 
precedent: the city helped to identify and secure buildings to preserve the Dance Complex and 
the Cambridge Multicultural Arts Center. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Nicola. So now we'll hear from the City Manager and the Police Commissioner. 
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager   
Thank you. So, first, I want to say that I also have a long history with the carnival. Back in my 
early days when this Carnival first started, with Mayor Reeves, Manager Healey asked me to 
make sure all the finances worked and I've been working on that with Nicola on the committee 
since this time. In since becoming City Manager, I clearly have done everything I could to make 
sure that this event was supported, in that we did everything we could to make it continue. I've 
attended the last two events as City Manager, and really got to witness the culture and the 
richness of the event. I want to bring something that's real important here. There is nobody on 
this side of the table who doesn't truly understand the importance of this event and truly does 
not understand the disappointment that everybody had when we called the event off. I think 
that's real important. In 2017, when I was at the carnival, there was an incident that put some 
concerns in the community and the Commissioner will get into more detail but I quickly said to 
him that we need to have this Carnival in 2018: "do whatever it takes". And I think he will show 
how we changed things dramatically in terms of making sure that this Carnival was going to take 
place in 2018, and it did and it was great. In 2019, we continued to say how can we even do it 
better and as the commissioner will state, I clearly stated to him, "I'm not worried about the 
funds. I'm worried about making this the best possible Carnival we can do. And we are in place, 
I think, to do that again". However, when the Police Commissioner states that he has a real 
concern for the safety of the residents and the participants of any event, that is something that I 
have to take very seriously. And I can honestly say, and I think people who know me will 
understand this, there was probably no more difficult decision that I've had to make, knowing 
the importance of this to the community to have to say, "okay, we're not having the Carnival". As 
soon as we made that decision with the Police Commissioner, we reached out to Nicola. And 
the real question was, we could not have it this year, probably, but how could we do something 
to help compensate for that, and how can we get prepared for 2020? And, you know, the Taste 
of the Carnival, once we met on that, I can tell you that I really helped take a lead in making 
sure that was going to work. I reached out to Pastor Washington immediately to get the 
Christian Life Center to see if we could keep it in the Cultural District because that was 
important. I assigned David Kale to try to make the finances work. We worked with Michael 
Monestime to continue to help and support and we work with Jason Weeks. So we really have 
tried to make the best of a very difficult situation, and are looking forward to the February event. 
I think it is real important to continue to say that for 2020, now more than ever, it is incredibly 
important that we have this Carnival. And we will do everything we can, as we continue and 
have done, to make this Carnival a success. So, I'm going to turn it over on the specifics, but I 
just really want to thank everybody for working with us, for having this Carnival for all these

years, and I can assure you that on the city side, we will do whatever it takes to try not to have 
this happen next year. I'm going to turn it now over to Commissioner Bard. 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  
Good evening, Mr. Chair. I start off by saying that this year would have been my third Caribbean 
festival, and it's delightful working with the Caribbean Carnival Committee. From Nicola, 
Gregory, Miss Drucilla, Owen, everyone is fantastic to work with. I just want to frame the events 
surrounding this year's cancellation but to do that I have to talk about my first Carnival here. So 
during the 2017 Caribbean Festival, as we all know, gunfire erupted near viewing stand at 300 
Technology Square, resulting in two individuals being shot, and several other individuals being 
trampled. A secondary shooting, believed to be related to that shooting, occurred on River and 
William Street. Several houses were damaged, we recovered a large caliber weapon, and we 
made several arrests based on both of those shooting incidents. The video of that event I can 
tell you is brutally disturbing, and I've never publicly shown it or frames from it because I think it 
does damage to the reputation of the Carnival, which is, you know, a family friendly event. I 
have to point out that the event was also disrupted in 2015 and in 2016 by violence. So because 
the festival was interrupted by violence in those preceding years, after the gun violence in 2017 
I was inundated with emails and phone calls, and I believe the City Manager's office was as 
well, asking that the carnival be re-evaluated and many pleaded for it to be canceled.  
Therefore, the City Manager tasked me, after first stressing the importance of the event and the 
cultural landscape here in Cambridge, with conducting a review to make an informed 
recommendation as to whether the Carnival should be allowed to continue in 2018 and moving 
forward. So, to make an informed recommendation, a wide swath of historical and contextual 
knowledge was sought out. The following activities were undertaken by either myself or 
members of the Cambridge Police Department. We conducted a thorough review of prior 
incident action plans outlining our coverage for the festival. I conducted a thorough review of 
historical crime and incident related data pertaining to the festival, both here and in Boston. I 
met with then Superintendent and Chief William Gross of the BPD to discuss the event both 
here in Cambridge and in Boston. I held several intergovernmental meetings with departments 
most impacted by the festival. That includes obviously the police, fire, public works, inspectional 
services, special events, committee personnel, etc. Then I held several small working group 
meetings with elected officials and all, the Mayor, the Vice Mayor, and all the councillors were 
given opportunities to raise concerns and provide feedback and input. The mayor and his Chief 
of Staff continued to be assets throughout that entire fact-finding process. I conducted small 
clergy group meetings including with the police chaplains. I conducted a series of meetings 
between Cambridge Police Department and the Caribbean Carnival Committee board, who, I 
can't stress, were wonderful to work with. I can't stress that enough. I conducted several 
meetings between the Cambridge Carnival Committee board and then that larger 
intergovernmental group. We facilitated meetings between what was then the Central Square 
Business Association and the Cambridge Carnival board. We held two committee meetings, one 
in conjunction with the board, and Central Square and MIT, and then one that we held alone. 
And then we conducted several internal planning sessions where different policing strategies 
and incident accident plans were discussed and then subsequently developed. So, as a result of 
all of the information gathered from those key sources, and then several other things that we did 
that I didn't mention, several themes developed. The first theme was that the Carnival is of such 
importance in the context of celebrating the multicultural landscape represented in Cambridge, 
that its potential cancellation should not be considered without much deliberation. Two, the 
Carnival is the sole remaining Cambridge event that celebrates the heritage of the minority 
Cantabrigians. Three, the consensus was also that continued violence cannot and should not be 
tolerated. Four, although slightly more muted, most stakeholders indicated that they would defer 
to the discretion of the Cambridge Police Department and its belief as to whether it could devise

a plan that would severely reduce the likelihood of violence. And then the last one was that 
should the event be held in 2018, and should violence occur, that the event should be 
terminated for the foreseeable future in Cambridge.  Based on all of those factors, I made a 
recommendation to the City Manager that the carnival be permitted to occur in 2018. The 
recommendation was heavily influenced by the opinions of stakeholders pertaining to the 
cultural importance of the carnival, and my opinion that the likelihood for violence could be 
drastically reduced by several factors. One, we had an augmented staffing plan. Two, we 
changed our zone policing philosophy. Instead of looking at it as one large event, we broke it 
down into several zones, with a Deputy Superintendent in charge of each zone, with dedicated 
resources, and a superintendent being the overall incident commander, with me being present 
the entire time. And then we shortened the length of the Carnival, and we also augmented the 
amount of volunteers that the committee provided. So I made the recommendation that we allow 
it to occur based on that but then my final sentence of that recommendation to the City Manager 
was, "although I make this recommendation, I would ask that the City Manager allow me to 
reserve the right to alter or cancel the event should information or any situation develop that 
was seen threatened public safety if the event were allowed to occur".  So we had a wonderfully 
successful family friendly event in 2018. And you fast forward to August of 2019, And I 
recommended to the City Manager that the Caribbean festival that was scheduled for 
September 8, 2019 be canceled. Looking at the year prior and the backdrop, you know I did not 
come to this recommendation lightly. I did so because of the serious concern that gun violence 
would occur during this year's celebration. I consistently feel like I always have to point out that 
we were all set to go for 2019. We went through all of the necessary external, internal planning 
steps that we did the previous year. Much the way we had a successful event in 2018, we 
severely augmented our staffing plan. One of the bullets on on Miss Williams' presentation was 
a comprehensive public safety plan. Well, we already had a comprehensive public safety plan. 
We went from a staffing plan that costs for the Cambridge Police Department $40,000 in 2017, 
to one that cost $172,000 for the Police Department alone in 2018. And like I said, we pulled off 
a wonderfully smooth, successful event. So I already outlined how we went from treating it as 
one large event, to treating it as several smaller events in that zone policing, which worked out 
well. So we did that and many other things to prepare for this year. We were ready to go. The 
cancellation wasn't a knee jerk reaction to the violence that occurred surrounding the 
celebration in Boston. Although, I continually say of course, incidents that occur in Boston do 
play a role in the calculus for the events that occur here. I think it is key to remember that we 
went to, although this predated me, we went to a two week period and Between the Boston 
event and the Cambridge event as a cooling off period. So the recommendation this year was 
born out of a serious concern that gun violence was going to occur this year. And with the 
realization that there's no perfect public safety plan that can prevent targeted violence. I mean, 
you just got to harken back to the video of 2017, when you see an individual pull out a gun, and 
fire into a crowd of up to 40,000 people with 20 police officers within chasing distance. I mean 
very close to them. Understand that there's no perfect plan that can stop that type of targeted 
violence. So while I have the utmost confidence in the members of the Cambridge Police 
Department and our ability to successfully handle these large scale events, I can't let that 
confidence interfere with considerations when they concern matters of the highest level of public 
safety here in the city.  I didn't make the recommendation lightly. I went into it knowing that the 
carnival is of such importance in the context of celebrating the multicultural landscape in the 
city. I knew that its cancellation could not be even considered without much deliberation. And 
regrettably, as I initially went to law enforcement interventions and augmenting what was 
already an augmented plan, I remember having the epiphany of  "wait a minute, what are you 
doing? The best way to ensure that nobody gets hurt and nobody gets shot during this year's 
celebration is not to have it". So, I made a recommendation to the manager to cancel it. 
Obviously, I remain committed and the department remains committed, to ensuring that we

have the highest degree of public safety at the events moving forward. But this year, you know, 
it boils down to simple calculations. The simplest way to ensure safety was not to have it. Also, I 
felt like I wouldn't have allowed my wife and daughter to go to the event this year based on my 
serious concerns. So that means I wouldn't want any of you going to the event this year. And 
with that, I conclude the presentation of my comments. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Commissioner and thank you City Manager. I want to welcome Councillor Alanna 
Mallon as well as former Mayor Ken Reeves. We'll hear from Mayor Reeves for a few minutes. I 
do want to stress that I appreciate the history and and how we got here. Tonight, we're really 
looking forward. Of course we need to process the past so that we can plan for the future but we 
don't want to spend a lot of time on what happened. It was painful to many of us, and that's 
acknowledged. We now want to move forward and make sure that we have the Carnival in 2020 
and beyond, and that we have the necessary plans in place to make sure that happens. So we'll 
hear from Mayor Reeves and then we'll go to public comment. 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves   
I apologize for the late moment of my arrival as I have a competing Margaret Fuller board 
member meeting right now. So if I do leave that's why, I have to go back. I'm all about going 
forward. But I do think that we should not miss the many lessons that have been taught with 
respect to the cancellation of the Carnival. The first of which is that when the Carnival was 
canceled, members of the committee and members of the community came here to city hall to 
say to their elected officials that we do not think that this action is merited based on information 
that we have. So if you have more information, we could hear it, but we were just essentially told 
that, you know, there was information and this was done. That's it. So we came as citizens and 
we spoke at the mic. And the council, in its wisdom decided, well, what it would do was put over 
the discussion of this issue for another week. So we came back again, and we spoke again. 
And at the Council hearing about this event, there was no City Manager and no Police 
Commissioner, the two people who made the decision according to what was told to us. So, it 
was daunting, and I bring this up because I don't want anybody to think we missed it, that in our 
attempt to advocate on this issue, we didn't get a forum from our elected officials, because 
many of them for some reason kind of understood. I've talked to Craig Kelley, I've talked to you 
Councillor Zondervan, I've talked also to Sumbul Siddiqui. What do you think we came here for? 
And we couldn't have been more specific about: we don't think it should be canceled, we don't 
understand the nexus between the Boston event, you know, weeks prior, and this thing. And 
then the coup de grâce was that even the rain day couldn't occur based on this information. So, 
very truly, I don't, I'm not a police officer. I'm certainly not the Police Commissioner, and I don't 
expect to do that person's job but I do know this is a $50 million police operation we have. And I 
can't for the life of me understand, if the Boston Marathon continues to go on, despite the 
carnage that occurred there, and the fact that no Carnival anywhere in the world that we know 
of has ever been canceled. None! I had a good friend Ruth Batson who is a famous lady of 
Boston, who used to sometimes say to me, you know Ken, not good enough. Well, that's what I 
would say to this: just not good enough. It was so demeaning and unsatisfying. And this is the 
meeting that should have taken place the next week at the Council. This is exactly the meeting. 
Now here we are in the cloak of Christmas when nobody is watching and nobody is listening 
and nobody cares! And it's not because we didn't come and bring our issue here. It was really 
misdealt with. And I have to put this on the council, because you are the people who bring us 
the Manager and the Police Commissioner. To add insult to the injury, we had a rally here at 
City Hall. We had a big meeting over at the Union Baptist Church. We did everything we thought 
necessary to have our voices heard, and they were not heard. Because it got canceled, and and 
there was no, well, why don't why don't we come and counsel, let us let you know a little more

than we've let you know. Anything! And this has happened to no other group in the city that I'm 
aware of, and I've been aware of the city for a long, long, long time. And the further insult was 
that other events scheduled for that day went forward. So this is deeply problematic, both as to 
procedure, but as to fact. And, I for one, don't want to be treated in this manner. I am a citizen of 
the city, I pay taxes in the city. I'm paying for this $50 million police force. I expect it to be able to 
come up with a plan. If somebody does something to somebody in Boston, that will happen all 
the time. That has happened every year that there has been a Carnival. What made this year so 
distinct? We can't know because we don't have any information!  So, you know, I'm not going to 
argue with the air. But trust me, I do not feel in any sense that any concern I have has been 
addressed, because, no information! And what little there is, is so...I mean, what gives? So, that 
being said, I don't think there is the fullest awareness that until this Carnival came, there was no 
vehicle in this city where the peoples of color felt celebrated at all. And as one of the founders of 
this Carnival, from the first event, people literally cried in the street as we walked down the 
street, to see the celebration of themselves and their culture here. And for the City of Cambridge 
to sort of respond in this way to this thing was really shattering. And unfortunate, to say the 
least, but also very suspect. Because, you know, there are no secrets in Cambridge. I mean, I 
know that the police force in general doesn't care for the Carnival, because everybody has to 
work that day. And it strikes me that if I had a police force that I'm leading and the opportunity 
exists, because there is some problem, to just call the whole thing off, I think that's well received 
in some places. It was not well received in our place. And I don't know that this isn't irreparable 
because this was not done without information. And we did come and we did all the English 
language things we could think of doing, and we were not heard. And certainly there was no 
action. And I for one, you know, I'm glad that something is going to happen in February. But not 
good enough is my conclusion. And I will refer back to the amount of resources we have in 
policing. And you know, if we wanted to come up with a system where we had checks for people 
to come near, etc, and so on, all of those are possible. And again, I'm not the police. But to shut 
us down on this pretext is just not acceptable and won't be accepted, I'll put it that way.  So 
going forward, you know, the dynamic of the carnival and the city has been an interesting one 
because the carnival has always caused various concerns. And we're known to have the best 
Carnival in the area. People like to come to Cambridge, people won't go to Boston carnival. But 
we can't prevent people from Boston coming here. And if we have bands who are from not here, 
come here, they often bring with them whatever is going on wherever they're from. We have no 
way of protecting us from that either. But we can either have nothing ever, or we can come up 
with some sort of notion that is important as this goes on. Even if it had been confined to 
another area. That came up. Why can't we just go over and do it in the Forest City property, 
where we used to have it, a well contained area. Nope, that couldn't happen either. So it just, it 
just does not taste good. And I wish I had the great recipe going forward because I don't know. I 
stand on the fact that it has never been canceled before anywhere. So why we would be in dire 
concern about future cancellations is...you'd have to explain that to me. I don't have an 
explanation for that. But there are too many large events that go on around the world in New 
York City and wherever else. In the New York Carnival, they have issues all the time, but they 
they don't call it off. They try to build better systems to contain it and make public safety, and I 
do want to make it very clear that I want us all to be safe. But why we are calling our stuff off 
when other things occur and they don't seem to have to be called off. The Mayfair in Harvard 
Square didn't get called off. They said, "well, there's not been any gun violence there". Well, 
they didn't invite it. We didn't invite it. But we are living in a dynamic context so, stuff happens. 
And I hate to conclude so generally, but it does. You yourself Commissioner Bard say you were 
there and then, you know, something spontaneous happened with 20 officers around, whoever 
would imagine that? Certainly not you or I. So, but does that mean we're not going to have 
festivals? Because that could happen?  And so I'll just end for now with that, but I want to thank 
Councillor Zondervan, I didn't know you very well. But coming to you was the most hearing that

we could have had. You understood this issue in the way it should have been understood. 
There's a big cultural underpinning to this and because of where you're from and what you know 
from being there, you know what it is we're talking about. People wait the whole year to, in many 
ways, do their dance at Carnival in a way that just sort of lifts them up for the rest of the year. 
And they miss it! And not everybody is so articulate to come and tell you the many things it 
means, but it means a lot, and this meant a lot. And I want to say to you, Nicola Williams, you 
have done a wonderful job of really shepherding this event. Because you have been with us 
since the beginning, since I asked you would you do it. so I can't thank you enough for your 
efforts. But you took a big hit on this because there were people who believed that you called it 
off, and as I have told you, there's something you will never escape but it doesn't have to be 
true. And I thank you for your efforts in this. And I did run into the City Manager because I 
couldn't not tell him that, you know, when we came back to the council to discuss the issue, how 
come you and the Police Commissioner weren't there? And he did say that maybe the council 
didn't ask them to be here but I don't get that at all. I really just don't get that and I have a lot of 
faith in Cambridge government but this instance here really has woken my eyes and my number 
one went all kinds of new places because I wouldn't stand for this again, I just would not do it 
because this is a real limiting thing that occurred here for reasons that I still don't fully 
understand. So I think that's my few minutes. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you, Mayor Reeves. 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves  
Oh, I wanted to thank also the Our Revolution letter, I thought that was a very thoughtful letter, 
and I thought it spoke to why we're here. Thank you, Henry Wortis. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. And if I can ask the members of the audience to keep your enthusiasm inside, even 
though I understand the sentiment. So, let's hear from the public. We have a few people signed 
up to speak. When I call your name, please to the podium and make sure the microphone is 
turned on. So we'll hear from Nancy Ryan, and you'll have three minutes to speak. 
 
Nancy Ryan  
Thank you, I won't speak anywhere near that amount of time. I just wanted to say that I'm 
speaking formally for the Cambridge Residents Alliance. We've supported this organization, this 
community event in the past. We recognize how deeply important it is, especially in my 
neighborhood, The Port/Area IV, where so many of the Barbadians and other Afro-Caribbean 
people live. Our neighbors and friends were part of that enormous disappointment. So, I'm 
delighted that at least now it's getting an airing and we are committed to helping carry it forward, 
whatever that means. So, thank you all. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you, Nancy. Now we'll hear from Nomadik from Malden. 
 
Nomadik   
Hi, it's Nomadik and I live in Malden. So yes, I would like to speak and just say a few words 
about my experience with Carnival. I've been a long time attendee, and I've been participating 
as a DJ for the last couple of years. And it's been an amazing experience not only as a 
participant, but to actually be behind the scenes. I've been working with Nicola a little bit more 
over the years, and she's like a mentor to me. I am beginning to learn about all the work she 
does, all the tremendous energy and effort she puts in. And so it's much more than just me

being a DJ. It's actually just experiencing as, like I said many years as a participant, the joy I get 
every year looking forward to it just as former Mayor Ken Reeves mentioned, you know, it is the 
carnival where people are like, in the area wants to be at, you know. Cambridge Carnival always 
seemed more family friendly. So, I'm just hoping today we really move forward into 2020 and 
just, you know, just pray for a safer and even better Carnival going forward. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. We will now hear from Owen Howell. 
 
Owen Howell   
Yes, thanks for this opportunity. When I first came to this city in 1973, you know, it was the early 
days of Cambridge, and I used to walk from Central Square to Harvard Square. And that route 
was filled with nightclubs, and, you know, Cambridge has a wealth of diversity that it was this 
uh, you know, just walking from Central Square to Harvard Square at night was like, that was 
my joy. You know, I was in high school, but just doing that made me feel alive. Speaking on the 
carnival, being a carnival committee member, it was always a struggle trying to get resources, 
trying to get stuff with the city, it kind of felt like we were the forbidden child. And it was the city, 
obviously, and to be our opponent rather than help us go forward. Seeing that 2020 is perfect 
vision 2020 vision, I hope that perfect vision will allow us the resources and the time and the 
help to move this Carnival to where we always knew it should be. And that is a real, real high, 
you know, we we don't plan a bad carnival. You know, we aim to bring diversity, talent, things 
that people haven't seen to Cambridge. Hopefully the city will adopt our plans and help us get to 
that stage together. And that's all I want to say. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you so much. Henry Wortis is next. 
 
Henry Wortis   
Thank you for the opportunity. I've submitted a letter, which you either read or have the 
opportunity to read. And I won't repeat what I've said in that letter. But the point I raised is that 
the actions of a city or a civil committee or a school or a school committee, actions by any of 
those bodies are going to be judged. And those institutions, in this country, lie in the history of 
institutional racism. And this has nothing directly to do with the motivation of any individual. It's 
the fact that once institutional racism exists, you've got to consciously break out of it. Otherwise, 
actions easily repeat the same patterns. And I want to add to what I've written, my own belief 
about the standard that we should expect from our institutions and from this city. And this is 
personal, I can't prove that what I'm saying is correct. It comes from some experience that I 
have, working in education, dealing with issues of diversity. And I've come to learn from 
interacting with people about this. So the standard a few years ago, and this is decades ago, in 
dealing or confronting or preventing racism, the cutting edge then was against the most blatant 
forms of outright racism. That was the cutting edge. About 20 years ago, there was a shift. And 
of course, the most blatant forms of racism still exist and at the highest levels even. But the 
cutting edge of the movement against racism, now 20 years ago, shifted to implicit bias. People 
becoming aware of all the things they've internalized, and without even realizing it, just acting 
out, right? Over the last few years, there's been another shift. And that's where I think we're 
going to be challenged, all of us, because now the standard isn't even implicit bias. The 
standard now is that people from the dominant culture, people in the dominant institutions, have 
to be aware, have to become aware, of what will the people most affected by my actions think 
about this? What's their view? Because if you haven't internalized that, as an institution, you 
take the risk, whatever your motive, of repeating again and again, the very actions that have 
harmed people over the years. That's the challenge. Thank you.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Up next is Marilee Meyer. 
 
Marilee Mayer   
I'd love to thank you for your comments. Very, very astute observation. I also am representing 
the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, which is also very much in support of the 
carnival. If we had more cultural events, there'd be more understanding and less fear, this kind 
of interaction, and I've been attending Carnival for since the beginning, I knew Nicola before I 
knew who she was, and for 50 years, my parents, my family has been a host to the British Virgin 
Islands students up here, several who went on to become Attorney General Premier, Head of 
the Conservation and Fisheries, and Climate Change Commissioner. And I have, because of 
my dual cultural indoctrination, I had been in the position of being a liaison, during Carnival, in 
explaining to people on the sidewalk and explaining to neighbors, with my enthusiasm, how 
things work. And there's a lot more acceptance and a way of looking at things because people 
are talking. And so Carnival is a connection to my roots. And I've been to Boston for 15 years 
and there's always some incidents over there. And it's been frustrating to have those individual 
incidents always be associated with the carnival. They are using them as camouflage. And 
Brooklyn hasn't canceled, nobody's canceled. But this is an opportunity to include local 
musicians, etc. And I want you to pay attention to the suggestions that Nicola put up about 
improving the cultural event. As with other situations, communication was lacking. And I would 
like to see the organizers at the table. They had a right to hear, and even see the video 
perhaps. And maybe they did. The organizers need to be pulled in immediately. And if you're 
going if you're going to create a void where there's a lot of confusion, it is up to you, Manager 
and Commissioner, to not only create a teachable moment, but calm the waters. You guys were 
absent at some of these smaller rallies. I was at the church, at the small parade and there were 
no representation from the people who made the decisions. But in any case, you you get my 
point there needs to be more communication. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Lynette Laveau-Saxe is up next. 
 
Lynette Laveau-Saxe   
Hello. It's a privilege for me to be part of this Carnival given that the small group of co founders 
started with three and ballooned out to about 11 of us. Nicola was sent by Mayor Reeves, who 
believed in our vision and sailed with us all the way from 1992 to the parade in 1993. The 
response ability of the artist is to inspire and make a difference. And the carnival provided just 
such a platform for local artists. I've been a longtime resident of Cambridge, for about 50 years. 
And it was a wonderful thing to see how artists embraced the carnival. But over the years, of 
course, people move on, they migrate, they get married, they move away, whatever. So the 
responsibility of the current community is to continually let the public know the origin of the 
carnival, the original one, 185 years ago, that we are now continuing the tradition of celebrating, 
which is the emancipation of slavery. That was the first day of carnival. And if the public doesn't 
know, then, you know, we provide just such a platform for ne'er-do-wells who think that it's, 
someone said that, you know, it's a camouflage they use it as a camouflage to do their dirty 
deeds. So we must hold on to this product, energize it, edify it to newcomers. People who aren't 
understanding that it's a wonderful thing to to be part of because it has value. It allows people to 
release, celebrate. That was the reason why we decided to bring the carnival, because we can 
all celebrate this freedom that we now enjoy as people of color. And also share with other 
people. And I'm sure for people in this room if you've been to the carnival, you do see that. You 
see the effects. But on that first day, many things were happening. People were not only

celebrating, but they were mourning their dead and searching for lost family members. And you 
feel it all. All of that is felt at Carnival. People don't know why they just explode with exuberance. 
But there's a reason. It's like a primordial call for everyone when you are part of the carnival. 
And I'm looking forward to seeing it continue. I was sorry that it had to be interrupted, but that's 
in the past. We are all optimistic here. I thank the City Manager for having faith that this Carnival 
will, again, rise. Thank you, Ken for helping us to give it birth. Thank you Nicola for representing 
City Hall at that time and continuing to do the work. And we're going to make it live again. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Kevin Donaher is up next. 
 
Kevin Donaher   
Sorry, I had a speech to say but most of my points were made better by Ken. So I'll just jump to 
the conclusion: the question is how will we incorporate input from the Caribbean-American 
community to ensure that the mistakes of 2019 are not repeated in 2020.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. James Williamson is next. Thanks so much, James. Three minutes.  
 
James Williamson   
Thanks. James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place in Cambridge. I guess I want to start with a 
little bit of my own experience. I was sitting on a bench behind the reviewing stand in 2017, 
having a conversation with a German who I think was here working temporarily in the biotech 
sector. And for some reason, I think maybe partly because I saw a group of about a dozen 
officers with jackets on the back saying "Metro Gang Unit" or something, real big, bold letters, 
obviously a gang unit, all clustered together in the same location behind the reviewing stand. 
And I started having a conversation, I said, you know, maybe because there had been an 
incident on a previous occasion at the Carnival, and I said, well, you know, things can 
sometimes happen. But by and large, I think it's pretty safe. I think I also did talk about the fact 
that the German national police had fired their weapons in one recent year 70 times and I 
mentioned that Amadou Diallo was shot in New York City 41 times- just one person shot 41 
times- while in all of Germany, the National Police in one year had fired their weapons 70 times. 
At which point, a huge mass of people came running around the corner of the building. The 
German I was sitting next to on the bench took off, and I got down crouch down on to the side of 
the bench. Just to wait and see what was happening. I wasn't going to start running without a 
better idea of what was going on. In a minute, when it sort of settled down, I had an computer, a 
laptop with me and I took it out and I went around the corner and about 30 feet away was the 
spot where I think the initial shooting had taken place. And they hadn't even put up any sort of 
police line or anything. And I started to record and a police officer, while other people walked in 
front of him to, you know, move to a different location. He singled me out and started yelling at 
me that I had to go. And I think it was because I was recording and I think the recording actually 
might have turned out to be useful. In fact, later that afternoon, I talked to a detective who said, 
"could you send me that recording? because it might be useful in terms of assembling 
information about what might have happened here". And I was, to be frank, so upset about the 
way I'd been yelled at, in my feeling totally inappropriately, abusively by this officer, that I just 
said no. I'm not going to go there. And I think that's an example of where unfortunate things 
happen that don't have to happen in the way things get handled. So I did find myself wondering, 
why a gang? Why a gang team of a dozen people all clustered in the same location? In 
retrospect, thinking about this and going to the meeting at the church that has been alluded to 
earlier. I wondered, the specific question that I had about the cancellation, in addition to 
comments that have been made by others was, if there was, in fact, credible evidence that

would lead a prudent person to feel the right thing to do is to cancel the event, why were those 
people not arrested? I just didn't understand if it was credible enough to be like, yes, they're 
definitely going to do something, that you would presumably have enough information to make 
arrests, and that was the one thing that I didn't understand.  Okay. I didn't realize it was three 
minutes. The ordinance says five, but may I have just a brief extension? I think going forward, 
the key thing about this is to do whatever is possible to make this safe. As safe as possible. I 
don't think it's going to be possible to make it perfectly safe. I go to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. 
There are shootings there they happen all the time, quote, unquote, they don't cancel Mardi 
Gras, they don't cancel second lines on Sunday afternoons. I've been there, people have said 
don't go. I've had amazing experiences and yes, shooting sometimes happen. But they can 
happen anywhere and they happen there with a lot more frequency than here. The couple 
things that I would suggest that might help: one is to strengthen the connection to the history of 
the Caribbean community in this city. To elevate that, to integrate that and make that part of 
what this continuing and sustaining a safe Carnival here in Cambridge would be. That it's 
connected with that history that people have referred to. And the other thing is to elevate the 
visibility of when the Commissioner spoke about it having been a family-friendly event, to 
elevate the visibility of it as a family-friendly event. And to stress that. But the chair is getting 
looking impatient and I'll close early. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Andrew Sharpe is next. 
 
Andrew Sharpe   
The Caribbean and the US have been tremendous friends, from the establishment of Alexander 
Hamilton, to Shirley Chisholm. The establishment of the US-Caribbean engagement acts 
speaks on the basis of the Caribbean diaspora importance to the US economic development 
and its cultural diversity. Carnival is one of the most important elements of the Caribbean 
diaspora community throughout the entire United States. And I encourage the council to look at 
the HR 4939 US Caribbean Engagement Act, which explains more the importance of the 
Caribbean diaspora community. And it is important that we continue our cultural heritage, which 
is carnival. And I commend Nicola for your continued support to our Carnival community and 
members of our Caribbean diaspora. And that's my input regards to the carnival: it must 
continue. And we have reached so far that the Caribbean caucus in Washington has 
established this US Caribbean engagement. And it is focused on the importance of the 
Caribbean diaspora. And in the City of Cambridge and in the state of Massachusetts. We have 
to, you know, work, engage, and elevate our diverse community. And the Caribbean community 
ain't going away because we were one of the pillars that really supported the United States. And 
we're America's third border. So we really appreciate you approving the continuation and 
establishing mechanisms, engaging with our community, bringing everyone at the table to see 
how we can move forward to continue Cambridge Carnival because I look forward to attend 
anytime. I'm a Boston resident, but definitely appreciate the work that you guys are doing and 
thanks a lot. Have a good night. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. That concludes the list of people have signed up. Anyone else want to speak, who 
hasn't spoken? All right, seeing none, we'll close public comment. So we'll have a little bit of 
discussion. And again, I want to frame it by focusing on what we do, going forward to make sure 
that the carnival happens in 2020 and beyond. As Mayor Reeves mentioned, I'm myself from 
the Caribbean, from Suriname in South America. I have the great privilege of going home on 
Saturday for a couple of weeks to visit. And when I came to Cambridge in 1992, I wasn't fully 
aware of the Caribbean heritage that exists here. But it must have spoken to me because I felt

at home here, and ended up settling down here. So when the carnival was canceled it impacted 
me as well, personally, as a person of Caribbean heritage, that this event got canceled. And 
when, you know, as the Commissioner said, In 2018, there was a series of meetings and I met 
with the Commissioner and the police, I believe was Superintendent Elow actually, that I met 
with, regarding whether or not we should have the carnival in 2018. And I began to understand 
some of the history and some of the challenges that the carnival has experienced in sustaining 
itself through the years in Cambridge. And in 2019, when it was cancelled, it really became clear 
to me that this is an issue of equity, and an issue of race, even though it again does not reflect 
on any one person who is making decisions. But it's in the context of institutional and historic 
racism, that we come to a place where this important cultural event to an important part of our 
community can be cancelled so easily, when other events are not. And that is an issue of equity. 
And I thank Nicola for her presentation because she really gave us some very specific ways that 
we can remedy some of those inequities. And we can begin to stabilize this event, in the same 
way that we have done for other events that take place in our city every year. This really can 
and should be a signature event for our city that we can be very proud of and that we can 
ensure continues to happen year after year and grows and really speaks to and uplifts the 
Caribbean community. So I really have only one question and I'll open it up to to my colleagues 
if they have other questions. But my question is, knowing what we know now and knowing what 
happened this year, what can we put in place so that if in 2020, we get to the same point where 
we have information that threatens the carnival, can we have a plan that ensures that the event 
can still happen? It can happen in a different way, it can happen in a different place, but can we 
make sure that it can still happen? 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner   
Mr. Chair, yeah, yeah. As I said, the City Manager, the Police Department, we're committed to 
ensuring that we have a family friendly, safe event in 2020. If you want me to say, with 100 
degree, hundred percent certainty that nothing could threaten the carnival, then I can't sit here 
and do that. You know, for instance, if we found a device along the path where the festival was 
supposed to occur, then, you know, in many ways it would be derelict, you know. But absent 
something, you know, to that extreme degree, we will do everything within our power to ensure 
that the carnival is successful, safe, and that it you know, kicks off in 2020. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you, and I certainly appreciate that. And I want to press a little bit on on your example. 
Even in that case, obviously, we couldn't have the event in that place, at that time, given a 
threat like a device that might explode. Can we have a plan that says, in that event, we will have 
the carnival somewhere else at another time, under different circumstances, so that we can 
secure it sufficiently that it can still happen? 
 
Branville Bard, Police Commissioner  
To you and through you, Mr. Chair, that's not unreasonable. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. I appreciate that.  
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager  
I would just say that, absolutely we can have a date. We may need two or three dates, because 
pending the situation and would give us as much flexibility as possible, because we understand 
the importance of this event. So I think having as many backup plans as possible, hopefully we 
don't have to use any of them. But to make sure that whatever we do, I think the problem is if 
the backup dates are too close, often you get the same issue. So I think being realistic to say,

work that out and be happy to see how that works for Nicola and the committee and everybody 
else.

I think we should speak a little to sort of the elephant in the room and that is the breakout of 
violence in public celebrations. Now, for whatever reasons I happened to be in the middle of the 
Detroit riots of 1967. They broke out two blocks from my house, and I was a junior in high 
school. I have seen weeks of unrest, snipers, tanks in the streets. So I really know what can 
happen when there's public bedlam. And in Cambridge, I have seen I have been at Carnival 
when something happened in Kendall and everybody was running, and it's a very difficult feeling 
for me because it reminds me of '67 Detroit. And that's the reason I came to Cambridge is it was 
not like Detroit. So my point is this. I think there is a deeper understanding of what it takes to 
maintain order, but I'm not the police. But I do think this in prior years under prior 
commissioners, particularly under Commissioner Haas, after 9/11 happened and it seemed like 
the government had a lot of surplus riot gear, etc. So suddenly we have in the middle of 
Cambridge Carnival, you know, 50 officers in black with machine guns. And I'm bringing this up 
because you will never convince me that that ever happened at Saint Cosmas and Damian or 
any of it. I mean, that was for us. So we're not here imagining things. There's a history here. 
And it's important as the Police Department does its planning, etc. to really deeply realize that 
there are some things that set off public reaction and you put these people in riot gear in 
August, September, and you get a bunch of revelers with a Caribbean Carnival, many of whom 
are not from the city. It's like asking for a combustion. And I'll give you one more example. And 
this again was during Commissioner Haas. Some Caribbean people on Prospect Street had an 
annual party. And someone called about noise. And the police came and told them to turn down 
the noise. And the police went away and the noise went back up, and someone called again. 
Well, the person whose house it was contacted me to say that the police had now given them a 
ticket for this party, etc. So I said, Well, you know, you want to be able to have a party so I got 
involved with this issue. Spending this moment to say this: the next thing the man told me, he 
says, you know, there were 50 officers in riot gear on the river, in response to this party. And I 
said, Oh, no, that could never be, because given my Detroit instincts, I know that's the recipe for 
disaster. And so Commissioner Haas told me, oh, no, that could not have happened. And I 
continued my research to only find out that it did happen. It was a combination of Cambridge, 
and the MPC police and MIT and Harvard were ready in the event there was something, and 
this was so wrong. So as planning goes on, this is notes from the bridge of civilian, but there 
have been times in my life where I really felt that I was underpaid because some of these just 
needed a match. And it was in complete obliviousness, and maybe the commissioner didn't 
know which is even more concerning. So it's just to point out that this is a city of 110,000 
people. It is not New York City. There must be a way to better engage and also be able to 
contain, without inciting. And that is a lesson I would really want to know that we have learned. 
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager  
Through you, Mr. Chair, can I just respond briefly? So, as I said, just before you got here, I was 
involved in the first one from Manager Healey working with you to make this happen. And I 
really believe we've had a very strong working relationship for all your years as Councillor and 
as Mayor. I think you know how much respect I have for you, and I know how busy you are. But 
in talking to the Commissioner, if you would like to, in any way, shape, or form, be part of

anything in terms of us trying to figure out moving forward, I would take that as a great 
opportunity for us and certainly would welcome you to help play a role. I think the council would 
feel that it's appropriate Nicola as well so I just want to make that as an offer. I think we've 
worked well together in the past, and we'll continue that, but I really want to make sure that that 
offer is out there for you. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. Councillor Carlone? 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Obviously the conversation and comments have been very powerful 
tonight. I thought the presentation was excellent. But I want to focus on something a little 
different. And that's Nicola's presentation, page 21, and a sustainable carnival. So we had a 
problem last time, people were disappointed. And in a way, as Nicola has done, it's sort of a 
recap. All right, where do we go from here? And I can say it without asking the four councillors 
that are here are all big enthusiasts for arts and celebrations. There have been committees 
made, and I think what I'm looking at here on page 21, seems very reasonable. I'm not going to 
ask what we do now because you need to look at that yourself. But it seems to me that the city, 
no matter if we thought it was the right thing, we still owe something to a group of people. And 
we need to look at how can we learn from this. And really invigorate what makes Cambridge 
special on those days. And that's the few celebrations we do. We don't do many. We don't have 
museums. We don't have our own theaters. This is it, really. And so I hope the 
recommendations here and I know the four of us, if not the whole future council, will be looking 
into this. How can we reinforce and remedy at least the planning and the strategy portion at the 
same time that we look at the whole plan for safety. And honestly, I went and re-read this. And 
it's extremely well put together and quite reasonable and it affects a large segment of our 
population and the rest of the city. I enjoy it. You're all going to laugh and that's okay. I was 
invited to be in the parade, not in an outfit. And I felt completely out of place, but I was 
welcomed! I won't do it again, but I was welcomed and and it was fun. I was out of my...it's not 
who I am to dance publicly, but 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves  
You did a good job! 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
Well you were just behind me which also made me feel awkward. But we all, I think everybody 
in this room wants this to work and wants it to be even more special. And maybe, as an 
example, you know, I know the River Festival, I was involved in the beginning. And I know a 
good chunk of money goes into that. And activities. So we don't have that many and we should 
make the most of it, but I'm saying what everybody here knows. Thank you, Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you. Councillor Siddiqui? 
 
Councillor Sumbul Siddiqui  
Thank you, Mr. Chair, through you. I want to echo Councillor Carlone's comments on this. 
Thank you to the members of the public comment who came and spoke. And thank you to 
Councillor Zondervan for being the lead on these important conversations. I think former 
Mayor/Councillor Reeves is right in that when this did happen, I think there was a failure of 
leadership on making sure that the community knew exactly what was going on. And I think 
something the city has to always do a better job as of is over communicating. And I think we

think we communicate, but that doesn't happen. And so I think this was a lesson learned. It 
happened. Even that meeting, making folks come back, you know, that type of stuff, that was 
not the right thing to do. And so that's noted, and I'm sorry to you, I'm sorry to the Carnival and, 
you know, I think we need to accept responsibility for that, and then think about, as Councillor 
Zondervan has said, what do we do now moving forward in making this event as amazing as it 
can be? And how do we really think about how do we empower the Caribbean community in 
general? I think there's so much more work to be done. And I'm committed. I know my 
colleagues are committed. So I look forward to working together on that.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan  
Thank you Councillor. Councillor Mallon? 
 
Councillor Alanna Mallon  
Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm not a member of this committee so thank you for allowing me the time 
and space to speak. I also want to thank Councillor Zondervan for putting this meeting together. 
I do, back to former Mayor Reeves comment, feel like it should have been held a long time ago 
and I'll take responsibility for that along with my colleagues. You know, city council meetings 
aren't the forum to have conversations, especially ones as important as this. So I think this is 
the right meeting. It just happened at the wrong time. So, I want to apologize to you and to the 
members of the public who are feeling not heard by their city leadership. So, and I also will say, 
I have been thinking a lot about this actually, in, you know, in terms of arts and culture here in 
Cambridge and the lack of celebrations. This is very high stakes, right, because this is the 
celebration. This is the event for the Afro-Caribbean community. And when it gets canceled, 
boy, that's it, right? A whole year goes by. So I will say looking forward, I like the idea of having 
the smaller taste of Caribbean events. Could there be more events that could make it feel like 
high stakes, while at the same time be preparing for having this event annually? And then, in 
terms of one of the things that you mentioned here is securing a Caribbean Cultural Center and 
something that Councillor Carlone said around we don't have museums here. We do have a 
museum in Central Square, the MIT Museum, and it's going away. I don't know what MIT's 
plans for the first floor of that building. It's right here in the cultural district. We've been thinking a 
lot about how do we bring more arts and culture into the Cultural District to make sure that it 
isn't...all the arts and culture don't just leave Central Square and we say, jeez, isn't that too bad? 
So is there a way to be intentional around that space here in Central Square to really think 
about a Caribbean Cultural Center to again, add on that layer of this isn't just this one thing. So I 
guess that's that's all I'll say except, you know, I am, of course supportive of trying to figure out 
how to continue to hold this while at the same time really being aware and cognizant that, you 
know, public safety is a real thing. Public safety is something that we all really care about, 
obviously, and I know our Police Commissioner really cares about it. And I know, like, just 
looking at this number $172,000 for public safety for 2018. That's, that's quite a, quite a jump 
from $40,000. So I know that there's a commitment on the city side and on the police side to 
make sure that this event happens and it happens safely. I guess the last thing I'll say is I am 
thinking a lot about what Mayor Reeves said around the riot gear and what kind of visual and 
optics that presents. I have been thinking about that actually a lot lately, in terms of how that 
presents to the community. And what that relationship between the police and and festival 
goers...how that interplay is and to carefully, really think about that so I'm supportive of how 
we're going to move forward here. I thank you again for allowing me to speak and being present 
tonight. And thank you to Nicola for really bringing this event forward every single year. I know 
it's a lot of work. So I look forward to working with you in the future. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Councillor Mallon. Mayor Reeves?

Former Mayor Ken Reeves   
The comment of Councillor Carlone, and I meant to thank you for your prior participation and 
current because I think you have turned up twice. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone   
It was very forgettable! 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves   
It was good and he brought his Hawaiian shirt so he was in the spirit. I'm from the tradition 
where you take lemons and you make lemonade. So I want to refer to page 21 along with 
Councillor Carlone and just say, now if Cambridge really want to get into the carnival business, 
it turns out that in Canada, they understand this much better. So in Toronto, they have 
something called Caribana. And the provincial government gives Caribana $400,000 a year, 
because the number of people who come at that time, food sold, etc, is economic development 
too! So then, Montreal, they came up with their $400,000. In America, there's another idea that 
we couldn't possibly use public money in these ways. And Canada has some interesting cultural 
challenges, so they know how to put a little something to see if we can make things better. So I 
would hope, and Nicola has argued, that she has spent so much time telling me about how the 
city should embrace this as its own, because it's such a rich thing and I'm thinking to myself, or 
thinking to her, Nicola, they are not trying to own Carnival. But there is a point of view that could 
be mutually beneficial, which is evidenced by these kinds of supports. Now, I will say this to you, 
as somebody who's involved in Margaret Fuller. And I went on that board because I was asked 
to, I did not want to be on the board. But now I feel I'm a part of running an operation because 
our biggest problem is we don't have money. And to see East End House get tied to a $9 million 
dollar deal, it got my attention because these community institutions, nobody is giving away 
money. But we still expect them to exist. So I really think the council, and it would take several 
of you to with Councillor Carlone to say, well, you know, why don't we ask the Carnival people 
to pitch this in even greater detail, or, you know, bring in one of these steel bands so people can 
get to see how this works. And the steel band culture is a magnificent thing. And there are 
whole places in this country where it is a great deployment of youth, because you teach them to 
play these steel drums and have a curriculum and they compete, they travel, it is one of the 
things you want young people to be doing. So I think you've bought something of great value 
here, other than let's don't cancel again. Maybe we should build in some more support to make 
our Carnival even greater. 
 
Louie DePasquale, City Manager   
Hey, Mr. Chair, Can I just follow up with that? I think it's an important point. So you made a good 
point about government and financing and all of that. And, you know, one of the things we've 
been able to do with the Taste of Carnival is because it's in the Cultural District, its at a lot lower 
number, but be able to come up with some finances that's allowed us to really help support the 
event. I think at this larger amount, we're gonna have to really revisit the whole structure of the 
thing because it would probably almost have to be a City of Cambridge event. And that doesn't 
mean we shouldn't but it would mean we'd have a long conversation. But I do think the key is 
that in a smaller event, we were able to really be creative in the Taste of the Carnival. But I think 
to make this a reality, it's going to take some time, it's going to take a lot of meetings and a lot of 
discussion and I would be happy to have David Kale be a point person on my side to figure out 
what we can and can't do and working with the council and Nicola to see, you know, what role 
we can play as we have in the Taste of the Carnival, which I think has been a really good 
success. It's a lot smaller event, but trying to think about, can we tie it to the BID district? Can

we tie it to Central Square? But again, these are not overnight decisions. But we're, I'm hearing 
you. 
 
Nicola Williams   
I just want to mention too that Michael Monestime said that the Central Square BID, because 
he's aware of this plan, can help. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you both. And I had the brief pleasure of being part of the steel band effort, and it was 
quite remarkable to see the way the kids respond and get interested in in the music and the 
culture behind it. And I do want to thank the City Manager and the Commissioner, I know this 
has been a challenging conversation. I know it was a difficult decision. And we felt the impact in 
the community. And, you know, as Mayor Reeves said, we didn't fully hear what was being said. 
And so it took a while to get there. But I think the City Manager has been working with the 
Carnival Committee to address the immediate concerns around cancellation. And, we did plan 
to have this meeting sooner, but unfortunately, we had a death in the family and so that delayed 
it a bit. But I am glad that we were able to come together this evening and at least begin to look 
forward to 2020 and beyond. So thank you all for being here and for participating in that effort. 
 
So I will put forward a motion and I will read it, and then I am of course open to 
suggestions for how to amend it and make it stronger. That the City Manager work with 
the Carnival Committee to enhance the Cambridge Carnival event, allocate the necessary 
funds, and develop a comprehensive public safety plan, including contingency plans so 
that the event can take place in a secure time and place, even in the presence of 
significant threats that can be anticipated.   
 
So on the motion, all in favor?  
 
All right. Thank you all. Happy holidays. Happy New Year. 
 
Former Mayor Ken Reeves  
Thank you. Thank you.

December 18, 2019 
 
To the Members of Cambridge City Council, 
 
The City of Cambridge cancelled the 2019 Caribbean Carnival at the last minute without 
consulting the organizers of the Carnival, its vendors, artists and other participants, including the 
Cambridge community. The Carnival is a well-established major contributor to Cambridge’s 
celebration of its Caribbean-American heritage. When sponsoring events, the City must take 
responsibility for including people and groups who belong to the cultures being celebrated as 
they bring great experience and knowledge to planning and implementation.  
 
The failure to include the Carnival’s organizers and participants in discussions about potential 
threats to public safety, was disrespectful of the community of people who have been 
successfully organizing the Caribbean Carnival for almost 30 years.   
 
In America today, institutional racism is still dominant.  Institutional racism, a phrase coined by 
Stokely Carmichael, was fully defined in The Lawrence Report for the United Kingdom as, "The 
collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people 
because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, 
attitudes and behaviour which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, 
thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people."  When the 
City acts in a way that is consistent with the historic pattern of institutional racism, we can 
conclude that the pattern is continuing.   Breaking the pattern takes conscious effort. 
 
We support the future success of this treasured celebration of Caribbean-American heritage in 
2020 and beyond.

On behalf of Our Revolution-Cambridge

HISTORY OF CAMBRIDGE CARNIVAL
INTERNATIONAL- FESTIVAL FOOTPRINT

• For the first 10 years or so, the date of the Carnival was held on the second week in August, 

we used our rain date of the day after Boston Carnival. 

• The Committee decided to keep that date for 2 reasons: fresh costumes and attracted more 

people

• The festival grew tremendously since the date change and we were bursting at the seams.  The 

Committee also wanted to plan for the growth of the festival and work with the City to 
proactively develop a safety plan 

• In 2005, in collaboration with the City and organized by residents, we held our first Carnival 
Community Forum to discuss the expansion and challenges with the growth of the event.  

• The outcome of the meeting resulted in a new location of Kendall Square accompanied by a 

parade route that began on Sidney Street

• In 2008, based on community feedback and input (especially from seniors), we worked with 

City to reclaim our old route starting from the River Street

CARNIVAL OPERATIONS

• Planning Committee consists of mainly volunteer residents:

Everton Daniel, Drucilla Edwards, Rocky Jeanty, Owen Howell, Kathy King, Ellis 
Mendes, Gregory O’Bannon, Wayne Robinson, Maxine Samuels, Natalie Syrion, 
Nicola Williams

• Funding mostly comes from vendors, a little from sponsors.  The City 
covers services relating to public safety such as police, fire, and traffic

• We are seriously under-resourced. Our ideal festival budget is $150,000.  

We heavily rely on volunteers, interns, and in-kind planning services.

• All our performers receive honorariums that are less than what the 

Cambridge Riverfest and other festivals offer

CULTURAL PRESERVATION

• In order to preserve the legacy and cultural contributions of the 

Caribbean community in Cambridge, we need a Caribbean 
Cultural Center which offers a permanent home to house our 
programs, including the Cambridge Youth Steel Orchestra and 
costume camps. This center will provide the following:

– A functional space for performances: music, dance, and other art forms 

focusing on the Caribbean and African Diaspora

– Storage for our Steel Pans (valued at $20,000)

– Community workshops 

– A meeting space for low cost rentals for artists and for rehearsals

The Health and Environment Committee will meet on January 22, 2020 at 2:30 PM to discuss the 
recommendation from the Urban Forest Master Plan Taskforce and outline potential amendment 
to the Tree Protection Ordinance, including an extension of the current moratorium. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Welcome everyone, we're going to get started. I will read the call to the meeting: The Health 
and Environment Committee will meet on January 22 to discuss the recommendation from the 
Urban Forest Master Plan Taskforce and outline potential amendment to the tree protection 
ordinance, including an extension of the current moratorium. So, we have the policy order that 
was referred by the Council a week and a half ago, that includes an extension of the 
moratorium. And then we'll also hear a little bit from the Department of Public Works about the 
Urban Forest Master Plan Task Force process and the recommendations that came out from 
that. And the plan is to forward the moratorium extension back to the Council for a vote on that, 
and then we'll have follow up meetings of this committee to further dig into the Urban Forest 
Master Plan Task Force recommendations. So with that, I'd like to welcome my colleagues and 
the staff and the public, thank you for being here. And I'm joined by fellow committee members 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler and Councillor Nolan, and the Department of Public Works. So 
with that, I'll hand it over to you. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
Thank you. Since this is my first committee meeting of this body, what is the general process, 
and I assume we'll hear from the public? Just how will it unfold and what's the order of business 
just so that I can understand? Maybe I should know that already, but I don't. So I would 
appreciate some forgiveness for me, ensuring that I understand the process as we move 
forward. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Yes, thank you, Councillor Nolan for asking and my apologies for not explaining that better. So 
the rough agenda for this meeting is that we'll hear from Department of Public Works, we'll ask a 
few clarifying questions only, we won't have any debates. Then we'll hear from the public. And 
then we'll come back to the committee for further discussion and final actions.Thank you.

DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Chair, perhaps I should introduce the other members of DPW 
staff that are here today. So to my left, Catherine Daly Woodbury, Catherine was the project 
manager associated with the Urban Forestry Master Plan, which is still ongoing. And then I've 
Andrew Putnam. Andrew is the Superintendent of Urban Forestry at the Department of Public 
Works. On the desk behind, John Nardone. John is the Deputy Commissioner of the 
Department of Public Works. David Lefcourt. David is the City Arborist. And then we have Abby 
Bentley. Abby has just recently come on board, and Abby is the Assistant City Arborist with the 
Department of Public Works. And so I think that's us in terms of the Department of Public Works 
at this point in time. So we have a presentation that we will go through in a few minutes, but 
perhaps for the benefit of the new Councillors, it might be worthwhile providing some context 
associated with how we got to where we are at this point in time. Perhaps the best place to start 
is back in 2009, when UVM working with the city conducted a LiDAR flyover of the city. In other 
words, a remote sensing of the city's canopy at that point in time, and estimated that about the 
30% of the city had tree canopy at that point in time. They then did a similar flyover or the 
similar flyover was conducted in 2014 and they conducted an analysis after that, and indicated 
that in terms of the overall area of the city, that the canopy had been reduced by 2%, or specific 
to the actual canopy that had been there in 2009, was equivalent to about 7.8% loss in canopy 
between 2009 and 2014. They then conducted another study on the basis of a flyover that was 
conducted in April of 2018. On this occasion, the canopy was indicated to be just less than 26%. 
So, a further reduction in the canopy scale. And again, equivalent to about 17.8% reduction in 
canopy between 2009 and 2018. At this point in time, 17.8% specific to the canopy that existed 
in 2009. Going back, you know, I think City Council became concerned about this in 2016. 
There were there was a hearing held in 2016. The primary focus at that point in time was on 
what was the city doing in terms of its own design standards, its own practices in terms of 
maintaining the canopy that is by ordinance required to manage in the city. And so there was a 
significant focus on our practices in terms of planting and maintaining our trees and indeed, the 
processes associated with the taking down of public shade trees in accordance with chapter 87 
of state law. Then as time moved along, I think there was an increased understanding that a lot 
of trees that we're losing were not on the public right-of-way. And so I think people became 
more concerned about that. And in early 2018, there were hearings about setting up a task force 
to begin to look at this. And so we hired a consultant team, Reed Hildebrand early in 2018. And 
a task force was brought together, consisting of 18 people from different parts of the community. 
I think one of the more significant issues that emerged from those early meetings associated 
with the task force was the fact that a significant amount of the canopy was being lost on 
residential property. In fact, the vast majority of canopy loss was on private property. There's 
loss across all land uses in the city, but a significant amount of it was on private property. And 
the most significant of all was on residential private property. In early 2019, there was a hearing 
that was held at the Health and Environment Committee, where there was a proposal to institute 
an amendment to the existing Tree Protection Ordinance to impact the taking down of trees on 
private property. Previous to this, the Tree Protection Ordinance which was ordained initially in 
2005, spoke specifically to development projects: large special private projects and projects in 
excess of 25,000 square feet. And so the request was to extend that to cover all properties. And 
specifically what it came to mean in terms of this passage was that no permits would be issued 
to anyone in the city outside those associated with special permits and large projects unless the 
tree was dead or dangerous, unless there was significant emergency (and we can get into the 
details of what that meant). Utility projects, there were projects associated with other 
environmental concerns, or indeed if there was an instance where a structure might be 
impacted. So over a period of I would say maybe a month and a half, it was a relatively short 
period of time, we came back to City Council with an amendment to the Tree Protection 
Ordinance together with a body of regulations. And so those have been in effect for about the

last 11 months. Those will sunset on February 25 of this year. And so I guess one of the things 
that you have to make a determination about is whether or not that should extend. In terms of 
the Urban Forestry Master Plan and Task Force, you know, we have in front of us here and I 
think there's a copy online and we give you hard copies of this. This is a 280 page Urban 
Forestry Master Plan Technical Report. It is online. There is another 750 pages of this 
document in appendices. I would say this is an extraordinarily comprehensive report. It took a 
lot longer for us to complete it than we initially thought, but I think at the outset we said this is 
going to be a data-driven science-based community engagement project. And I think this 
document is true to that, in that there is an enormous amount of data analysis incorporated in 
this. I think the recommendations that are provided for in this as well, are science-based and 
also come out of a lot of the interactions that were had, both with the task force and with the 
community through three community meetings.  We met on 12 occasions with the task force. I 
think everybody in the task force was hugely committed and extraordinarily knowledgeable. And 
like I said, represented all elements of the community. I think given the scope of this project, my 
sense is that we brought this back to the task force in early December, for their consideration in 
terms of prioritizing some aspects of this in terms of policy and practice and design and so forth. 
Quite truthfully, I think it may have been too early for us to actually glean everything that we 
could glean from the task force at that point in time. And, it very much depends on the will of the 
City Council but our wish would be that we could go back to the Task Force for one additional 
meeting, so as to be able to further filter through all of those aspects of this associated with 
permitting specifically that the task force fields are most important, and put those in front of you. 
And we would do that in early February, again, with the blessing of City Council. We would not 
do this unless we had the blessing of City Council to do it. And I do think that if indeed we can 
move this reasonably rapidly through the task force again, you know, last year it took us maybe 
I would say, four or five weeks to actually amend the existing ordinance and put an amendment 
together. We'd certainly commit to being as quick as we possibly can and putting changes to the 
existing ordinances together so that we could have something in place for late spring, early 
summer. I recognize that we had committed to get this done earlier than we ultimately got it 
done. But I think it's not because we slowed down and didn't commit resources to it. I think quite 
the opposite. I think we committed a lot lot more than we ever anticipated committing to this, 
and so I would ask for some latitude in terms of your sense as to us being late with regard to 
this document. Also, in terms of extending the existing amendment, I would, I think we would be 
in favor of an extension of the existing amendment. I don't think it would necessarily need to be 
extended for a long period of time, but I think given the commitment that the community and the 
task force have given to this, and also your instruction to us last year with the amendment that 
was excuses, it's important that we'd be able to report back to you in terms of recommendations 
in the not too distant future. And again, that would be our commitment that we will try and get a 
recommendation back to you sooner rather than later. So with that, perhaps we should get into 
a little bit more detailed presentation. And then could ask Catherine and Andrew to help me go 
through this. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Owen. 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
Okay, so we'll just talk a little bit about the amendment for a second. And again, what it did was, 
it basically said that specific to tree removal on properties not associated with special permits or 
large projects, people would be required to get permits from the Department of Public Works if 
they expected to take down trees on those properties. However, for a period of one year, we 
would not issue permits unless a tree was either dead or dangerous, or there was an 
emergency circumstance (and we describe that in more detail in the regulations), where a

significant utility project was be undertaken with state or federal regulations or programs 
associated with it, city park projects where there were, again community engagement in 
advance of that, or in instances where the canopy would benefit from the removal of a number 
of trees so that perhaps native trees would grow that much more healthier. And then instances 
where a tree would impact a structure. And again this is all associated with significant trees. 
Significant trees were defined as trees that have DBH in excess of eight inches. And so that 
was ordained in February of last year, and became effective on March 11 of last year. And 
again, this goes to again significant trees over eight inches in DBH. Again, a one year restriction 
for significant tree removal with exception of those instances that I've already spelled out to you. 
And then there were specific mitigations put in place for people who had residential tax 
exemptions in the city. So for people who had residential tax exemptions, the mitigation fee that 
they would have to pay, if indeed they felt that they had to remove a tree without a permit, would 
be 10% of the replacement cost, as determined by the existing City of Cambridge contract. The 
existing contracts in the city, when we purchase a two inch tree, we pay $1700 dollars for that 
tree. And so we basically said it is $850 per inch you would have to pay the city, and that money 
will go into a tree fund. But if you're a resident with a residential exemption, you would only have 
to pay 10% of the cost. And if you are someone who is receiving financial assistance, federal 
financial assistance, there would be no cost for you in that instance. And then for all others, you 
would have to pay full replacement costs associated with that tree. And so its been in existence 
for the past year. Immediately before it became effective, we sent out a postcard to every 
resident in the city. And this is a copy of that postcard and again, just going through the same 
details. And I think this was effective. We also obviously used social media. We contacted all 
the landscapers in the area, all of the arborists in the area. And so our feeling was that, you 
know, we sent this out to 41,000 households at a significant cost to the city. But we felt that we 
had done a good amount of outreach before this became effective. And quite frankly, I don't 
think that we have had many instances where people were ignorant in terms of what happened 
in terms of the ordinance changes after this point in time. Again, the existing amendment 
terminates the 25th of February 2020. And I know that there's a proposal to extend that for the 
full of this year at this point in time. That was proposed at last City Council meeting. So just 
specific to the requirements associated with this, I know there's been some concern in the 
community about how onerous this is. We require, if you're going to take a tree down, we 
require an arborist to certify that the tree is dead or dangerous. That means there is a 
certification that they have to sign. They also have to complete an ISA tree risk assessment 
relative to that tree. For emergency circumstances we need those described by the property 
owner, and in terms of utility projects, we have to describe in detail as to what's required in that 
instances. I know that there's been some concern in the community about the cost of bringing 
an arborist on-site. And we can talk a little bit more about that as we move through today's 
conversation. Andrew, do you want to talk a little bit about the permits that we've received and 
so on? 
 
Andrew Putnam, Superintendent of Urban Forestry and Landscape   
So we took the time to go through all of the permit applications and flush out multiple 
applications that were either applied for under the wrong category or rejected because either 
they didn't meet the requirements or the application was incomplete. And so spending that time, 
we found that there's been a grand total of 347 permits issued out of 366, meaning that 19 were 
denied and you can see sort of the breakdown where dead or dangerous are about 76% of the 
approved applications, and for emergency circumstances 2%. City park projects make up about 
10%. The healthy canopy 6%. Poses significant negative impact on an adjacent structure is 3%, 
and significant utility infrastructure projects is about 3%. And then the reasons that most of them 
were denied was because the application was incomplete so either we didn't have, from our 
administrative point of view, all of the necessary documentation required to approve the permit,

and then the applicant never followed up with us or just simply did not meet the category 
requirements, and so it was rejected, which is 37%. And did not reapply as they were in the 
incorrect category and then never followed up. Typically that is if we have a discussion with 
either the arborist or the homeowner and sort of describe the parameters for getting approved 
for a permit and they realize that their tree doesn't actually qualify so then they don't follow up 
with a permit. And this is just sort of anecdotal community feedback from residents, whether it's 
through talking to them on the phone or other people. So the majority of residents do 
understand that Cambridge is trying to protect trees through this ordinance, and some of the 
other additional pros are that residents and property owners are learning that pruning for 
clearance along their buildings can be an appropriate alternative to removals. I've heard of a 
few different circumstances where construction has been redesigned or additions have been 
changed to preserve trees that didn't qualify for a removal permit. There's also a couple 
instances where it sparked discussions among neighbors about tree preservation. A new 
property owner had bought a piece of property and was going to pave a backyard, and through 
the neighbors reaching out to see if this tree qualified for a permit it started a discussion with the 
new property owner who then changed that design layout to actually preserve that tree. And 
then also, we'll get into it a little bit more on the next slide, but practicing arborists working within 
the city are fairly supportive of the amendment. Some cons that we've heard, the primary one so 
far is that the current amendment does not allow for replanting to offset mitigation. So even if a 
plan were to replace more caliper DBH inches than the tree that's coming down in the final step, 
there is no language that allows for a permit to be issued under that they would still have to pay 
the mitigation through the payment through a fine. There is no protection for tree roots or 
aggressive pruning under the current amendment, so in theory, an abutting property owner 
could do a significant amount of damage to tree roots that would eventually lead to killing a tree. 
Same with aggressive pruning, that's some feedback we've had from abutting property owners 
and residents in the city. There is no language that allows for the removal of invasive species, or 
species perceived as to be invasive. So it's a blanket application and it just refers to the canopy 
and trees and not specific species. Some feedback also is the cost of the arborist assessment 
specifically in regards to having a dead tree removed and an arborist coming out to make that 
determination. And then just some other anecdotal phone conversations, somewhat short 
conversations with people who said that well, I will just wait until it sunsets and then we'll 
proceed with the removals that we have planned. And then we spoke with some practicing 
arborists in the area to kind of get an idea of what a range of prices may be for a resident in the 
city to apply for a permit. And we found that the range of tree care companies could charge 
between $250 to $300 to do a site visit and the online permit application. The residents 
themselves can apply for the permit on their own, they just need the documentation from the 
certified arborist. A consulting arborist can charge $600 to $800 per tree and will adjust their 
price accordingly if it's a multiple tree assessment on the property, Some tree care companies 
charge $50 to $150 to visit a site to notify the property if it even would meet the requirements 
from first glance. So if they come on the property, they'll come on the property for $50 to $150 to 
say, yes, a tree is dead, I'll fill out a permit and it will most likely be approved because it is dead. 
And then if that's the case, they'll charge the remaining balance, which on average was that 
$250 to $300. So that just sort of illustrates that that the range $50 to $150 for that first 
determination, is the tree dead or dangerous and will it actually get approved for a permit in the 
arborist's professional opinion. And again, this was sort of covered in the previous slide but 
most residents understand why the city has enacted the tree ordinance. And after the practicing 
arborist explain that reasoning to them, some still obviously complain about the amendment for 
different reasons. And some say they'll wait until the ordinance expires.

Okay, so just back to the Urban Forestry Master Plan and the task force. And so the task force 
started meeting in June of last year. The first meeting was in June 2018, a year and a half ago I 
beg your pardon. And there were 18 taskforce members, again, representing different 
communities in the city: institutional members, members from different neighborhoods, people 
of different backgrounds, race, and so on and so forth. And we felt that we had a really strong, 
knowledgeable group of people who were very committed to working with us on this. Again, they 
met 12 times during 2018 and 2019, and provided a lot of input to the consultant team. And 
again, a very large consultant team, given the fact that there was a lot of analysis that was done 
by arborists, soil scientists, landscape architects, engineers, and so on. And I think, you know, 
the interaction of the task force with the team significantly shaped this report and I think 
something that they should be very, very proud of in terms of what has been born as a result of 
that effort. Again, we also had three public meetings, there was a Health and Environment 
Committee presentation that was made in November of last year. Together with a presentation 
that was made before CPAC earlier this year. In terms of just some of the strategies associated 
with curbing loss and growing the canopy, in chapter four of this document, it goes through that 
in great detail. And we're happy to spend time talking about that perhaps at a subsequent 
meeting, because I do think that there's a lot that can be discussed associated with various 
strategies here. But just in summary, again, there are 19 policy strategies, a lot of those 
associated with ordinances. There are design and practice strategies that we at the Department 
of Public Works will certainly look to incorporate in much of what we do. And then I think one of 
the areas that we feel very strongly about addressing moving forward is outreach and 
education. And I think we'd also say public engagement. It's our expectation in terms of 
community outreach, that we would meet with different communities in the city over the next 
year and work with a consultant team so as to allow people to understand in more detail, the 
appropriate trees to grow in the city, the value of trees in terms of clean air, clean water, carbon 
sequestration, and so on, so forth. And just to increase the prominence of trees in terms of 
urban infrastructure in the city and their importance as we move into a period where climate 
change is going to become a more significant and difficult reality for us. And so, again, we'll be 
more than happy to talk to these at a subsequent meeting. I want to have our consultants 
necessary for those if that's what is necessary. I think one of the challenges for us moving 
forward, and for the City Council, in terms of discouraging tree removals is that can act against 
encouraging planting subsequent to that. And so trying to make sure that we balance our 
strategy so that we encourage people to plant more trees, while at the same time trying to 
protect the existing canopy is something that is a real challenge to grapple with. And I think one 
of the errors that we made last year, quite frankly, in the amendment that was ultimately voted 
on was that for those people who are taking down trees in their property, we did not allow them 
mitigate that loss with the planting of new trees and that's something certainly we've taken to 
heart over the last year. We recognize that a tree canopy is a cyclical thing, tree canopies 
decrease and then go back up again because it's just the nature of tree loss and growth and so 
on. And so we want to encourage, where possible, for further tree planting. Even if it's not on 
the person's in their on their private property, maybe it's in their neighbor's private property. We 
are committed to increasing the extent to which we're planting trees and taking care of trees in 
the city. And that will continue to grow over the next number of years. It's challenging for us, as 
a Department of Public Works and indeed as a city, to legislate for people planting on their 
property. We recognize that and so that's where outreach and education and perhaps other 
financial mechanisms are appropriate so as to provide for that. And that's something that we 
again, we'd like to talk about a trust at sometime in the future that could provide private finances 
toward planting on private property. There is an allowance in Chapter 87 at this point in time of 
the state law that provides for the city planting on private property within 20 feet of the public 
right-of-way. However, if someone wants to take that tree down subsequent to it being planted, 
they are subject to a public tree hearing, so that serves to discourage people as well. But again,

I think there are other ways to tackle this as we move forward. And again, these are some of the 
more significant strategies. I think a significant tree up now has been defined as 8 inches DBH 
or larger. I think for most communities within the immediate area and across the country, six 
inches is generally the standard there and I think it's worthwhile having a look at that. We can 
provide you more data in terms of the number of trees that one would then immediately have 
under the jurisdiction of an amendment that that changed from an 8 to a 6 inch DBH. Again, we 
want to strengthen the Back of the Sidewalk problem, perhaps not using city funds, but perhaps 
using private funds or perhaps using mitigation funds in a different way. Again, to the same 
effect, using community grants to encourage people to plant trees in their property. Using 
nonprofits in the city that perhaps could work with us to to encourage that. We want to again 
review the mitigation costs, because I do think that residential neighbors feel that it's punitive. 
I'm not sure we fully agree with that but I do think there's a conversation that should be had 
there. Again, I think it's a benefit that the Tree Protection Ordinance extends to all properties, 
not just to large development but rather to residential properties, given the fact that a significant 
majority of our trees are on private property and a significant amount of the loss over the last 10 
years has been on residential property. And then I think one of, you know, again, we've 
increased our staff over the last couple of years. And we recognize that there's more rigor 
required in terms of inspecting the large development. They commit to planting trees and so on, 
then we go out and we inspect that prior to Certificates of Occupancy being issued for those 
projects. And that's something that we're committed to doing as well, if indeed it is the will of 
City Council that be incorporated in a subsequent ordinance. And again, this is just further 
exemplifying that.  I think our expectation is obviously we will always provide for dead or 
dangerous trees be removed. The arborist evaluation can be reduced somewhat for a dead 
tree. We at this point in time require people to complete an ISA assessment, which provides 
rigor, but if a tree is dead, perhaps that's not necessary and so we can reduce that and reduce 
the cost to the homeowner on that basis. We do want to have a permit on file. Again, we set up 
an electronic system of permitting last year. We think that's been successful. I think there was 
some problems at the outset for our arborists, but they've all become used to that over the last 
five or six months. And so that doesn't seem to be a problem. And, again, the idea of perhaps a 
replacement tree being offered to a neighbor who takes the tree down is something that's worth 
considering. There are anti-aid issues that we need to work out with our Law Department 
around this issue, but we're in conversation with them as well about that. And again, just 
removal strategies, like I said, if you can't remove it on your own property, perhaps you can 
plant it on a neighbor's property who would like to have a tree. That's something that we would 
certainly be open to. The idea of a replacement tree is something that we would also be open 
to. And again, not all trees need to be treated equally. Maybe perhaps we need special 
protections for larger trees, for exceptional trees in the city. And something that I think it's worth 
thinking about: a 30 inch tree with a large canopy, it's equivalent to eight smaller trees. And so 
you lose one of those larger trees, it has a profound impact on the canopy and indeed in the 
neighborhood potentially. And again, this is just a further exemplify that. And then again, from 
our perspective, it's just a question of, it was a sensitivity in terms of process, you know, we can 
have a simple process or a complex process, I think we'd like to start with something that's 
relatively simple. You know, we have been discussing all of these various strategies with the 
Urban Forestry Master Plan Task Force. I think in terms of making this understandable to the 
residential community, it needs to be relatively straightforward. I think the other thing that should 
be noted that there's a difference between replacement cost and the inherent value of a tree. 
You know, if I look at the inherent value of a tree, for example, we lost a tree on Gore Street 
maybe a year and a half ago when the gas company took down that tree. That tree's value was 
something in the order of $60,000. That's the inherent value of the tree. When we talk about 
replacement costs, as of now, we're not talking about that cost, we lose that value and so some 
level of replacement mitigation as it should be required, but it doesn't equate to the inherent

value of that tree. And again, this is the balance of trying to encourage planting and discourage 
removal and how do we continue to achieve that balance? I think that's about it for us for the 
moment. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you very much. I do want to welcome some colleagues who have joined us, Mayor 
Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and committee member, Councillor McGovern. I do want to thank 
DPW as well. I know this amendment process has been a little bit arduous and was executed 
quite rapidly. And I think it's been very successful considering the short time frame that we had 
to implement it. And thank you again for this presentation and for the update on how it's been 
working in our community so far. So at this point, I'll open it up to my colleagues for clarifying 
questions only. We're not discussing or debating yet we're just asking any questions of the staff 
about their presentation. Councillor Nolan? 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
This is just clarifying questions, right? Not discussion. Okay. So I wanted to make sure that I 
understood the chart. The 366 applications, only 5% of people who applied to take down a tree 
were denied a permit and most of them were denied simply because they didn't complete the 
application. Is that correct? That's the entire universe of people during the time of this 
moratorium, who applied was the 366. And only 5% of them were denied. And most of that 5% 
was just they didn't complete the application. Just want to make sure we're clear on that, 
because it looks like pretty much nobody was denied who completed a full application. 
 
Andrew Putnam, Superintendent of Urban Forestry and Landscape   
Yeah, that percentage is correct. And then it's about 60% were incomplete application, and then 
almost 40% were just didn't meet the requirements. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon   
And that's only 5% of the whole applications. Correct. Okay. Then the other question, at the 
end, when you talk about all the suggestions for an eventual ordinance, that's not for immediate 
adoption that would be for when the ordinance is rewritten over the course of the next, as you 
said it could be expedited, maybe four to six weeks, but that it would be during that expedited 
process that's the kind of thing you see yourself building on, the Urban Forestry Master Plan, to 
be included in the new ordinance. Okay. 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
Yes, that's correct Councillor. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Just to follow on on that, I believe what I heard the commissioner say is that they 
could turn around specific recommendations to us in about four to five weeks, but of course it's 
up to us as the council how long it takes us to amend the ordinance fully. Councillor Sobrinho-
Wheeler?  
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
We talked a little about the fines and the enforcement side which is a question I had. How many 
times were there folks who were fined for being in violation of the ordinance in this time period? 
 
Andrew Putnam, Superintendent of Urban Forestry and Landscape   
There's been a total of four. Two were for transparent, you know, the contractor or homeowner 
came to us and applied for the permit that then we rejected and they took it down and they paid

the mitigation costs. And then early on when the program started, we responded to two reports 
of people taking them down and issued them the violation. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
That's one of my questions, thinking through more is the enforcement piece. I mean, we can get 
into more in the discussion, but just if it's sort of relying on folks reporting, then I think there's 
studies that show the lower income parts of the city are less likely to sort of proactively report 
and so thinking about, you know, whether it's ISD, or something else that could help with the 
enforcement, there's something I think we need to think through. And then I just had one other 
question about the Urban Forestry Master Plan. It is a great report, I really appreciate it and the 
graphs and maps are really helpful, and the fact that 72% of tree loss is on private property is 
really interesting and useful. I was wondering if there was any breakdown in the report by 
ownership size, of whether that loss on private property is owner-occupied homes or whether it's 
buildings owned by asset management companies, or if there's any sense of sort of ownership? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
Through you, Mr. Chair. Councillor, we did try to further investigate as to why trees were taken 
down on private property. And we looked at three different circumstances. We tried to see if 
there was a correlation between lost impervious area and tree loss. And that would to some 
extent perhaps represent either the person putting a driveway or putting an extension on their 
property. Or there was infill development happening on their property. We also looked at 
building permits and tree loss, and we looked at changes in ownership in properties, I think that 
was it, I think. And so there was no great correlation that we found between those three, now we 
haven't looked at the size of the property, or indeed, again, building premits perhaps might be 
similar to that, which you were thinking about in terms of development and so on. And again, 
there wasn't a significant correlation there between those, as far as we could tell. And again, 
we're looking at sort of a sparse amount of information over a short period of time. And so 
perhaps over a longer period of time, we might find that there is a greater correlation there then 
we could actually identify in the work that we did. 
 
Councillor Patty Nolan   
That would be great and i'd be really interested in seeing that analysis to just understand if, you 
know, it's one particular ownership company that has a couple hundred units and they're sort of 
going around, you know, taking trees down on all their properties and that would be useful both 
from an enforcement side I think, and then from a policy side, to sort of tailor if we knew it was 
more, you know, owner-occupied single family homes, or someone who owns, you know, a 
hundred triple deckers cutting down a tree at each of their properties. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks. Just follow on that, part of the purpose of putting in this amendment separate from the 
moratorium was so that we would be able to start gathering that information because prior to 
that amendment being in effect, we had really no information about who's cutting down trees 
and why. And I believe, as the commissioner explained, we will likely get a recommendation to 
maintain the permitting requirement, so that we'll be able to track better who was applying to 
remove trees and why. Any other questions from my colleagues? Vice Mayor? 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon   
Thank you, Mr. Chair, through you to the Commissioner. Thanks for this presentation, I know it 
was not originally on the agenda so thank you for pulling it together, and thanks to the chair for 
allowing this hearing to happen today. I have a couple of questions. One, just going back to the 
Back of the Sidewalk Program and trying to strengthen that. You mentioned something about

how, and I've heard this too, if we want to strengthen that program, all of a sudden, you know, 
we buy the tree, we plant it, and then it's their problem in the future, right? Like if they'd wanted 
to take it down or if somehow the roots were growing into their structure, all of the things that we 
identified as exceptions, right? It would then become their issue to remove that tree? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
Councillor, as matters stand, if the city were to plant a tree on private property within 20 feet of 
the right-of-way, it's the owners tree, but if the owner wants to take that tree down, that tree is 
subject to a public hearing, if it's planted within 20 feet of the right-of-way. That's covered by 
Chapter 87 I think section three of state law at this point in time, if public finances are involved. 
So we have been looking at ways around that so that there's people have more discretion with 
what they do with the tree on their property. Given that we want to encourage people to plant 
back of sidewalk trees. And so the question is whether or not those mitigation funds that come 
in from development could be used, in other words, can they be identified as not municipal 
funds and be directly transferred to entities who would then encourage planting on private 
property. And so they would not become then subject to Chapter 87 of state law. That's 
something that we're continuing to investigate. Or indeed if there was a trust that was setup with 
private funding, could the trust working with nonprofits or whomever encourage people to plant 
trees on back of sidewalks or areas. And again, those would not be subject to Chapter 87. And 
let me further clarify that. That's a tree hearing. The fact that you have a tree hearing doesn't 
mean that you can't take your tree down. It's just that you're subject to public process around 
that. There have been many instances, as you know, where we've had tree hearings, and 
people have objections to the tree coming down, but the tree eventually comes down. And so 
we could think about perhaps a set of rules that could manage that, but they'd still be subject to 
a tree hearing. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon   
Thank you. And just one more question about that, who would be responsible for the cost of 
taking that down, through a tree company, in that situation and scenario? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
In all probability, that would be the private property owner. If indeed the private property owner 
wanted the trees out, then the private owner would be responsible for taking it down. So if the 
private property owner agreed in the first place to have a tree planted by the city within 20 feet 
of the right-of-way, 10-15 years later said, you know, I'm fed up with this tree, it's disturbing me, 
I've got leaves in my yard every fall, I can't do it anymore. And they want to take it down. They 
would have to have a public hearing and then given the way the rules are written today, they 
would be responsible for taking it out. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon   
Okay, so given that we are trying to encourage people to do this type of planting and there is a 
greater opportunity for us to increase the tree canopy through this Back of Sidewalk Program, 
will there be recommendations from your team, and from the the task force, in the four to five 
week window? Like will we be able to review your recommendations based on this, based on 
maybe having mitigation funds that can be used to pay for this or some kind of trust, like, will 
that be in the next four to five weeks? Or is that kind of down the road? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
So Councillor, my expectation is that in the next four to five weeks, we will provide you 
recommendations associated with the taking down of trees on private property. In terms of 
encouraging the planting of trees on private property moving forward, that is further down the

road. That's a separate matter that we would like to have further discussion on, but just in terms 
of the amendment so as to preserve canopy by reducing the number of trees that are taken 
down on private property, that's something that we've committed to try and get back to you as 
soon as we possibly could. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon   
Okay, thank you. And I have one more question. On this slide where it says in all cases, always 
allow removal of dead or hazardous trees. This is something that will be a recommendation? Or 
this is, it says get arborist evaluation, file permit. This is part of the ordinance now? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
So Councillor, that's provided for in today's ordinance. And so we would continue to provide for 
that in the future. I think one of the things that we've been looking at, given the fact that we've 
heard from neighbors saying, look, my tree is obviously dead. Why do I need to bring an arborist 
on-site and have them complete this two-page detailed summary of the condition of the tree? 
What we would say is that I think we still want to be rigorous. And so we still want a professional 
to say the tree is dead. But you do not need to go beyond that and complete this. And so if you 
look at the scale of cost, you can get an arborist out on-site for $150 perhaps, rather than the 
$300 that is required to do all of the auxillary work. So we will try and simplify that the extent that 
we can, but I do think that it's still extremely important that there be rigor. If you vote to continue 
to have an amendment, it's important I think that it be robust enough to be able to withstand 
frivolous circumstances that might rise for people who want to take trees down. And it's your 
word against mine that it's a dead tree or not. I do think that we need a certain amount of rigor 
associated with this moving forward. But I think we can reduce the cost to the homeowner, 
recognizing that there have been concerns expressed around that. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon   
So thank you for that. And just to speak to some of the concerns that you've heard, we've heard, 
around this Tree Protection Ordinance and how it is. When you have a dead tree on your 
property, it's obviously dead, I'm just wondering if, you know, we are going to get a 
recommendation four to five weeks, it is going to take us a little bit of time to work through the 
Ordinance Committee hearing and then go through the City Council process. Is there something 
that we could do in amending what we have right now, in between now and when we have a full 
recommendations from the task force, and put together a whole recommendation to think about 
just in this case, right. So that you have to get the arborist evaluation, and I understand we're 
reducing the cost to $150 so they don't have to go through the rest of that process, but could we 
use our city arborist to get that? I'm speaking to your rigor piece, right. Like we don't want 
people willy-nilly taking down trees, this is the whole point of this. But at the same time if you 
have an obviously dead tree on your property, amending or doing something in the interim, 
between now and when we fully update this to be even more rigorous, and speak to some of the 
other concerns. Is there something that we can do now in terms of dead or hazardous trees to 
reduce the barriers and costs for homeowners on something that is clearly dead and going to 
come down? I just want to try to speak to some of the concerns that we've been hearing. And 
you know, I know everybody is worried that this is going to go on until the end of 2020, and 
that's not the case. We've heard that today. However, it could be six months from now. Right? 
So if I have a dead tree in my yard, and between now, and six months from now, perhaps there 
could be something we could be doing differently? I know, I'm sorry. Go ahead. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Sorry. Maybe if we can defer that to the discussion session, because that's not really a clarifying 
question. We're getting into a little bit of policy debate. Councillor McGovern?

Councillor Marc McGovern   
Thank you. Through you, Mr. Chair. So maybe I can phrase that in a question, because I had a 
similar. when I was looking at the list of, I guess it's on page five of the handout, I don't know 
what slide it is but, of the cons. You know, two that have been brought up to me mostly have 
been the cost of the arborist assessment. So I know that was discussed last year when we were 
talking about, could the city go on private property and do that? And there were some so, so I 
guess in framing that in a question, is that something the city can start doing because that has 
been a concern that's been raised? And then the other was the not allowing removal of invasive 
species. And I told this story at the last City Council meeting where I was talking to someone in 
West Cambridge who said that his neighbor had an invasive species, wanted to cut the tree 
down, could not, wasn't allowed to. The tree ended up falling on his roof, not on the owner's 
roof, but on the neighbor's roof, costing tens of thousands of dollars worth of damage. And, you 
know, if he had been allowed to cut that tree down, that wouldn't have happened. So I guess 
there are two questions. One is can we do something to alleviate the cost? And secondly, would 
allowing the removal of invasive species completely undermine this policy? Would it be 
negligible? Why wouldn't we include it? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
So maybe to the first clarifying question that you both asked. And so I think we've already 
committed to revisiting this. I think we stated last year in the latter that we had sent with the 
proposed amendments to the ordinance that we did not want city arborists assessing private 
property trees. And there is a liability issue that we are concerned about with regard to that, and 
arborists unless invited are not allowed on private property. Surveyors are one of the few 
professionals working for a community that are allowed. I think the liability issue is a significant 
one. So it's all well and good saying an arborist goes out on-site and he makes a determination 
that a tree is dead. But there are many instances, some of them that may be frivolous, where 
people will say, Look, let me just get an arborist out here, let's just have a go, let's take a 
chance at it. We want to do something or other we want to get rid of this tree. And so we might 
be caught in instances where the tree is obviously alive, but people are just trying to see if they 
can get rid of the tree. There's also an instance where the arborist in his professional opinion 
says I think this tree is not dead. And then there's a windstorm the day afterwards and the tree 
falls on a house. And then the city then has perhaps some liability based on his professional 
opinion. And so there's real concern about that. But I mean, we can go back and talk in more 
detail with our Law Department about this, because there may be ways around that. But I'm not 
the person to speak to the liability issues and indemnification issues that inevitably arise when 
we talk about us working on private property. But I'm happy to further that conversation with the 
Law Department and get maybe perhaps a more comprehensive response back to you. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Before you answer the invasive species question. So I mean, I would also think, you know, I 
don't know this for sure. But I would hope we could work something out. I would trust the city a 
little bit more to make that determination. If I'm a private arborist, who is going to, you know, 
make an assessment and then further get paid to remove a tree, I have a financial incentive to 
maybe declare something dead that may not be dead. Or, you know, maybe, encourage or I 
would trust the city that doesn't have a financial stake in the game maybe to make that 
determination. And then just the invasive species question, is there a reason we wouldn't allow 
for those to be removed?

DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
You know, I think in terms of invasive species, obviously, we don't want them planted in the city. 
But I think we don't actually want to cull invasive species at this point. I think the tree you talked 
about is an ash tree, which is not an invasive species, but rather one that perhaps may be 
subject to a beetle that has obviously become problematic in terms of our ash tree population in 
the city. But I don't think we want to cull invasive trees at this point in time. But rather, obviously, 
we don't want them planted. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
A couple more, Mr. Chair, please. Others in this room may know this, but for me, just to sort of 
understand sort of where we are in the big picture. You know, we've talked a lot about 20%, 17 
to 20%. And you mentioned, Mr. O'Riordan, that the tree canopy loss is sort of a cyclical thing. 
So is this something that we've been through before in our history? Is what we're seeing now 
worse or on-par with what's happened in the past? And where does this kind of, how have we 
dealt with it in the past? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
Councillor, I think there's evidence to suggest that at the turn of the 20th century, that there was 
a lot of tree planting that occurred in that city. And so we benefited from that for the last hundred 
years. And I think that there is a certain amount of dieout that has occurred. Proportionately, 
again, that was not one of the things that we could divine in terms of the analysis that was 
completed. Certainly, I would say this: that if I look at trees in the public right-of-ways and to 
trees in private property, trees in private property are distinctly more healthy than trees in the 
public right-of-way and that's for good reasons. There's not much permeable surfaces in the 
public right-of-way. They're subject to much more difficult environmental circumstances, be it 
cars, be it salt and what have you. Trees in the private way provide I think it's maybe 60% of the 
canopy overall. And it is critically important to us, if indeed we want to preserve trees, that they 
continue to be protected in some form or fashion. Be that encouraging people to plant, or 
reducing the extent to which trees are taken down. But I can't speak specifically as to how 
different the natural cycle the present circumstance is. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Mr. Chair, I know we're talking a lot about the tree removal ordinance, but can I ask a general 
question about the forest master plan as well, is that on the table? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
That is in order, yes. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
So just, and maybe it's me, I'm sorry, if I missed in here. But just so what do you think will be the 
most important policy changes we can make that would yield the largest percentage of gain in 
the tree canopy? What are sort of your top three or four things that we need to do? 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
We've asked each member of the task force to provide us with their top five. I don't know if 
we've necessarily aggregated all of that as of yet. And so, there may be a different answer that 
might come out of the task force. But I would say this. I forgot my train of thought. Yes, I know 
there's been a lot of talk about the amount of canopy in the city being at 30%, and I know 
people are advocating for 40%. There were three values that were identified as being most 
critical in this exercise: resilience in the face of climate change, shared responsibility be it public 
responsibility and private responsibility. But then I think perhaps the most significant from our

perspective, in light of climate change, in light of, you know, healthier neighborhoods, was the 
idea around equity. And, you know, if you look at some of the maps in the Urban Forest Master 
Plan, you know, where you have the least canopy is in those communities that are most under 
stress, in where there's poverty, where English is a second language. And so it's important from 
our perspective moving forward that we concentrate not so much on the 30% canopy, but rather 
providing more canopy in the public right-of-way. Where again, more people can take 
advantage of it. Providing more canopy in those areas of the city where the impact of urban heat 
island is most significant. And so I think that is the area where we think that we should be 
placing more emphasis moving forward. And quite frankly, that's a heavy lift. And certainly in the 
east of the city where just the urban form is one that is more challenging in terms of providing 
more canopy. But I do think that in terms of this master plan, those are the values that present 
themselves I think to us as being the most significant and important. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
That's all for now, Mr. Chair. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Councillor. Alright, so we'll hear from the public if you haven't already done so 
please sign up. So we can call your name and I do want to note that we did receive numerous 
communications. And we received from, from private residents and then we received one letter 
from Green Cambridge in support of extending the moratorium and a letter from Harvard 
University in opposition. So, if you've signed up to speak, please come forward to the mic and I 
will go retrieve the signup sheet while you do that. Kristine Jelstrop. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
Here we go. Kristine Jelstrop, 120 pleasant street, member of mothers out front. That was a 
really interesting presentation. I appreciate the DPWputting that together. Esteemed city 
councillors. My comments are pulled from a letter posted to the urban forestry masterplan 
website and the green Cambridge opinion piece which appeared in Cambridge day and which I 
wholeheartedly support. Our trees are living infrastructures that are essential to Cambridge is 
livability and resilience in the face of accelerating climate change. Trees mitigate flooding, 
reduce energy consumption, cool urban heat islands and improve public mental and physical 
health. The trees clean the air and help to stabilize the climate by sequestering carbon above 
and below the ground. It is in the interests of the entire community to protect our existing trees 
and at the same time expand the canopy by planting more. To make Cambridge more resilient 
to climate change we must act quickly and decisively. Trees are part of the natural system that 
reduces carbon pollution and protects us all. The tree protection ordinance is critical because it 
gives the city space to work and take recommendations laid out in the excellent Task Force 
technical report, jointly written by Reed Hildebrand and the city and find an agreed upon method 
to implement them. The top level strategies in the report were clear; curb the loss of trees and 
grow the canopy. We can't do either if the ordinance is about to expire, especially with so many 
people standing at the ready to take down their trees when the [sic] moratorium expires. I hope 
that the city council will vote unanimously to extend the moratorium through 2020. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you, Kristine. Byron Cohen. 
 
 
Good afternoon. Thank you for the presentation. My name is Byron Cohen. I'm a lifelong 
resident of Cambridge, a graduate of the amigo school and CRLS and an active voter. Currently 
I reside in Harvard Graduate Student Housing but for most of my life, I lived in our family home

on 11 Donald street, and my family actually moved into that home the day I was born 25 years 
ago. During the time that I was growing up, the tree landscape of our property has experienced 
many changes, but it's always been green with the lush tree canopy that many people would 
expect on a large lot. My parents Peter Cohen and Michelle Mentis Cohen have moved very 
slowly in making changes to the tree scape trying to be conservative in the best sense of the 
word, as they share the city's goal of preserving the tree canopy. They've only replaced trees 
that were killed by disease or remove trees that were either causing damage to the two 
buildings on our family property, or which were damaged and at risk of falling representing a 
safety hazard. For example, in 1998, when I was about four years old, my parents planted 
approximately 15 hemlock trees dividing them up into the north, west and south sides of our 
property. Each group of trees had a different fate. As I grew older the group in the north side did 
well initially growing by leaps and bounds as I did as well. The group on the west side did all 
right, growing slowly, and the group on... of trees, about eight of them on the south side all died 
for reasons that were unclear at the time. Being optimistic my parents replaced all of those eight 
dead hemlocks, and most of them died again about 15 dead trees. In total. They had soil tests 
done and consulted with various experts, who eventually reached a consensus that these 
hemlocks were being killed by the neighbors adjacent Norway maples. Then in the early 2000s, 
a new problem arose our surviving had hemlocks were suddenly attacked by an invasive 
species known as the hemlock woolly adle ged, which had moved up from Southern climes as a 
result of climate change. So when I was about nine years old, these trees began to look more 
and more sickly. It became apparent that they were dying and that they weren't going to return 
to good health and so my parents with a heavy heart, and to hit to their pocketbook, removed 
these diseased, dying trees and replace them with arborvids. So today of those original 15 
hemlocks only two still stand. So I know that my parents would like to plant more trees on our 
property. But I also know that living in 125 year old house with a 50 year old roof and a need for 
maintenance, there's competition for limited household dollars in terms of property maintenance 
and improvement. And we feel that anything that unnecessarily increases the cost of tree care 
over the tree life cycle makes it less likely rather than more likely that people like my parents will 
be able to plant more trees, specifically the provision of the ordinance that requires property 
owners to obtain permits to remove dead or dangerous trees. And which effectively requires 
them to spend 250 to 300 dollars per tree in fees to obtain certifications of those trees being 
dead by certified arborists. Its... are both unfair and counterproductive to Cambridge's goal 
which we share of retaining a robust tree canopy.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks Byron, if you could wrap up 
 
 
Okay, so had they been subject to this ordinance at that time. Wy parents would have been 
subjected about three and a half thousand dollars in mandatory arborist fees simply to certify 
the death of our hemlocks. Clearly that discourages tree planting. We don't want that to happen. 
We want Cambridge to have a vibrant robust tree canopy, but people have to plant trees for that 
to happen in the long run. So thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Trumbull Barrett. 
 
 
There we go. Good afternoon. My name is Trumbull Barrett. I live at 11 King Street. And I also 
happen to be the president of a Barrett Tree Service East in Medford. And I want to thank the 
folks at the DPW, particularly David and Andrew for all the work they've done in implementing

this ordinance. The Councillors and the task force for all the work you've put in. Over the course 
of the last 11 months or so, our company has removed about 50 trees under this ordinance. And 
I think it might be worth pointing out that the cost of complying with this ordinance is, on 
average, less than about 10% of the cost the removal, so that might, you know, help speak to 
the conversation about the cost of meeting the needs of the ordinance. I was just thought it'd be 
worthwhile sharing that. My comments I think we're on the slideshow. The majority of our clients 
recognize that the ordinance is important and recognize the need to comply with it. It's been my 
experience that folks were annoyed by the ordinance. I think it's more about the city enforcing 
the city's will on their personal property. And it's not often as much about the finance. And my 
last piece of... my last thought rather, is that, um, you know, for me on a practicing level, the 
ordinance has been pretty straightforward, I think thanks to the hard work of the DPW. And if the 
council sees it fit to proceed with the ordinance, I would, I would very much support an 
allowance for replacement. And I think that that would really help folks understand and be able 
to comply with the ordinance moving forward. So thank you for your time. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Former Vice Mayor Jen Devereaux. 
 
 
Hi, everyone. Nice to be back to my former committee and to be talking about a subject that's 
near and dear to my heart. If you need my address. It's 255 Lakeview Avenue. And I am now a 
board member of Green Cambridge. So I think Kristine has already paraphrased some of the 
comments that you received by email and that were in Cambridge Day, and a longer set of 
comments that were sent to the urban forest master plan task force, which like all of the public 
comment are posted on that project webpage, which I encourage anyone who hasn't seen the 
range of comments to take a look at those. So I'm here to amplify what Green Cambridge has 
already said. And also speaking for myself, just to remind us that, that list of the pros was... the 
pros and cons, on the pro side was perhaps a little scant on the actual pros of why this is such 
an important thing. I mean, yes, it is a pro that Cambridge residents are by and large now sort of 
on board with this, but I think it's really important for us to bear in mind that it is one of the city... 
you know, it complements all of the city's larger priorities. So we're not really just talking about 
trees, we're talking about our urban environment and other priorities, like increasing safety and 
walkability on our streets. It helps promote street level retail, and it has measurable public health 
outcomes. I don't think that gets talked about enough in terms of both air quality and cooling. 
And those are especially important to vulnerable residents, children and seniors. And they make 
all of our housing whether it's low income or market rate housing more attractive, they enhance 
our parks. So there's a huge public benefit to everybody getting behind this. I agree that if we 
can in the eventual amendment of the tree protection ordinance, if we can include a way for 
people to replant as mitigation that seems sensible. I support increasing the or decreasing the 
diameter. And I also would support a different set of mitigation for particularly large or significant 
trees because those are really hard to replace. But for now, I would encourage you to keep it 
simple, to extend the moratorium and not try to figure out how to amend the moratorium while 
extending it. If as Commissioner O'Riordan says he can have a set of recommendations to 
amend the ordinance more fully within four or five, six weeks that will give you time to do this 
and this won't drag on forever and ever. So I hope you'll do that. And I look forward to following 
along. Thanks. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you so much, Fritz Donovan. 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan

Chairman Zonderva, Councillors. I'm Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving street Cambridge. First I want to 
thank you for being here today on behalf of our dangerously threatened environment. 
Undoubtedly the most important issue that faces us today. It is difficult to save a planet without 
inconveniencing people. One need only observed the aggressive attempts of the current 
Washington administration and their inconvenienced billionaire backers to overturn all the major 
environmental victories achieved by previous administrations. But our planet definitely needs 
saving and everyone in this room knows it. So how do we get that done? The key is balance. 
Every new ordinance imposes restrictions that do not previously exist and the impact of those 
restrictions falls on different people in different ways. So the successful ordinance has to 
balance the impact to achieve the goals our planet desperately needs without unfair burden on 
anyone. Our recently published urban forest master plan points out that the vast majority of 
Cambridge trees are on private property. There's nothing private about the huge benefits those 
trees provide. But restricting private owners rights to benefit the public as a whole is a delicate 
process. The current ordinance has been criticized for imposing major expense on some private 
tree owners without providing any financial offset. The City of Cambridge can easily afford to 
mitigate that expense through subsidized landscape services, tax rebates and other means. 
This committee needs to work out fair and balanced methods to do so. At the same time, the 
ordinance needs to be broadened to include a wide range of trees this current ordinance does 
not protect at all. But those protections must have teeth, sharp teeth. It is hard to imagine a per 
tree dollar penalty for unlawful destruction of a healthy tree. That is high enough to prevent the 
developer of a multi million dollar project from simply destroying all the trees in their way. And 
just adding the fine to the cost of the project. Preventing this abuse may be the highest 
challenge of all, but it has to be done. Cambridge has the intellectual and financial resources to 
protect our health and environment in this vital area. We are all rooting for this committee to do 
it, no pun intended. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks Fritz. Peter Cohen. 
 
 
Good afternoon, members of the council. Nice to see many of you again and see for the first 
time some of you I haven't met before. I'm Peter Cohen. My wife Michelle and I live at 11 
Donnell Street in Cambridge, where we've lived since July 14, 1994. Prior to that I lived most of 
my life in the Agassi neighborhood. We have a large lot with two buildings on it. And they're 40, 
count them of 40 trees on our property. So we like trees. I grew up with a lot of trees, I love 
trees. But the current ordinance is really giving me daily heartache and likelihood of more 
heartache. During the time we've been there, we've had different species and sizes and there's 
been constant change. People get this picture that trees are just some kind of static thing. But if 
you look at over time, it's actually much more dynamic system. We have three problems that are 
caused by this ordinance. Problem number one is unreasonable burden caused... relating to the 
removal of dead trees. Four of our 40 trees are now dead. Three are currently subject to the 
current ordinance and require individual removal permits. And the quotes I have gotten out, 
making some inquiries are $250 to $300 per thing. So to give you the numbers, I have a quote 
to remove just two of the tree is $1900 to take down the trees by relatively reasonably priced 
person, and then $500 on top of that for the certification. That increases the cost of the removal 
by 26%. Now, at that point, we just have a tree that's cut to the ground. We don't we haven't 
even gotten into stump grinding, preparing soil for a possible replacement. I can tell you that 
one of the reasons we move slowly, is we like to protect existing trees and another is cost. 
We're not made of money any more than anyone else is. And so this notion that really the 
marginal costs, whether it's 10% or, or, or 25% more isn't important is just wrong. So I have 
here in this forum of November and in public meetings and in private meetings, again and again

invited the city arborist come look at my dead trees. And dare him to say that they're not 
anything but dead. This notion that the city can't come on my properties is just nonsense. City 
asserts authority to regulate. It can issue stop work citations, it can issue huge penalties. But 
when I invite them to come, they can come apparently. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks, Peter. 
 
 
I have more to say, a lot more to say. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
We need to move on. Thank you. Florrie Wescout. Thank you. Florrie Wescout. 
 
 
Just for the record, I'm going to be submitting the rest of my stuff then in writing since I've now 
been cut off.  I haven't  gotten past point 1. I hope you read it because I want to keep showing 
up at city council member meetings. 
 
 
Florrie Wescout, I live at 33 Market Street. And I'm a member of the Committee on Public 
Planting and also served on the task force and also a member of mothers up front. And I'm here 
just to urge you to extend the moratorium for the trees and just to point out that the technical 
report, which is a really long read, really well written, but on page 247, it's strongly recommends 
that we don't let that protection ordinance lapse. In general, it was good to see on the 
presentation that most residents understand the importance of maintaining and protecting the 
trees. They are a community asset, and it's our responsibility as citizens to protect them. I did 
want to just briefly comment on a couple of comments that councillors made. I do agree that it 
would be good to streamline the process somehow, when trees are just dead and make that a 
little bit easier for residents. And I think ultimately, to take into account species might be a good 
idea also, especially trees that emit toxic chemicals from their roots like Norway maples, the 
young man spoke about them, because that's a particularly pesky problem. But I think 
ultimately, the reworking and the refining of the tree protection ordinance will be better for 
residents. I think the consultant is very capable and anyway thank you very much. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you Florrie. Chantal Eide. 
 
 
Hello, I'm Chantal Eide, I'm 20 Ellsworth Avenue. I'm also on the committee for public planting. 
I'd like to request an extension for the tree protection ordinance. The urban forestry master plan 
recommendations have not yet emerged but there's overwhelming data that Cambridge is losing 
tree canopy at an accelerated rate. The volume of canopy of a mature tree is so significant 
compared to a new tree which may not thrive. So I would like to request extending the tree 
cutting moratorium until a considered response can be made to the urban forestry master plan. 
Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Okay, thanks so much. Steven Bolotin. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern

Good afternoon Mr. Chairman, members of the committee. My name is Steve Bolotin. I live at 
7C Donnell Street since July 4 of 1996. I'm going to start by saying I don't have a personal issue 
with any trees on my property. I'm also going to start by saying I don't think anybody here is 
against trees. So I think we can take off the issue of the rape of the land. What we have here is 
an issue of an ordinance. An ordinance which obviously shows some measure of unpopularity 
as I keep hearing from the committee, that many people are waiting for it to expire to go and 
start cutting down trees. So obviously we have an issue in terms of the ordinance, it would be 
obviously far better to have an ordinance that people are more interested in complying with than 
waiting to try and avoid. Some very good suggestions have been made by the, by the 
commission members regarding options. Offsets for new planting, streamlining of the 
application process, reducing cost. These are critical if you're going to get community 
participation. And that's what we're really looking at. If the goal is to increase the canopy, it 
needs to be done in a manner that encourages planting, rather than just discourages the cutting 
down of a tree. We can all sit there and wait for a tree to die, take it down and then do nothing. 
Or alternatively we can encourage somebody to take a sick tree or a tree that's not working in 
the community and encourage its removal and replacement. I urge the committee to work 
towards that directive. Thank you very much.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Lee Farris. 
 
 
Good afternoon, Lee Farris 269 Norfolk Street. Responding to the testimony that I heard today I 
had a few questions as well as a few thoughts. I'm wondering if the city could ask the tree 
maintenance companies and the arborist how many trees they were called out to look at or 
inspect, but they did not apply for a removal permit? Because I suspect that is perhaps the 
reason why we only have 5% disapproval. Then I would also like to gather more data. I would 
add like the city to ask the arborist and the tree maintenance company to say why in their 
opinion, a tree died, not with any liability on the tree maintenance company or the arborist but 
again, just so we can try to gather data. I think there was some discussion about did it happen 
because driveways paved over the trees, watershed or the trees roots got damaged. But if we 
could be more systematic trying to collect that data, that would be helpful. And I asked Mr. 
Barrett, if that was asked for now, and he said no. I'd like to also to know what was the number 
of reports by neighbors of illegal cutting. So for example, I saw a tree that looked healthy to me 
on my street, very large cut down, and I was pretty upset about it, but I went and talked to the 
homeowner instead of calling up the city and asking if they had a permit? And she said, yes, 
they did indeed have a permit because the tree was much sicker than it looked from the street. 
But I don't know if anybody did report illegal cutting. So I, I would like that to happen. And I 
would like us to think how to encourage that. So looking at the new ordinance going forward, 
once we get to the master plan recommendations, I'd like there to be a component of notifying 
neighbors of applications to remove trees. So that neighbors can be involved in the process 
because it does impact you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks Lee if you could wrap up. 
 
 
Okay, thanks. The last one is, can... this is a question, can CHA and other nonprofits get back of 
the sidewalk trees now? Thank you.

Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. That concludes the list. I erecognize Tom Lucey and Maggie Booz. 
 
 
Good afternoon, Tom Lucey with Harvard University. We submitted a letter and I encourage you 
to read it. And... but I did want to add, Councillor McGovern asked about the policy, potential 
policy thing that could help here. And one of the things that I think you could look at as a council 
probably not the urban tree Task Force is your parking ratios. Your parking ratios in your zoning 
haven't been updated in decades. They drive and force you to put impervious surfaces in many 
cases to provide the parking for this. They also discourage people from greening over because 
then you'd have to create structured parking. I know at the Divinity School we paved... we did a 
parking over we had some capacity, we could do it. But in other areas where we could green 
over surface parking, the creation of structured parking is so expensive that it's a 
discouragement to do that. So I think that's one area you could look at.  I think you could create 
further green space and further areas the plant in your city. And again, please read my letter. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks, and I did. Maggie. 
 
 
Hi, I'm Maggie Booz. I live at 27 Lawn Street in Cambridge. I'm a... I'm the co chair of the 
committee on public planting, and I'm also a member of the tree task force for the urban forest 
master plan. I'm also an architect. I have an architecture... a small architecture firm in 
Cambridge for 25 years now. And I wanted to just speak anecdotally about how the moratorium 
has helped me as an architect encourage people to keep trees. Actually just have an excuse to, 
to convince people to keep trees because I've had a couple of projects in the last year in which 
my clients really wanted to cut down trees, whether for the, for the purpose of the projects that 
we were doing residential additions, or whether they just in the other case, just didn't like trees 
at all, one of which is right next to Peter Cohen's property. In fact, he'll be happy to know that all 
the trees are saved in the, in the project as a result of this moratorium. And it's, it's because I 
can point to this moratorium and, and and just remind people that it exists, and we've done 
pretty significant workarounds on small residential projects. And it's, it's save trees. So there, 
there's the tree moratorium in which, you know, permits have been applied for whatever it is 350 
and, you know, 80 to 100 trees have been saved through that permitting process. And then 
there are the residual results of the moratorium that in which no one applied for a permit. The 
trees were saved nonetheless. So I'd encourage you to extend the moratorium until which time 
you can come up with a great ordinance that addresses the concerns of citizens like Peters. 
Where, where you know, the hiring of the arborist is expensive, etc. Perhaps consider what the 
building department does, which is that a homeowner can apply for his own building permit even 
though does he doesn't have a contractor's license. You know, maybe there's a way of of 
working that as, as, you know, evaluation of the trees. And I'd also like to lend great support to 
the Department of Public Works, which is committed to an engagement with the public that will 
make the, make the make the citizenry cognizant of how important these trees are, how 
essential they are to our, to our good health and the beauty of our city. Thank you so much. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Yes, please come forward and speak and then we will have to close public 
comment. So we run out of time. Please give us your name.

Yes. My name's Pamela heart. Pamela heart. I live also on Donnell street number 18. So I just 
was hoping that there could be some consideration given to people who have planted or plan to 
plant additional trees. And I'm wondering if it might be possible for people who want to get 
permission to remove an undesirable tree, whether it's in poor condition, or its invasive or 
whatever reason, that if they agreed plant a tree that would become a comparable size that this 
could be taken into consideration. I also think we need to consider other kinds of plants as well. 
There are instances where people would really like to have a vegetable garden or they want to 
have small lawn for their children to do somersaults or for whatever reasons, I would like there 
to be some consideration of individual circumstances. Thank you. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you so much. I'll entertain a motion to close public comment. So on closing public 
comment, all in favor please say aye. Any against. Alright, so public comment is closed. So we'll 
return to discussion of both the moratorium as well as the urban forest master plan task force 
report. And we have about 20 minutes. So if we could keep that in mind. So any questions or 
comments? Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
Thanks. I really appreciate our colleagues started the conversation before. And I m really 
impressed with the with the whole report. I didn't read every single page, but I did look through 
it. And it is really comprehensive, scientifically based and extensive. I understand it did take 
longer than expected, which is why we're here discussing the possible moratorium for that huge 
report to come out in November. It would be unreasonable to think in a month or two that a new 
ordinance could be drafted. I do think a few of the things that, that struck me in reading the 
report was that the draft goals which I believe the commissioner talked about are equity, shared 
responsibility and resilience as all things and then under each of those, there's a number of 
areas that are very specific recommendations that would come forward in a new report. I think. 
What I don't know is when I hear the commissioner say he's committed to coming forward in 
four to six weeks with, in essence a draft new ordinances that... and then my understanding is 
that would come forward, and then it would be up to the council to then take that in, would it 
take then a couple months maybe to, to pass it? And if so, we are talking about it's now January 
by end of February there's the draft ordinance from public works. And then another couple 
months for us. So we should be able to wrap this up by spring, but let's say it doesn't maybe 
they've been in the summer. That seems like a reasonable timeframe. Within that to just keep it 
simple. Keep the existing moratorium in place. Understanding that yes, it will be challenging for 
some folks who feel like they... look, I think we all agree some of the cons are not so great about 
not being able to trade off a replacement tree. But every single one of those cons, my 
understanding and looking at them, every single one can be addressed and part of the new 
ordinance. In fact, it's in the master plan and some of the recommendations that all of those 
cons about not allowing replanting, no protection for tree roots. The question of invasive species 
I think has been answered and the cost can all be incorporated in any kind of new ordinance. 
And... which i'm in favor of doing I really want us to get to a much more robust ordinance, build 
on this incredibly important report. And the other another striking thing that is informing my 
thinking on this from the report is that many other cities also have a goal. So we have a goal of 
30% regarding back up to 30%. There's a striking chart in the report that shows that even with 
really aggressive planting of hundreds and hundreds of trees that we will not get there unless 
we combine, in essence, a moratorium and a very strict incentive program combined with 
aggressive planting to even reach that goal. And I will say that is lower than Boston's goal of 
35%, New York City's goal of 36%. And so I want us to do everything we can and to listen to 
and adhere to what we've also heard, which is, I think we're all united in... while this seems 
somewhat punitive, we want to do everything we can to incentivize people to plant to have not

just a stick but a carrot. And in the... one of the things I really enjoyed about in the urban forestry 
mastery plan is there's a lot of incentives in there in ways that through education, others that we 
would address, one, the equity, the geographic equity issue across the city, which is going to be 
the biggest challenge for that part of the city that has less tree. This is not a super onerous thing 
if I'm correct. If we're all committed and tell me if I'm wrong, that we actually can get this done 
within... While it may not be this spring as we would like by March or April, but that we could 
definitely by May or June, which seems to be a reasonable period of time. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. Anyone else?  Councillor McGovern. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Thank you, Mr. Chair. So, my guess is that we are... we will extend this for a period of time. I do 
think, you know, the folks who I... who I've talked to who have had concerns, I think that when 
we talk about people are waiting for this to expire. I sort of envisioned someone sitting there, 
you know, twiddling their hands. I can't wait to... you know, most of the people that I've talked to 
that have that issue with this are reasonable people who are having an issue with trees on their 
property and, you know, maybe... and you know, people have different priorities. It is as Mr. 
Donovan said, it is a difficult, challenging balance to... you know, I bought a house I want to put 
a deck on because I want to have barbecues with my grandkids. And the city comes in and says 
you can't do that because we want to save the tree. I mean, we are infringing on someone's 
personal rights on their property. That's not something we should just kind of take, take lightly. 
And so you know, I do, you know, either this is going to become permanent, or it's going to 
expire at some point, in which case, people may be waiting. Maybe they thought they were 
waiting until did we decide, was it February 11? Is that when? March? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
February 25. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
We get we got an answer to that? 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
But just to clarify, there's no interest in making this permanent. What we're doing... what we're 
talking about is reworking the ordinance. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
I'm just I'm just I'm just saying that at some point, if it's going to expire, then that date will come 
where people will wait, whether it be in March or December. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
That's not correct because the assumption is that we will amend it. And so there will still be 
protections after the moratorium.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
We will see when we get there. But so I do think that there's, you know, and in the ordinance 
and I and Councillor Mallon, you know, asked for this in the original ordinance to be mindful of 
folks that, you know, were lower income who, you know, a 5, 6, 7, $10,000 fine, you know, 
significant. But there's a lot of people who don't qualify for a... What are we saying? What's the 
word we use to achieve established forms of financial assistance? Were a couple thousand 
dollars is significant to them. And so if we're going to extend this, which I think we will, are we

planning on doing another mailing to people how are we planning on letting people know 
because if you are someone who is, who thinks this is going to expire in March and you're 
waiting for a good reason, not passing judgment, to remove a tree. And now we extend it and 
you don't know it's extended and you cut down the tree and you get a fine for $6,000. I'm not 
sure that's really fair either. So are we planning to do another outreach to people once we 
extend this. 
 
DPW Commissioner Owen O'Riordan   
Through you Mr. Chair. Councillor not wanting necessarily to predict that you will extend or 
change. But we certainly would commit to doing another mailing and more outreach to the 
community. If indeed either a new ordinance or this amendment was to be extended, so we'd be 
happy to take that on. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Yes. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
This would be really quick because the postcard that I also got. I'm a property owner, I one tree 
on my property. Didn't have an end date. It just said effective March 11. There was a tree 
ordinance it didn't say this will only be in place for a year. So I don't know what  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
But, I would say in conversations and in papers that people know.... I mean, we can on one 
hand, say people waiting for this to expire in March and then say people don't know what's 
expiring in March. Right? So obviously people know. So if we're going to extend that, let's inform 
them, so we don't have any unintended consequences. 
 
Councillor Patty Nolan   
Thank you. Yeah, I think, just to reiterate, my colleagues points, I think we need to extend the 
tree protection ordinance, because if there's a gap, it sort of defeats the purpose in some ways. 
And that's I am... I'm sympathetic to the idea of having a dead tree on your property having to 
call an arborist to come and that "yup, dead tree", and that there might be some way to work 
with that. Whether it's city sort of refunding the fee if it is dead, and you can certify that and sort 
of looking at what the costs would be, if that's possible. Not wanting to extend the burden on the 
DPW and the arborist but if they're, you know, are if we just put in the budget the fee for another 
city staff arborist specifically look at dead trees that would then be able to take off the cost. 
Maybe that's a possibility. And then just sort of, sort of reiterate the point before around 
enforcement. I think it's just something we need to think about. Maybe have a list on the website 
of trees that have gotten permitted, for cutting down. I think, we, I've been at city council 
meetings where folks have said, You know, I just saw these trees coming down the other day, 
and I thought we had a tree protection ordinance now and wanting sort of have an answer for 
them. And to just avoid sort of reporting of having to folks telling their neighbors in order for it to 
really be enforced, and that there are parts of the neighbor, parts of the city where, you know, 
they're more folks who are working class, have less income at this time who are less likely to 
report, you know, whether that's their neighbor, who's a homeowner owner, whether that's a big 
developer or someone who's violating the ordinance that there might be times where folks aren't 
reporting and so just trying to figure out whether that's, you know, ISD doing an inventory when 
they look at properties or some other way to sort of keep track that way. I would be interested in 
sort of figuring that out on the enforcement side.

Thanks. Vice Mayor Mallon. 
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon   
Thank you. I think we heard a couple of really great comments today around. We really do need 
to be thinking about this as encouraging tree planting, not just encourage... discouraging 
removals. I think one of the earlier public speakers was talking about... I know Miss Nolan just 
mentioned it. So I would really challenge the DPW in, through this process to think about how 
we can be creative about using funds and staffing to encourage tree planting. Including what Mr. 
Lucey brought up from Harvard around what are the other city barriers for us to be encouraging 
tree planting on places where, you know what, what are the places where we can as a city as a 
government be looking at to decrease... parking ratios is an excellent example. I'm sure that 
there are others. So I would challenge us all to be thinking about what those other things are. I 
do think, I was appreciative of the data that was afforded to us here. But I do, I wonder about 
how many trees were called for that didn't meet the requirement. And so we never saw that 
data. And I'm wonder if there is a way to collect that for the next meeting, whether that's working 
through the arborist to find out were there, were 500 calls that went out that the arborist went 
out to calls to say, you know, what this actually does... We have a tree protection ordinance and 
a moratorium and so you can't apply. So, you know, there are... I think the data is a little bit 
incomplete. I do wonder if there is a way... I was just thinking about it when people were talking 
about, you know, you see a tree coming down and you think I thought we had a tree protection 
ordinance. Is there a way that the DPW could put up a sign? Like you know what, when you're a 
team, when the DPW is doing tree work, right? There's a there's a sign so that I don't ever show 
up to my house where I'm surprised the DPW is there because there's been a sign up for a 
week that says that the tree is coming down. Is there a way to design a sign so that 
homeowners who have received a permit to remove a tree can put it up in front of their house? 
So neighbors aren't wondering, did they get a permit? Did they go through the process? I do 
think that that's just an easy quick way for us to communicate to abutters and to neighbors that 
the neighbors have followed a process much like the we do the tree work signs. So I am looking 
forward to continuing this conversation because I do think that there are some really good 
strategies for consideration in the next ordinance. I do want to call attention to the fact, when we 
were having this conversation at the City Council level that there was a I don't want to put words 
in your mouth, Councillor McGovern, but there was an amendment on the floor around changing 
the no such permits will be issued until December 31 2020 or until a new ordinance has been 
put forth based on the recommendations of the urban tree task force. Again, I don't want to put 
words in your mouth. But I do think that that might put some minds to rest and give a little more 
clarity around what we're talking about. That this isn't just going to be an indefinite moratorium 
and moratorium forever but that there is a clear thing that we are looking at, to put a stop to this. 
But thank you very much again, for all of your work. I know. This was a tremendous effort. And I 
commend you all for for putting in that effort and making it easy for our residents. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thanks, Vice Mayor. So just respond to that suggestion, and I certainly considered it myself 
even when first putting in place this moratorium, but we decided at that time that it's it's not 
necessary to put that in. It's also a little bit confusing, because how do we decide what we 
consider substantial amendments, but at the end of the day as Councillor Nolan outlined, it's 
quite likely that we could get through a process of amending the ordinance by this summer, 
maybe it spills into the fall. But certainly we would hope that we could get this done before the 
end of the year. And as part of that amendment process itself, we would simply remove the 
moratorium. So even though we are amending it, proposing to amend it now, this say expires 
December 31. At any point that we are ready to amend the overall tree protection ordinance, we 
can simply remove that phrase and the moratorium. So I don't think it's necessary to put it in

there to say, you know, December 31, unless we amended first because that's essentially what 
we're going to do so we can explain that to people but we don't necessarily have to put that in 
the actual text. So that's just my opinion. I did want to briefly ask a few questions, and then I will 
entertain a motion to forward the proposed amendment to the, to the full Council. So at the 
November 12, 2019 meeting of this committee, we also got an update on the permit applications 
at that time. And the data we received, according to my notes was 349 permits applied for and 
298 issued that was about 51 not issued at that time. But today we're hearing 347 issued out of 
366 so 19 not issued so is that because many are most of those 51 ultimately were issued 
between then and now. 
 
Andrew Putnam, Superintendent of Urban Forestry and Landscape   
Correct. They were either filed submitted under the wrong category or with insane with 
insufficient amount of data and then they were resubmitted. So this is actually kind of, more of a 
tree basis. If you think about it that way that 347 trees to be removed, and then a total of 19 
were denied. Got it. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Thank you. I wanted to quickly speak to the back of the sidewalk program, which I've been able 
to participate in quite happily. The trees doing well. And I was really glad to receive that tree. It 
was a substantial tree, it wasn't a stick you know. It was a significant tree when it was planted, 
which is the advantage of this kind of a program because that would be a significant cost to 
homeowner to purchase such a tree. And it is correct that as part, as a participant, I'm agreeing 
to take care of the tree and so if at some point I need to remove it, I would have to bear that that 
cost. Of course, that's also true if I plant the tree myself. And I think because, more because of 
the 20 feet limit than other, than any other reason, I think it's really limited program. We just so 
happened in my case that there was one spot where we could squeeze it in. And so I think, as 
we consider different options, I would be in favor of a program that is more free ranging right 
that, that allows us to fund planting a tree on private property. And, and also that we consider a 
kind of insurance program where we would also fund in the future removal of such a tree and 
replacing it if it was sick or dying, or otherwise needed to be removed. So that the participating 
property owners would know that they would really not bear significant cost down the road? If, if 
the tree needs to be removed or replaced. And, you know, obviously we have to get around the 
anti-aid amendment. But that's a general issue. And we have ways to do that. So I'm not terribly 
concerned about that. And then I want to highlight what Councillor Nolan brought up and others 
as well that what we don't know is how many trees will not cut down, because we have this 
moratorium in place and Maggie Booz spoke to that as well. So I think it is really important that 
we extend that protection. Give ourselves the time that we need to fully amend the ordinance 
and that we do commit to our, to our residents that we are going to do that as speedily as we 
can so that we're not intending to continue this extension process. This is a one time extension 
because of the delay which is quite understandable and has ultimately delivered a much deeper 
and more thorough report. So with that I would entertain a motion to refer the amendment to the 
full council with a favorable recommendation. Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
I'm just interested. I understand, Mr. Chair, you're concern. But would we rather put in the 
phrase that Councillor McGovern had suggested, which is prior to December 31 2020, or such 
time as a new tree ordinance is approved? I think we should do that. So I don't know how the 
process is? Do I move an amendment? Is it a friendly amendment? Or do you? You should 
move it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern

I was.. You beat me to the punch. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Yes. So that that would be an amendment, which is in order. I will say that, again, it's... I 
understand and, and support the intention, but it is also confusing in, in that wording, because 
what do we mean by a new tree protection ordinance. So I, you know, I think Think it's 
unnecessary, and it complicates the process and I would not be voting for it. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
So if I may, Mr. Chair, so I would say, I don't think it's confusing because we're talking about 
passing the tree protection ordinance in the springs. That's what we're talking about. Right. So 
when that ordinance... 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
Point of information, we have a tree protection ordinance. So what we're talking about is 
amending it further. So what, what we would have to specify is what constitutes a sufficiently 
comprehensive amended to. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan   
Do we have a hard stop at 4:30? Because we have to do this in a minute if we do. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
There's another committee meeting... or until a... So I would move that after December 31, 
2020. That we add or until a new city wide tree protection ordinance is  passed.  You 
don't second. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
We do not second so the amendment is on today. So we will have discussion, any comments? 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler   
Just to say I'm fine with it either way. I think sort of, in fact, if we have an ordinance [sic] sort of 
replaced what we have with the moratorium now, I don't think we need it. I don't think it changes 
that it if we do have it. No super strong feelings. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
So what I will say again, I don't think that is clear language. What do we mean by a new tree 
protection ordinance? I don't know what that means, if we could amend it to change one word, 
and then is the moratorium now no longer the fact.  I just don't think this is useful, but that's my 
opinion. On the amendment, all in favor? Opposed? I'm opposed. So the amendment 
carries with two in favor and one opposed and one present. On the motion. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern   
Motion as amended move to send to the council with a favorable recommendation. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan   
On the motion. All in favor? Any opposed? Okay, the motion carries. I will entertain a 
motion to adjourn. So moved. All in favor. Thank you.

URBAN FOREST MASTER PLAN
Process overview

Builds upon findings of the CCVA 

Attempts to deepen the City’s understanding of the anticipated risks to the urban forest

Proposed strategies were conceived to support goals of CCPR:
building infrastructural, economic, and social resilience that integrates the built and 
natural environments. 

Task Force met 11 times during 2018-2019 to review progress, pose questions, 
and provide advice to the consultant team, and the interaction with the Task 
Force has significantly shaped the content of this report, the approach to the 
subject, and the components of the response strategies. 

UFMP is as a unique project, one that other communities are looking to emulate 
in planning for the future

Multiple factors impact the future condition of the forest

2030, 2050 and 2070 Baseline
—  existing and potential pests and diseases
—  temperature change and hardiness zone shift 
—  uses existing replanting and growth rates 

2030 Flooding
—  areas experiencing standing water > 24 hrs in a   
 

simulated 100 yr flood event

2050 Drought
—  a moderate drought event is projected to occur    
 
once every 30 years within the 2035 to 2064    
 
timeframe (Hayhoe et al 2006)

Climate change will alter the character of the forest

The species composition of the future forest 
is influenced by suceptibility of individual species  
to climate risks, particularly pests and diseases.

Flooding was found to have a potentially  
minimal impact on the canopy.

Drought was found to have a potentially  
moderate impact on the existing tree canopy.

Draft goals and targets

EQUITY

SHARED RESPONSIBILITY 

RESILIENCE

Goal 
Minimum 25% cover per 
neighborhood

Target
Each year, plant X* trees in 
neighborhoods deficient in canopy

Feasibility Analaysis
Six neighborhoods do not currently 
meet the target. Will be difficult to 
achieve in East Cambridge.

Goal
City, residents, universities, 
developers all to increase their 
canopy cover by 10 to 25% by 2050

Target
Each year, each constituent plants X* 
number of trees

Human resilience goal
1. 60% of sidewalks canopy covered. 
2. 50% reduction in the number of 
hotspots (92 degrees when 90 degree 
average) in the R.O.W.

Target 
Each year, plant X* trees in the R.O.W. 

Feasibility Analysis
There is enough plantable area to 
achieve this goal.

Forest Resilience Goal
No more than 10% of a single species, 
20% of a genus and 30% of a family.

 

Target
Each year, plant more of X* species on 
recommended list, fewer of X* species

*Planting target numbers will fluctuate depending on a number of factors such as neighborhood, constituent type, and most recent data on loss rates.

STEM LOSS

GROW CANOPY

SUMMARY
Various tree-related requirements and 
landscape mandates are currently scattered 
throughout City zoning. Most of these 
requirements are tied to narrowly defined site 
uses (such as parking facilities or townhouses) 
and limited districts (such as the Parkway or 
Prospect Street Overlay Districts). 

The Zoning Ordinance also includes 
requirements for setbacks and open space, 
which have implications for the amount of 
area available for planting on sites, but do 
not specifically define the amount of planting 
required.

The concepts behind this strategy  have been 
taken under consideration by the Resilient 
Zoning Task Force.

ANALYSIS
The City of Cambridge could increase the 
minimum front setback and open space 
requirements for all or certain zoning districts 
to increase the amount of space available 
for planting on lots. While many of the 
City’s residential districts have substantial 
requirements, most industrial and business 
districts in the city have little or no front 
setback and open space requirements. 
This would not require the implementation 
of a new concept; rather it would simply 
involve a revision to the existing minimum 
requirements. The city could coordinate 
increased requirements to match the areas 
designated as “high priority” for planting 
and preservation. The City could customize 
enhanced planting areas based on building

142    CAMBRIDGE URBAN FOREST MASTER PLAN  PRELIMINARY REPORT

SUMMARY
Today, Cambridge has 26 percent of its land 
area covered by canopy. Between 2009 and 
2018, the canopy declined on average by 16.4 
acres every year. At this rate, canopy cover will 
be 21.6 percent in 2030. 

This is also a time period in which significant 
redevelopment has taken place, and long-
term plans such as Envision Cambridge are 
currently setting out a vision for the next areas 
of significant development. Zoning is the most 
effective way to influence development, but 
currently Cambridge zoning has little specific 
direction about trees or canopy cover. 

The concepts behind this strategy  have been 
taken under consideration by the Resilient 
Zoning Task Force.

Land Use Type 

ANALYSIS
If the City amended the Zoning Ordinance to 
require specific canopy coverage percentages 
by land use or district, future development 
would be structured to contribute to 
overall City-wide goals. Emphasis or higher 
percentages could be applied to priority areas 
such as canopy corridors through an overlay 
district. If cover requirements were to apply 
citywide, they could be incorporated into the 
existing requirements/standards for open 
space or established as a separate minimum 
requirement alongside the existing setback 
and open space requirements applied to each 
zoning district and land use type.

DESIGN STRATEGY 2B

Plant bare root trees 
in expanded and 
enhanced tree ways 
where possible

SUMMARY
Street trees establish more quickly and survive 
longer, especially in the face of drought 
conditions, when they have larger soil volumes. 
In cases where the back of sidewalk condition is 
pervious, it is beneficial for the long term health 
of the tree to connect the tree pit soil to the back 
of the sidewalk, providing a larger continuous 
soil volume for the roots to access.

IMPACT AREAS

PROS
Improves establishment success and life-span

ANALYSIS
Unless infeasible, the City should improve 
planting pits before installing new trees. 
New or amended soils should be placed in 
the open tree pit, with structural soils under 
sidewalks for root growth into adjacent areas. 
Bare root trees are field grown and shippped 
without soil around the roots. Bare root trees 
are recommended over balled and burlapped 
trees due to the ability to plant a larger number 
of bare root trees and bare root trees being 
quicker to establish. 
CONS
Requires additional investment in each replanting

Provides a strategy that is replicable  
across many sites

Requires more protection as bare root trees are 
more susceptible to damage

PRACTICE STRATEGY 2B

Implement structural 
pruning for young 
trees

SUMMARY
The City does not currently conduct structural 
pruning for young trees and this represents 
a significant opportunity to improve the long 
term health of street and park trees.

ANALYSIS
Structural pruning is a type of pruning typically 
performed on young to middle-aged shade and 
ornamental trees. The objective is to create a 
strong and healthy structure so that trees are 
sturdier under wind, snow and ice loads, and 
less prone to failures, and so they can live full 
and useful lives in the landscape. The sooner 
in the life of the tree that structural pruning 
is started, the easier and less expensive it is. 
Waiting until the tree is mature often means 
larger more disfiguring pruning cuts, cabling 
and much greater expense.

PROS
Avoided long term costs

CONS
New operational costs

Establish a soils 
management program

SUMMARY
Currently the City mulches some of its trees on 
a regular basis, which is a good way to support 
organic matter renewal and good soil function. 
The City has also begun to monitor the impact 
of salts on street tree soil. 

Implementing a program to improve soils 
health represents an important opportunity 
to reduce tree mortality and increase canopy 
growth.

ANALYSIS
Injecting liquid biological amendments 
(compost tea) is an effective method of 
improving and maintaining soil health. The City 
is currently in the process of establishing an 
in-house liquid biological amendment program 
to treat all newly planted trees. Long term, the 
City could develop the capacity to treat all street 
trees once a year on a two year cycle.

PROS
Increased survival rates

Expand watering 
program

SUMMARY
Water availability is the primary determinate of 
tree health. Providing sufficient water during 
establishment, when roots are expanding to 
find additional sources of water is critical to 
their long term success.

ANALYSIS
Given the increased planting targets, the City 
will need to increase its watering program to 
cover an increased number of new trees. In 
addition, the City should consider emergency 
watering during drought.

The current tree contract requires the 
contractor to water newly planted trees for 
three years, and the City currently utilizes the 
Tree Ambassador program to water trees for 
two summers following this initial three year 
period.

PRACTICE STRATEGY 3

Establish a gravel bed 
nursery

IMPACT AREAS

SUMMARY
With municipal tree planting, especially at 
large scale, there is an inevitable holding period 
between digging and acquiring the trees and 
planting them. Balled and burlapped trees 
are less likely to survive if they have extended 
periods out of the ground, so their planting 
season is constrained to a few weeks in spring 
and a few in the fall. If cared for properly, bare 
root trees enjoy the benefit of an extended 
planting season. Root dessication is the most 
critical disadvantage to planting bare root trees, 
however, proper care in a gravel bed nursery 
mitigates the risk. 

ANALYSIS
A gravel bed is an irrigated bed of gravel to 
place and safely hold bare root or washed 
containerized stock (aka  “heeling in”) for up to 
3-6 months.  Doing this dramatically increases 
fibrous root volume, decreasing transplant 
shock and increasing survivability of the plant. 
Since bare root stock is typically only available 
during spring, this also allows for staged 
plantings throughout the year.

8,200 sf of space is required to store 456 bare 
root trees

Support community 
tree planting efforts

SUMMARY
Supporting community tree planting efforts 
may lead citizens to work together and create 
more energy and momentum behind planting 
trees. This may result in groups advocating and 
planting trees within neighborhoods that are 
underserved today.

PRECEDENT
Keep Indianapolis Beautiful is a nonprofit 
organization. They offer a community forestry 
program which residents can apply for tree 
planting if they find at least 20 spots for trees 
in their neighborhood. Applicants need to form 
a small group and need to agree with their 
neighbors and local business owners to commit 
to tree preservation.

OUTREACH AND EDUCATION STRATEGY 1C

Educate local 
businesses about 
the dangers of pest 
outbreaks

IMPACT AREAS

SUMMARY
Businesses can help protect the forest by 
ensuring all wood products are pest free by 
using ISPM 15 regulated wood packaging 
material in international trade. 

ANALYSIS
In 2008, the Asian Longhorn Beetle was found 
in Worcester, MA, presumably brought in 
through wood pallets. The city lost 35,000 trees 
either killed by the beetle or felled by foresters 
working to contain the infestation. 

The ISPM 15 standard describes phytosanitary 
measures that reduce the risk of introduction 
and spread of quarantine pests associated with 
the movement in international trade of wood 
packaging material made from raw wood.

OUTREACH AND EDUCATION STRATEGY 1B

Organize tree tours 
for citizens to 
engage with trees

SUMMARY
Organizing tree tours could foster good working 
relationships between the community and 
DPW. This is something that the City has 
implemented in the past but currently is not in 
practice. 

ANALYSIS
There are examples of guided walking and 
biking tree tours in neighborhoods and parks 
in various cities. For example, the City of 
Chesapeake, Virginia, organizes guided tours 
once every season, or four times a year. There 
are also self-guided tours that allow citizens 
to access a tree map by using smart phones in 
some cities such as Seattle (Tree Walk app), 
Nevada City, Sacramento, and Atlanta.

Publish annual reports 
to document 
progress

SUMMARY
A yearly report card that evaluates the efforts to 
expand the urban forest can remind citizens of 
the state of the forest, communicate the goals of 
this report, and hold communities accountable 
for reaching their goals. 

IMPACT AREAS

PRECEDENTS
Tree Report Card, Washington, D.C.
Cambridge MA Annual Drinking Water Quality Report

ANALYSIS
As an example, Casey Trees’ tree report card 
rates Washington DC’s urban forest based on 
four metrics: Tree coverage, tree health, tree 
planting and tree protection. It also compares 
previous years’ grades. 
As with the Cambridge Water Department’s 
Drinking Water Quality Report, the Urban 
Forest report card could be mailed to all 
residents.

How Is Your Water Purified? 
The source waters of the Cambridge reservoir system undergo extensive treatment at the 
Walter J. Sullivan Water Purification Facility at Fresh Pond Reservation before drinking water 
is delivered to your home or business. The water is treated to exceed all state and federal 
drinking water standards. 

(1) Pretreatment: The first steps in the treatment process combine preoxidation with ozone, 
coagulation and dissolved air flotation (DAF) to remove manganese, natural color, sediment 
and particles, algae, protozoa, viruses and bacteria.

(2) Ozone: Fine bubbles of ozone are dissolved into the water to kill bacteria, viruses, and 
protozoa. 

(3) Filtration: The water passes through granular activated carbon (GAC) to remove organic 
compounds. Filtration also acts as a “polishing step” to remove additional particles, color and 
protozoa. 

(4) Disinfection: Chlorine is used to provide the second step of disinfection for redundancy 
in the overall process and monochloramine is added to maintain a disinfectant residual 
throughout the distribution system.

(5) Post Treatment: The pH of the water is adjusted for corrosion control and fluoride is 
added for dental health.

The Cambridge Water Department’s state-certified laboratory continuously monitors the 
effectiveness of the treatment process and makes adjustments to the treatment to ensure 
the highest quality water.

Come see it for yourself!  Timothy MacDonald, Director of Water Operations, leads tours of 
the City’s beautiful treatment facility. Tours are scheduled for July 9, August 13, September 17, 
October 15, and November 5, and run from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

Go Green 

with Your Machine

There are many ways you can save 
water while still getting clean clothes! 
Combine laundry to run only full 
loads, and check out the settings 
on your machine to select the right 
water levels and load selection. Also, 
by switching to an EPA WaterSense 
washing machine, you can save an 
average of 82 gallons per day, which 
adds up to around 30,000 gallons per 
year, enough to fill a Red Line train car!

Where Does Your Water Come From?

Reservoirs
The Cambridge Water System extends across 
four towns and includes four bodies of water. 
The Hobbs Brook Upper Reservoir flows into 
the Hobbs Brook Lower Reservoir and connects 
with the Stony Brook Reservoir. The water then 
flows to the Fresh Pond Reservoir through 
an underground aqueduct. The Stony Brook 
Reservoir watershed extends from Weston 
north into the Town of Lincoln. The watershed 
for the Hobbs Brook Reservoirs includes 
areas of Waltham, Lexington, and Lincoln. 
The watershed for the Fresh Pond Reservoir is 
completely within the City of Cambridge. Storm 
drainage modifications were implemented 
to divert street runoff away from Fresh Pond 
Reservoir. The contributing watershed area 
is the first step in a multi-barrier program to 
protect our drinking water. The combined 
capacity of the Hobbs Brook and Stony Brook 
reservoir system is 3.1 billion gallons; an 
additional 1.3 billion gallons of water is stored  
in Fresh Pond Reservoir. Our water supply 
is backed up by interconnections to the 
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority 
(MWRA) system. For a more detailed map of  
our water sources and their protection areas 
please visit cambridgema.gov/water

Watershed Protection
As part of our ongoing commitment to 
protecting the water supply, we participated 
with the Massachusetts Department of 
Environmental Protection (MassDEP) in 
preparing a Source Water Assessment Program 
(SWAP) Report completed in 2003. The SWAP 
Report assesses the susceptibility of our public 
water supply and notes the key land use and 
protection issues, including: Zone A Land 

Uses, Residential Land Uses, Transportation 
Corridors, Hazardous Material Storage and Use, 
and Presence of Oil or Hazardous Materials 
Contamination Sites. A copy of the Cambridge 
SWAP Report can be found on the MassDEP 
website at mass.gov/eea/docs/dep/water/
drinking/swap/nero/3049000.pdf or at the 
Cambridge Water Department.

Because of the developed nature and types of 
land uses within the Cambridge watershed, our 
source waters are considered as having “high” 
susceptibility to contamination. Susceptibility 
is a measure of a water supply’s potential to 
become contaminated due to land uses and 
activities within its recharge (watershed) area. If 
a source is susceptible to contamination, it does 
not necessarily mean the source has poor water 
quality. The Cambridge Water Department 
has taken the following actions to minimize 
contamination threats to our water supply:

 6 Work cooperatively with watershed towns 
on emergency response and stormwater 
management

 6 Placed spill kits at strategic points within the 

watershed

 6 Actively monitor source water quality 

throughout the watersheds, using the data  
to target source protection

 6 Work cooperatively with businesses in the 
watersheds to encourage source protection

 6 Adopted the Fresh Pond Master Plan, which 
includes long-term protection measures for 
the Fresh Pond Reservation

 6 Dedicated staff resources to inspections, 

public education, and coordination of source 
protection efforts

How Much Energy Does it Take?
 6 The Water Purification Facility (WPF) has 
the largest electrical usage for a single 
municipal facility in the City of Cambridge

 6 The WPF uses an average of 8 million 

kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity per year, 
or enough to power over 1,000 homes¥
  

 6 At one time, pumping accounted for over 
60% of the total energy use at the WPF.  
We have reduced that by over 50% since 2012!

In 2011, the Watershed Division of the 
Cambridge Water Department updated its 
comprehensive Source Water Protection 
Program. The major components of the 
program to ensure a continuous supply of high 
quality water include: 
1.   Extensive monitoring – sampling and 

analysis of water chemistry and microbiology
2.   Hazardous materials emergency response 

planning – to reduce the potential for 
contamination in the watershed

3.   Partnership development – relationship-

building with other parties in the watershed 
with common goals

4.   Proactive site review and monitoring – 
to minimize potential impacts on the 
watershed from construction

5.   Stormwater management – ensuring that 

Best Management Practices are implemented
6.   Community outreach – public relations and 

education

For questions about our source water  
and our protection efforts, please contact 
Watershed Manager David Kaplan at  
dkaplan@cambridgema. gov or 617-349-4799.

You Can Save Money!
The Water Department 
is updating the 
Automated Meter 
Reading (AMR) System 
for improved service. 
We are replacing the 
Meter Transmitting 
Units (MTUs) so we 
can provide actual 
(not estimated) 
water bill readings 
quarterly. The MTU is 
the device connected 
to your water meter 
that transmits 
meter readings to the Water Department. 
This “High Read” program notifies our 
customers soon after we detect unusually 
high water usage, which is typically caused 
by a leak. This notification allows property 
owners to make repairs quickly, saving 
you money and conserving water! 

Rooftop receiving unit 
for daily readings from 
customers’ meters.

We need property owners to update their 
contact information so the Water Department 
can notify you as soon as a “High-Read”  
is detected. Please call Brian McCoy at 
617-349-4737 or email him at HighReads@
cambridgema.gov with your name, account 
number, phone number, mailing address, and 
email address.

UFMP TECHNICAL REPORT  REVIEWNOVEMBER 12, 2019TREE PROTECTION ORDINANCE
Values

Trees are a shared resource

Everyone is subject to the tree  
ordinance

Trees provide benefits to the city

Voluntary removals necessitate a fee 
that reflects the value of the lost  
resource

Large trees provide greater benefits 
and take longer to regrow

Mitigation requirements are propor-
tionately higher for larger trees, and

The city’s largest trees receive special  
protection

The process should be simple  
and objective

Homeowners and small projects can use a 
streamlined replacement formula, and

Large projects use the exiting special permit 
process and a standard valuation formula

Not all trees are equal

Fees are computed based on health, loca-
tion, and species of tree

The process should be equitable

Owner-occupied properties have reduced  
mitigation requirements, and

Those on financial assistance have all fees 
waived

Replanting in kind is preferred,  
but not all sites and project types 
are equal

The ordinance encourages on-site  
replacement, 

Allows off-site mitigation planting, and

Makes fees paid to the tree fund the 
most expensive option

Committee on Public Planting Comments on UFMP Technical Report

Committee on Public Planting

January 9, 2020

Dear City Staff, Reed Hilderbrand Consultant Team, City Manager, and City Council Members:

As a result of the work presented in the Cambridge Urban Forest Master Plan Technical Report 
released in November 2019, we are poised to make a big difference in tree canopy coverage in the 
City of Cambridge. We appreciate the thoughtful and comprehensive scope of the report, the 
expertise of the consultants and task force, and the City’s 
commitment.

Our urban forest and its trees must be valued for what they are: as important as our gas, electric, 
water, and communications lines, our streets, sidewalks, and bicycle lanes. Our trees are living 
infrastructure that are essential to Cambridge’s livability and resilience in the face of accelerating 
climate change. As the Technical Report states, trees mitigate flooding, reduce energy consumption, 
cool urban heat islands, improve public mental and physical health, boost property values, and 
increase tax revenue. The trees clean the air and help to stabilize the climate by sequestering carbon 
above and below ground.

 

Page 29 of the Technical Report states: “...there is no single department or individual who speaks for 
the urban forest”. The Committee on Public Planting recommends that the UFMP include in its Master 
Plan a city position to implement an Accelerated Action Plan (described below). This person would 
integrate horticulture, ecology, and design; would be responsible for the urban forest; and would 
ensure compliance. He or she would coordinate with DPW, CDD, Public Health, TPT, Water 
Department, and the School Department. Staffing would be hired and/or assigned in those 
departments to implement initiatives suggested in the report.

In addition, the Committee strongly recommends an Accelerated Action Plan that includes all of the 
Policy, Design, Practice, and Outreach Strategies detailed in the Technical Report.

We would like to emphasize:

(cid:127)   Establishing zoning regulations requiring shade trees with adequate space and suitable soil 
for them to grow.

(cid:127)   Ensuring that all neighborhoods and housing types are equitably planted with trees.

(cid:127)   Conducting compliance inspections for tree planting before obtaining certificates of 
occupancy.

(cid:127)   Implementing cool-corridor tree planting at closest appropriate intervals on all major 
corridors.

(cid:127)   Redesigning streets within the City’s ongoing Five-Year Street and Sidewalk reconstruction 
program with tree, bike, and pedestrian infrastructure given priority.

(cid:127)   Increasing canopy planting, using diverse species, in parks, schools, the riverfront, and 
cemeteries.

(cid:127)   Acquiring land for parks by the city in areas identified as heat island—a critical goal.

(cid:127)   Achieving a canopy goal of 40% (National Academy of Sciences states that 40% is the 
minimum adequate to achieve cooling).

(cid:127)   Enhancing protection for existing trees on public and private property. For developers, 
increasing calculations of payments to the tree fund, that reflect the true value of our urban 
forest.

(cid:127)   Working with large property owners (Harvard, MIT, DCR, DOT) to increase the tree canopy 
on their land. 

We believe that the climate crisis demands accelerated and decisive action to expand and enhance 
our urban forest; therefore, we recommend launching these initiatives immediately.

Trees are not decorative landscape elements; they are our environmental infrastructure. They are 
critical to urban survival and quality of life. Our trees are meaningful and beloved by citizens. They 
provide a habitat for birds and pollinators, and a connection to the natural world for urban dwellers. 
Cambridge residents recognize the value of trees and have voted for planting more trees as a top 
priority in Participatory Budgeting again this year. 

We look forward to continuing to support and work with the city on our shared goals, and to a 
“brighter, more shaded future”.

 

 

Respectfully,

 

The Cambridge Committee on Public Planting

Tree canopy protection..please extend it

So...please please renew the moratorium.

Thank you

Helen Snively

The tree task force did a good job..but it took longer than expected. Meanwhile the moratorium on cutting is running 
out. And we need it.

Trees Matter!

Please extend the moratorium on removing healthy significant trees on private property through December 31, allowing
appropriate time for the ordinance to be amended in alignment with the recommendations from the Urban 
Forest Master Plan Task Force without hasting through the process. 

Preserving and expanding our tree canopy benefits all Cambridge citizens. There is no reason to let the 
moratorium expire.

Thank you,
Elisabeth Werby

Support for Policy Orders 2, 4 & #255 on Surveillance

Dear Honorable Mayor Siddiqui and City Councilors,

Congratulations on beginning the new term! I look forward to two years of governance by a dream team of 
policymaker public servants. I seriously think this Council will get a lot done that we can all agree on. I am 
writing to offer my detailed support for Policy Order 4 as well as mention my support for Policy Order 2 
reporting on stakeholder meetings addressing tourism and the arts and #255 from December on an 
Amendment to the Surveillance Ordinance.

Support for Policy Order #4: I am offering my support for an extension to the amendments of the Tree 
Protection Ordinance, because I believe that the Ordinance is working. In North Cambridge, I saw several 
homes with tree-filled setbacks go on the market over the summer. When construction began in the fall, the 
trees were either left in place or removed after receiving a permit. This was a departure from the "clear cut 
because it makes the property easier to work with" mentality which has exacerbated our city's tree loss over 
the past decade.

While working as the Supervisor to the Tree Ambassadors over the summer, I was flagged down by several 
contractors who identified me as an employee under the Cambridge arborist. They made an effort to show me 
how they were working around the trees or, if they were in the process of removal, told me they had received 
a permit. I hadn't asked for this information, but clearly the folks working on the houses were aware that 
trees were a priority in Cambridge and that there were new, enforceable requirements.

I have many students who work on renovation projects and they will admit that a common approach is to just 
remove the trees in front and behind houses to place dumpsters and more easily move around the property. 
But, my students have also told me that clear cutting isn't the only option, and that with disincentives and 
forethought it can in many cases be avoided. This policy is causing folks redeveloping homes in the city to 
think twice before clearing out their property's open space.

I would also like to add that the Department of Forestry is doing an excellent job helping folks encountering 
the Ordinance understand it better. Over the summer, I witnessed many phone calls by developers and 
contractors to the Superintendent of Urban Forestry, Andrew Putnam. Andrew handled the calls well, 
explaining clearly how the regulations applied, what terms like "significant tree removal" and "dead or 
dangerous" meant, as well as walking callers through the process of applying for a permit if removal was 
necessary. The folks calling Andrew also clearly wanted to make sure their actions were above board. As a 
concerned neighbor, I experienced how thorough Andrew and his staff were. After three trees visible from the 
street were cut down at 64 Richdale, I emailed Andrew to inquire about if the new owners had obtained a 
permit. Andrew responded quickly with a screenshot of the permits attached to the property, including those 
for tree removal. This is to say, not only does the ordinance amendment seem to be working, but it seems 
that the officials tasked with implementing the regulations have a handle on them.

Support for PO#4

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and City Councillors,

I am writing in support of PO#4 to extend the TPO through the end of 2020.

essential component of Cambridge's resilience to climate change.

I am a member of the 

Please vote to extend the moratorium until the Urban Forest Master Plan/Task Force has completed 
its work and made recommendations, to ensure an effective and considered TPO.

Sincerely,
Florrie Wescoat

City of Cambridge 

O- 
Calendar Item #  
IN CITY COUNCIL 
January 27, 2020 

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
 
WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

Cambridge’s tree canopy has shrunk by nearly 20% over the last decade; and 
 
Amendments made to the Tree Protection Ordinance (TPO) last year which restrict the 
removal of “significant trees” on private property will expire on March 11, 2020 if no 
action is taken; and 
 
On November 12, 2019, the city and consultants presented a thorough and impressive 
report to the Health & Environment Committee on a long term approach to reversing 
the canopy decline, rooted in recommendations from the Urban Forest Master Plan 
Task Force which met 13 times between June 2018 and April 2019; and 
 
The report, which contains numerous recommendations on lasting changes that should 
be made to the TPO, was originally scheduled to be released in June 2019 but was 
delayed; and 
 
The report is excellent and deserves careful deliberation and discussion by the city 
council, and it would be a great disservice to rush this conversation in an attempt to 
overhaul the ordinance ahead of the March 11, 2020 expiration date; and 
 
At the same time, it would be a travesty to let the temporary amendments to the TPO 
expire without any new language, as doing so would almost certainly result in a 
massive citywide cutting spree, worsening our canopy decline and erasing any positive 
impact the temporary amendments might have had; now therefore be it 
 

Packet Pg. 382

ORDERED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

 

That section 8.66.055 of the municipal ordinances of the City of Cambridge, entitled 
“Procedure for Other Significant Tree Removals” be amend by substitution to read as 
follows: 
 
“For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050, a permit will be required 
from the City Arborist. In all cases, the City Arborist shall keep a record of the type 
and size of tree removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the tree 
documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractor(s) involved, and the name 
and address of the property owner. No such permits will be issued until December 31, 
2020 or sooner by further amendment to this section, except for emergency 
circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects undertaken pursuant to State or 
Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, or where a tree poses 
significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or for dead or dangerous 
trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the removal of certain 
significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree canopy. Any tree 
removed in violation of this section, prior to December 31, 2020, shall require a 
payment into the tree replacement fund as per section 8.66.070 according to a schedule 
as follows:  10% of the replacement value for property owners who qualify for the City 
of Cambridge residential real property tax exemption, no fee for property owners that 
receive established forms of financial assistance, and the full replacement cost in all 
other circumstances. The value to be paid into the tree replacement fund shall be 
equivalent to the cost of purchasing, planting, watering and maintaining said 
Replacement Trees for a period of not less than five years.” 
 
 
 
That the City Council go on record expressing a clear intent to pass comprehensive 
amendments to the TPO, based off the recommendations of the task force, well ahead 
the new proposed deadline of December 2020.

comes on passing to be ordained.
