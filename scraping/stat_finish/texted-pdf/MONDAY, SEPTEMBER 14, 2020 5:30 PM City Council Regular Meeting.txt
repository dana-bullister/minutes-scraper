To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $100,000, received from Harvard University, to the 
Grant Fund Human Service Programs Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account. 
 
The funds combined with City funding of $150,000 will support the operation of the Y2Y 
Shelter from August through December. The City has provided funding to support the shelter’s 
operations since April 2020, when the Y2Y shelter would normally have closed until mid-
November because of the schedule of the students. The Y2Y shelter has been operating with 
non-student professional staff since that time. The funding from Harvard, combined with the 
City funding will pay for the staff and extra cleaning required because of the pandemic.

Date:   September 9, 2020  

Re:

Jerry’s Pond and discussing next steps in the potential restoration and

In response to the above-mentioned policy orders, the Community Development 
Department (CDD) and Department of Public Works (DPW) report the following:  
 
The North Cambridge site containing Jerry’s Pond and its surrounding environs was 
recently acquired by IQHQ from GCP Applied Technologies. CDD has reached out 
to representatives of IQHQ to schedule a meeting between the new owners of the site 
and key City departments. The purpose of this meeting will be to familiarize IQHQ with 
the recommendations of the Alewife District Plan and the Alewife Preparedness Plan; 
and to ensure they are aware of the community’s expressed desire to beautify Jerry’s 
Pond and improve connections to nearby open spaces and pedestrian and bicycle 
facilities, while understanding the environmental hazards and the need to safely 
manage the site. The Alewife District Plan outlines recommendations for open space 
improvements in the area as well as a zoning framework that could provide incentives 
to realize these improvements through development. The Alewife Preparedness Plan 
provides strategies to create a prepared and resilient Alewife area that is responsive to 
climate change threats including heat, flooding from precipitation and flooding from sea 
level rise/storm surge and provides resilience strategies that will need to implemented 
with any redevelopment of the site.  
 
Much of the 26-acre site is enclosed by fencing, including Jerry’s Pond (also known as 
Jerry’s Pit). Jerry’s Pond is an artificial pond that was created about 1870 from a disused 
clay pit. The clay pit was subsequently filled with water and an icehouse was built 
around 1907. Though the property was privately owned, Jerry’s Pit was well known as a 
neighborhood swimming hole until the Francis J. McCrehan Pool opened in 1961. The 
property has housed other uses throughout its history, including manufacturing. Today, 
a large portion of the site today is not developed.

The City anticipates working with IQHQ toward the realization of the vision for the 
district at this site. Given the potentially broad scope of open space improvements and 
the environmental risks associated with remediation and infrastructure work, discussion 
of future improvements would be expected to include property owners, residents, and 
other community stakeholders that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.   

Over the past two years the City has undertaken numerous improvements to several 
areas within its jurisdiction near the Jerry’s Pond site and adjacent to the existing public

In addition, as initially indicated in the council order response dated August 27th, 2019, 
the City has engaged and coordinated with the Department of Conservation and 
Recreation (DCR) and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 
(MBTA) to encourage improvements to the broader area. The following is an update:  

•  DCR agreed to remove a portion of the post fence between the edge of Jerry’s 
Pond and Alewife Brook Parkway along Rindge Avenue. This will provide easier 
access and facilitate maintenance to this area. The City has indicated to DCR its 
willingness to maintain this area.

•  DCR did not support the City’s request to de-pave and plant sections of the 
concrete median at the intersection of Rindge Avenue and Alewife Brook 
Parkway, due to concerns with sight lines.  

•  The City requested that the MBTA remove the dead Sycamore trees near station 

headhouse and consider replanting and establishing maintenance 
procedures for new trees.  The MBTA indicated that they would work to remove 
and replace these trees. We are presently awaiting an update from them and 
will forward such to City Council once we receive it.

Fossil Fuel Zoning Petition (Amendments to Article 22.000 of the 
Zoning Ordinance) 

Recommendation:  The Planning Board recommends ADOPTION, following further study 

and refinement. 

To the Honorable, the City Council, 

On August 18, 2020, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing on a City Council 
zoning petition (the “Petition”) to amend Article 22.000 of the Zoning Ordinance by creating a 
new Paragraph 22.25.2(d) within the Green Building Requirements.  The Petition would amend 
the administrative review procedure at the building permit phase to require the submission of a 
plan that uses alternative and renewable energy sources as well as an analysis of the feasibility 
and cost of installing such a system compared with a fossil fueled energy system.  The Petition 
does not mandate that a non-fossil fuel system be installed; rather, its intent is to gather data 
about the options available to developers regarding clean energy systems. 

Following discussion with City Councillor Dennis Carlone, who presented the Petition, the 
Board voted to submit a favorable recommendation to the City Council, acknowledging the need 
for further refinement.  Board members agreed that it would be beneficial to collect data on the 
feasibility of using renewable energy sources.  Board members suggested that some aspects of 
the petition could be rethought or clarified, including whether off-site or on-site renewable 
energy options should be studied, how the requested information would relate to analogous state 
energy codes, and when in the permitting process it would be most beneficial to receive the 
required information. Board members would encourage working with City staff to refine the 
language of the Petition and to address considerations raised in the Community Development 
Department memo to the Planning Board dated August 13, 2020. Overall, the Board supports the 
Petition as an incremental step towards advancing the City’s climate goals. 

Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) Zoning Petition 

Recommendation: 

The Planning Board recommends ADOPTION. 

To the Honorable, the City Council, 

On August 4, 2020, the Planning Board (the “Board”) held a public hearing to discuss the 
Affordable Housing Overlay City Council Zoning Petition (the “Petition”). Board members 
heard an introductory statement from Councillor Marc McGovern, who sponsored the Petition, a 
presentation from Community Development Department (CDD) staff, and testimony from the 
public.  

Board members asked clarifying questions of staff regarding the applicability of the proposed 
AHO Design Guidelines in relation to the proposed zoning, the role of the Board in project 
review if the AHO is adopted, and the rationale for specific dimensional requirements in the 
Petition. 

The majority of Board members expressed strong support for the AHO in concept, and 
recognized that the AHO is an important step in addressing the challenge of housing 
unaffordability in Cambridge by removing barriers to the production of affordable housing. The 
majority of Board members agreed that an as-of-right approval process for AHO projects is 
crucial to provide a level of certainty to developers of AHO projects, and that a citywide 
approach is necessary to promote goals of equity. Board members acknowledged that the Petition 
might not be perfect, and some Board members expressed concerns around details such as 
parking and dimensional standards, but it was noted that there is an evaluation process built into 
the zoning and that adjustments could be made over time to better meet the desired goals. Some 
Board members reflected on this Petition as an opportunity to acknowledge and address the 
broader role that zoning has played over time in furthering segregation and social inequity.  

At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board voted 7-1 in favor of recommending adoption of 
the Petition as referred. 

Respectfully submitted for the Planning Board,

Catherine Preston Connolly, Chair.

Re: 

Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) Zoning Petition Follow-Up Items 

 
 
At its hearing on August 19, 2020, the Ordinance Committee voted to request that CDD 
staff prepare diagrammatic illustrations of step-down requirements in current zoning for 
buildings in taller-height zoning districts abutting lower-height zoning districts. Although 
there is no universal step-down requirement in current zoning, there are four instances 
where such regulations exist. In cases where there is at least a 20-foot difference in 
height limits between adjoining districts, large developments (≥ 25,000 square feet) are 
subject to requirements in Section 19.52. Also, in specific Business zoning districts 
(Business A-2, Business A-4, and Business C/C-1) there are step-down requirements 
where buildings are adjacent to residential zoning districts. Illustrations of these 
requirements are appended hereto. 
 
In addition, after receiving the full text of the AHO Zoning Petition as recommended by 
the Ordinance Committee, CDD staff reviewed the zoning text and identified some 
typographical, grammatical, or similar errors that should be corrected. The attached 
petition text draft includes a set of suggested corrections.

Units within the project shall be occupied by AHO 
Eligible Households whose gross household income 
upon  initial  occupancy  is  no  more  than  eighty 
percent (80%) of AMI. 

(iii)  Rent, including utilities and any other fees routinely 
charged to tenants and approved by CDD, shall not 
exceed thirty percent (30%) of the gross household 
income  of  the  AHO  Eligible  Household  occupying 
the  AHO  Dwelling  Unit  or  other  similar  standard 
pursuant  to an applicable housing subsidy program 
which has been approved by CDD. 

(v) 

(iv)  After initial occupancy, the gross household income 
of  an  AHO  Eligible  Household  shall  be  verified 
annually,  or  on  such  other  basis  required  by  an 
applicable housing subsidy program which has been 
to  determine  continued 
approved  by  CDD, 
eligibility  and  rent,  in  accordance  with  policies, 
standards, and procedures established by CDD.  
An  AHO  Eligible  Household  may  continue  to  rent 
an AHO Dwelling Unit after initial occupancy even 
if  the  AHO  Eligible  Household’s  gross  household 
income exceeds the eligibility limits set forth above, 
but  may  not  exceed  one  hundred  twenty  percent 
(120%)  of  AMI  for  more  than  one  year  after  that 
Eligible  Household’s  gross  household  income  has 
been  verified  to  exceed  such  percentage,  unless 
to  an  applicable 
otherwise  restricted  pursuant 
housing subsidy program which has been approved 
by CDD. 

(vi)  Notwithstanding  the  requirements  set  forth  in  (i) 
through (v) above, an owner may voluntarily choose 
to  charge  a  lower  rent  than  as  provided  herein  for 
AHO Dwelling Units. 

For owner-occupied AHO Dwelling Units: 
(i) 

The  gross  household  income  of  an  AHO  Eligible 
Household upon initial occupancy shall be no more 
than one-hundred percent (100%) of AMI.

1.24.a

Building  façades  shall  incorporate  architectural  elements 
that project or recess by at least two feet from the adjacent 
section of the façade. Such projecting or recessed elements 
shall  occur  on  an  average  interval  of  40  linear  horizontal 
feet  or  less  for  portions  of  the  façade  directly  facing  a 
public  street,  and  on  an  average  interval  of  80  linear 
horizontal feet or less for other portions of the façade. Such 
projecting or recessed elements shall not be required on the 
lowest  Story  Above  Grade  or  on  the  highest  Story  Above 
Grade, and shall not be required on the highest two Stories 
Above  Grade  of  a  building  containing  at  least  six  Stories 
Above Grade. The intent is to incorporate elements such as 
bays,  balconies,  cornices,  shading  devices,  or  similar 
architectural  elements  that  promote  visual  interest  and 
residential  character,  and  to  allow  variation  at  the  ground 
floor  and  on  upper  floors  where  a  different  architectural 
treatment may be preferable. 

Ground Stories and Stories Below Grade 

The elevation at floor level of the Ground Story shall be at 
the  mean  Grade  of  the  abutting  public  sidewalk,  or  above 
such  mean  Grade  by  not  more  than  four  feet.  Active  non-
residential  uses  at  the  Ground  Story  shall  be  accessible 
directly from the sidewalk without requiring use of stairs or 
a lift. The requirements of this paragraph shall not apply if 
it is determined by the City Engineer that a higher Ground 
Story  elevation  is  necessary  for  the  purpose  of  flood 
protection. 

11.207.7.4 
(a) 

(b)  Where  structured  parking  is  provided  within  the  Ground 
Story of a building, the portion of the building immediately 
behind the front wall plane shall consist of residential units, 
common areas, or other populated portions of the building 
in  order  to  screen  the  provided  parking  over  at  least 
seventy-five  percent  (75%)  of  the  length  of  the  façade 
measured parallel to the street and excluding portions of the 
façade  used  for  driveway  access.  On  a  corner  lot,  the 
requirements  of  this  Paragraph  shall  only  apply  along  one 
street. 
The  façade  of  a  Ground  Story  facing  a  public  street  shall 
consist of expanses no longer than twenty-five (25) feet in 
length,  measured  parallel  to  the  street,  which  contain  no 
transparent windows or pedestrian entryways.

Advisory Design Consultation Procedure 

11.207.8 
Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO 
Project  shall  comply  with  the  following  procedure,  which  is 
intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and 
staff input into the design of the project. 
(a) 

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance 
the  City’s  desired  outcomes  for  the  form  and  character  of 
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable  housing  units,  AHO  Projects  are  permitted  to 
have  a  greater  height,  scale,  and  density  than  other 
developments  permitted  by the  zoning for a given district. 
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that 
are  compatible  with  the  existing  neighborhood  context  or 
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 
The  City’s  “Design  Guidelines  for  100%  Affordable 
Housing  Overlay,”  along  with  other  design  objectives  and 
guidelines  established for the  part of  the  city in which the 
AHO  Project  is  located,  are  intended  to  inform the  design 
of  AHO  Projects  and  to  guide  the  Planning  Board’s 
consultation  and  report  as  set  forth  below.  It  is  intended 
that  designers  of  AHO  Projects,  City  staff,  the  Planning 
Board,  and  the  general  public  will  be  open  to  creative 
variations  from  any  detailed  provisions  set  forth  in  such 
objectives  and  guidelines  as  long  as  the  core  values 
expressed are being served. 
At  least  two  community  meetings  shall  be  scheduled  at  a 
time  and  location  that  is  convenient  to  residents  in 
proximity to the project site. The Community Development 
Department  (CDD)  shall  be  notified  of  the  time  and 
location  of  such  meetings,  and  shall  give  notification  to 
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or 
private  street  or  way,  and  abutters  to  the  abutters  within 
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which 
the  AHO  Project  is  proposed  and  to  any  individual  or 
organization  who  each  year  files  with  CDD  a  written 
request  for  such  notification,  or  to  any  other  individual  or 
organization CDD may wish to notify.

documents at a second design consultation meeting, which 
shall  proceed  in  accordance  with  Paragraphs  (c)  and  (d) 
above.  Following  the  second  design  consultation,  the 
Planning Board may submit a revised report and either the 
revised report or  if there are no revisions the initial report 
shall  become  the  final  report  (the  “Final  Report”).  Any 
additional  design  consultations  to  review  further  revisions 
may occur only at the discretion and on the request of the 
developer or the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) for 
FY2021. For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa 
Peterson, dated September 10, 2020. 
 
The CPA process included a virtual public hearing held on July 1, 2020 to solicit proposals and ideas on 
CPA projects for FY2021. A second virtual public hearing was held on August 5, 2020 to solicit 
recommendations on the percentage of CPA funds allocated to each funding category: Affordable 
Housing, Historic Preservation, and Open Space. The CPAC also received several online submissions, e-
mails and mailed comments regarding potential CPA projects and the allocation percentages. The CPAC, 
on September 9, 2020, voted 7-1 for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historic 
Preservation projects and 10% for Open Space projects. 
 
In accordance with the CPAC’s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a 
total of $15,330,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2021 CPA surcharge, the FY2020 state match 
funds received in FY2021 and a portion of the existing CPA Fund Balance.  
 
For this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2021 will 
total $10,500,000, added to an anticipated FY2020 state match of $2,150,000 and an additional 
$2,670,000 from CPA Fund Balance.  Additionally, $10,000 from CPA Fund Balance will go to the 
City’s annual membership in the Community Preservation Coalition.   
 
On September 9, 2020 the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these FY2021 funds. By 
unanimous votes, the CPAC recommended to the City Council, through the City Manager, that the 
CPA funds be allocated and appropriated as follows: 
 
VOTE 1:  Fiscal Year 2021 Local Funds ($10,500,000) 

Vote 1A 
80% of FY2021 CPA Local Fund revenues ($8,400,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and

Allocation and Appropriation of FY2021 CPA Funds  

To:    Louis DePasquale, City Manager  
From:  Lisa Peterson, Chair of Community Preservation Act Committee 
Date:  September 10, 2020 
Re: 
 
The purpose of this memo is to summarize the process of the Community Preservation Act Committee 
(CPAC) and to convey the Committee’s recommendations for FY2021 CPA funding, voted on by the 
CPAC on September 9, 2020.  
 
The Committee met four times: June 10, 2020 (Organizing Meeting & Hearing on COVID-19 Housing 
Stabilization Program), July 1, 2020 (Project Recommendation Hearing), August 5, 2020 (Allocation 
Percentages Hearing), and September 9, 2020 (Project and Allocation Vote Meeting).  The Committee’s 
recommendations are based on public comments and City staff presentations received at the July 1, 2020 
and August 5, 2020 hearings, as well as public comment submitted electronically or via mail while the 
record remained open.   
 
The Committee received comments as follows:  

  10 public speakers at the July 1, 2020 hearing; 
  12 public speakers at the August 5, 2020 hearing; 
  174 communications received via electronic or mail submission; and  
  3 emailed petitions with a total of 198 signatures. 

 
The Committee received 16 comments related to CPA projects: 
  4 comments supported affordable housing initiatives; 
  8 comments supported historic preservation projects; and 
  4 comments supported open space projects. 

 
The Committee received 368 comments on the allocation percentages:  

  166 individual comments supported an 80% allocation to affordable housing;  
  198 petition signatures, from 3 petitions, supported an 80% allocation to affordable housing; and 
  4 comments supported a 60% allocation to affordable housing and a 20%, 20% split between 

historic preservation and open space. 

All comments received by the Committee are available on the CPA website at FY21 CPA Public 
Comment.  The attached FY21 Project Recommendations Book provides additional detail on the 
Committee’s process, funding and recommended projects for FY21.   

Accordingly, on September 9, 2020, the CPAC voted on the following recommendations to the City 
Council, through the City Manager. The CPAC voted 7-1 for an allocation of 80% for Affordable 
Housing, 10% for Historic Preservation projects and 10% for Open Space projects.  The Committee then 
voted unanimously to recommend that CPA funds in the amount of $15,330,000 be allocated and 
appropriated as follows: 

VOTE 1:  Fiscal Year 2021 Local Funds ($10,500,000) 

Vote 1A 
80% of FY2021 CPA Local Fund revenues ($8,400,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and 
appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust

Community Preservation Act: History & Overview 
 

Funding provided for: 

 

  Affordable Housing 
  Historic Preservation 
  Open Space  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Community Preservation Act (CPA) was created in 2000 by state law (G.L. c. 44B) to help cities and 
towns preserve the character of their communities.  In 2001, Cambridge residents voted to adopt the 
CPA  locally,  which  allowed  the  City  to  implement  a  3%  surcharge  on  Property  Tax  bills  (with  certain 
residential exemptions) to fund affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space initiatives.  
 
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides matching funds in addition to those raised locally by the 
surcharge.  The percentage of the state match varies from year to year, depending on two factors: the 
amount of fees paid at Registries of Deeds throughout the state, and the number of communities that 
have  adopted  the  CPA  locally  (thereby  receiving  a  share  of  the  state  match).    CPA  revenues  are 
maintained in a dedicated City account – the CPA Fund.    
 
Each year, the City is required to spend at least 10% of its annual CPA revenues on each CPA category – 
affordable  housing,  historic  preservation,  and  open  space.    The  remaining  percentage  can  be  used 
towards  any  of  the  three  funding  categories.    In  July  2012,  the  state  statute  was  amended  to  allow 
greater flexibility in the use of CPA open space funds.  Open space funds may also go toward active and 
passive recreational uses such as parks, playgrounds, community gardens and athletic fields. 
 
The CPA process is overseen by the Community Preservation Act Committee.  The Committee is a nine-
member  public  body,  responsible  for  evaluating  the  City’s  community  preservation  needs.    The 
Committee receives input from the public and city staff and makes funding recommendations to the City 
Manager and City Council.

CPA Committee Process 
 

Each year, the CPA Committee holds a series of public meetings on potential projects and the 
percentage of funds that should be dedicated to each CPA category.  The CPA Committee meetings to 
consider CPA funding for FY21 were as follows: 
 

Hearing on COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program & FY21 Organizing Meeting – June 10, 
2020  

The Committee voted to recommend the allocation of $1,000,000 from the CPA Fund 
Balance (not FY21 funding) to the City’s Covid-19 Housing Stabilization Program.  The 
Committee also set its schedule, presented CPA background and process, and discussed the 
FY21 funding estimate.   

Hearing on FY21 Project Recommendations – July 1, 2020  

The Committee received project recommendations from the public and city staff.   

Hearing on FY21 Allocation Percentages – August 5, 2020  

The Committee received input on the funding allocation percentages for affordable 
housing, historic preservation, and open space. 

FY21 Project and Allocation Vote Meeting – September 9, 2020  

The Committee voted to recommend the funding allocation percentages and certain 
projects for FY21 CPA funding.

CPA Fund Allocations & Appropriations: FY02-20 Summary 
 
In each fiscal year, CPA funds are appropriated and allocated from three distinct sources: (1) CPA Local 
Funds  generated  by  the  3%  Property  Tax  bill  surcharge;  (2)  State  Match  revenues  generated  by  the 
Commonwealth’s matching funds; and (3) the CPA Fund Balance, made up of monies in the CPA Fund 
not appropriated in earlier fiscal years.

$2,150,000 

$2,680,000* 

*Includes $10,000 appropriation for Community Preservation Coalition Membership 

 

 

A percentage of the funds from each source is in turn dedicated to one of three CPA funding 
categories: Affordable Housing, Historic Preservation or Open Space.  Each category must receive at 
least 10% of the CPA funds each year.  Funds dedicated to Affordable Housing are transferred to the 
Affordable Housing Trust, while funds dedicated to Historic Preservation and Open Space typically go 
toward specific projects.  A summary of the allocations and appropriations from each funding source, 
and to each funding category, is below.

Affordable Housing 

Funds dedicated to Affordable Housing initiatives are typically transferred to the Affordable Housing 
Trust rather than being allocated to a particular project by the CPA Committee.  The Trust leverages its 
expertise to direct CPA funds to a variety of critical affordable housing initiatives throughout the City.

COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program  

In June 2020, in recognition of the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CPA Committee 
recommended $1,000,000 in one-time, direct funding for a new COVID-19 Housing Stabilization 
Program.  This short-term financial assistance program is administered jointly by the City Manager’s 
Office through the Office of the Housing Liaison, the Department of Human Services Programs through 
the Multi-Service Center, and the Community Development Department. 

Maximizing Affordable Housing Support 

CPA funds provide more than a one-time direct appropriation; CPA funds committed to affordable 
housing have leveraged more than $500 million from other public and private sources in FY02-20.  

CPA funds are the most important source of funding for the Affordable Housing Trust.  Similar to last 
year, as part of the FY21 Budget, the City committed to 25% of budgeted building permit revenue 
($4,998,630) in capital funding to the Affordable Housing Trust.  In addition, in FY21, $10 million of 
property tax revenue will be used to provide funding to the Affordable Housing Trust. This totals 
$14,998,630 in the FY21 Capital Budget to directly support the development and preservation of 
affordable housing. These funds will supplement FY21 Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds as well 
as federal funding.  Through these combined sources, if 80% of CPA funds are allocated to the 
Affordable Housing Trust in FY21 the City will reach its goal of doubling the amount of funds dedicated 
to creating and preserving affordable housing to $27,254,630 from FY19 ($13,626,000) within 2 years, 
which is earlier than the 3-5 years that was anticipated.

Historic Preservation 

The Historical Commission oversees historic preservation efforts in the City and works to preserve the 
integrity of Cambridge’s varied historical resources.  Preservation efforts have included restoring 
historic buildings, maintaining historic cemeteries, and digitizing records and archives.  

CPA Fund Allocations & Appropriations FY02-20 

$20,626,000 

Historic Preservation 

Preservation Grants 

A large portion of CPA funding for historic preservation is disseminated through the City’s Preservation 
Grants program.  The program makes grants available in two categories: Affordable Housing 
Preservation Grants and Institutional (Non-profit) Preservation Grants.   

Since 1975, the program has supported affordable housing agencies in the exterior restoration of their 
significant properties. Until 2003, when CPA funds became available, small grants were available from 
Community Development Block Grants. 

Affordable Housing Preservation Grants 

  Low- to moderate-income homeowners may apply for funds to restore exterior features that 

contribute to the building’s original appearance. 

  The program offers up to $30,000 (and 50% matching funds up to $50,000) to eligible 

homeowners and up to $50,000 (plus 50% matching funds for certain costs) to affordable 
housing agencies.  Grants to homeowners are administered by two local non-profit 
organizations that operate broader Home Improvement Programs for income-eligible 
homeowners. 

  97 Affordable Housing Preservation Grants have been awarded since FY03; 80 projects have 

been completed and 17 are under construction or cleared to proceed. 

Institutional Preservation Grants 

  Many non-profits, including churches and community groups, own deteriorating historic 

buildings.  These organizations may apply for funds to rehabilitate or restore such buildings. 

  The Institutional Preservation Grant program offers up to $50,000 (and 50% matching funds up 
to $100,000) for overall exterior preservation, code compliance, and accessibility projects 
where historic fabric is directly involved.  

  115 Institutional Preservation Grants have been awarded since FY05; 103 projects have been 

completed and 12 are under construction or cleared to proceed.

Open Space 

Cambridge has a variety of public open spaces, from its major natural resource areas such as the 
Charles River, Alewife Brook, and Fresh Pond Reservation, to the neighborhood parks and playgrounds 
embedded across the City.  CPA funds have been used to increase the amount of open space – by 
acquiring land or converting property – and to improve existing open space resources.  Efforts have 
included playground redevelopment and watershed protection.  

CPA Fund Allocations & Appropriations FY02-20 

$20,626,000 

Open Space 

Many open space improvements in Cambridge are realized through larger capital development.  Open 
space projects are therefore regularly funded through revenue sources other than CPA funds, including 
Property Taxes, Water Service Charges, and Bond Proceeds.   From FY2011 through FY2020, open 
space projects received $52,186,000 in funding from non-CPA Fund sources.

FY21 CPA AFFORDABLE HOUSING RECOMMENDATIONS 

Affordable Housing Trust  

$12,256,000 

Where CPA funds for affordable housing typically go directly to the Affordable Housing Trust rather 
than to specific housing initiatives, this summary information includes current statistics and ongoing 
projects affecting affordable housing in Cambridge and informing the CPA Committee’s 
recommendations.  

Continued Need 

Recently Completed CPA-funded Affordable Housing 

More than 2,600 applications were received for 98 affordable rental units at the most recently 
completed development in the City – Finch Cambridge, also known as Concord Highlands. 

Affordability Restrictions & Waiting Lists 

There are 504 units facing expiring affordability restrictions before December 31, 2020. The Affordable 
Housing Trust has committed funds to preserve these units, and preservation should be completed in 
the coming months. 

Current Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA) waiting list:  

  The CHA has over 20,500 distinct households on its waiting list.  More than 7,000 of these 

households indicate that they currently live or work in Cambridge. 

Current Community Development Department (CDD) applicant pools:  

  Rental Housing – The CDD Rental Applicant Pool has more than 3,800 applicants for affordable 

rental housing, including more than 815 Cambridge residents. 

  Homeownership – The CDD Homeownership Resale Pool has more than 550 applicants looking 
to purchase an affordable unit when the current owner decides to sell, including more than 400 
Cambridge residents. 

In 2019, the median market price for a condominium in Cambridge was more than $760,000.  Without 
a significant down payment, purchasing a condominium at this price would require an income of more 
than $160,000 per year. 

Spring 2020 Median Market Asking Rents 

  1-bedroom 
  2-bedroom 
  3-bedroom 

$ 2,550 
$ 3,100

Two people earning Cambridge’s living wage would each have to work 74 hours per week to afford a 
monthly rent of $3,100 for a two-bedroom apartment.  

Recently Completed Developments 

Finch Cambridge/Concord Highlands 

In July 2020, Homeowner’s Rehab, Inc. (HRI) completed Finch Cambridge (aka Concord Highlands), a new, 98-
unit affordable rental development in the Cambridge Highlands area. Residents are now moving into the mixed-
income building which meets the highest standards of energy efficiency and sustainability. More than 2,600 
applications were submitted for units that are affordable to low-, moderate-, and middle-income households. 

Current Developments 

Frost Terrace 

Frost Terrace will create 40 affordable rental units in the heart of Porter Square. The development will preserve 
three existing houses on the site, including the full restoration of the historic building at 1791 Mass. Ave., as well 
as adding a new building. The units will be affordable in perpetuity, with all units restricted to low- and 
moderate-income households. The majority of the units will be family-sized, and the project will feature an 
indoor play space. The design will focus on sustainability, including energy-efficient fixtures and systems.  
Construction will be completed in early 2021.

Rindge Commons 

Just-A-Start Corporation is advancing plans to build more than 100 new affordable rental units as part of their 
Rindge Commons development in North Cambridge.  New units will be built in two phases, with the funding for 
development of the first phase now being secured.  The first phase will include 24 affordable units along with 
42,000 square feet of space for early childhood education and Just-A-Start’s training and job readiness 
programs. 

 

HomeBridge: Homebuyer Assistance Program 

First-Time Homebuyers can access funds to help them purchase homes on the market.  HomeBridge offers 
income-eligible buyers up to 50% of the cost of buying a home on the market to make homeownership more 
affordable while expanding the City’s stock of affordable homes.  More than 110 buyers have purchased homes 
with City funding through HomeBridge and its predecessor programs.

93-99 Bishop Allen Drive Restoration 

The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) purchased 93-99 
Bishop Allen Drive (known as “Nonprofit Row”) in the fall of 2019. 
The building provides affordable office space in the heart of 
Central Square, and has had a 55-year long tenure as a center for 
social services. While the building remains a bustling site for 
social services, it suffers from deferred maintenance. CPA funds 
would support a multi-million dollar renovation project that the 
CRA plans to undertake during the first half of 2021. The 
building’s historic preservation needs include masonry 
repointing, brick repair and infill, lintel repair, lintel replacement, 
brownstone windowsill repair and replacement, vinyl siding 
removal and window repair.  ($330,000) 

 

 

 

 

Digitizing Architectural Survey, Phase III 

The Survey of Architectural History in Cambridge contains 
information on each of the approximately 13,000 
buildings in Cambridge. Originally compiled between 
1965-1977, it has been continually updated and now 
comprises 36 file drawers of archival material. The 
digitization project was initiated at the request of the City 
Council with an FY2011 CPA appropriation, and received 
appropriations in FY2019 and FY2020.  Physical file 
preparation, document scanning, processing of returned 
digital files, and database creation are all nearing 
completion. The project was intended to be completed in 
FY20 but experienced setbacks due to COVID-19 closures. 
The FY21 appropriation would allow the project to be

Foundry, Masonry Restoration 

101 Rogers Street (1890).  The historic former 
Blake & Knowles Foundry is undergoing a 
complete redevelopment to create a new 
community space for visual and performing arts, 
entrepreneurship, technology, and workforce 
education within its historic, industrial setting.  
The recommended appropriation would go 
toward exterior masonry restoration, such as 
repairing or replacing cracked, spalled, missing, 
and loose brick.  ($387,000) 

 

Foundry, Women’s History Project 

This appropriation would also go toward the 
Foundry project, specifically toward design and 
construction costs for an installation 
commemorating the role of women workers in the 
original Foundry and their importance in women’s 
labor history.  ($50,000)

Linear Park Design      

 

This park is an important recreational and commuting resource with links to regional off-road paths 
including the Minuteman Bikeway and Somerville Community Path.  The path is deteriorated, with 
drainage and surfacing issues, and various open spaces along the path need improvement.  The 
recommended appropriation would fund the project design, which is 12% of the estimated $5,000,000 
construction cost.  The project would reconstruct the path, address drainage problems, improve the 
green spaces and add to the tree canopy.  ($600,000) 

Magazine Beach, Sunken Parking Lot Removal & Grassy Beach Creation 

Magazine Beach Partners requested CPA funds 
to remove a sunken parking lot and pavement, 
and replace the area with a grassy beach.  The 
Magazine Beach project has received CPA 
funding in previous Fiscal Years, and has 
leveraged matching funds for earlier phases 
including shoreline path improvements, a canoe 
and kayak launch, and landscaping.  This 
appropriation would 
go toward 
construction of the 
Phase II-2 parking lot 
and grassy beach 
improvements. 
($150,000)

The recommended appropriation would 
supplement CPA funding from previous 
Fiscal Years and cover an enhanced project 
scope.  This would allow the playground to 
expand into an existing paved area, add 
some universal play equipment for 
improved accessibility, and remove hard 
surfacing/make more natural play setting. 
($200,000) 

Sennott Park 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The recommended appropriation would supplement CPA funding from previous Fiscal Years and cover 
an enhanced project scope, including an improved drainage system and irrigation to address problems 
discovered after assessing the field area as a possible water storage tank site.  Funding would also 
allow for better renovation of the basketball courts, which are heavily used by the 
community.  ($500,000) 

Open Space Reserve Fund  

The requested appropriation to the Open Space Reserve Fund would set aside CPA funding for future 
open space projects, costs associated with ongoing projects, or other eligible open space and 
recreation priorities.  ($82,000)

Appendix C: CPA Reserve Fund Allocations 

In addition to the CPA Fund Balance, which consists of monies in the CPA Fund that have not been appropriated 
in previous fiscal years, the City maintains two reserve accounts: the Historic Preservation Reserve and the Open 
Space Reserve.  These accounts include funds that were allocated and appropriated for spending on Historic 
Preservation or Open Space purposes in previous fiscal years but were not ultimately expended for a particular 
project.   

Once funds are transferred into a reserve account, they can only be used for qualifying purposes (i.e., Historic 
Preservation or Open Space).  A summary of allocations and transfers from these reserve accounts is presented 
below by Fiscal Year.

amendment to the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Account, entitled “The City of Cambridge Restated 
and Amended Mayor’s Disaster Relief Account” (“Account”) as set forth in the attached

organizations whose principal place of business is in Cambridge”, which will allow the Account 
to provide emergency funds to Cambridge arts organizations that have been impacted by the

WHEREAS: 
in Cambridge, including small businesses operated by individuals in Cambridge, who are in emergency 
need due to the pandemic disaster.  
 
WHEREAS:  During the recent first stage of distributions from the Account, the Account assisted over 
1,400 individuals and families most financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic disaster to pay rent, 
utilities, and address their basic needs. During the second stage, the Account assisted individuals operating

enrichment of our community, and they need our emergency assistance to survive this unprecedented 
disaster caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; now therefore be it

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 
 
WHEREAS: 

Routine traffic stops disproportionately impact Black and Brown drivers, who are 
pulled over and searched more often than white drivers, leading to potentially stressful 
interactions with the police; and 

 
This racist outcome is not the result of biases by individual officers, although those 
may play a role, but rather is primarily the result of systemic biases, including over-
policing in Black neighborhoods, and training of police officers to be hypervigilant and 
to expect violent resistance, despite such incidents being very rare; and 
 
The presence of an armed police officer during a routine traffic stop raises the tension 
of the encounter unnecessarily and can itself lead to conflict, causing harmful stress to 
both parties and damaging the relationship between police and the community; and 
 
Routine traffic enforcement can be conducted by unarmed employees of the city, 
which would reduce the possibility of violence during such encounters; and 
 
The police would still be responsible for apprehending known criminals, dangerous or 
erratic drivers, and other related situations that clearly go beyond routine traffic 
enforcement; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager look into transferring primary traffic enforcement 
responsibilities from the Cambridge Police Department to unarmed, trained 
enforcement personnel in the Traffic & Parking Department, Department of Public 
Works, Health & Human Services, or another suitable department; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter as soon as possible.

Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
RE:  Curb Cut Application 
10 Acorn Park Drive 
 
 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 
 
 
Dear Mr. Niranjan: 
 
On behalf of SXC Alewife Hotel, LLC, BSC Group has completed the City of Cambridge’s 
online application for a curb cut at 10 Acorn Park Drive to service the AC Marriott Hotel.  
The AC Hotel is located within the Cambridge Discovery Park development and currently 
has access from Discovery Way, a private way, running parallel to Acorn Park Drive. 
 
The proposed curb cut and driveway have been designed to provide one-way only access 
from Acorn Park Drive in accordance with the City of Cambridge requirements and the 
comments communicated at our site meetings in order to improve site access for hotel guests 
and deliveries, and to provide improved emergency vehicle access to the Hotel.   
 
Visitors to the Hotel exiting Route 2 via the Alewife Station Access Road currently travel 
along Acorn Park Drive to Discovery Way in order to access the Hotel.  The proposed drive 
will have improved wayfinding and access to the Hotel by providing direct access to the 
Hotel from Acorn Park Drive, including for ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency 
vehicles.   
 
We are available to discuss further at your convenience anytime.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact our office with any questions or inquiries you may have.  I can be reached at 
dbiancavilla@bscgroup.com or at 617-896-4347 or my cell phone:  978-857-0513. 
 
 
Very truly yours, 
BSC Group, Inc.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments;

language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further  
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward the substituted language for 
the aforementioned home rule petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation.

shall not apply to the following types of units:

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it 

Packet Pg. 220

Re: Re-Submission of Zoning Amendment Petition 

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance 
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey, 
and Zondervan: 

On behalf of BMR-Third LLC, a subsidiary of BioMed Realty, L.P., we are pleased to re-

submit for your review the enclosed rezoning petition for a proposed amendment to the Zoning 
Ordinance and the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, which, upon adoption, would result in 
a new Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) District CDK. As you know, on March 11, 2020 we 
submitted the enclosed rezoning petition to the City Clerk, and the City Council referred the 
rezoning petition to the Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee at the March 16, 2020 
City Council meeting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Planning Board cancelled its 
meetings for the months of April, May and early June, and has since re-commenced remote 
meetings on June 16, 2020. Accordingly, in July we re-submitted the PUD-CDK rezoning 
petition but due to certain scheduling constraints we are re-submitting the enclosed rezoning 
petition. The enclosed rezoning petition is exactly the same as the March and July petitions other 
than any revised dates or references to this re-submission, as the case may be. 

As you know, we have worked closely with the City to see to the stewardship of what is 

now branded as Canal District Kendall (formerly Kendall Square and Cambridge Research Park) 
since completing the acquisition of the former Lyme Properties portfolio in 2007. Specific 
stewardship projects include ongoing improvements to the public realm (including renovation of 
the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the introduction of public art, improvements to the ice

skating rink and boat launch, a commitment to local retail, and the on-going redevelopment and 
dedication of Termeer Square) and the development of 450 Kendall Street. We now come to you 
with what we hope is the final step in finishing what Lyme Properties started in 1999 by 
realizing on the longstanding goal of having a significant arts and culture facility in the 
neighborhood. At the same time, we hope to replace the Eversource gas facility located along 
Third Street to make way for an iconic architectural building that enhances the public realm and 
the connections among surrounding open spaces. As you will see in the enclosed proposed 
Zoning Map amendment, the new overlay district covers the portion of the Canal District 
Kendall that was originally developed as Kendall Square plus the Eversource site (referred to 
here as the gas transfer station site, or “GTS Site,” for ease of reference). 

A. Background. We submit this petition after soliciting extensive public feedback 

through community open houses, surveys, deeply engaging with the arts community, and other 
means to determine what type of arts and culture facility the City wants to see at 585 Third 
Street, the former Constellation Center site (also known as “Parcel C”). As you know, 
Constellation acquired the site in 2002 and spent over 15 years trying to raise the capital for a 
theater complex at the location. In the interim, the rest of the area within the proposed PUD-
CDK has been improved to now include approximately 757,970 square feet of office and 
laboratory space, 75,500 square feet of retail and restaurant uses, and 465 residential units. 
Unfortunately, a standalone theater proved not to be economically viable on Parcel C. We 
acquired Parcel C in 2018, and have subsequently entered into an option agreement with 
Eversource that creates the possibility of combining Parcel C with the abutting GTS Site. The 
finite duration of the option agreement and the unique ability to  relocate the GTS in 
coordination with a development spanning both parcels makes this a one-in-a-generation 
opportunity. We continue to work diligently on establishing a new location for the GTS facility, 
and are nearer than ever to achieving our goal, but have not yet completed that effort. 

We and our affiliates are the owners of abutting first class laboratory facilities that serve 
as key locations for companies like Takeda, Alnylam, and Eli Lilly; the success of development 
on Parcel C was and is highly important to us and our shareholders. As majority owners in the 
association that manages the public realm of the Canal District Kendall, the public realm is also 
essential to us and to our tenants – both biotech and retailers alike. We are convinced that we can 
make a significant impact with an arts and culture facility in a way that fits into the 
neighborhood, is attractive to a diverse set of Cambridge residents and visitors, enhances the 
public realm, is economically viable, and otherwise furthers the development goals of the 
community, while being within the guidelines of our mission as a real estate investment 
company focusing on high quality life sciences space. 

B.  Summary of Petition. Our zoning petition memorializes the previously approved and 

constructed density at each site within the proposed PUD-CDK, and allows for additional 
development on Parcel C and the GTS Site to achieve the project concept described below. The 
proposed amendment permits a mixed use development project that is a new building containing 
an arts, culture, and public space component that complements the existing 465 apartments and 
commercial space, and, as noted above, creates incentives for incorporating the GTS Site by 
allowing for greater bulk and height, and public realm amenities, if the GTS Site is included. The 
height and floor area, under a scenario where the GTS facility is removed from Third Street,

would be 250 feet and up to 550,000 gross square feet, respectively. The proposed amendment 
does not grant further development potential to the existing buildings constructed within PUD-
CDK. 

C. Project Concept. Since acquiring Parcel C, we have worked tirelessly with our 
consultant team to unlock the full potential of the site. The renderings enclosed show the fruits of 
our labor. To accommodate the building and concepts shown, the proposed PUD-CDK allows us 
to combine Parcel C with the GTS Site and construct mixed use laboratory and office above 
approximately 40,000 square feet of arts, culture, and public space, all in a striking 21st-century 
building consistent with existing and other proposed building heights in the vicinity. This 
building will significantly enhance the open spaces surrounding it, and will help strengthen the 
pedestrian corridor that ties together Termeer Square to the north, the Broad Canal and Broad 
Canal Way retail to the south, and the future Volpe Center project to the west (across Third 
Street).  All of this can be done in a manner that meets the sustainability practices of modern 
construction and caters to a community as economically and culturally diverse as Cambridge. 

Compare the renderings of our proposed project to the existing condition, also shown in 

the enclosed renderings. Parcel C is the “missing tooth” in the Canal District Kendall, and the 
location of the GTS Site (the last remnant of an industrial zone on Third Street) exacerbates the 
problem from an urban planning perspective. We believe that the project facilitated by the 
enclosed rezoning is a massive improvement, and a welcome addition, to the Cambridge 
pedestrian environment. 

We note that we have every intention of including the GTS Site in our proposed project. 
Although the ability to move the GTS facilities is not entirely within our control, we have been 
working continuously with Eversource and others to reach agreements that are necessary for the 
exercise of our option to acquire the GTS Site and move its facilities to a non-residential 
location. However, some details remain to be worked out and, out of an abundance of caution, 
we have drafted the petition allowing for the possibility that the project might not include the 
GTS Site by providing for a more limited scope of improvements utilizing only Parcel C to 
advance the vision of a community arts facility on the ground floor of a mixed use building. 
While not our preference because its impact would be less transformative and enriching for the 
neighborhood, we believe it is a viable alternative project. 

D. Benefits. Our preferred proposed project, utilizing the GTS Site, will result in many 

benefits for the East Cambridge community, and the community close to PUD-CKD in 
particular. Those benefits, many of which will be memorialized in a commitment letter to be 
submitted to City Council, have an approximate value of at least Sixty Million Dollars 
($60,000,000), and include the following: 

 A commitment to use reasonable efforts to relocate the existing utility facilities 

from the GTS Site to a non-residential location. 

 An arts and culture component of 30,000 square feet, inclusive of a 250-300 seat 
state-of-the-art theater, if the GTS Site is included (and, in any event, arts and 
culture space of at least 15,000 square feet).
10,000 square feet of indoor all-season public space.

Practical  measures to support  a diverse,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  operatine
model  for the arts and culture component.
No new parking.
Use of best practices  for meeting  sustainability goals in areas  such  as energ).
emissions, water,  materials,  urban site reuse,  and landscaping.
No new  gas connection.

Our proposal  is the end result  of many  community  meetings  and public  presentations

with neighbors,  neighborhood  stakeholders, and with stakeholders  at City Hall, including  three
open  houses, multiple  meetings with an Arts Advisory Committee  comprised  of community  arts
advocates,  a public  survey,  and solicitations for public  comment  on presentation  boards  that we
displayed  at our open houses.  Key takeaways from  the public  process  included a focus on the
need for flexible performing  arts spaces  for small  and larger  productions,  community  arts  spaces
(such  as classrooms for leaming art and exhibit space),  public gathering  spaces  available  across
all four  seasons,  and relocating  the GTS facility away from  Third Street.  Our proposed zoning
overlay  text and map encourages  achievement  of these goals, with the publicly  accessible
facilities  within  and commanding  the lower  levels  of a unique  and beautiful  commercial  building
that will provide over an acre of new  landscaped  area (indoors and outdoors),  subject  to further
detailed  review by the Planning  Board  under the contemplated  special  permit process.

We  are excited to work with you in the formal  review process  for the zoning amendment
and again  upon  submission  of an application for a PUD-CDK  special  permit.  We  are committed
to East  Cambridge  and to doing all that we can to make Canal District Kendall  a shining  example
of the best of mixed-use  transit-oriented  development  for the 21st century.

Very truly  yours,

-THIRD  LLC

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 

Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use district that is 
comprised of high quality general and technical office and labs with diverse active 
commercial and community uses (including retail and restaurant uses, and arts and 
cultural uses), all of which promote, create corridors among, and enhance the existing 
open space network within and surrounding the district, and provide benefits to the 
surrounding community through community arts and publicly accessible interior 
gathering space. In particular, the district facilitates strengthening the public open 
space connections among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the 
Broad Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street. The PUD-CDK District creates incentives to 
(A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and culture facility that will further diversify the 
mix of uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade utility 
and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station on Third Street to 
enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street and provide an attractive 
connector corridor between the district and the East Cambridge neighborhood. The 
parcel on which the existing gas regulator/transfer station is located is referred to 
herein as the “Gas Transfer Station Parcel”. 

13.202

PUD-CDK Special Permit

13.202.1 Eligible Development Parcel. To further the purpose of this Section 13.200, an 

applicant may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the 
Planning Board approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel 
located within the PUD-CDK District that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK 
special permit, consists of at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the 
foregoing, the Final Development Plan for a currently vacant or undeveloped 
Development Parcel under this PUD-CDK overlay zoning shall include either an Arts 
and Culture Center or Community Arts Facility, as further provided in Section 
13.204.1(b) below. 

13.202.2 PUD-CDK Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-CDK 

special permit approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel upon 
finding that the Final Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, 
and all other criteria applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought. 

13.202.3 PUD-CDK Special Permit Requirements. Within the Development Parcel the 
locations of the open spaces, the quantities of proposed land uses, the building 
envelope, and heights shall be indicated in sufficient detail that the Planning Board 
can reasonably assess the impact of the PUD-CDK special permit and its general 
consistency with the PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 13.202.4 
below. At a minimum, a Development Proposal and subsequent Final Development 
Plan must contain the following components:  

(a) Site Development Plan: describing how the Development Parcel is divided 
into use areas and their development characteristics, including potential uses and 
Gross Floor Area.

Floor Area or the construction of a new building:  

(a) If Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires a 
Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, such Community Arts 
Facility or Arts and Culture Center (i) takes into consideration the orientation of the 
uses, location of building entrances, pedestrian connectivity between such uses and 
adjacent open space areas, and the ability of such uses to promote diversity and serve 
all residents of the City of Cambridge; and (ii) creates a facility available for the 
neighborhood that supports or promotes small arts or theater organizations, 
independent artists, art co-working opportunities, or partnerships among the 
foregoing and the local community. Furthermore, the developer of such Community 
Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center shall have demonstrated a commitment to 
establishing an arts and culture operational plan for space within the new building 
that will be made available for teaching, learning, rehearsing, or idea exchange.

Development Parcel does not include the Gas Transfer Station Parcel. 

(f) The developer shall have demonstrated a commitment to seeking solutions to 

relocate applicable above-grade utility infrastructure on the Gas Transfer Station 
Parcel to other appropriate locations and away from key streetscape corridors if 
Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires an Arts and Culture 
Center. 

(g) Demonstrates a commitment to seeking high quality, locally-based retail and 

restaurant owners or operators where such uses are part of the Final Development

CDK to a condominium property regime. A violation of one or more conditions of a 
PUD-CDK special permit by one condominium unit owner (or its occupant) shall not 
be deemed to be a violation by another condominium unit owner (or its occupant). 

13.202.6 Applicability of Requirements to Development Parcel. A violation, with respect to an 

individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any 
provision of this Section 13.200 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any 
other individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel. A 
PUD-CDK special permit may specify that certain modifications to the Final 
Development Plan do not alter the concept of the PUD and such modifications shall 
be considered minor amendments under Section 12.37 of this Zoning Ordinance 
subject only to written approval of the Planning Board if the developer demonstrates 
that such modification(s): (i) constitute a reallocation or reconfiguration of Gross 
Floor Area among uses in the Final Development Plan or otherwise allowed in the 
PUD-CDK District, (ii) do not require a new type of zoning relief (other than the 
categories of relief previously granted for the proposed development project, whether 
by existing PUD special permits or otherwise), and (iii) maintain the same percentage 
of Minimum Open Space as approved by the PUD-CDK special permit. 

13.202.7 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a development proposal for a 

Development Parcel, the developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD 
Pre-Application Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site 
arrangement, building massing, and public space arrangement, as well as general 
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the Planning Board to 
provide the developer informal feedback prior to preparing the Final Development 
Plan materials. As set forth in Section 12.33.2 of this Zoning Ordinance, any 
statement made by the Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application 
Conference shall not be legally binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3 of this 
Zoning Ordinance, the developer shall present graphic and written materials as 
needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development alternatives.

(b) Required Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center. The Final 
Development Plan for a currently vacant or undeveloped Development Parcel under 
this PUD-CDK overlay zoning shall include an Arts and Culture Center containing 
not less than 30,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area as otherwise measured under this 
Zoning Code comprised of Performing Arts Uses, Community Arts Uses, and All-
Season Public Gathering Uses if the Planning Board allows the maximum 550,000 
square feet of Gross Floor Area under Section 13.204.1(c) below. The term “Arts and 
Culture Center” shall mean a facility comprised of Performing Arts Uses, Community 
Arts Uses, and All-Season Public Gathering Uses. In all other events, the Final

Arts Uses and Indoor Public Gathering Uses. 

(c) Permitted New Gross Floor Area. Any planned Development Parcel within the 
PUD-CDK District that is currently vacant or undeveloped shall be permitted to have 
a maximum of 450,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area in the aggregate, excluding 
any Gross Floor Area for the Community Arts Facility as described in Section 
13.204.1(b) above. However, the Planning Board, in its review of a special permit 
application under this Section 13.204.1(c), may allow a planned development within 
the PUD-CDK District to have a maximum of 550,000 square feet of new Gross 
Floor Area, excluding any Gross Floor Area for the Arts and Culture Center as 
described in Section 13.204.1(b) above, if the proposed development project will abut 
and/or have frontage along at least 75 linear feet of Third Street or otherwise, at the 
developer’s option, provide an appropriate pedestrian corridor between the existing or 
planned open space in the PUD-CDK District and open space to the west of Third 
Street. 

13.204.2 Residential Density: There shall be no required minimum lot area for Dwelling Units 

in the PUD-CDK District.

increased to 250 feet if the proposed development project will abut and/or have 
frontage along at least 75 linear feet of Third Street or otherwise, at the developer’s 
option, provide an appropriate pedestrian corridor between the existing or planned 
open space in the PUD-CDK District and open space to the west of Third Street. In 
addition to the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its review of a special permit 
application under this Section 13.204.3, may except from the calculation of the height 
of buildings and structures in the PUD-CDK District chimneys, water towers, air 
conditioning equipment, ventilators, and other necessary features appurtenant to 
buildings which are otherwise typically carried above roofs and are not used for 
human occupancy, including mechanical floors within a building where for functional 
or aesthetic reasons such equipment, structures, or features are on above-grade levels 
of the building other than the roof level or above. 

13.204.4 Other Dimensional Requirements: There shall be no minimum lot area, no minimum 
lot width, no minimum frontage, and no minimum front, side or rear yard 
requirements for the Development Parcel or any lot within the PUD-CDK District. 
There shall be no minimum building setbacks or other minimum or maximum 
building dimensional requirements other than as provided by this Section 13.204. 

13.204.5 Open Space: Any Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK District shall 

demonstrate that, following completion of such development, there shall be not less 
than fifteen percent (15%) open space as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 in 
the PUD-CDK District except as modified below.  

13.204.5.1

13.204.5.2

The Planning Board, in its review of any special permit application for a 
development containing a Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, 
may consider indoor or covered pedestrian ways, decks, arcades, loggias, and 
gallerias appurtenant to the Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center, 
even if located on a different Development Parcel in the PUD-CDK District, to be 
open space provided that the same is publicly accessible during normal business 
hours. The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall make a finding that there is no net-loss of open space already existing within 
the PUD-CDK District (other than within any previously undeveloped or vacant 
Development Parcel). 

Open space, whether already existing within the PUD-CDK District or to be 
constructed by the developer or its affiliate, shall include, without limitation, the 
following: parks; plazas; lawns; landscaped areas substantially open to the sky; 
playgrounds; balconies; roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage; 
pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified 
by the Planning Board; and such other areas or spaces determined, or approved, 
by the Planning Board to be open space.   

13.204.6 Perimeter and Transition: Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an 
existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and 
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, 
height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-CDK District should 
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages 
between the Broad Canal and Kendall Square.

Parking and Loading Requirements.

13.205.1 Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the off-street 

Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as modified by 
this Section 13.205. 

13.205.2 Parking:  

13.205.2.1 Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements within the 
PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in approving a Final 
Development Plan may specify a minimum parking requirement based on review 
and analysis of Transportation Assessments and other relevant information on 
parking demand provided in application documents, and with the guidance of City 
agencies.  

13.205.2.2

13.205.2.3

13.205.2.4

13.205.2.5

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, shall 
make a finding that that the Final Development Plan provides adequate parking 
for the proposed uses and that the Final Development Plan does not substantially 
increase net-new off-street parking spaces within the PUD-CDK District. 

The parking requirements of this Section 13.205.2 may be satisfied (a) anywhere 
in the PUD-CDK District, or if located outside of the PUD-CDK District, within 
2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in part by an easement, lease 
agreement, occupancy agreement, license or other comparable legal instrument 
between the developer and the City, other public entity or private owner or 
consortium for use of parking spaces in the public or shared parking facilities 
within said area. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 6.000, this Zoning Ordinance 
shall not restrict the management and assignment of parking spaces in a way that 
will most efficiently utilize the existing and proposed parking spaces to serve all 
approved uses. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 19.20, the Planning Board 
may permit the Developer to substitute a Transportation Assessment in form and 
substance acceptable to the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department if the 
Planning Board otherwise determines that the materials submitted with the Final 
Development Plan adequately describe the impacts of traffic and parking on the 
area surrounding the Development Parcel.  

13.205.3 Loading: The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may 
waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities 
within the PUD-CDK District, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across 
various uses within the PUD-CDK District or the adjacent PUD-3 District. 

13.205.4 Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100 
of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the 
requirements in Section 6.100 may be modified by the Planning Board through its 
approval of a Final Development Plan.

Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to Development 
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK District.

13.206.1 Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s) shall remain 

13.206.2 Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District shall comply 

valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, all development 
projects constructed pursuant thereto and existing prior to the enactment date of this 
Section 13.200 for the PUD-CDK District, including without limitation with respect 
to rebuilding due to casualty. Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit 
shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-3 special permit, 
and the PUD-CDK zoning shall govern with respect to such additional rights, except 
however any rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit shall 
automatically supersede any undeveloped rights for the applicable development 
parcel as provided for under the PUD-3 zoning. Such undeveloped rights, and any 
associated outstanding obligations with respect to such rights, under a previously 
issued PUD-3 special permit shall be deemed automatically extinguished as of the 
date that the subsequent PUD-CDK special permit becomes valid and effective, and 
such automatic extinguishment shall be deemed to be a minor amendment of such 
previously issued special permit under PUD-3 under Section 12.37.2 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to the 
issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted hereunder and the provisions of 
such existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the PUD-CDK special 
permit, the provisions of the PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 

with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain documentation showing how the 
development at an aggregate level will comply with the requirements of Section 
22.20. The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the 
requirements of Section 22.20.  

The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development Proposal shall 
describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will incorporate a 
comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best practices for meeting 
sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero Action Plan, Climate Change 
Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and other sustainability plans and guidelines 
promulgated by the City at the time the Development Proposal is submitted. The 
conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be 
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall 
incorporate best practices in the following areas:  

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve building energy 
and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new 
building within the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for implementation 
of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may include rooftop 
solar pv) within the PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse gas 
emissions analysis for such new building and will implement energy efficiency

DHSP preschools opening next week/plans for testing

Hello Mayor Siddiqui and other City Council members, I am writing because I understand that DHSP preschools are 
opening next week, and I am concerned about how the City plans to ensure the health of the DHSP teachers and 
students.

First, I hope you can prioritize testing for DHSP teachers. My daughter attended MLK preschool this year and I stopped 
by the school today. The teachers said there is no plan in place to test teachers; and even if they wanted to get tested, 
the wait at the local clinics is prohibitive. They are not able to get tested through health insurance without showing 
symptoms unless they pay $160. If your plan is to test CPS teachers, why would you not extend the same protections to 
preschool teachers, who are at potentially even higher risk due to the nature of caring for 2-5 year olds?

Second, the teachers emphasized there are no health or safety protocols in place. As you know, CPS has been working 
on a draft health and safety protocols for many weeks now. I hope that DHSP can make the same preparations.

Finally, in addition to concern for the health of DHSP teachers, children attending preschool, and our community, I am 
also concerned about how lax heath measures at DHSP could affect CPS opening. If teachers or students at DHSP 
preschools were to get sick, I imagine this could severely impact CPS's ability to reopen in September, even if the 
appropriate health measures were in place, as the DHSP preschools operate on CPS campuses and many DHSP students 
are siblings of CPS students.

I appreciate you have many concerns to address right now. I hope you can devote some attention to ensuring the health 
of DHSP teachers and students.

Best,
Amanda Beatty

Cambridge Public Schools Must be a Priority

Dear Cambridge City Manager and City Councilors

Very soon the School Committee will vote on an important and historic decision to either send our 
children and teachers back into our school buildings or to keep the buildings closed and continue with 
remote learning. The implications and ramifications for our entire community are unquestionably 
enormous.

Over 4,000 families in the Cambridge Public School district have been juggling overwhelming tasks 
between homeschooling, work demands, health practices, and the general stress of trying to survive a 
worldwide pandemic during a national political reckoning.

Our beloved teachers in this district have been struggling to master new learning techniques and worrying 
about their students while trying to maintain their own family health considerations.

Meanwhile, Cambridge children have been out of school without structured learning or socializing 
opportunities for far too many months.

Superintendent Kenneth Salim has created an impressive and thoughtful reopening plan for the 7,000 
students in our district, helped by educators and local epidemiologists and scientists who have been 
tirelessly donating their own time and expertise. The plan gives options for families and teachers, extra 
supports for vulnerable students, and data-driven parameters to monitor the incidence rates in our 
community to determine safe opening and closing decisions. The School Committee delayed its usual 
summer break and has hosted 16 additional meetings since June to discuss and shape these plans, with 
many more subcommittee hearings and special meetings scheduled until completion. These meetings have 
been hourslong, and nearly every one of them included public comment.

But the responsibility of educating and supporting our students does not fall just to the School Committee 
and our educators. It’s the responsibility of the entire Cambridge community to provide a safe 
environment for our teachers to be able to do this important work.

The city manager has been extremely supportive of the requests from the school department for personal 
protective gear, building safety equipment, and providing access to additional space for adequate social 
distancing. But there are still some missing protocols that need some attention from the City Council and 
from our surrounding community.

First is to establish an ongoing comprehensive testing protocol for teachers and students, as experts have 

recommended as a high priority. Right now the testing plan has been reduced to testing teachers only 
once, at the beginning of the school season. Local universities are developing more robust testing 
protocols to protect their students. There is no reason CPS students and teachers are not given this same 
important priority protection.

Second is securing the surrounding community to prevent a second surge like those seen in states and 
cities that reopened too quickly. Gov. Charlie Baker issued a travel order for tracing and tracking anyone 
coming into the commonwealth from one of these hot spots, but it’s up to the city manager to ensure our 
local universities are enforcing its guidelines. Concurrently the city manager and his team of health 
experts should ensure that bars, nightclubs, gyms, and indoor seating at restaurants remain closed in 
Cambridge and lobby surrounding cities such as Somerville and Boston to do the same. The school district 
is establishing safe metrics for community incidence rates before it will recommend it is safe for students 
and teachers to go back into our buildings. Denying Cambridge residents access to known risky activities 
such as bars and indoor restaurants during this pandemic is a small sacrifice to make for the health and 
safety of our schools and teachers.

Third is that you, our Cambridge leaders advocate for more state funding for education. Instead of 
allowing well-financed business lobbyists to dictate our state’s funding priority, Massachusetts needs to 
support its most fundamental and important public asset: its school system.

This pandemic has been a painful reminder about the fragile interconnectivity of a community. The 
ramifications of an unconfined virus are horrifying, but the loss of learning to an entire generation of 
students is unacceptable. Let’s see the City of Cambridge support the right practices to contain this virus 
and ensure our school system is its highest priority.

Cambridge Public Schools Must Be Prioritized

Thank you, Superintendent Salim and Cambridge School Committee for all the incredible work you have done by 
extending your schedules into the summer months. It is inspiring to see community leaders and Cambridge citizens 
putting personal needs and interests aside to work so hard to combat this pandemic in our community.

The plans so far are impressive and detailed and I am hopeful that you will be successful in getting the staff necessary to 
execute them effectively. As you continue to outline and refine schedules and plans there are several important details 
that should be addressed.

1) Please find ways to get more families to respond to the Superintendent's survey and town halls so that 
traditionally marginalized communities have a voice in the re-opening plans. Currently, 73% of all CPS households have 
answered this survey. But only 34% of the African American/Hispanic/Multiracial families have replied, when these 
families represent 46% of our community.*
If we want to be a more inclusive community we need to find better ways for everyone to be........included.

2) Please ask CPS school Principals to hold individual town hall meeting with their communities including teachers to 
discuss and document plans for class sizes, ventilation, building safety, PPE protocols and outdoor learning opportunities 
so families and teachers know what will be happening in their respective buildings to keep them safe as we reopen 
schools.

3) Continue to develop and communicate the metrics for tracking Cambridge community incidence rates which will be 
used to decide opening and closing decisions for our district.

4) Ensure that the City of Cambridge provides a robust testing and tracing protocol for the CPS community similar to 
what the universities are providing.

5) Urge the City of Cambridge to prioritize the needs of our school system by keeing bars and nightclubs CLOSED and 
ensuring local universities force students to adhere to state safety protocols for testing and 
quarantine protocols. We need to adjust our community priorities to protect our teachers and our students as 
much as possible.

Looking forward to more details on your planning process.

Cambridge City Council 
795 Massachusetts Ave., 2nd Floor 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
CityCouncil@CambridgeMA.GOV 
July 23, 2020 

Dear Honorable Members of the Council: 

On behalf of the City of Cambridge's Bicycle Committee, I am writing to respectfully request that the 
 
draft Affordable Housing Ordinance (AHO) be modified to require equivalent bicycle parking facilities as are 
required for any other private residential development in Cambridge. The current proposed AHO has 
substantially reduced requirements for both secure and short-term bicycle parking, and this disparity is 
inconsistent with our city’s goals of fostering equity. The reduced bicycle parking requirements for affordable 
housing is also inconsistent with a well-documented need for more, not less, secure bike parking facilities in 
economically disadvantaged communities and creates barriers for future residents who wish to take advantage 
of bicycling as an affordable and sustainable transportation option in Cambridge. 

Lack of access to secure bike parking in economically disadvantaged communities was identified as a 

 
barrier to using bicycles for transportation or recreation in a recent capstone report written by graduate 
students in the Tufts Urban and Environmental Policy Program (Briseno et al 2019). These students interviewed 
residents of Roxbury and concluded that “the lack of secure bike storage and parking in the target communities 
is a major concern for local bikers.” This report also noted that “the disparity in bike storage and parking is one 
example of the difference in bike infrastructure between wealthier and low-income neighborhoods,” and 
another study conducted in Boston concluded that “bike storage is a major barrier for low income cyclists as 
they do not have enough room to store bikes in their apartments” (Lusk et al, 2017).  

Cycling is an affordable, fun, healthy, and efficient method to get around Cambridge, which is compact 

and flat. It is important that the AHO contributes to creating transportation equity by making cycling a safe 
option for everyone, and reducing known barriers. It is difficult to understand the rationale for an ordinance that 
provides lower quality bike storage facilities in affordable housing in Cambridge. If anything, affordable 
residential developments in Cambridge need more, not less bike parking.  

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Sincerely yours, 
Ruthann Rudel,  
Cambridge Bicycle Committee

Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund and supporting the arts

Dear Members of the City Council,

I am a Cambridge resident living with my husband and son at 158 Pleasant Street. I have lived in Cambridge for 30 years 
and chose to stay here because of the unique visual, musical, theatrical, and dance offerings and opportunities. A 
professional musician myself, the quality of my life and the lives of my neighbors, friends, and colleagues in Cambridge is 
greatly enhanced by the thriving arts community in our city.

I was very disappointed to find out that a decision about opening up the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to support arts 
organizations who are literally on the brink of folding was tabled until September. At a time when every day leads arts 
organizations closer to rent deadlines and bill due dates, it seems irresponsible for the council to delay this decision.  

The relief fund is aptly named the "DISASTER Relief Fund" because it exists to help struggling citizens who can't meet 
basic needs because of an unforeseen situation like the Covid19 pandemic. The Cambridge arts community is struggling,
and in many cases, disappearing because basic needs aren't being met They are receiving no financial help to meet them 
in this time of critical need. I believe Cambridge needs to step up and support our beloved arts community, starting at 
the top with this decision by the City Council.  

Will you please convene an emergency meeting ASAP to move on this decision?

Thank you,
Felicia Brady-Lopez

supporting arts organziations through covid

I am writing to support the use of the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to provide relief to arts organizations in Cambridge. 
This issue was on the Council's agenda this week (item #29); however, Councillor Simmons exercised her charter-right 
and the issue was dropped and apparently not rescheduled.

I've been a Cambridge resident for more than 20 years and have raised two children here. It's a special place in no small 
part because of the vibrant arts community - we are lucky to have neighbors who are artists and musicians, and lucky to 
have organizations that support them. Without emergency relief, however, we are losing those organizations. They are 
Cambridge and it would be foolish to let them disappear. I urge you to address this issue in a substantive manner.

Perez, Lori

Put City Manager's order about arts disaster relief funding on Aug 10 agenda

I am a dancer and am very concerned about the future of dance (and arts more broadly) in Cambridge. We already lost 
Green Street Studios prior to COVID-19, and many other dance and other arts organizations are struggling, especially 
due to the pandemic.

I am therefore writing to ask you to put the City Manager's order, which would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund 
to include arts organizations, on the agenda for the special meeting scheduled for Aug 10. This matter can't wait until 
Sept 14, as many organizations have been waiting since mid-March for some relief. The longer the delay, the greater the 
likelihood that we will lose crucial organizations.

Thanks for your attention to this important issue.

Sincerely,
Emily Bloomenthal

INCLUDE ARTS ORGANIZATIONS IN AUGUST 10TH DISCUSSION OF DISASTER RELIEF 
FUNDING

Respected representatives of Cambridge, MA,

I'm a long time Cambridge resident and I've been teaching and performing comedy in Cambridge for two decades.
Two years ago yesterday, your council spoke of my service and certified it on Cambridge letterhead.
I can't tell you how much it meant to me to feel recognized by the city that I love.

Two years later, I desperately need my city to recognize the places, venues and organizations that groomed me for that 
recognition.
The arts organizations I know and love are in serious jeopardy of closing forever. The damage that these closures would 
do to the culture, the livelihood and the soul of this city gives me nightmares.
I see arts organizations repeatedly cut out of important funding and relief plans and packages proposed by the city.
These organizations needed your help yesterday. If the council puts off inclusive funding discussions until September 
14th, it could mean the difference between organizations surviving this pandemic or shuttering forever.

The arts lured me to move here in 2000. Then, I fell quickly in love with Inman Square. I'm still a proud, engaged resident 
of Inman today.
I get my coffee at 1369. I meet with my friends at Bukowski Tavern or the Druid.
Up until April, I was an Assistant Operations Manager at Inman Oasis before we had no choice but to close permanently 
given the financial uncertainty that came with the Coronavirus.

I've watched other industries take a major hit in the last 5 months.
Despite already losing some of my favorite Cambridge hangouts to the pandemic, I'm hanging on to hope.
(RIP to the Field, the Cantab, Flat Top Johnnys and Cuchi Cuchi)

While in my heart I believe the artists are what make venues special, I cherish the places that fostered, encouraged and 
provided the springboards for my growth as an artist and a comedian. These venues are places of worship for so many 
Cambridge residents who seek creativity, community and culture.
I want to believe in Cambridge like I've always believed in Cambridge.

I know you have so much to consider.

I implore you to consider ImprovBoston, The Dance Complex, Passim, Gallery 263, Central Square Theater, Brattle Film 
Foundation, the ART, Beyond The Fourth Wall, The Cambridge Center for Adult Education, The Cambridge Symphony 
Orchestra, The Cambridge Youth Dance Program, Underground Railway Theater, CCTV, the Cambridge Jazz Festival and 
the many, many, many other crucial arts institutions that have brought people to Cambridge to stay and have exposed 
people to the very best of what art, culture and Cambridge have to offer.

I appreciate your time.

Sending love and gratitude during what I'm sure feels like an impossible time to govern.

Requesting that Arts Organizations are included in the disaster relief  

To Whom It May Concern ,
I am writing for so many of us  who have  been in the performing arts for decades and for the newer ones who have just 
begun .
Please add all arts organizations to be included in the  Mayor’s Relief Disaster Fund.
It is essential to add the arts organization  and artists because they are an essential part to keeping life balanced and 
harmonious even when things are falling apart .  And as we know things have fallen apart due to the Virus . 
And we know, so many arts organizations had to close down as soon as the Covid19 began . These organizations also 
need to be lifted up financially. I await your response. 
Thank you so much .
Best wishes ,

Arts in Cambridge 

It has come to my attention that there is a City Manager’s order to amend the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund to include 
arts organizations. As someone who is an artist who practices art in Cambridge, who cares deeply about the arts in 
Greater Boston, I find it offensive that arts organizations were left off this fund in the first place. This issue needs to be 
resolved as soon as possible so I am urging you to add it to the next special meeting agenda scheduled for August 10. 
The arts are the engine for everything that makes Cambridge unique and livable. There was serious gaps in relief funding 
for nonprofits and artist organizations so many of them are at risk. The city needs to show that they care and make 
haste with this amendment !

Include arts organizations in Disaster Relief Fund

It has been brought to my attention that non-profits have not been granted money to help them survive 
through this covid disaster. 
I have taken classes, rehearsed, taught, performed and attended performances in Cambridge for decades. 
One of my beloved spaces, Studio @ 550, already has lost the current location due to the building being 
sold to make micro apartments in Central Square. This organization and many more - especially in the arts 
- will not survive if they do not receive funds to help through the covid disaster. Please put this on your 
August 10th agenda and help arts survive and thrive in Cambridge!

thank you.

Arts Organizations need you Immediate Attention

To the City Council and City Clerk of Cambridge,

I have been part of the Arts Community in Cambridge since 1975. I have been blessed in the ability to 
take classes, teach classes, perform with local and international artists, take classes with 
Internationally known artists because of the RICH cultural community you have had.

I continue to teach and through my teaching, enrich the lives of many residents and non-residents. I 
bring my students to Cambridge and they eat at your restaurants, buy from your stores and pay for 
parking. I work at the Dance Complex, have taken at Ballet Theater of Cambridge and Dance Complex, 
taught and taken at Green Street and rented at Studio 550.

These places are so important to me and our community and they are disappearing. The current Covid 
crisis in taking incomes, wrecking the economy and non profits need your help. This cannot wait and I 
am requesting you put the City Manager's order which would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to 
include arts organizations on the special meeting agenda scheduled for Aug 10.

We are all being hit hard and debt is not unknown to us but the funds made available for assistance need 
to include rental assistance. The work Dance Complex, Studio 550 and other dance studios support is 
immense in keeping local artists afloat and working during this time. Please continue your support and 
expand it to assist those hard hit at this time.

Thank you for your consideration!

Dear Cambridge City Council,

Gen Carmel <gencarmel@gmail.com>
Friday, July 31, 2020 10:47 PM
City Council
City Clerk
Put Arts Organizations on the Aug 10 Agenda 

I was born in 1988. I grew up in Cambridge, where I was surrounded by opportunities to make and experience art in the 
90s. Not every kid gets that experience, but when they do, it can change their life, broaden their horizons, develop a 
vital understanding of the civic and community value of artistic expression in society, and this is something that can only 
happen in a city that loves and protects art, artists, and arts organizations. Please support Cambridge artists and small 
arts organizations now!

I went to Morse school K-8, then Harvard, and am lucky to call Cambridge my hometown again as an adult after a few 
years away. I now live in 02138. And I am even more lucky to work for an arts organization in Cambridge, though it was 
pushed to a work-from-home situation not by COVID but by terrible rent hikes in a key Harvard Square building, 4 
Brattle, several years back. I’ve watched as the arts & culture heart of the beautiful, diverse, green city I love has 
dissipated into wave upon wave of empty gentrification, and all of my classmates have moved away. This happens when 
a city discards art as a less-than-profitable kind of small business, not something that is as important (and 
unmonetizable) as the air we breath, as core to our identity and community as the moral/spiritual/educational compass 
we each need to navigate life and to re-envision a new way of relating to one another to improve the life of our city, 
state, country, world. Art is not for the rich. It’s for everyone!

However, the current lack of relief funding for small arts organizations, particularly tenant arts spaces, reveals a huge 
inequity in our relief funding provisions, and will lead to the deaths of these spaces and organizations forever. I would 
like to request that you put the City Manager's order (which would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to include 
arts organizations) on the special meeting agenda scheduled for Aug 10. This matter CANNOT WAIT until Sept 14 as 
many organizations have been waiting since mid-March for some relief and will likely not survive the next month.

This is an emergency! Please support arts organizations but discussing this matter on August 10.

Best,
Genevieve Carmel

Studio at 550 and Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund

I am writing to you to request that you amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund with a City Manager's Order to include 
arts organizations on the special meeting agenda scheduled for August 10.

Cambridge arts need the support right now! I am a dancer and choreographer who makes work primarily in Cambridge. I 
have been honored to receive funding from the Boston Foundation to be able to hire and pay dancers and 
videographers for my work, most of whom live in Cambridge. For years, Cambridge has been a cradle of dance in the 
Boston area, but in the past year the dance community has been experiencing major setbacks with the closure of studio 
spaces, including Green Street Studios most recently.

Studio at 550 is an extremely valuable cultural institution in the vibrant cultural district of Central Square, and it is 
struggling to survive. I personally have attended and hosted events, taken class, and held rehearsal at Studio at 550. 
Callie Chapman is a leader in the dance community who supports many artists. The closure of this space would be a 
devastating blow to the viability of the arts in Cambridge. They need relief funding, and they need it now. They simply 
will not be able to survive if there is a delay in their funding.

Thank you for your consideration,

Caitlin Canty

Support to Amend and Expedite Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund

I am writing to request that you please put the City Manager's order, which would amend the Mayor's 
Disaster Relief Fund to include arts organizations, on the special meeting agenda scheduled for Aug 
10. This matter CANNOT WAIT until Sept 14 as many organizations have been waiting since mid-March for 
some relief.

Please incorporate the following article about this situation into the public record:
https://www.cambridgeday.com/2020/07/31/council-delay-in-assistance-for-arts-nonprofits-looks-fatal-for-at-
least-one-and-others-worry/.

I am a singer and songwriter performing under the name Sharon Sky. My legal name is Sharon Chaitin-Pollak 
and I live in Acton, MA. I have lived in Cambridge previously and have performed live music, both original 
music and covers, as part of multi-arts live events including dance, performance art, and live mixing of video 
art and sound, at Studio@550 in Central Square, Cambridge.

I have previously been involved in supporting Studio@550 at various public hearings by being present and 
speaking on behalf of the amazing and unique work being done by Studio@550, a great deal of which involves 
multi-artist collaborations of an extremely creative variety involving experimental, improvisational and cutting 
edge performance events that blaze new trails in the arts and involve the viewer in novel ways and 
dimensions. The Studio also provides affordable space rentals to a great diversity of artists and arts groups for 
rehearsal and performance, and development opportunities to artists doing advanced work in their careers. I 
know of no other organization in the area doing this type of work and thereby contributing to the arts in 
Cambridge in this unique, irreplaceable way.

Studio@550 is not the only non-profit arts business in Cambridge that is in dire need of City assistance due to 
the Covid-19 pandemic. Many such organizations and businesses have been ineligible for other types of 
financial relief as well. I know that Studio@550 has been closed since March, trying to do it's part to protect the 
public and prevent the spread of the Coronavirus by remaining closed, and has therefore has foregone the 
income necessary to continue to cover its rent.

Due to this foregoing of income and to circumstances specific to its agreement with its landlord prior to the 
Coronavirus, it cannot survive without assistance until the next normal City Council meeting in September. If 
the meeting last week had resulted in some support, it might have hung on and not begun going into debt, that 
the non-profit cannot afford. Instead, the issue of support for the arts was, as I understand it, tabled until six 
weeks later, when a Council member exercised her charter right due to concerns about the specifics of how 
such support would be allocated. This may be an issue, but the delay of the discussion may cause substantial, 
irreparable harm to Studio@550 and other arts non-profits that cannot hang on that long and cannot just come 
back from a situation not only of zero income, but of going into significant debt.

Therefore I stress the urgent, critical nature of the decision to please put the City Manager's order, which 
would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to include arts organizations, on the special meeting 
agenda scheduled for Aug 10.

Move the Disaster Relief Fund amendment order to Aug 10! from the director of Studio 
at 550

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,

I'm writing as the director of Studio@550, in addition to an independent artist who has created my career in Central 
Square for approximately 20 years. Most recently I was awarded one of 3 fellowships in the state for choreography via 
the Massachusetts Cultural Council. I pride myself as being a Cambridge-based artist! Watching the entire City Council 
meeting last Monday I was hopeful with the agenda item containing the City Manager's order to amend the Mayor's 
Disaster Relief Fund to include arts organizations. There seemed to be full fledged support in the room as Councilor 
Mallon triumphed in articulating the reasons why this amendment needed to be adopted. I was disheartened (and a bit 
confused about the motive) to hear Councilor Simmons using her charter right to move it to the next regular meeting of 
September 14. In the moments afterward I suddenly realized what this meant for the organization I worked to build for 
the last 4 years. It meant a death warrant was signed, and instead of leaving our current location at 550 Mass Ave with 
a bit of funds to relocate, it meant potentially leaving with a debt. Notwithstanding the next uphill battle of actually 
identifying appropriate accessible and equitable space for our next iteration. We are tirelessly working on it however, 
and wanting to stay in Central Square, yet real estate prices are currently still too high for anything sustainable.

The ins and out of why time is so important in this case relies on the fact that our landlord had offered to escrow our 
rent from May-Sept and upon vacating our space on Sept would give 100% of the escrow back. The landlord plans on 
building micro-unit apartments on the site and still intends on moving forward with seeking a variance from the BZA. I 
know just as much as you fighting this particular action leaves the organization with very little grounds to do so as due to 
not having any policy protection as an arts organization within the cultural district my landlord can essentially do what 
he wants and eventually he will push through and succeed. I obviously wish this weren't the case, but I choose to focus 
my efforts in the continual uphill battle in the direction of relocating to a more stable home. In the very long term I have 
been interested FOR YEARS in adopting a cultural plan that will provide a pathway for arts organizations to stabilize and 
prosper in the square. I'm willing to do that work.

Studio at 550 has been around for 4 years, but the space itself used to house the now folded Boston Dance Company 
for the 25 years before that. The space has been a sanctuary for art making for the past 30 years in one form or 
another!  

I implore you to do whatever is necessary to include this agenda item at your special meeting on Aug 10 as it would 
essentially mean the difference between life and death for Studio at 550. It still comes later than assistance for small 
businesses some of whom have been open for months now. It still comes later than assistance for non-profits who are 
currently providing much needed services to their various sectors. Echoing points made by councilor Mallon, we 
cannot do curb-side pickup (although that would be a sight to see), we don't have products to sell, nor do we have any 
online sales to capture. We are an arts organization who keeps lean expenses in order to service our artists and the 
Cambridge community. Our budget is $50K/year to put that into perspective. Our ongoing/regular teaching artists are 
65% people of color and 55% women-led arts small businesses. We produce performances which catalyze the bringing 
together of artists of various artistic disciples. We run professional development programs for artists including business 
Skillsets and production management. Our rates range from $17-$35/hr and are very low when compared to other 
studios in the area. Our space is transformable from a dance/movement studio to a photo/video/media studio to

accommodate multidisciplinary artists. This is one of the only studios in the area that has this capability, bringing this 
unique service to the square. Even the Dance Complex (although we love our neighbor) does not have this capacity.

If you ever want to talk with me or ask questions, I'm more than available to have a conversation.

Urgent Arts Funding Concern for Cambridge re: August 10th Meeting Agenda

Dear Cambridge City Council Members:

I am writing in deep concern over the Council’s recent decision to delay funding to arts nonprofits, specifically 
considering how this will impact Studio at 550, an essential resource for dance in the Cambridge ecosystem. 

I am a dancer, choreographer, and former staff member of The Dance Complex; I am based in Somerville, MA 
with strong ties to the arts in Cambridge. With the recent abrupt closure of Green Street Studios, the huge 
impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the arts, and a constant push for gentrification that further raises the costs of 
rent and existence in Central Square, Cambridge and its surrounding cities and towns need the presence of 
Studio@550 now more than ever. When not in pandemic times, I find myself in Central Square very often to 
take class, attend performances, and share ideas with members of the dance community. I know from 
firsthand experience working with teaching artists that Studio@550 is a crucial resource for keeping dance 
classes, rehearsals, and performances alive in Cambridge. My former job was to help artists find this much-
needed space on a daily basis, so I am deeply aware of the challenges these artists face. The need for space to 
practice this art form is urgent, and it cannot be ignored or pushed to later dates without dire financial 
consequences for those who need the help most. There simply is no more space – let alone affordable space.

The Council’s decision to delay funding to arts nonprofits deeply affects Studio@550’s ability to relocate in 
September and may result in its closure. Studio at 550 is just one example of the small arts organizations in 
Cambridge that house many other arts businesses, organizations, and entrepreneurs, and its closure would 
damage the viability of the entire dance landscape in Cambridge and beyond. I therefore implore that you put 
the City Manager's order which would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to include arts organizations on 
the special meeting agenda scheduled for August 10th.

The City Council’s attention and action on this matter are requested immediately.

Sincerely,

Sarah Craver
Former staff member at The Dance Complex
Member of the greater Boston arts community as a dancer, choreographer, student, and patron

Arts Organization Support

My name is Ellice Patterson. I am a dancer/choreographer/artistic director in the greater Boston/Cambridge area. I am 
writing in support of other artistic organizations to request you put the City Manager's order which would amend the 
Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to include arts organizations on the special meeting agenda scheduled for Aug 10. This 
support is critical to keep salaries and lights on throughout this difficult time and by effect giving our community a much 
needed artistic morale boost to keep us all going strong.

Studio 550 

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,

I am writing in deep concern over the Council’s recent decision to delay funding to arts nonprofits, 
specifically considering how this will impact Studio at 550, an essential resource for dance in the 
Cambridge ecosystem. 

I am a professional choreographer based in Cambridge. I teach out the 2 existing studios in Cambridge, 
Studio 550 and the Dance Complex. Besides that, I also run a modern dance company providing 
employment to fellow dancers, teaching classes to local residents, performing in local festivals in the city.
The Cambridge dance community was already hit hard with the recent closure of Green Street Studios, 
but the impacts of the pandemic have continued to threaten our vibrant arts landscape. The Council’s 
decision to delay funding to arts nonprofits deeply affects Studio at 550’s ability to relocate in September 
and may result in its closure. Studio at 550 is just one example of the small arts organizations in 
Cambridge that house many other arts businesses, organizations, and entrepreneurs, and its closure 
would damage the viability of the entire dance landscape in Cambridge and beyond. I therefore implore 
that you put the City Manager's order which would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to include 
arts organizations on the special meeting agenda scheduled for August 10th.

The city council’s attention and action on this matter are requested immediately.

Help Studio 550

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,

I am writing in deep concern over the Council’s recent decision to delay funding to arts nonprofits, specifically 
considering how this will impact Studio at 550, an essential resource for dance in the Cambridge ecosystem.

I am a professional improvisational dance/theatre artist based in Lexington with strong ties to the arts in 
Cambridge. I rehearsed, performed, and viewed dance regularly in Central Square. I have fostered important 
mentorships and peer relationships through my creative work in Cambridge. Access to Cambridge dance 
spaces is crucial to the further development of my and others’ choreographic careers.

The Cambridge dance community was already hit hard with the recent closure of Green Street Studios, but the 
impacts of the pandemic have continued to threaten our vibrant arts landscape. The Council’s decision to 
delay funding to arts nonprofits deeply affects Studio at 550’s ability to relocate in September and may result 
in its closure. Studio at 550 is just one example of the small arts organizations in Cambridge that house many

which would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to include arts organizations on the special meeting 
agenda scheduled for August 10th.

Studio at 550 funding

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,

I am writing in deep concern over the Council’s recent decision to delay funding to arts nonprofits, specifically 
considering how this will impact Studio at 550, an essential resource for dance in the Cambridge ecosystem.  

I am a professional interdisciplinary dance artist based in Malden, MA who has been a part of the arts 
community in Cambridge for over 20 years. In addition to my role as the co-Artistic Director of Monkeyhouse, 
an award-winning nonprofit that connects communities with choreography, I am also an artist advisor to both 
the Boston Dance Alliance and the Dance Complex. Having multiple venues where people can rehearse, 
perform, and train within a short distance of one another is vital to the dance ecosystem here. Hundreds of 
people depend upon these spaces. Frankly speaking, we need more dance venues not less.

The Cambridge dance community was already hit hard with the recent closure of Green Street Studios, but the 
impacts of the pandemic have continued to threaten our vibrant arts landscape. The Council’s decision to 
delay funding to arts nonprofits deeply affects Studio at 550’s ability to relocate in September and may result 
in its closure. Studio at 550 is just one example of the small arts organizations in Cambridge that house many 
other arts businesses, organizations, and entrepreneurs, and its closure would damage the viability of the 
entire dance landscape in Cambridge and beyond. I therefore implore that you put the City Manager's order

Emergency Relief and Grant Criteria for Arts Organizations

I am writing this letter to encourage adding Arts Organizations as a beneficiary of the Mayor's Disaster Relief Funding to the special meeting in 
August, as a time sensitive issue. Arts organizations that need emergency help with utility bills, rent, and/or face evictions cannot wait until 
September. I appreciate Councilor Simmons’ quick response to Kristie to explain her charter rights and her concerns to our Reopening 
Committee, it is very helpful to get the feedback. I do understand that clarification is needed to strengthen the policy order, but also hope it can 
be resolved in timely manner.

In response to concerns about establishing criteria, I’d like to clarify that Cambridge Arts can readily offer criteria guidelines input. Cambridge 
Arts is in the process of developing new grant guidelines for both the Art for Racial Justice and Annual Grant Programs that will be ready for the 
next grant cycle very soon. Working in response to Covid-19, BLM, and MCC guidelines, I have no doubt that they will be very robust with 
appropriate outreach, checks, and balances. I encourage the City Council to become familiar with them and would be pleased to answer any 
questions or concerns you may have. Moving forward, I am very thankful to Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon and the City of Cambridge for the well 
appreciated increase in the Arts Grant Programs budget. I am very thankful that it will now be able to serve more artists in need, a broader 
community, and more neighborhoods.  Sadly, however, this funding does not solve the emergency funding for survival that several arts 
organizations now face.

I’d like to highlight some examples of recipients from the 2019-20 grant cycle to clarify how many projects have a focus on social healing, 
engagement, and community building, especially at this difficult time. The variety of art mediums represented is also helpful to reach different 
audiences. I am pleased that Cambridge Arts puts a strong focus on helping artists to establish creative partnerships to strengthen their access 
and impact on broader communities in Cambridge.

Here are a few examples, (for full list, see link at end):

DANCE
Studio at 550: Creative Residency 2020 - In less than 4 years Studio at 550 has grown to serve over 650+ artists working in many artistic 
disciplines.
Dance in the Schools: Dance Teaching Artists into the 12 Cambridge Public School classrooms
Japanese Cultural Show:
Cultivate: original works by female and non-binary disabled choreographers and a team of musicians/composers with hope to further promote 
intersectional disability rights through art.

MUSIC
Shelter Music Boston: Transformative Concerts at CASPAR Emergency Shelter
Cambridge Community Center: The Hip Hop Transformation
Longy School of Music: Healing Art Initiative - hybrid of music and medicine
Walter Chapin: Epiphanies
New Gallery Concert Series: From There to Here - work as literal as a train whizzing by to the musical retelling of a Holocaust survivor’s 
personal journey.
Skooby Lapofsky: Hidden Life Radio - aims to increase the general awareness of trees in Cambridge and the city’s disappearing canopy.
Aaron King: Bridgeside Cypher - rappers hosted at Graffiti Alley in Central Square
Erik Lindgren: Oral Moses in Concert - bass baritone from Atlanta, African American Spiritual.
Alex Lemski: The Creative Music Series - adventurous jazz; bringing out-of-town musicians with national reputations paying attention to social 
and cultural realities; booking musicians as leaders who are women and musicians of color.

THEATER
Central Square Theater: The Voting Project - Act Up and Vote!
Faye Dupras: Cozy Corner: Dragon Next Door
Jade Sylcan: Beloved King - Beloved King is a full-length musical based on a queer reading of the book of Samuel in the Bible.
Grace Valaskovic: Annabel Lee - Noah learns to cope with the death of his once-beloved Annabel Lee and heal the damage he has inflicted on 
himself and those around him.
Queen Mab: The Tempest – Three African-American actors – one of whom is deaf – will dive deep into the play's reflections on colonial power, 
and how it controls not just the way we express ourselves, but our very sense of self. Resonances of the immigrant experience and the dignity 
of marginalized peoples abound. Shakespeare’s transcendent language takes center stage, both as spoken English and translated into 
American Sign Language.

On the left you can also see the extensive list of grant recipients for previous years and the panelists listed for each year by discipline. Over 
several years, I have found that Cambridge Arts is very intentional about the professionals they reach out to. The list of reviewers changes 
each year to ensure a fair process. They now pay panelists an honorarium to make sure that reviewers are compensated for their time and 
work in the deliberations and panel meetings. As a board member of Cambridge Arts, I also welcome feedback and suggestions for panelists 
to ensure multiple voices and perspectives are represented.

Traffic enforcement proposal

Hi, as a resident of Cambridge, I fully support the proposal to remove traffic enforcement from the purview of the 
Cambridge Police Department. I strongly believe that city employees are fully capable of enforcing traffic violations and 
doing so without the racist motivations that are endemic in the police department. This way, I hope that one day the 
violence and oppression associated with "driving while black" will not be a part of local Cambridge life.

Thanks
Josie

ABC support for AHO and JAS Rindge Commons
Rindge Commons - ABC letter of support.docx

Dear Members of the Planning Board,

Apologies for the delay here, email got caught in my outbox yesterday. Attaching a support letter for Just A Start's 
Rindge Commons project, and personal support for the AHO proposal below.

Many thanks, and hoping these notes can still be included in the record for this evening's meeting.

I’m writing as a strong supporter of the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay. I am very grateful this policy proposed has 
come back to the Planning Board in 2020 - in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a spotlight on deep equities 
nationwide, we need effective zoning reform and affordable housing now more than ever. I believe the AHO is an 
essential tool for building more affordable housing in Cambridge and preventing the displacement of low- and 
moderate-income families from our City.

For local affordable housing nonprofits to compete with market rate developers, the Overlay’s provision to allow for 
more density as-of-right is key to the success of this policy. I urge this committee not to water-down the current 
proposal - to limit density or include additional dimensional or permitting requirements would add costs and likely make 
many affordable housing developments infeasible, even if the AHO does move forward. If this zoning proposal is truly 
going to help affordable housing developers build, the current density and as-of-right provisions described cannot be 
weakened. The citywide, comprehensive zoning proposal before you is the culmination of years of due diligence and 
expertise; please support the AHO as written.

In my conversations with friends and neighbors against the Overlay, it's become clear that discomfort with an as-of-right 
provision is not based on affordable housing but market rate projects where developers 1) did not have an inclusive 
community process and 2) weren't responsive to local concerns. Affordable housing developments are held to local and 
state-level requirements on community meetings, impact assessments, and other due diligence - an as-of-right provision 
through a successful AHO would not limit process.

Affordable housing developers work closely with City staff to acquire and finance projects and meet with the Community 
Development Dept. at various stages of building design. Public lenders weigh in on design details, sustainability 
measures, and other components of the proposed project before providing funding. Throughout Cambridge, affordable 
housing is high-quality and responsive to both City and community feedback. I am confident this will not change with an 
as-of-right provision.

Cambridge's affordable housing stock is some of the most sustainable, energy efficient, and resilient around. In 
my experience, when mission-driven developers have an opportunity to build new housing we recognize the positive 
impact of good design and quality materials on the well-being of residents and the durability of their homes. Healthier 
buildings and lower carbon footprints are integral to the mission of local nonprofit developers, and the Overlay 
will support this responsible development approach.

4.25.a

In our current market, affordable housing nonprofits are unable to put bids on properties that come up for sale because 
of the substantial acquisition costs. Market developers are more likely to pay high asking prices because they can make 
their investment back with higher rents and/or condo sales, but this doesn't pencil out for affordable housing. We must 
act now, through passing the Overlay and simplifying the development process (i.e. reducing up-front costs, not limiting 
design process or accountability!) for affordable housing projects. This is just one key step in protecting affordable 
housing for the long-term and ensuring that more people - from many income levels, backgrounds, education, 
employment, etc. - can afford to stay in Cambridge.  

In the midst of an incredibly challenging public health crisis and a political climate full of fear and inequity, our effort to 
build more housing and provide stability for lower-income families in Cambridge is a small but essential action our 
community must take. Please don't wait any long to pass the AHO.

Thank you for your consideration, and please reach out if you'd like to discuss further.

Rindge Commons – Proposed Just-A-Start Development – Letter of Support 
August 3, 2020 
 
To Members of the Planning Board, 
 
A Better Cambridge (ABC) has been a long-time housing advocate in the Cambridge. We’re 
proud to reach out in support of Just-A-Start’s Rindge Commons project, a proposed infill 
development that will provide 101 new affordable apartments at a transit-oriented site. Rindge 
Commons will also include a job training center, early childhood education space, and other on-
site services that support the existing community at 402 Rindge and future Rindge Commons 
residents. 
 
JAS’s experience developing affordable housing in Cambridge and the community process 
they’ve begun – with resident meetings, public meetings, and open houses allowing for 
neighborhood feedback and an opportunity to learn more about Rindge Commons – 
demonstrates their connection to the neighborhood and thoughtful planning for this new 
construction project. We believe Rindge Commons will maximize the potential of this site, 
which is currently an under-utilized parking lot. 
 
The Rindge Commons design shows a site plan with active walking paths, resilient landscaping, 
and several spaces for families to gather and connect. Instead of an asphalt lot, Cambridge will 
gain 101 new apartments for families at 80% AMI or below, meeting an urgent need for more 
affordable housing options. Rindge Commons, along with existing housing at this site (402 
Rindge and Fresh Pond Apartments) is a short walk from Alewife T station and the Minuteman 
bike trail; all residents will have access to healthier, more sustainable travel options. 
 
Our board has reviewed the details of JAS’s proposed Rindge Commons development, and 
we’re encouraged by their community-oriented design and focus on both providing supportive 
services for residents and minimizing the environmental impact of new construction. We hope 
the Planning Board will support this much-needed affordable development. 
 
Sincerely, 
A Better Cambridge (ABC) Board and Steering Committee

Support for 585 Third Street

To the Planning Board and City Council,

On behalf of Cambridge nonprofit CitySprouts, I would like to register my support for BioMed Realty and their 
designs for 585 Third Street. BioMed is a valued sponsor of our work, and has repeatedly shown its 
commitment to the community by supporting us and through the involvement of its Executive Vice President, 
Bill Kane, who sits on our Board of Directors. Through these relationships, we have come to appreciate the 
active role that BioMed plays in fostering community growth and believe them to be exactly the kind of 
developers that the City of Cambridge should encourage.

Even without this personal experience with BioMed, however, their proposal would earn our support on its 
merits alone. CitySprouts gives Cambridge children opportunities for hands-on learning through urban 
gardens, and 585 Third Street would add much-needed green space to the steel-and-glass streetscape of 
Kendall Square. We look forward to collaborating with BioMed Realty in finding ways for young people to take 
advantage of the new landscaping opportunities their community space would bring. We are also excited about 
the landscaping planned for the setback intervals at various elevations in the building’s design; verticality is an 
important aspect of urban gardening, where space is always at a premium. It also sends a good message to 
young people- that plant life should be cultivated everywhere, especially in places you’d least expect it.

I encourage you to support this proposal and would welcome the opportunity to discuss this endorsement in 
further detail should you desire.

Thank you for your time.

Jane Hirschi, Executive Director
www.citysprouts.org

The CitySprouts mission is to cultivate wonder for all children with hands-on learning through urban gardening.

Re: Cambridge Police refusing to process License to Carry applications

Good Morning City Manager DePasquale,

I am writing a third reminder to ask about my concern about the Cambridge Police. I wrote on 8/25 and 9/1, and called 
your office twice, yet have not received a response or an acknowledgement. Can you please address this 
constitutional violation by the Cambridge Police Department and urge them to begin processing LTC applications 
immediately?

Subject: Cambridge Police refusing to process License to Carry applications

Good afternoon,

I am writing to express concern that the Cambridge Police Department is in violation of state law and 
the US Constitution by refusing to process License to Carry applications, citing the COVID-19 emergency 
as justification to essentially deny citizens' rights. 

I submitted my application on June 30th and was told that the Cambridge Police has stopped 
processing applications, effectively denying our constitutional rights. When I pressed further, I was 
also told to apply with the Massachusetts State Police, who then told me they do not process LTC 
applications.

I contacted the Attorney General's Office, who led me to the State Firearms Licensing Board, and they 
instructed me to contact your office as you have control of the police department. CPB tells me that 
they aren't processing applications due to safety/COVID, however, two people at the Firearms Records

Bureau told me that towns and cities across the Commonwealth are processing fingerprints necessary 
to apply for permits, some even with drive through service.

I find it hard to understand how the emergency can be used to justify this denial of rights while people 
are allowed to eat in restaurants and work out in gyms. As a staunch supporter of strong gun control 
regulations, I find it harder to sympathize when the rights of law-abiding citizens, willing to go through 
the process to rightfully obtain a License to Carry, are being administratively denied.

I am asking that your office work with the Cambridge Police to immediately lift the de facto ban on 
legal firearms and restore our rights.

Thank you,

Regarding Studio 550

Dear Cambridge City Council Members,

I am writing in deep concern over the Council’s recent decision to delay funding to arts nonprofits, specifically 
considering how this will impact Studio at 550, an essential resource for dance in the Cambridge ecosystem.  

I am a professional contemporary dance artist based in Somerville with strong ties to the arts in Cambridge. 
Cambridge has been the hub of dance for me my entire life. I have engaged in the arts in the city since I was in 
my early teens and continue to now. I have taken classes, performed, and taught at Green Street Studios, Jose 
Mateo Ballet Theatre, The Dance Complex, and Studio 550. Without these institutions in Cambridge, my dance 
training and career would be no more. I cannot begin to fully express how crucial the arts are in this city. 
They’ve shaped who I am, and so many other folks in the Boston area. Studio 550 in particular has enabled me 
to continue my dance career and passion. Whether that has been taking classes with Lion’s Jaw Festival in 
2016, or performing in the space multiple times, or rehearsing there for a myriad of projects, Callie has offered 
her space to me and my colleagues and truly fostered the arts community in Cambridge.

The Cambridge dance community was already hit hard with the recent closure of Green Street Studios, but the 
impacts of the pandemic have continued to threaten our vibrant arts landscape. The Council’s decision to 
delay funding to arts nonprofits deeply affects Studio at 550’s ability to relocate in September and may result 
in its closure. Studio at 550 is just one example of the small arts organizations in Cambridge that house many 
other arts businesses, organizations, and entrepreneurs, and its closure would damage the viability of the 
entire dance landscape in Cambridge and beyond. I therefore implore that you put the City Manager's order 
which would amend the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund to include arts organizations on the special meeting 
agenda scheduled for August 10th.

The city council’s attention and action on this matter are requested immediately.

Sincerely,
Sasha Peterson

Affordable Housing in Cambridge

Dear City Council, Ordinance Committee:

The Cambridge Residents Alliance lists worthwhile ways to provide more affordable housing. Going over the 
CRA's summary, I'm struck how compatible existing Res C-2B zoning requirements are with CRA's 
suggestions. The current Zoning Ordinance's Res C-2B's terms provide, I believe, a good way to achieve those 
goals. 

For what I hope is your convenience, I've pasted Res C-2B provisions below my signature rather than as an 
attachment, and with my emphasis.  

Main point: one simple way to increase construction of affordable housing citywide is for the City Council to 
reconfirm Res C-2B provisions, remove any Special Permit exceptions, and rezone all Bus A zones to Res C-
2B.

Even now, Res C-2B is Bus A zones' default for residential construction. If the need is to provide more 
affordable housing, to protect existing, local businesses, and to protect and increase green space, this change 
would do that for all new construction in those zones.

Again, simply changing Bus A zones to Res C-2B would help get new affordable housing, whether subject to 
Inclusionary Zoning or as dedicated 100% affordable. Notably, it would grandfather in existing business uses, 
and would preserve existing trees while requiring new green space for everyone's benefit.

 

Res C-2B.
New construction in Res C-2B districts may only be 4-story multifamily housing, It is thus subject to 
Inclusionary Zoning. New business uses are prohibited in Res C-2B zones, but existing businesses are 
grandfathered and small local businesses protected.

Res C-2B's mandated setback requirements are more than compatible with the Tree Ordinance. While they 
mandate trees and shrubs, they also prohibit construction both above and below ground in those setbacks. This 
is serious protection for existing trees.

Res C-2B zoning is the default for housing construction in all Bus A zones citywide. For example, Bus A zones 
include much of Cambridge Street, Fresh Pond Parkway, and the parking lot on Church St.. Changing all Bus 
A to Res C-2B would signal the city is serious, and thus greatly improve housing development throughout the 
city, and do it simply.

Again, rezoning Bus A to its Res C-2B housing default would not eliminate business uses. It would grandfather 
in existing ones and thus protect small local businesses.

An example of Res C-2B mass and landscaping is the former Inn at Harvard, 1201 Mass Ave.. Res C-2B 
setback language also applies to Bus B-1 and Bus B-2 zones on Mass Ave. An example of the 20' mandated 
green setbacks common to all three zones is the green setback behind 1030 Mass Ave.

Please note that the original Res C-2B requirements that setbacks be above and below ground have has been 
changed. The Planning Board may now grant Special Permits for basement, i.e., underground, apartments in 
those setbacks. Such construction, if allowed, would have destroyed the mature trees in 1030's setback and 
would do so elsewhere.

My thanks to CRA for careful work, and to the Council for keeping on in the pandemic.

rezoning for affordable housing.

Table 5-1.

  Table of Dimensional Requirements - Residential Districts

Footnotes:

(a) Measured from the centerline of the street, but in no case may a building be nearer the street than ten 
(10) feet. 

(c) In no case may a building be nearer the rear lot line than twenty (20) feet in Residence C-2, C-2B, C-
2A, C-3, C-3A, C-3B districts. In Residence C and C-1 districts, no building may be nearer the rear lot line 
than twenty (20) feet plus one additional foot of rear yard for each four feet that the depth of the lot exceeds 100 
feet, up to a maximum of thirty (30) feet. In Residence A-1, A-2, and B districts, no building may be nearer the 
rear lot line than twenty-five (25) feet plus one additional foot of rear yard for each four feet that the depth of 
the lot exceeds one hundred (100) feet, up to a maximum of thirty-five (35) feet. For purposes of this Footnote 
C, the lot depth shall be that distance measured along a line perpendicular to the front lot line and extending to 
that point on the rear lot line most distant from the front lot line.

(k) Yard Requirements in the Residence C-2B District 

1) Setbacks - In the Residence C-2B District, buildings shall comply with these yard requirements by 
being set back above and below ground. 

2) Green Area - general 

Two of the yards on a lot shall consist exclusively of green area as defined in section 2.000. Contrary to 
the provisions of said definition, hard surfaced walks and terraces shall not exceed twenty-five (25) 
percent of the area of each yard.   At a minimum, green area setback shall consist of permanently 
maintained densely planted trees and shrubs that may be expected to form within three (3) years after 
the time of planting a continuous unbroken, year round visual screen. Every effort shall be made to 
retain the best existing trees in said setbacks to meet the requirements this section in whole or in 
part. Plans for landscaping and maintenance shall be approved by the Committee on Public Planting as

the terms of this section is completed. 

(3) Lots with more than four yards.   If the shape of a lot creates a situation where there are more than four 
yards, this green area requirement shall apply to half of the yards, rounded up in the instance of an odd number 
of yards. 

(4) Lots in two or more zoning districts. Where a zoning district boundary line or lines split a lot, a lot 
partially in the Residence C-2B district shall comply with provisions elsewhere in this zoning ordinance with 
regard to lots in two or more zoning districts, except that the setback and green area requirements of this 
footnote shall apply to all parts of the lot regardless of zoning district. 

(5) Lots abutting more restrictively zoned districts. When any lot abuts a more restrictively zoned 
district or districts, all yards abutting the more restrictively zoned district)s) shall be designated as yards 
required to comply with the green area requirements of this footnote. This provision shall apply to that 
quantity of abutting yards numbering up to and including the maximum number of green area yards required by 
this footnote. The total number of green area yards required on a lot shall not be changed by the 
provisions of this subsection (5). 

(6) Pedestrian and vehicular access.  

(a) When a yard used to satisfy the Green Area Open Space requirement of this footnote is 
a front yard, the Green Area Open Space may be interrupted by not more than one path 
for pedestrian access to the building. Said pedestrian path shall be constructed perpendicular 
to the lot line and shall not be more than eight (8) feet wide. The green area yard may also be 
interrupted by not more than one driveway constructed perpendicular to the lot line and 
which is not more than twelve (12) feet wide. 

(b) The sum of the width of the said pedestrian path and driveway may not exceed the 
setback provided by the smallest of the yards provided on the lot. 

(c) The areas allowed to be used for access under this subsection (6) shall be counted as 
part of the twenty-five (25) percent of the total required green area which is allowed to be 
use for hard surfaced walks and terraces for the front yard in which the access areas are 
constructed. 

(7) Townhouse Development When a lot is used for townhouse development, the provisions of this 
footnote shall apply to the lot before subdivision into townhouse lots. Subdivision into townhouse lots 
shall be done in such a manner as to not affect the application of this footnote to the entire unsubdivided 
lot. In particular, the pedestrian path and driveways allowed.

(e) Where any lot abuts a residential district, buildings above and below ground shall be set back a 
minimum of twenty (20) feet from the zoning district boundary line, notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary provided in Article 6.000 of this Ordinance. Said setback shall consist exclusively of landscaped 
green area as defined in Article 2.000. Where the zoning district boundary line splits a lot the minimum

CRLS Remote Plan

The presentation of the CRLS remote learning plan was a complete disappointment Tuesday night. Clearly the CRLS 
Leadership Team cannot effectively create a remote learning plan. This was now the third or fourth iteration presented 
to the public, with little or no pedagogy included, while the vague discussions of taking this opportunity to  'reinvent" 
our educational system are completely terrifying.

There does not seem to be any focus or expectation for the amount or type of content able to be delivered, no clear 
plan how small group learning and discussions will occur, no plan for grading  and very very few details outside of the 
basic core subjects. Teachers will certainly not be working their contractual 6:25 minutes per day.

The fact that Principal Smith did not even know that the full day schedule starts on 9/28 and not 10/28 as stated in 
his presentation is yet one more red flag that this team needs help, and quickly.

We were also extremely disappointed to hear the CEA's letter to the District after all the work CPSD put into the hybrid 
plan for our most vulnerable students. Offering neither an effective remote plan nor any in-class instruction is 
completely unacceptable for a team of educators that have maintained their positions with a generous pay raise for the 
upcoming year. The children of this city should not continue to bear the brunt of our faltering systems.

We are extremely concerned about what will happen to our district as we remember the years when families fled CPSD 
and the high school nearly lost its accreditation because of the uncertainty and chaos inflicted upon the community by 
that administration.

Please stand strong for our children and do what you know is best for them.

Perez, Lori

[Dear Mr. Wilson: I have searched city web pages in vain for instructions
on how to have this email included for the record for today's Ordinance
Committee Hearing. (I believe this is a severe deficiency in the information
provided to the public at the multitude of city web pages.) Would you please
include this in the record for today's hearing, and also add it as a "communication"

you would confirm that you've been able to do this. Thanks. James Williamson]

Re: Revised AHO

Dear Members of the Ordinance Committee and Co-Chairs:

It's my understanding that an amendment to last year’s AHO which
would have guaranteed lower income residents in Cambridge the
same protection for mature shade trees as all other residents
of Cambridge has been removed from this year’s revised version.
As far as I know, there has been no empirical study or evidence
presented which shows that saving mature shade trees necessarily
increases the costs of affordable housing. If so, is there any evidence
that such an increase is sufficient to warrant removing this protection
for lower income residents from the revised AHO?
To remove this city-wide protection from the AHO smacks of exactly
the opposite of the purported logic of the AHO itself, does it not? The
AHO would purportedly treat all of Cambridge "the same" for purposes
of "100 per cent affordable housing." Yet, when it comes to something
as essential and vitally important as what the experts call "tree canopy"
(and what the rest of us simply call "trees") it obviously does not.
Proponents of this feature of the revised AHO have been recently touting
their apparent rediscovery of "redlining" decades ago in Cambridge. Are
they not now advocating a latter-day imposition of another heinous form of
discrimination in housing when they assert that "poor people don't need (or

even care about) trees," and therefore don't deserve this equal protection??
(Perhaps it's time for these tree-haters to get re-acquainted with the 14th
Amendment to the US Constitution.)
The CHA plan to demolish all of the remaining brick buildings on what's
popularly known as the "Federal Side" of Jefferson Park (where, incidentally,
I live.) To do so, they will presumably destroy all of the existing mature
shade trees on the site, in order for architects to have a "tabula rasa" with
which to play. I would submit that this would be extremely detrimental to the
health and well-being of current and future residents of Jefferson Park but
would presumably be allowed "as of right," without public review, were the
AHO in its present form allowed to pass. I am enclosing some photographs
of the lovely tree canopy as it currently exists at Jefferson Park. (There would
be even more here had not two large trees in front of the building at 1000 Jackson
Place been killed as a result of what I believe was an avoidable maintenance
catastrophe only relatively recently.)
If you decide to pass this zoning change I urge you to seriously consider, at the very
least, a provision which would require a "developer" under the ordinance to demonstrate
the necessity for removing mature trees, including evidence of the cost of saving those
trees compared with abbreviated but reasonable evidence of the cost of a "reasonable
and prudent alternative" which would preserve those trees.
Thank you for working to truly respect the rights of all residents of Cambridge equally. 

Sincerely,  James Williamson

Stabbing in Central Square (and an Evidently False Police Report: August 3, 2020)

[NB: Please include this email as a communication to the City Council for
their next meeting. Thank you.]

August 18, 2020

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and City Council Members:

Two weeks ago this past Monday evening on August 3, at approximately 
7:30 p.m., someone I've known reasonably well for several years who lives
in Central Square was stabbed while sitting at a bench in front of Rodney's.
He had inadvertently sat down next to an apparently abandoned bag which
it turned out contained unopened bottles of beer and was first accosted and
then violently attacked by a total stranger.
Members of the CPD arrived and were informed by more than one person
that the assailant was "walking down the sidewalk." The police at the scene
reportedly did nothing to pursue or apprehend the assailant.
The victim was taken by ambulance to Mass General, where he received
stitches. He had apparently succeeded in partially blocking the knife blow
and, as a result, a second wound to his side was not especially deep.
Needless to say, however, contrary to the perhaps overly optimistic characterization
of this incident by the police in their CPD "Daily Log," any wound of this kind
could easily be life threatening.
It turns out that this person was also on blood thinner. He reported to me 
that he was bleeding rather profusely. This wanton assault could have obviously
been far worse than it was.
The police report for the Daily Log for August 3 states: "The suspect is believed
to be known to the victim."
According to the victim in question, this statement is completely false.
I ask you to consider the implications of this statement in an official police log.
Where would such a falsehood come from and why? (I'm afraid I have my own
suspicions.) Why was the suspect not pursued and possibly arrested?? Don't the
CPD want the citizenry to have highly accurate information regarding assaults
and other crimes in Central Square? Whose interests are being served when
this information is suppressed, or worse yet, presented in a manner that seemingly
attempts to minimize the "threat to the public" by demeaning the integrity of an
altogether innocent victim of a violent crime by a total stranger by insinuating that
"they knew each other," and hence it's presumably nothing for anyone else to be
particularly worried about??
I wonder if this false report shouldn't be investigated, but then I wonder, "Who

Subject: Council August 25 Agenda item: 5 Alternative Housing at Churchill Park. I request that the clerk include this 
letter/email in the agenda package. 

Mayor and Council, City of Cambridge:

It came to my attention that city staff has prepared a report without public input on installing numerous pod 
type housing in Churchill park, Cambridge. This report is part of the council agenda for August 25th 2020 at 
10 am. Staff is seeking direction from the council to move forward with this proposal.

This is a very busy and well loved greenspace used by the citizens of Cambridge for sport and recreation. 
Bringing in any type of residences here is not acceptable or desirable. The park is surrounded by residential 
properties, schools, splash pads for kids, park, playground, as well as businesses.

The potential users who are planned to be housed in those pods are unknown and potentially a threat to the 
citizens who live in close proximity and to all users of churchill park.

The location of such a proposal is critical and I strongly suggest the council to vote against this location and 
direct staff to propose suitable locations together with public input from those locations prior to considering 
to vote for approval. I am against any housing projects inside this parkland.

I am flabbergasted that this was even put on the table by the very people who should be working for the hard 
working people in this city who contribute in so many ways,
Again, I request that the clerk include this letter/email in the agenda package.

Regards,
Tania Hanscom

Hello Councilors,

Becca Schofield <beccascho@gmail.com>
Monday, August 24, 2020 2:45 PM
City Council
Clerk
POR #147

I'm glad that the council is taking steps to acknowledge the urgency of addressing climate change through 
limiting/eliminating fossil fuels in new construction and preservation in Cambridge. While I admire the intent, my 
concern is that this doesn't go far enough to bring more efficient technologies and sustainable design to development 
projects.

The language should not include the assumption that "costs for different forms of clean energy are equal to or less than 
fossil fuels," because that's project-specific and provides a frame for developers that won't incentivize sustainable 
practices. If you do want to address costs as part of this PO, would be helpful to acknowledge that operating costs for 
this efficient tech are likely lower and/or more stable.

It's much more challenging to prescribe rehab measures, think this should focus on new construction opportunities. If 
very motivated to include rehab, would strongly recommend developing clearer guidance for rehab and new 
construction - e.g. consider adding insulating for gut rehabs, consider Passive House standards and compare common vs. 
unit metering approaches in new construction.

The sustainable technologies that may be considered in these studies vary greatly based on building size, type, and use:
new residential buildings < 10 units can be developed with no fossil fuel reliance much more easily than 100 unit 
buildings. Furthermore, residential and commercial buildings have vastly different needs for ventilation, utilities, etc.

Without including more detail on the measure you'd like developers to consider for categories of building types and 
uses, you'll see a range of studies framed to support their preferred tech. It's also important to acknowledge the cost of 
a WUFI model; would recommend that nonprofit developers have the option to pursue a more affordable analysis 
and/or can access grant funding for Green Building Projects.

I'm excited that the City is pursuing more aggressive action to make our built environment more carbon neutral. I hope
this PO can be an opportunity to set a higher standard, particularly for large new construction and commercial 
developments that have the biggest opportunity to make a more positive climate impact.

All my best,
Becca Schofield

Communication to the City Council Re: Appointments to the CHA Board of 
Commissioners (9/10/20)

[Please include as a 'Communication' for Monday's City Council Meeting. Thanks.]

September 10, 2020

Dear Councillors,

I wonder why so many appointments to various boards and commissions
seem to turn into "lifetime appointments" in Cambridge?? Can it be that
difficult to find qualified citizens to "serve" in a city so rich in talent and
people eager to participate in civic life as Cambridge? What's the problem?
Please consider this unfortunate (and undemocratic) reality in weighing
renewal of appointments, especially any which involve persons who have
occupied positions for more than a decade. (Some just keep getting rolled
over forever!)

Please at least ask prospective appointees to the CHA Board the following:

1) What is your view regarding meaningful tenant participation at CHA?

2) Do you support public comment on announced agenda items

at CHA Board Meetings, as was once actually the case in Cambridge,
and is evidently the case today in neighboring cities like Somerville,
but not in Cambridge?

3) Do you support exploring the possibility for tenants in distinct

developments having the option of actually hiring the management 
companies or teams for their developments, as has been the case
apparently for years at some affordable housing developments in
Boston? And would you at least support the review of management
hires and promotions at CHA developments by the tenant community
in their respective developments??

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, James Williamson Jefferson Park

Cambridge, MA

Communication to the City Council regarding the Community Preservation Act and CPA 
Funding & Formula

[Dear Anthony: Please include this as a Communication for the Council Meeting of 9/14/20.
Thanks.]

September 10, 2020

To the City Council:

Everyone knows that the distribution "formula" for CPA money will be 80-10-10
for so-called "affordable housing," as it has always been, but I feel obliged to send
a few remarks to our elected representatives nevertheless.
First of all, the online submission "form" used for comments does not allow one
to indicate an interest in more than just one category. Why is that?? Some of us
are interested in supporting all three.
And the form asks only if one is a "Resident or Business Owner." One could be both,
I suppose, but why are we being asked if we are "Residents" when the proponents
of 80-10-10 "for affordable," invariably work for and run the entities which ultimately
receive this funding, and are routinely allowed to testify at public hearings (and even
City Council meetings) without being required to provide their home addresses like the
rest of us?? A number of them live in leafy suburbs like Reading and Southborough,
but they love preaching "density" to those of us who live here! This seems profoundly 
disingenuous and hypocritical. We all know the annual CPA "process" is rigged, but
can't there be even a modicum of respect for those of us who actually do live in
Cambridge when it comes to deciding how to spend our own money?? It is, after all,
the "COMMUNITY - PRESERVATION - ACT," is it not??

[SOME COMMENTS ON THE CPA ALLOCATION FORMULA]

I am quite certain that nothing anyone says or writes will make the slightest bit of difference
to the decision about the CPA  allocation. I was an enthusiastic supporter of the Community Preservation Act, 
but would probably not vote for it again, primarily due to the anti-democratic nature of this “process,” and the 
fact - obvious to anyone with half a brain — that the “process”
is rigged. The recipients of the CPA money dutifully show up and “testify,” knowing they will soon be getting 
funds for their “non-profits” and their “mission” (and their payroll!), as if the outcome were ever in doubt. Is it 
really all that surprising that no one else do?? Lisa Peterson chaired the meeting and then, the very next day, 
joined the Affordable Housing Trust meeting and urged everyone there (the recipients of the money) to 
mobilize support for the 80-10-10 formula from which they benefit directly. There is scarcely any sign of 
embarrassment. The CHA reportedly circulated a “petition” of support at Lincoln Way and several other 
locations. No petitions were spontaneously circulated by anyone at Jefferson Park, where I live. One might ask,

“Why not?” Apart from the fact that everyone here knows the result is a foregone conclusion, tenants of 
affordable housing are routinely left out of the picture when it comes to most of the decisions which affect 
our lives. Why support funding for something when your voices are routinely ignored?? “Just to have a roof 
over your head,” as someone who does NOT live in affordable housing recently opined. I can’t support 80-10-
10 “for affordable housing” anymore. Not without explicit commitments to lift up the voices of those who live 
in the housing that is to be funded, so, for example, management and management companies are re-
organized and re-directed to respect tenants and require full tenant participation. No one who “do” affordable 
housing EVER seem discuss how those of us who live in it are treated or feel about how we're treated.
Projects that are funded actually entail the reduction of practical open space. Deficits of open space should 
be compensated for with a comparable reduction in the funding for the so-called "affordable housing."
At Jefferson Park, a CPA-funded project involved the CHA's clear-cutting approximately 96 trees at the 
existing site. CHA now seek to destroy all the remaining brick buildings at Jefferson Park and to add 50 per 
cent additional “density.” (While they drive in from the suburbs!) How could anyone in his or her right mind 
countenance the destruction of their own homes in this
way, for these suburbanites?? Dozens and dozens of trees will be cut down if this plan is funded and allowed 
to go forward.
As if these predations were not bad enough, the cost of these so-called “affordable units” is as much as 
$528,000 a unit. (See the TDC per unit of the newly approved expansion at 402 Rindge Ave., already “pre-
approved” by the Affordable Housing Trust.) Lots of people are making lots of money, but WE’RE paying for it. 
This isn’t “COMMUNITY PRESERVATION,” this is a kind of organized gangsterism and pillage by people who 
know they know best and whose own spouses even, in some cases, are involved in the very same business. Is 
our money being squandered?
Condos in Reading, where the director of planning and development at the Housing Authority lives, who 
testified for the 80-10-10 without providing her home address, could be purchased for $460,000 each or less. 
I haven’t even mentioned the portion of the purported “Historic Preservation” allocation that actually goes to 
support officially-approved “affordable housing” projects.
The whole business is a sham and a scam, I'm sorry to say.
I support THE PUBLIC — AND PUBLICLY ACCOUNTABLE — PROVISION OF HOUSING!
I do NOT support THIS... I now recommend 40 per cent for "Housing," 20 percent for (actual)  "Historic 
Preservation," and 40 per cent for "Open Space," until such time as this process has been rendered more 
genuinely democratic, the authentic voices of tenants residing in affordable housing are truly heard, without 
prompting from their landlords, and the purposes of the Act are restored to what was originally intended: 
COMMUNITY PRESERVATION.

Sincerely, James M. Williamson

or any other "leafy suburb...")

Elizabeth Gombosi <egombosi@gmail.com>
Monday, September 14, 2020 12:24 PM
City Council; City Clerk
City Council September 14, 2020

Honorable Councillors:

I wish to speak today on two issues:

POR 2020 #188:

I strongly support the proposal to close several blocks in Harvard Square to vehicular traffic. This is 
an idea that has worked extremely well in other cities. Not only does it improve safety and support the 
business community, but it greatly enhances the experience of residents and visitors alike… 
something Harvard Square can use!

POR 2020 no # given in the agenda:

I strongly oppose passage of the 100% AHO as currently written. Some have said the issue has been 
discussed endlessly, but what was discussed was a former version of the ordinance and many of the 
important amendments to that version (such as protections for our tree canopy) have been dropped 
from the current version. There has been little discussion of critical amendments to the current 
version, nor of other options which would provide much more needed affordable housing.

The AHO ordinance was based largely on recommendations from builders and developers, who have 
financially supported the candidacy of some of the supporting councillors… that seems very 
questionable to me!

The AHO removes property owners’ rights.

The AHO removes vital design review from the Planning Board.

The AHO is a threat to the distinct characteristics of Cambridge neighborhoods, which make this city 
such an interesting place to live.

The AHO ignores critical components of the Envision document.

The AHO will promote discrimination by concentrating low-income residents in social ghettos.

The AHO provides no criteria to evaluate the success or failure of built projects.

The AHO is a poor proposal. Cambridge can and should do better!

Thank you,

Elizabeth Gombosi

gather here has concerns - about a lot of things
LetterToCambridgeCouncil9_14_20.pdf

Attached is a letter outlining being left out of the process of reimagining Cambridge Street but also, not feeling like the 
City of Cambridge has supported the small business community in re-opening (as best we can) in light of a global 
pandemic. The City of Cambridge has been slower than our neighbors to create a consistent campaign and with so many 
businesses in the US closing FOREVER it behooves us to work together to help mend the fabric of our City.

Cambridge, MA 02142 

	
 
August 23, 2020 
 
 
To the Planning Board and City Council: 
 
I am writing to voice my support for BioMed Realty and the new development they have 
proposed for 585 Third Street. As the owner of Cambridge Spirits Dana Hill Liquors, small 
businesses that straddle Kendall and Central Squares, respectively, I believe it would benefit 
both of those areas- and the city as a whole. 
 
I look at the 585 Third Street proposal from the perspective of a small business owner. For 
retail shops like mine, an active and busy neighborhood is essential. We depend on foot 
traffic and visitors from nearby neighborhoods incorporating us into their routine as they 
pass through. That’s why I’m so excited about BioMed’s efforts to revitalize the Canal 
District in Kendall Square- more restaurants, arts, activations, and attractions will draw more 
people to this area and benefit not only my business but the many others in the vicinity. 
Some, especially bars and restaurants, have suffered under this pandemic even worse than 
Cambridge Spirits. 585 Third Street is the capstone to these efforts to transform the Canal 
District and would permanently transform the area into one much more inviting and 
accessible to all Cantabridgians. 
 
My shop is also on the doorstep of Central Square, and I have seen the toll that COVID is 
taking on that neighborhood- especially some beloved arts organizations, which were already 
in trouble before the pandemic. In my view, any expansion of the arts in Cambridge- let 
alone one as robust and diverse as the one BioMed is proposing- should be welcomed now 
more than ever. The arts are so important to a dynamic, attractive, exciting Cambridge which 
is the baseline for how businesses like mine can succeed. 
 
I hope you will vote in favor of the zoning needed to make this project a reality. I support it 
as a small business owner and know I speak for many others in the small retail world; but I 
also support it as someone who wants to see Cambridge continue to grow and come out of 
this pandemic stronger than ever. 
 
Thank you for your time, 
 

 
Charles J Marquardt 
Owner, Cambridge Spirits 
Owner, Dana Hill Liquors

Hello Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, City Manager DePasquale, and esteemed members 
of the Cambridge City Council. 
 
My name is Kayleigh Kane, and I am a resident of Cambridge, and a proud member of the 
ImprovBoston community. I offer this testimony in support of the petition hosted by 
MASSCreative to advocate for protection and relief for arts and culture in Cambridge. 
 
I am a full-time artist and arts educator. As an ImprovBoston instructor and cast member of the 
ImprovBoston National Touring Company, I was making the majority of my income at or through 
this organization before the COVID-19 emergency. ImprovBoston has been one of the main 
contributors to my development as a performing artist, and as an arts educator, and I truly don’t 
know where I would be without it. 
 
One of the jobs I hold in the performing arts is as an Intimacy Director and Consent 
Professional. I work with groups of performing artists facilitate communication around consent, 
and help to ensure the mental and physical safety of artists as they perform moments of 
physical contact and sequences of simulated intimacy. As such, I have developed workshops 
for promoting consent and safety in Improv specifically, and ImprovBoston has been invaluable 
in the development and implementation of this curriculum. Because ImprovBoston prioritized the 
safety and well-being of their cast members and invested in these trainings, I believe we’re 
becoming a national leader in consensual improv. With IB’s help, I’ve now been able to start 
offering this training to improvisers at other theaters, and in other parts of the country. The 
adoption of this work, I believe, is central to making improv more safe and more inclusive 
around the world. ImprovBoston is at the forefront of that change. 
 
Since I moved to the greater Boston area in 2016, ImprovBoston has brought me to Central 
Square every single week. When I first joined the community, I would attend class once a week, 
and drop into a show most weekends. By 2020, I was rolling into ImprovBoston 5 or 6 times a 
week, every week. And with almost every trip to Central Square, I would visit another local 
business. The Green Goddess bowl at Life Alive has fueled many of my performances at 
ImprovBoston’s community-centered Harold Nights. Naco Taco is a favorite hang-out spot after 
a rehearsal. I’ve had countless meetings with ImprovBoston directors at 1369 Coffee House, 
and the students I teach at ImprovBoston have probably never seen me without one of their 
lemon ginger teas in hand. After shows, with my adrenaline still running high and needing to 
blow off steam, I head to the Field, or Zuzu’s, or Middle East, or 730. And I don’t think my 
boyfriend has ever attended a show without INSISTING we get Aleppo Palace takeout 
afterwards. 
 
I buy my plants at Central Square Florist, I get my art supplies in the basement of Artist and 
Craftsman Supply Cambridge, I get my records at Cheapo, and I get my exercise at the Dance 
Complex! And I would not have discovered any of these places - let alone made them my 
“usuals” - if I had not been pulled in by the loving and supportive community at ImprovBoston.

Lastly, I want to speak briefly to the deeply positive impact ImprovBoston has on the countless 
lives it touches. As an instructor of both youth and adult classes, I have seen firsthand the 
unbridled joy improv brings at any age. I have seen children be positively transformed by their 
newfound confidence after making somebody laugh for the first time. Children who have been 
bullied at school, or who are struggling with a learning disability, or who are settling into a new 
foster home have all found a supportive and creative outlet in my ImprovBoston classroom. 
 
In my adult classes, I’ve taught introductory improv to parents, grandparents, college students, 
salespeople, HR professionals, construction workers, managers, circus performers, social 
workers, and engineers. And regardless of what age, background, profession, or personality 
type people walk into the room with, the one thing I hear from almost everybody is how grateful 
they are to be in a room where they can totally be themselves. Improv has helped me personally 
build stronger relationships with people in my life, encouraged me to be more confident and 
adventurous, and supported me through struggles with my mental health. This, and more, is 
what is brought to the lives of the hundreds and hundreds of people who come through the 
ImprovBoston Comedy School. Improv gives people a space to realize and express their 
creativity, to fully express big emotions, to improve their communication skills, and, of course, to 
laugh! 
 
And holy shit, do we need to laugh right now. 
 
Recently, in a virtual improv class, a new student joined the group in a round of uproarious 
laughter at a goofy story we had just worked together to tell. The new student then paused, and 
said “Oh my god, I think that was my first time laughing out loud in three months.” Comedy, in 
this time of uncertainty and great loss, has been an exercise in healing for so many. This has 
cemented my already-firm belief that our community in Cambridge needs ImprovBoston, and 
every ounce of the camaraderie, joy, and laughter it brings. 
 
I urge you, Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, City Manager DePasquale, and Councillors, to 
adopt the policy recommendations set forth in the petition hosted by MASSCreative, to protect 
the future of arts and culture in the city of Cambridge. 
 
Thank you for your time, 
Kayleigh Kane

I was hoping to speak at today's City Council meeting at 5:30 PM, on behalf of the petition hosted by MASSCreative. 
Unfortunately, I may not be able to attend, due to a work conflict, and I was wondering if I could submit my comments

9/14 Council Meeting Public Comment re:City Manager

To whom it may concern,

I am writing to submit a public comment for this evening's Council meeting.

I strongly oppose extending the City Manager's contract for any longer than one year. He has not taken seriously the 
needs of Cambridge residents--especially broadband, housing, and public safety without police. I do not have faith that 
we can make real progress on these pressing issues without a change in the office of City Manager.

Furthermore, I encourage the Council not to extend the City Manager's contract beyond its current end date.

Sincerely,

9/14/2020	

Dear	Mayor	and	Councilors,	

I	am	writing	for	the	Cambridge	Residents	Alliance	regarding	Policy Order #8 (POR 2020 #198) on 
tonight’s agenda regarding	extension	of	the	city	manager’s	contract. 

The	city	council	has	had	to	delay	addressing	many	important	issues	to	deal	with	the	coronavirus	
pandemic,	including	the	manager’s	request	to	extend	his	contract.		Since	the	Council	has	to	reply	to	the	
manager	soon,	we	ask	that	the	council	extend	the	contract	for	one	year	only,	with	an	option	to	extend	
the	contract	for	an	additional	6-12	months	if	needed.		We	think	that	is	preferable	to	the	18	months	
proposed	by	Councilor	Simmons	(COF	2020	#46.)	

We	also	ask	that	the	Council	decide	on	a	process	to	evaluate	the	manager,	and	begin	that	evaluation	as	
soon	as	possible.	Initially	the	Council	could	evaluate	the	manager	using	the	most	recent	Council	goals,	
including	criteria	for	success,	and	require	a	means	of	public	input.		Longer-term,	the	Council	should	
design	a	more	comprehensive	evaluation,	such	as	is	outlined	in	“Evaluating	the	City	Manager	Best	
Management	Practices,”	http://fccma.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Evaluating-the-City-
Manager.pdf	.	

That	document	notes	that	a	comprehensive	manager	evaluation	provides	feedback,	demonstrates	
accountability	to	residents,	and	maintains	alignment	between	goals	and	accomplishments.	The	
evaluation	should	address	1)	results	that	should	be	accomplished,	and	the	extent,	efficiency	and	
effectiveness	with	which	specific	established	goals	and	expectations	can	be	tracked	to	determine	
success,	and	2)	a	wide	range	of	leadership	skills	that	should	be	demonstrated.	
	
The	document	recommends	that	the	Council	adopt,	after	getting	public	input,	an	organizational	Vision,	
Mission,	Goals	and	Objectives	that	can	be	objectively	tracked	to	determine	progress/success	as	part	of	
the	performance	review	process.		It	also	recommends	that	“the	city	manager	complete	a	self-evaluation,	
providing	elected	officials	the	process	by	which	he/she	pursued	organizational	and	individual	goals,	and	
the	perceptions	of	both	the	Manager	and	stakeholders	of	his/her	success	or	failure	in	meeting	those	
goals	during	the	review	period.”	

In	addition	to	working	on	the	evaluation	of	the	manager	and	designing	a	comprehensive	manager	
evaluation,	we	ask	that	the	Council	establish	a	process	and	timing	for	a	nation-wide	city	manager	search	
and	hiring	process.		That	process	should	include	a	national	salary	survey.		The	city’s	search	for	a	school	
superintendent	could	inform	the	search	for	a	city	manager.	
	
At	a	public	meeting	of	the	Cambridge	Residents	Alliance	in	early	2020,	many	members	of	the	public	
expressed	dissatisfaction	with	the	lack	of	evaluation	of	the	manager,	and	expressed	concerns	about	
specific	aspects	of	his	performance.		Residents	were	unhappy	that	too	many	times	the	manager	has	not	
responded	at	all	to	the	Council’s	repeated	policy	orders,	or	has	responded	very	slowly.		Residents	
expressed	dissatisfaction	with	the	development	model	that	this	and	prior	managers	have	used,	which	
includes	permitting	substantial	commercial	development	in	order	to	generate	tax	revenue.		
	
Other	areas	of	concern	include	the	lack	of	manager’s	dialogue	with	the	council	about	not	responding	to	
policy	orders,	and	the	fact	that	he	has	over-ruled	some	policies.	These	concerns	also	include	the	
manager’s	initial	refusal	to	start	a	broadband	feasibility	study,	extending	the	ban	on	re-usable	bags,	
slowness	to	increase	funding	for	affordable	housing,	delays	on	implementing	Shared	Streets,	and	the	
lack	of	transparency	on	Covid	task	force	meetings.

Term of City Manager and Better Planning and Zoning

I support a thorough, formal, and open evaluation of the City Manager, based on the stated goals of the 
council.
I favor granting a one-year contract only.   I would like to see some new blood in the city management. 

 I would like to see the following:
- better planning for the future, 
- more carefully considered zoning,
- preservation of some historic urban plans [East Cambridge Urban Plan], and
- an end to developers trading affordable housing In order to break height limits, or other existing limits. 

I also want to mention that I have the impression that several of the speakers at City Council during the 

4.
hearings for the CambridgeSide petition in 2019 spoke with little passion and seemed to 

have received some inducement(s) to appear on behalf of N.E.D.   This is an impression, not an 
assertion, as I have no proof.

City Manager Contract Renewal and Charter Review

I would like to state my opinion that City Manager DePasquale's contract should be extended by as little time as possible 
or perhaps not renewed at all. He has not demonstrated the kind of progressive leadership that is expected from a city 
like Cambridge.

Fellow Cantabridgian Chris Schmidt lays out some data on his blog post:

At the end of the 2017 Council session, more than 35 items awaiting report from the City Manager — some 
dating back more than 18 months — were simply “placed on file” after a lack of response from the Manager, 
and this is by no means atypical.  
[...]
Throughout 2017, 7 different policy orders were filed seeking information on the current status of the City on 
moving forward on the recommendations of the Municipal Broadband Task Force — none received a 
response.

When residents asked for a copy of the Cambridge Police Department's annual report to the City Manager and an 
inventory of police equipment, the Manager should have had these in hand as stipulated by the Department's 
requirement to submit an annual report. Yet it was nowhere to be found.

Every employee I know is submitted to a yearly, if not more frequent, performance review by their employer where they 
are measured against an explicit rubric or framework that allows employers to assess whether the employee has been 
doing a good job. Where is the City Manager's performance review? On what basis is his performance evaluated?

If I had ignored requests for 35 different reports at my job, like the City Manager has, my manager would certainly be 
calling me in for a chat or have me put on a Performance Improvement Plan or perhaps fire me on the spot.

City Manager is a position with an enormous amount of power in Cambridge, and we must hold that power to account. 
Please do not vote to extend the City Manager's contract by 24 months.

The time is ripe to look at our city charter with a critical eye and see if there is not a way to improve our government's 
accountability and transparency.

Thank you,
Jae Storozum

On the City Manager's Contract Renewal

In my opinion, the City Manager needs to demonstrate greater accountability to the Council and the Public in order to 
earn a long-term renewal of his contract. Given that he has been nonresponsive to repeated orders from the Council, 
even with demonstrated broad support, and has actively misled the council on important elements of fact in response to 
Council demands, I believe that a careful evaluation of the City Manager's work is due -- and sorely lacking.

I would encourage you to keep this in mind as you consider his contract renewal this evening.

(I meant to include this in my public comment, but I spaced out and forgot; forgive me.)

Comments at tonight's city council meeting

George Schneeloch
81 School St #1
Somerville MA
Committee report #5 (Cycling Safety Ordinance amendment)

I think about something I saw two years ago. Amanda Phillips partner said a couple years ago "my heart goes 
out to the family and friends who are forced into this position because their lives weren’t urgent enough" and 
now we're here

I feel so badly for Darryl Willis and his Niece who witnessed his death in Harvard Square.

We should be fighting to prevent people from being hurt and I feel horrible and a little guilty we didn't fight 
harder when Sharon Hamer was killed last year. People trust us to fight for them and his family is now dealing 
with this terrible event in their lives.

Please pass this law

9/14/20 City Council Meeting agenda thoughts

Madam Mayor and Councilors,
I wanted to share my personal thoughts on some of the business before you tonight. Given the scope of the agenda, I 
will comment on them in order and I will try to be brief. 
Charter Right 2 
There are currently 56 items on the awaiting reports list. Does the council really want to ask the manager to spend time 
investigating this? I can only imagine that in addition to the probable legal issues, the logistical, personnel, and union 
issues would make this amazingly complicated and unlikely to come to fruition. It seems like passage would only 
generate unnecessary work for the administration, while not addressing the need for ensuring equity in the 
enforcement of traffic laws throughout the city.
Charter Right 3
I would happily support anything that would increase the ease and likelihood of a high voter turnout in Cambridge. It is 
the cornerstone of our constitutional republic.
Applications and Petitions 2
I don't believe that the applicant has reached out to ISNA yet. I think that the council should hear their opinion before 
making a decision.
Applications and Petitions 3
I am in full support of BioMed Realty's zoning petition. I believe it will carry forward the spirit of the constellation center 
which will benefit the area.
Policy Order 4
While I think that there are potential merits to the spirit of this order, I am concerned because I don't believe that the 
HSBA was engaged prior to or during the drafting. I have heard all of you state multiple times that you are concerned 
with protecting small businesses. Unfortunately, there seems to be a tendency to not reach out to constituent groups 
that are bound to be affected, before putting in policy orders. I just wanted to point this out and once again ask you all 
to seek out and respect our opinions. It has been hard feeling ignored, especially give the additional challenges that the 
Covid-19 pandemic has presented to the small business community.
Committee Report 2
I believe that I have made my feelings abundantly clear about the CSO. I truly hope that you will opt to remove 
Cambridge Street from this restrictive and prescriptive ordinance. Leaving it in will almost definitely result in an outcome 
that a handful of you have publicly stated would be disappointing. While deciding what actions you will take tonight, 
please consider how you would be feeling about this if it had been an administration driven process, instead of a council 
driven process. Would any of you as individuals been comfortable with the near complete lack of public process? I have 
heard almost all of you clearly state the importance of public process and vocally complain when city staff haven't 
executed outreach to your standards. I am simply asking that you hold yourselves to that same standard. 
Additionally, I feel the need to set the record straight. This morning, Cambridge Bicycle Safety sent out an email to 
generate support for passage of the CSO. Their email included the line "However, there has been lobbying behind the 
scenes to remove Cambridge St. from the ordinance . . . . . (sic)" In my opinion, this is an outrageous display of gas 
lighting. 
The reality is that members of Cambridge Bicycle Safety and the City Council, met behind closed doors to draft the 
ordinance, with no input from anyone else else. The ECBA has sent letters that are a part of the public record to voice 
our concerns. After the PO was taken off the table, we reached out to all of you collectively and individually to attempt 
to find a solution that would be palatable to all parties. Additionally, I reached out directly to the Cambridge Bicycle 
Safety in an effort to find common ground. Unfortunately, Cambridge Bicycle Safety chose to spread a complete lie,

which will ultimately only dive a wedge deeper between different groups. It is disappointing and disheartening that they 
are choosing to conduct themselves this way.
Committee Report 3 
I am supportive of the AHO and I am thankful for the amendment to protect active first floor space. I did want to point 
out that I believe that there is a potential problem with the two year look back in that amendment. Two sites come to 
mind quickly that this would impact. The Sunset Cafe site at 851 Cambridge Street, caught fire in January of 2019, so we 
are less than 4 months away from the two year cap. Additionally, the University Monument Works, at 1055 Cambridge 
Street has been vacant for over three years. Losing first floor retail on either of these sites would negatively impact the 
commercial corridor. Please work to remedy this potential issue.
Committee Report 4
I fully support extending the City Manager's contract for 24 months. Given the ongoing challenges presented by the 
Covid-19 crisis, consistency is incredibly important. Having actively participated in the most recent City Manager 
selection process, I find it unlikely that we as a community will be able to engage in the public process necessary to chart 
a new course of our community that this hire will signify, if we try to rush things. The city is in great hands under the 
leadership of Mr DePasquale and we should utilize his experience while we work collaboratively through this important 
transition. 
Committee Report 5
Lastly, I fully support the appointment of Louis Bacci, III to the Cambridge Housing Authority Board. 
Thank you for your service,

--

Policy Order #8 (POR 2020 #198.)

Welcome back after a summer unlike any we have experienced! I appreciate your work during this time of pandemic and 
upheaval.

I am writing today regarding Policy Order #8 (POR 2020 #198.) regarding an extension of the City Manager's contract. 
Please give the manager a one-year contract Extension with the option of a 6-12 month further extension. In a previous 
meeting, the majority of the council seemed to be opposed to the longer 2 year contract. 

In addition I hope you institute a detailed plan to evaluate the manager based on the goals of the city.

Although Louise DePesquale has worked diligently through the years to serve the city, many Cambridge residents 
believe we need a new manager who will more closely follow the policy goals of you, our elected officials. We also need 
a thorough evaluation f the manager based on the goals of the council.

TO: council@cambridgema.gov, clerk@cambidgema.gov 

Monday 14Sep20 530pm Cambridge City Council Meeting 

I’m Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street, Cambridge. 

Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councilors –  

Policy Order #4 which proposes to close a few blocks of Harvard Square streets 

to cars is exactly the kind of innovative change we need to add new Covid-safe 

space for outdoor seating and retail and help Harvard Square work its way back 

to the kind of socially and economically successful destination it used to be.  

This idea has already proved effective in several other major cities around the 

country and should be implemented in Cambridge as quickly as possible.  Please 

give it your strong support. 

As to the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay ordinance, I enthusiastically endorse 

your heroic efforts over the last year or two to negotiate a fair and workable plan 

to increase the amount of affordable housing in Cambridge.  But I am deeply 

disappointed that so many wise and well-drafted enhancements agreed to in your 

hundreds of hours of debate and discussion last session are not included in the 

ordinance language before you tonight.  Cambridge clearly needs more 

affordable housing, but all residents of this historic city deserve a balanced 

approach to fill that need.  And our planet simply begs for relief from the forces 

that are rapidly shrinking our vital tree canopy and open spaces that benefit every 

resident of every economic level in our already dense city.  The horrific wildfires 

on the west coast, the increasingly violent storms which are now commonplace 

everywhere and the melting of glaciers dramatically raising our ocean levels are 

just the first harbingers of what we all face if we do not take our obligations to 

this planet seriously.   As one pundit put so perfectly: “If we do not, the next 

endangered species - is us.”  I hope you will take time to add back in at least 

some of last year’s vital environment amendments before adopting this 

ordinance.   We – and the planet - are counting on you.

Subject: City Council: Santander Projecting Sign, Central Sq., App. 1 (2020 #32), 9/14/20

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon and City Councillors:

Sure! This is way down on everyone’s priority list, BUT …
- Enough already! The 8 Central Square banks are already plenty “SIGNED UP.”   Indeed, some are screaming: Look 
Here > Look Here More >  No, Look Only Here!
See attached bank-photos, West to East, 4 short blocks.
- These 8 banks’ many existing signs already distract from Central Sq.’s fabulous murals, retail stores’ signs and eclectic 
architecture. Especially so, now that so many retail businesses and restaurants are folding.
- Yes, the Council has already approved 2 of the 8 banks’ projecting signs!
- But, that’s no justification for approving Santander’s now. Mass Ave. and adjacent sidewalks are our public way and 
air rights, not the bank$’. No one’s entitled to use our public way to advertise, least of all banks that are overwhelming 
our once vibrant Central Square.

Please just stop favoring banks with the privilege of protruding into our public way & air rights. 

Central Square – Mass Ave., 8 Banks, 4 blocks (Photos attached)
1. Bank of America Financial Center - #727
2. Citizens Bank - #689 - Existing 2 huge, projecting signs
3. Leader Bank - #675
4. Eastern Bank - #647
5. Cambridge Savings Bank - #630 – Existing 2 small, projecting sign
6. TD Bank - #617
7. Santander Bank - #599 - Next Up?
8, People’s United Bank - #485

*Yes, Santander’s proposed projecting sign is smaller than those the Council has already permitted.

But, especially now with more local businesses disappearing, please: Just say “no” more!

Thanks, as always, for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Carol O’Hare
172 Magazine St.

Danroy DJ Henry Resolution 

I want to send deep heartfelt appreciation for the Resolution presented tonight requesting the reopening of the Case for 
Danroy DJ Henry and am grateful to Cambridge City Council leaders, Marc McGovern, Sumbul Siddiqui, Denise Simmons, 
Quinton Zondervan and others for their support of this Resolution. 

We all know (or are now realizing) “DJ Henry” could easily be the son we have sent off to college. I thank you for holding 
the officer involved in stepping in front of and shooting into a car full of students accountable for his reckless and 
dangerous actions. 

With great hopes for the future,

July 24, 2020 

Dear Cambridge City Councilors: 

      The City’s Transit Advisory Committee met virtually on July 8, 2020 to review and discuss the 
proposed ordinance amending the “Cycling Safety Ordinance”. We understand that this proposed 
ordinance amendment is to be voted on by the City Council as early as the summer Council meeting in 
late July 2020. While the Committee generally agreed with the intent and overall thrust of the 
ordinance, the Committee wanted to express a few concerns with the ordinance as it is currently 
written. Below, we suggest several changes to ensure that the City analyzes the changes to streets with 
both cyclists and bus riders in mind and that bus riders in the City are not unduly delayed by the changes 
that implementation of this ordinance would bring about on City streets.  

       When allocating precious street space in the City, the Committee feels that it is important to 
remember that the clear plurality of people on the street on major bus corridors such as Massachusetts 
Ave. and Mt. Auburn St. are on the bus. Many bus riders simply cannot or will not ride bikes, others have 
disabilities that make riding the bus the most comfortable and safe. In addition, large proportions of bus 
riders are members of under-represented minority groups who depend on public transportation for the 
majority of their trips to, from, and within Cambridge. Our buses in Cambridge also attract a wide range 
of “choice” riders that have historically chosen to ride the bus for a variety of reasons even though they 
generally have access to other means of transportation. Some of these riders chose the bus to save 
money, sometimes save time, for their own personal impact on climate change, stay out of bad weather, 
or because they feel safest while riding with others on a bus. We hope that the City Council recognizes 
this substantial group of street users during your deliberations and carefully evaluate and assess 
whether any unintentional consequences of the Cycling Safety Ordinance could potentially cause 
unacceptable delays to bus riders. 

      In this spirit, the Committee would like to offer the following specific amendments to the ordinance, 
as it is currently drafted, for careful consideration by the Council: 

1. 

2. 

In paragraph H of Section 12.22.030, amend the definition of “Public Transportation” to include 
the word “routes” as well as “stops” as follows: “shall mean bus and shuttle routes and stops”; 
In Section 12.22.040, paragraph B, insert a new phrase in the second sentence as follows (in 
italics): “Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above will be considered 
impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager determines that the 
characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, a demonstrable negative impact on a 
Public Transportation route’s travel times and/or other service quality factors will result from full 
compliance, or financial constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent 
Separated Bicycle Lane with Adequate Directionality.”

3. 

In Section 12.22.040, paragraph E, insert the following phrase (in italics) in the first sentence: 
“By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-block 
analysis determining the impacts, including the potential travel time and/or other service quality 
impacts for Public Transportation riders of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated 
Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:” 

4.  Any other amendments that the Council may deem appropriate consistent with the above 

changes and the intent of not diminishing, but improving, the riding experience and travel time 
of bus riders throughout the City. 

      The Committee appreciates the opportunity to comment on this proposed ordinance and hopes that 
the City Council will seriously consider these recommendations. 

Sincerely, 

 
John Attanucci on behalf of the Transit Advisory Committee 
Chair, Transit Advisory Committee 
 

c.c., Andrew Reker, Assistant Transportation Planner, CCD

WHEREAS:  The City Council was deeply saddened to learn of the sudden passing of Justin Waithe 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

on August 22, 2020; and 
 
Justin Aaron Leroy Waithe was born in Boston, MA, on October 8, 1979 to the Rev. 
Leroy (deceased) and Cecilia Waithe, he was brother to Sheralyn Waithe Henry and 
Joel Waithe, and as a child, Justin attended Agape Christian Academy, before later 
attending Rhema Bible Training Center and UMass Lowell; and 
 
From a very young age, it was apparent that Justin Waithe was truly gifted in the area 
of music – from his voice being the family's wake up call, recording pretend radio 
shows, singing lead parts in his school and church performances, teaching the youth in 
his church how to "step," singing the National Anthem during the playoff season for 
the Boston Celtics, singing with the Boston Pops, and being the voice a bride and 
groom would hear for their first dance, it wasn't hard to figure out that music and the 
arts would play a huge part in his life; and 
 
Justin Waithe not only showed who he was through his music, but also through his 
style and natural charisma; and 
 
Justin Waithe's deep love for his family was also evident throughout the course of his 
life, and that love was taken to the next level when his nephew and nieces were born, 
as one of his favorite titles was "Uncle," and he truly enjoyed serving in that role for 
his family and for his friends, proudly filling in the gap for the fatherless and becoming 
a surrogate uncle for some of his closest friends’ children; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Over the last several years, Justin Waithe was very passionate about people's rights, 

regardless of their race, religion, or orientation, he wanted to show people that 
disagreement and respect can coexist, he spoke with clear conviction and passion 
without ever expressing judgment or hate, because he was proud of who he was and 
wanted people to see that; and 
 
Justin Waithe’s legacy will continue to be celebrated by his Mom, siblings, nieces, 
nephew, cousins, and a host of relatives and friends, and his memory shall be forever 
cherished; now therefore be it  

 
WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

ORDERED: 

On the night of October 16, 2010, Danroy “DJ” Henry went out in 
Pleasantville, NY with teammates, celebrating the win of Pace University’s 
Homecoming Football Game; and 
 
DJ’s parents, Angela Henry and Danroy Henry Sr. both attended Cambridge 
Rindge and Latin High School, connecting them to our city and this council; 
and 
 
Unrelated to the Pace University group, a fight broke out and local police 
were called; and   
DJ was asked by police to move his car out of a fire lane where he was 
waiting for his teammates, and as he moved his car, he was fired upon by 
Officer Aaron Hess of the Pleasantville PD; and 
DJ was shot 3 times as he drove, pulled from the car, handcuffed, then left 
face down on the street unattended, dying, with 3 bullet wounds to his chest; 
and  
Initial reports, which suggested that DJ was shot because he tried to run over 
officer Hess, were later deemed to be untrue. In fact, DJ was moving his car 
in compliance with the officers’ request; and 
Ronald Beckley, a 30-year veteran officer of Westchester County, admitted 
that in his opinion, officer Hess was the aggressor and not DJ. He further 
stated that he shot officer Hess in the leg because he did not know who he 
was and thought that he was the aggressor, and that he was not sure why Hess 
“had placed himself in front of the car”; and 
No charges have been filed against officer Hess despite this new evidence; 
and   
Since the death of DJ, it has become more and more evident that Black and 
Brown people have been killed by the hands of white police officers, 
something that has been going on long before DJ’s death, but has gained 
increased visibility due to cell phone video and police body cameras; and 
The Henry family deserve a new investigation into the killing of their son; 
now therefore be it 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record requesting that the Danroy 
“DJ” Henry’s case be reopened; that officer Aaron Hess be charged for 
excessive use of force, negligent treatment of life in the death of DJ Henry; 
and that a formal apology and acknowledgement of the misinformation that 
was knowingly stated by the Westchester Police Department and others be 
made to the Henry family; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

Over the course of the past year, a number of residents of the LBJ Apartments, located 
at 150 Erie Street, have voiced concerns that vehicles are frequently illegally parking 
in front of their building; and  
 
The space in front of this building, which is home to mostly senior citizens, is reserved 
for emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks, and LBJ residents have 
cited fears that the vehicles they regularly see illegally parked in front of their building 
could impede the work of first responders, which could have potentially deadly 
consequences in an emergency; and 
 
This issue has been brought to the attention of the City and the Cambridge Police over 
the course of the past year, but unfortunately no lasting solutions have been found, 
leaving LBJ residents frustrated over what they view as a potential hazard to their 
safety; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to ask the Director of Traffic, 
Parking, and Transportation, the Cambridge Police Department, and any other relevant 
City personnel to collaborate with the Cambridge Housing Authority in formulating 
plans that will lead to increased enforcement of the parking regulations in front of 150 
Erie Street, that will discourage illegal parking in front of the building, and to report 
back to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:  

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

It has come to the City Council’s attention that there is a recurring problem on 
Columbia Street involving the placement of trash and discarded furniture on the streets 
during the final weekend of each of the summer months, coinciding with the periods of 
greatest annual tenant turnover; and  
 
There are several multi-family homes on Columbia Street that are mostly owned by 
out-of-town landlords, and unfortunately there are no incentives for these landlords to 
ensure that their outgoing tenants be mindful of the City’s trash pick-up schedule when 
they leave, leading to the excessive placement of discarded items on the streets when 
the tenants move out, and a sense of blight and neglect in the area; and  
 
The discarded furniture and trash piles are often left out for several days between 
scheduled trash pick-ups, forcing residents of Columbia Street to regularly contact the 
City to request that the DPW be dispatched to pick up the discarded trash – a task 
which the DPW unfailingly does, and which the Columbia Street residents are grateful 
for; and  
 
As this is an issue that seems to recur each year during the summer months, the City 
should be able to anticipate the need for increased DPW trash pick-ups on Columbia 
Streets during the months of June – September each year and be able to build this into 
the DPW’s schedule of service, so that it does not continue to fall upon the Columbia 
Street residents to request this additional service each summer; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to ask the Director of the Public 
Works Department to review this matter, establish a plan that is responsive to the 
concerns of the Columbia Street residents, and report back to the City Council on this 
matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way that public spaces are 
designed and the need for open, outdoor space has dramatically increased; and 

 
Local businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and it is not clear when restaurants and 
retail will be safely able to have close to their full capacity of patrons inside; during 
this unknown period, outdoor retail and dining remains an important lifeline; and 

 
There have been numerous attempts to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety and slow 
traffic in Harvard Square after multiple fatalities have occurred over the past three 
years; and 

 
Recent studies have shown the myriad benefits that come from the pedestrianization of 
city centers, including an increase in commercial activity, and improved street life and 
safety; and 

 
Cities, including those with a similar climate to Cambridge, such as Burlington, 
Vermont and Boulder, Colorado, have permanently closed several blocks of central 
city streets creating open spaces for retail, restaurant and resident strolling; and cities 
in Europe of all sizes have had success with pedestrianized areas of urban centers; and  

 
The Council unanimously passed an order asking for certain streets in Harvard Square 
be closed to vehicle traffic on a select number of days during the summer of 2020; now 
the idea of having a permanent plan for open space and outdoor dining is appropriate; 
and 

 
The Envision Cambridge Masterplan states, “By encouraging vibrancy on streets in the 
city’s retail districts, Cambridge can ensure these commercial areas continue to meet 
the everyday needs of the city’s population. Vibrancy can be fostered both through 
street design and retail district programming”; and 

WHEREAS:  Moody Street in Waltham has been a vibrant destination over the summer as the entire 

street has been closed to vehicle traffic to make space for outdoor dining and retail; 
now therefore be it

weekends and possibly weeknights in Harvard Square.  Prior to closing, the Traffic, 
Parking and Transportation Department should conduct extensive outreach to impacted 
businesses to ensure that the closures would not prevent deliveries and other essential 
operations of those businesses; and be it further 

 
That the City Manager is requested to establish a stakeholder committee to study traffic 
impacts of any further to determine if street modifications would work towards 
fulfilling city goals; the committee would include representation from Traffic, Parking

Harvard Square Business Association, the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, 
and Harvard University, the City Pedestrian and Bicycles Committee, Mid-Cambridge 
Neighborhood Association and Cambridge Bicycle Safety and further be it

As national COVID-19 cases reach 6.2 million, vaccine developers have begun 
hundreds of clinical trials; and

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

Public Health Department must have a plan on how the vaccine will be equitably 
disseminated; and 
 
A plan will ensure residents feel confident in our public health officials’  
allocation and distribution of any vaccine that becomes available; and   
 
The plan must maintain equity at the forefront of vaccine dissemination and 
information sharing, including that we: 
•  Ensure essential workers, communities of color and low-income residents receive 
critical information to aid their decision-making around COVID-19 vaccination; 
•  Partner with community groups, health care provider networks, universities, state 
and local peers, federal authorities, and other stakeholders, in conducting rapid 
response research and message development and testing; 

•  Provide residents with clear and timely explanations regarding COVID-19 vaccine 

allocation and distribution strategies; 

•  Develop operational systems including nontraditional locations to provide 

vaccines, such as faith centers, grocery stores, schools, senior centers, offices, etc.; 
•  Work to establish a public oversight committee to review and report on COVID-19 
vaccination systems, ensuring allocation is fair, target groups receive vaccine, and 
populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic are justly served; and 

•  Mandate inclusive committee membership that reflects the jurisdiction’s 

demographic make-up, incorporates diverse sectors including business and faith 
communities, and involves experts in public health, vaccination, and ethics; now 
therefore be it 

 
 
 
The City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with Claude Jacob, Chief Public

WHEREAS: 

The U.S. census provides critical data to determine how federal funding is allocated to 
a city’s hospitals, fire departments, schools, roads, and other resources; and 
 
The results of the census also determine the number of seats each state will have in the 
U.S. House of Representatives, and they are used to draw congressional and state 
legislative districts; and 
 
The stakes are even higher during a global pandemic, and we must work together to 
complete the most accurate count of Cambridge residents to ensure proper funding 
distribution, fair government representation, and appropriate, data-informed school and 
voting district designations for the next 10 years; and 
 
To date, the City of Cambridge has employed many strategies to reach Cambridge 
residents and increase census turnout, including nightly Citywide emails, the formation 
of a multi-sector Cambridge Complete Count Committee, outreach events at Fresh 
Pond apartments, creating and disseminating materials in eight languages (public 
buildings, businesses, community spaces), through the school's Backpack Express 
program, on social media, at Bluebikes stations, through videos with CCTV and 22-
CityView, online and more; and 
 
There have been expected obstacles due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as 
decreased engagement, concerns about security in providing personal information, and 
gaps in computer and/or internet access that deny opportunities to respond online; and 
 
As of September 2, 2020, 65% of Cambridge residents have responded to the  
2020 Census, down from the 2010 census response rate of 73%; and 
 

deadline extended to September 30, 2020, which gives us two more weeks to collect as 
much information as possible; and 
 
The Cambridge Public Schools Food and Nutrition team will begin supplying free 
breakfast and lunch again Monday through Friday starting September 14, 2020; and 
 
Food distribution sites at schools and affordable housing locations are a resource for 
many community members, and gives us an opportunity to meet the community where 
they already are; now therefore be it

The Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund Grant and Loan program has been established to 
serve as a financial lifeline to our local small business community during the covid-19 
crisis, providing grants to businesses of up to $10,000, which will not have to be 
repaid, and zero interest loans of up to $15,000 from the Cambridge Redevelopment 
Authority; and 
 
The Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund Grant and Loan program was initially promoted as 
prioritizing “…businesses that have been more severely affected by the impact of the 
COVID-19 Pandemic,” and that its funds could be used toward paying such expenses 
as “…the average rent, salaries, utilities and cost of goods” that other programs do not 
cover; and 
 
At the City Council meeting held on July 27, 2020, the possibility of expanding the 
scope of organizations that would be eligible to receive funds from this program was 
raised, even as members of the City Council were hearing from some local small 
business owners that they had not previously heard about this program, or that they felt 
they had been unfairly left out of consideration for obtaining these critical funds; and 
 
The City must ensure that it has conducted truly aggressive outreach to the 
community’s most vulnerable businesses – particularly the Black and Minority-owned 
businesses, to those who are not members of the neighborhood business associations, 
and to those who may not rely heavily upon electronic communication – to ensure that 
these entities have been given every reasonable opportunity to participate in the 
Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund Grant and Loan program; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
what specific outreach methods have been conducted to the City’s small businesses, 
particularly those Black and Minority-owned small businesses, to ensure that these 
entities have been given every reasonable opportunity to participate in and receive 
funding from the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund Grant and Loan program; and be it 
further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Community 
Development Department and any other appropriate City personnel to establish a 
means of providing technical support to marginalized, underrepresented business 
owners in applying for and obtaining the critical funds from the Mayor’s Disaster 
Relief Fund Grant and Loan program, and/or from other similar State and Federal 
assistance programs, and to report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely 
manner.

WHEREAS: 

COVID-19; and 
 
SARS-CoV-2 can be shed in the feces of individuals with COVID-19, thus it

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS:  Wastewater testing has been used for years as an effective method for detecting  
any virus that can be transmitted asymptomatically and was instrumental in the  
Global Polio Eradication Initiative; and 
 
Currently, researchers around the world – in the United States, Canada, New  
Zealand, Singapore, China, Spain, United Kingdom, Netherlands and more –  
are testing wastewater to study and understand the prevalence of COVID-19  
infection rates to help prevent COVID-19 outbreaks; and 
 
The University of Arizona reported signs of a COVID-19 outbreak before it  
Started by testing their wastewater; and 
 
Cambridge Public School District is relying on several metrics to determine  
back to school planning, including the rate of positive test rate below 5%, less  
than 25 new cases per day/per 100,00, and sewage monitoring showing less  
than 100 copies of RNA per mL; and 
 
Collecting additional data provides more information for our public health  
departments to make informed, data-driven decisions for reopening and can  
reveal COVID-19 hotspots up to one to two weeks earlier than current  
individual testing; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Department of Public Works, the  
Cambridge Water Department and other relevant partners to create a pilot  
program for wastewater testing for evidence of COVID-19.

WHEREAS: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed housing situations and travel patterns for 
Cantabrigians, with many residents temporarily sheltering family members and other 
loved ones; and 
 
Cambridge’s permit parking requirements require visitors with cars to display a Visitor 
Parking Permit and park in a designated zone; and 
 
Current construction in Visitor Permit Area 14, which even normally has minimal 
street parking, has significantly reduced available space in that Permit Area even 
further; and 
 
The Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department has shown flexibility in other 
aspects of parking requirements during the pandemic by not enforcing meters and other 
restrictions for significant periods of time; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Traffic, Parking, 
and Transportation Department to examine solutions for residents with visitors in 
Permit Area 14 such as allowing parking in another Zone or access to nearby City 
garages; and be it further

WHEREAS:  Walden Street has been identified by Cambridge residents as an area with motor 

vehicle speeding issues; and 
 
This is especially dangerous on the section where Walden Street curves between 
Raymond St and Richdale Ave, making it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians who 
may be attempting to cross the street, and on the section of Walden Street between 
Richdale Ave and Massachusetts Ave; and 
 
This potentially dangerous section of Walden Street is also near Raymond Park, which 
is a major neighborhood destination, including for children and families; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Multiple Cambridge residents have already been struck and killed by motor vehicles 

thus far in 2020; and 
 
The City has adopted Vision Zero, which seeks “to eliminate all traffic related fatalities 
and serious injuries” and strives for proactive action to prevent them before a crash 
occurs; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Traffic, Parking,

RESOLVED: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that the state legislature is considering 
H.4878, the COVID-19 Housing Stability Act; and 
 
H.4878 would guarantee housing stability for renters and homeowners during the 
COVID-19 pandemic by banning evictions for unpaid rent as well as foreclosures for 
missed mortgage payments through the duration of the State of Emergency and for a 
full year after it ends; and 
 
H.4878 would provide “just cause” protections to ensure renters and foreclosed 
homeowners cannot be evicted for no-fault or non-renewal of leases through the end of 
the State of Emergency and for a full year after it ends, and would provide a local 
option for municipalities to extend these protections upon expiration; and 
 
H.4878 would expand mortgage determent protections to landlords who own up to 15 
rental units to ensure interest does not accrue during the forbearance, putting missed 
payments at the end of the loan, and it would also ensure borrowers cannot be charged 
penalties for non-payment of mortgage; and 
 
H.4878 would freeze rents at pre-COVID-19 levels, ensuring the rent amount from 
March 10, 2020 would remain in effect through 12 months following the end of the 
State of Emergency; and 
 
H.4878 would establish a COVID-19 Housing Stability and Recovery Fund to assist 
property owners who lost rental income or missed mortgage payments due to COVID-
19, with priority given to low- and middle-class homeowners, elderly, owner-occupant, 
and non-profit landlords, and landlords who own 15 or fewer units; and 
 
H.4878 would obligate property owners who choose to draw upon the fund to extend 
protections to their tenants, and it would also establish an Oversight and Advisory 
Board to make recommendations on the equitable administration of the Housing 
Stability and Recovery Fund, to include members of the Legislature’s coronavirus 
working groups as well as strong representation of people from communities hardest 
hit by the pandemic and housing crisis; and 
 
Every single member of Cambridge’s legislative delegation has signed on as a 
cosponsor of H.4878; now therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record in strong support of H.4878, and in 
urging the legislature to pass it immediately; and be it further

COMMITTEE MEMBERS  
Councillor Marc McGovern, Chair 
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon 
Councillor Patricia Nolan 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons 
Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.   

 
The Human Services and Veterans Committee held a public hearing on Thursday, June 25, 2020 at 2:30 
p.m. in the Sullivan Chamber to receive an update from the Department of Human Services and the 
School Department on Summer Camp programming for Cambridge youth.   
 
Present at the hearing were Councillor McGovern, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Toomey, Naomie 
Stephen, and Deputy City Clerk Paula M. Crane. 
 
Participating in the hearing via Zoom were Councillor Nolan, Mayor Siddiqui, Councillor Carlone, 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Councillor Zondervan, Ellen Semonoff, Assistant City Manager for 
Human Services, Michelle Farnum, Assistant Director of Children, Youth and Families, Khari Milner and 
Susan Richards, Co-Directors, Agenda for Children, Nancy Tauber, Executive Director, Family Policy 
Council, Department of Human Service Programs (DHSP), Dr. Carolyn Turk, Deputy Superintendent, 
Maryann MacDonald, Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Schools, Cambridge Public School 
Department (CPSD) and Jennifer Mathews, City Manager’s Office.      
 
Councillor McGovern convened the hearing and read the Call of the Meeting.   
 
He stated that this was his first Zoom meeting and asked those participating to introduce themselves. He 
asked DHSP to begin their presentation. 
 
Ellen Semonoff stated that DHSP is going to give a brief update on the Mayor’s Summer Youth 
Employment Program and the Summer Food Program followed by an update from Michelle Farnum who 
will talk about summer online and offline programming.  She said that Nancy Tauber will then speak 
about some of the work with Find It as a vehicle for families understanding about offered programming.   
Finally, Dr. Turk and her team, along with Khari Milner and Susan Richards, will talk about programs 
other than City and School programs.   
 
Ms. Semonoff said that the School Department and volunteers did an amazing job to deliver food at 8 
sites across the city using the School Department Food Service, school busses and volunteers.  She 
explained that they were delivering 1,000 meals per day to children.  When the School Department 
finished on June 19, DHSP took over sites to deliver meals.  She noted that as in any transition, there 
were a few glitches, but many have been ironed out.  She said that in previous summers when they have 
been able to do the Summer Food Program, they were able to give food only to sites where there were 
enough eligible free and reduced lunch children.  She said that because of Covid 19 and the loosening of 
the restrictions, the City is not required to serve only those children.

Regarding the MSYEP, Ms. Semonoff said that the application period was from June 5-19.  She said that 
close to 900 applications were received.  She noted that the expectation is that the program will run from 
July 6 through August 14.  She noted that the participants will earn between 70-100 hours at $12.75 per 
hour.  She said that most of the programs are virtual.  She said that almost all of the young people have 
Chromebooks and they are working around technology to make it possible for all to participate.  She said 
that most of the activities will be virtual, with some having a portion that is not virtual.  She said that the 
Science Club for Girls will have one portion where children will assemble rockets with people that are 
supporting them in a socially distant way in fields.  The Summer Food Program will have some young 
people who are associated with it.  She said that DHSP has worked closely with the School Department to 
ensure that young people who are spending time at the high school can participate as well.  She said that 
one difference this summer is that young people who are eligible for free and reduced lunch are receiving 
priority status.  She said that the goal is to between 500-600 young people and they want to ensure that 
low income youth are the priority.  She said that there are over 50 sites that they are working with such as 
Upward Bound, Breakthrough, Community Arts Center, CCTV, and the Underground Railway Theater.  
There are partners of many years who have not run their program virtually so there will be challenges.  
She said that video interviews are being conducted with young people who are prioritized to gather all of 
the appropriate documents and additionally, they are working closely with Personnel and the IT 
Departments at the schools and the city.  Ms. Semonoff turned the presentation over to Michelle Farnum. 
 
Michelle Farnum stated that in the K-8 program model, they would typically be running about 16 separate 
camps across the city.  She said that because we are going virtual, they have redesigned the program to be 
essentially one program.  She said that they designed a model Online/Offline model where there are three 
circles of service.  They will continue to offer curated online activities by developmental stage for young 
people.  She said that it is currently being housed by Find It Cambridge.  The second and most robust 
level of service is the enrolled program for K-8.  She said that in K they need to have finished the first 
year of Kindergarten.  She said that this will be organized in small cohorts.  The membership will allow 
access to 4 days a week of programming in two sessions each day.  She explained that the daily schedule 
will include a live opportunity to be with a small cohort of young people at the same grade level with a 
stable group of adults and then they will have a choice of enrichment activities.  She said that they are 
also offering the opportunity for in-person recreational activities in some of the city’s parks and fields.  
She said that this will be staffed by full-time and part-time staff across the grades.  She noted that they are 
using a new online registration process for families which opened on June 22nd.  She said that they are 
also prioritizing families who are eligible for free and reduced lunch.  She said that programs are reaching 
out to families that they serve in afterschool.  She said that the program is free.  Additionally, they are 
thinking about the opportunity to offer targeted services who need extra support.  She explained that the 
design offers the opportunity for particular children who are pointed out by school personnel, parents, or 
staff, to sign up for a one-to-one or small school session during the week.  They are designing a program 
that could serve up to 800 children, but they are not sure of the breakout across the grades. She said that 
there are challenges with staff who have responsibilities at home and figuring out how to schedule this 
massive program.   
 
Ellen Semonoff stated that they are trying to work through challenges of offering outside activities safely.  
She noted the ability to give the students some organized activity and they are committed to doing that.  
She said that they are working very hard to make it happen.  She noted that the other piece is ensuring that 
once children have been enrolled and they do not show, it is important to troubleshoot with families to 
make it work better.  They will move forward to fix difficulties. 
 
Khari Milner talked about how the Agenda for Children out-of-school time supports some of the case 
management to support equitable access to programs. He noted that there are many factors at play this 
summer and they are evolving strategies and approaches that are already used.  He stated that they are 
working with the district in new and more specific ways.  They look at obstacles or barrier for children to 
participate and engage in the out-of- school time programs.  They have a Middle School Network that is 
supported by schools and the DHSP.  There is a small team who has been working virtually with upper 
schools to get updates in terms of what is being offered.  He stated that they have been getting updates 

Packet Pg. 928

7.1

from all types of providers and doing their best to get this information out to both colleagues in the 
schools and parents.  They are partnering with the Find It Cambridge website.  He added that when there 
is a group of high priority youth or families who are facing challenges, they work with the relationships at 
school and the out-of-school time programs to work with these families.  He said that they continue to 
create VIP lists with schools to work with counselors, faculty and leaders to work with out-of-school time 
providers to help families register for programs.  He stated that registration is the first step.  He said that 
this is the process for 6-8 graders and this process has begun to be expanded in the K-5 through the 
planning of an elementary network which is modelled after the Middle School Network.  He said that in 
the JK-5 work, with the planning around the elementary network, they have convened the concept of 
using pods that are working with principals and staff that are interested as well as others to model student 
support work and case management work.  He explained that they launched 4 pods and each pod will 
figure out its own rhythm which will inform the growth of the elementary network into the fall.  He said 
that there are different working groups within the School Department with some focused on summer 
programming.  He said that they have worked with that group to think about the targeting of certain 
young people to ensure that they are in programs.  He commented that this is work and they are trying to 
figure out how to best manage this.  He said that they are helping the in-school partners to think beyond 
what is a program mentality.  He said that there are many variables and we need to know what students 
are doing throughout the summer.  He said that they have been able to harness technology and explained 
that through CPS they are creating a portal that will allow community partners to engage with young 
people.  He added that technical fixes are being worked out, but it is the hope to go live soon.   
 
Susan Richards said that the Agenda for Children out-of-school time has just ended its 20th year and she is 
proud of the amazing impact in the city.  She said that when the pandemic hit, the team of trainers and 
facilitators never missed a beat.  She said that they went virtual, went on Zoom, contracted with trainers 
to help colleagues to be ready to use technology.  She said that hundreds of workers in this community 
rallied and continued to offer professional development training and coaching through this period.  In 
recent weeks, it has become more challenging for people of color in the professional community.  They 
see people in trainings and network activities multiple times weekly and can see the pain and the team is 
working to help people through this period.  She asserted that it has not been easy and having a 
professional community to support children and families is critical.  She said that the most recent training 
is called Cultural Proficiency, A Way of Being, and it was an extraordinary space.  She said that 
professional development goes on.  She explained that a survey was sent out to the out-of-school time 
community in an attempt to develop organizational profile data.  She said that they are trying to get a 
handle on the baseline of this organizational service in terms of typical service delivery in the summer, 
typical delivery in the school year and summer 2020 plans.  She stated that many people are going virtual 
and they will have a stronger virtual summer.  She said that there are about 2,300 students who will be 
served over the summer through DHSP and non-profits.  She said that these children will be supported by 
450 direct service staff.  Ms. Richards noted that the non-profit sector has had very few layoffs.  She said 
that programs that have city, state and corporate funding have not had to furlough or layoff staff.  She 
noted that access to Chromebooks is critical.  She said that people will be trained on Chromebook because 
it is a new technology for out-of-school time people.  She said that they look forward to partnership with 
the CPS school district to align learning.   
 
Nancy Tauber stated that since the beginning of Covid, Find It Cambridge has created a Covid resources 
that are available now category, a volunteer category, a virtual activity.  She noted that currently they are 
focusing on summer 2020.  She said that people are realizing that Find It Cambridge is a useful tool.  She 
said that partnerships are getting stronger.  She said that they have worked with family liaisons to ensure 
that they have information on programs for younger kids.  The Middle School Network has a great guide 
for summer 2020 resources, so they copied their guide and made one for elementary school resources.  
She said that more people are contacting them for information.  She explained that they share information 
via social media and the Community Engagement Team.  She said that Find It Cambridge is becoming a 
one-stop resource.   
 
Dr. Turk said that because the city has such a deep history of partnering with others and within the city, it 
has been helpful during a tremendously challenging time.  She said that the fact that people didn’t have to 

Packet Pg. 929

7.1

learn how to work with each and could use energy to do the work for the children of the city has made a 
tremendous difference.  She said that people do look at all of the children within the city as their children.  
From the CPSD piece of things, one piece that was important was to make sure that they were thinking in 
terms of utilizing a case management approach.  She said that they kept students at the center and made 
sure that connections were made around a common purpose.  She said that engagement has been at the 
top of the list.  She said that another piece that has been important is to make sure that there is a team 
approach to making sure that we are supporting students.  She noted that the team needs to include the 
students as well.  She stated that there is an idea about the implementation of some type of end of year 
conference with students, families and teachers.  She said that they may have looked slightly different in 
each grade band.  This would provide an opportunity to check that students were connected to an activity 
in some way or to find out if they need help with that connectivity.  She asked Maryann Macdonald to 
talk about the work being done for JK-5 students. 
 
Maryann MacDonald said that the CPSD and DHSP launched a great program last summer called Summit 
in collaboration with MIT and Massachusetts General.  They learned a lot of lessons from that.  She 
explained that DHSP collaborated with CPSD.  She said that it set the foundation for the work moving 
forward.  She said that they started planning in February for this year’s summer programming and then 
Covid happened. She said that this unprecedented time has been used as an opportunity.  In the School 
Department there are a number of programs, but they created a totally different elementary support 
program.  Before that, they wanted to offer resources to all elementary students, so they used a tiered 
approach to support students and families.  The first tier was resources on the CPSD website for all 
students and families to access.  She added that access is provided to community partners as well.  
Summer reading books have been shipped to all students with support from the School Committee from 
JK through Grade 8.  She said that they are looking to coordinate with DHSP so that all students have 
access to some learning and engagement over the summer.  She said that they see this work through a 
racial equity lens.  They are offering for elementary students that have been identified by their school 
teams is the Summer Support Program which is targeted support for students who have been 
recommended by teachers, in need of literacy, math or social/emotional learning support.  She said that 
this program will run from July 6-31st.  She said that they are trying to run the sessions in the morning so 
students will be able to take part in DHSP offerings in the afternoon.  She indicated that it is a small 
group instruction with some computer-based programming and some with a teacher. She said that they 
want to provide small group instruction as much as possible.  She said that the Title One and Summit will 
be combined into one program.  She said that teachers were recruited to be part of this, and training starts 
next week.  She noted that there is one registration for this program that launches two weeks ago.  1100 
students were invited with over 665 students registered.   
 
Dr. Turk said that for 6-8 programming looks different.  She said that there are offerings in July and 
August.  In July there is English Language Arts and math opportunity.  She explained that each of these 
programs for a wo-week session.  She said that this is for rising 6-8 grade students.  She noted that they 
are working with Cambridge School Volunteers to make themselves available for families who may be 
interested in tutoring services.  She stated that a new opportunity is one-week mini sessions.  She said that 
they are trying to find different ways to engage students.  One staff member will be running a media 
journalism course with the purpose at the end for students to be able to produce a 6-minute video 
magazine about Cambridge in the summertime.  She said that these are with groups of 10 students.  She 
said that another session is about Math Mysteries and solving problems by utilizing math routines that 
students have learned or will be exposed to in the upcoming school year.  Each school created space for 
an August ramp up that would be designed to help rebuild community as students are entering a new 
school year.  There will be space for assessment and needs moving into the new school year as well as an 
orientation.  That is the type of programming for July and August with 6-8 students.  As it relates to the 
high school, there are 5 or 6 programs with two being new; the Freshman Academy will provide space for 
incoming 9th graders to get the opportunity to get to know about people at the high school as well as what 
they will be doing the new school year and the other is for any individual at the extension school that is 
interested in credit recovery.  Dr. Turk noted that the High School Extension Program is small, but the 
summer program is open to any student.  Other programs include the Cambridge Harvard Summer 
academy, which will be staffed in a different way as Harvard cannot supply staff.  The Rise Up Program 

Packet Pg. 930

7.1

is more of a targeted program for students who have experienced academic difficulty throughout the year.  
English Language Learners will continue a virtual program this summer.  She said that there are several 
preview courses such as Math, ELA, and Science.  One new request from students is the offering of a 
preview course to participate in Honors and AP courses.  Dr. Turk spoke about the Office of Student 
Services that provides summer programming.  There is an extended year program available to students 
who receive specialized services.  There is an extended program for Special Start students and Autism 
Program students.     
 
Councillor McGovern said that there is a lot of information.   
 
Councillor Nolan said that since all program are remote and virtual, what is being done to ensure that they 
can access programs given childcare issues if parents need to work.  Susan Richards responded that her 
understanding from the non-profit sector is that there is a certain kind of assessment with programs 
around parents needs.  A lot is based on needs for families with childcare issues.  She said that one of the 
things they are hearing in the assessment is that over the last few months, families have tried to figure 
things out and people are using their own networks to care for children during the pandemic.  She said 
that they are weighing the needs of families and the safety of staff in this decision.  Ms. Richards noted 
that she is hearing from other non-profits that they are getting calls from families whose programs are not 
running who need care.   
 
Maryann MacDonald said that this has been the looming question throughout the closure.  She said that 
the CPSD is most with the JK-2 students.  They continue to be challenged by this and are trying to figure 
out other solutions.  They are sending printed materials to families as well.  The families appreciate 
printed materials so students can access that.  CPSD is now trying to do more videotaped lessons so a 
parent can engage in the evenings.  Ms. MacDonald said that they have learned will guide the work 
entering in the fall.  She noted that all teachers had end of year conferences which was helpful 
information on what worked for their families.     
 
Ellen Semonoff added that the reason there is morning and afternoon programming was due to the 
concern for families who may be able to time some of what they are doing so their student can participate.  
She said that video programming has been very valuable for many families so that children can play over 
and over again without needing parental aid.   
 
Councillor Nolan said that the Covid period has been troublesome for students.  She is interested in 
hearing if we have found models of other places that did online or remote learning or managed how to get 
learning assistance.  She asked how we are going to set expectations and monitor and ensure that the 
goals are high for students to be able to learn.  She asked how we are setting it up so there will be specific 
goals and monitor to adjust as necessary. Dr. Turk said that there have not been many examples of who 
has done this successfully.  She said that this has been new to everyone.  She stated that she and Ms. 
MacDonald have worked with a leadership team out of DC.  She said that it did not matter where students 
were from as the questions, concerns, and suggestions were similar.  Dr. Turk said that she has found 
success with those who have run virtual schools for some time now.  She said that this is one community 
of education where we could take some lessons and continue to do some of the brainwork with local 
communities around the way in which we will focus in on priority standards that are being set by the 
state.  She noted the importance of ensuring that the curriculums are aligned to those standards.  Ms. 
Maryann MacDonald said as it relates to the elementary students, specific goals are being set and it is 
being coordinated across the schools.  She said that students’ progress will be monitored.  She said that 
ST Math also monitors students progress on a daily and weekly basis. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that beyond virtual programs, are we looking at the successes of the emergency 
daycare systems that have been opened since March and are being reported to having very low outbreaks.  
She spoke about an article on NPR talking about the YMCA and New York City’s Department of 
Education who have been caring for thousands of children since March in person and they have had no 
reports of Corona virus, clusters or outbreaks based on the health and safety parameters that they put in 
place early.  She said that Brown University put together a study about the low outbreak rate in these 

Packet Pg. 931

7.1

early childhood care centers.  She said that there are ways to look at lessons learned other than the virtual, 
especially as we think about the fall.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked Ms. Semonoff on how many students have signed up for summer camp 
programs. She also asked about the 6-8 grade programming numbers and the DHSP enrolled participants.   
Ellen Semonoff stated that there are currently about 100 registrations and they expect that they are not 
being overloaded in the first few days.  Michelle Farnum stated that there are in the mid-200’s with about 
two-thirds of the people in K-2, the least amount of the folks in the 6-8 grade band and a moderate 
amount in grades 3-5 band.  She said that this mirrors the typical camp sign up.  She said that this is only 
the third day of registration and the response in very similar to non-virtual.  Dr. Turk said that the for the 
July programs, the capacity for the Math and ELA programming is 65 students for each session.  She 
noted that both of those sessions are full.  As it relates to the one-week sessions, there are 2 confirmed 
with a capacity of ten each and both have one slot available.  There have been 8 requests for tutoring and 
those matches will be made.  She said that the August program is for all students in the Upper Schools 
and they will be responding to their schools throughout the month of July, so she does not have a hard 
number.  For the high school, there are about 75 students enrolled in the Freshman Academy with room 
for 125.  The Cambridge Harvard Summer Academy has 180 enrolled with room for 250.   Rise Up has 
30 slots that are full.  There are four preview courses with the capacity of 75 each and currently there are 
50-55 currently enrolled.  The ELL program has capacity for 100 and they are at 80 enrolled. The High 
School Extension Program has 30 seats and they are all full.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked about kids who did not log onto classes.  She said that there is a section of 
students that did not log on or rarely did.  She said that she imagines that those are the students that we 
are trying to reach.  She asked how outreach is being conducted.  Dr. Turk said that in the conferences for 
all grade levels, in particular upper school and high school, one of the questions that was posed had to do 
with summer opportunities.  She said that it was more a discussion point of what could best benefit you 
for summer and the upcoming school year.  In terms of the words “ensuring that the students participate,” 
staff members are doing outreach in terms of making sure students know the program and helping them to 
register.  They have not mandated programs.  She said that if someone is reluctant to one type of program, 
they look into a different program where the student could receive support that is more helpful to them.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon said that she has a rising 7th grader and her parent/teacher conference did not include 
anything except her self-assessment student-led conversation.  She said that there were not questions 
about what was happening over the summer.  She said that this was not her experience.  In terms of Find 
It Cambridge, she wondered how we are accessing the Community Engagement Team to do the outreach 
work. Ms. Semonoff said that this has been true across the board for signing up for all programs.  Many 
families who signed up for the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund, were reached out through the Birth to Third 
Team as well as the Community Engagement Team.  She said that the percentage of families that took 
advantage of the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund who were non-first English language speakers was very 
high and that is a reflection of the outreach that was done.  They have been communicating the 
information to the Community Engagement Team.  Ms. Tauber has been meeting with family liaisons 
who have their own networks and there has been a deep effort to reach families that do not immediately 
sign up.  She said that there is deep effort that we are reaching families that will not find this information.   
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he appreciates all of the effort and hard work.   
 
Councillor Carlone said Michelle Farnum had mentioned that discussion groups are broken up into a 
small number.  He asked what is that number.  Ms. Farnum responded that the goal is to have group sizes 
of 15 children with 3 staff.  Councillor Carlone said that the Finance Committee is going to be exploring 
different City departments and how they are meeting goals.  He said that the summer program is a 
significant effort in trying to help students that need extra attention.  He asked if each teacher gives a list 
of students that will benefit most from a summer program.  Ms. MacDonald said this is correct in the 
elementary school that is correct.  Dr. Turk said in the upper schools, it is a team of teachers.  Councillor 
Carlone asked if there are records of needy students, especially disadvantaged or poor, that are not being 
helped, regardless of the reason.  Ms. MacDonald said that they are tracking that information and they use 

Packet Pg. 932

7.1

a Remind app to contact people in a different way.  She said that they are documenting that information.  
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Ms. MacDonald said that they were targeting 800 
elementary school students to take part in a summer program.  Dr. Turk said that the number is similar for 
the upper grades. Dr. Turk said in the event that a student has not enrolled in a program recommended for 
them, they are asking the student if they attended another program.  Councillor Carlone thanked all for 
their work.  He said that he found this meeting informative and hopeful. 
 
Councillor Toomey stated that this meeting has been very informative, and he looks forward to a 
successful program for students.   
 
Councillor McGovern said that as it relates to the online enrollment, he logged in on Monday night to 
register his twins and every section said that there was only a waitlist available.  He asked if the groups 
could be expanded to 18 to create spots.  Ms. Farnum explained the way that the online registration 
process works as it is a new system.  She explained that this system was rolled out for the MSYEP and 
then for the camp program.  She explained that in order to manage the placements of children into the 
small groups, everyone registers for a membership and indicates what sessions they desire.  They then go 
to a waitlist so staff can manage and place participants into small groups.  She affirmed that everyone is 
on a waitlist until enrolled.  She noted that this language has been clarified on the registration.  Councillor 
McGovern said that this is important to note.  He said that explaining that to people may be helpful to 
ensure maximum participation.  Ms. Farnum said that they were in touch with the company to help with 
the glitch.  The explained that the first day there were over 50 phone calls with questions to the company, 
most of which are currently resolved.  Ms. Farnum noted that participants will learn one week prior to a 
session whether they are in.  Councillor McGovern said that he sent a question to staff and he was pleased 
with quick response.  As it relates to the outdoor component of some programs, how much time are we 
looking at?  Ms. Farnum responded that the plan is to offer 2-3 times per week for each class to have an 
hour or so.   
 
Councillor McGovern said that there is a tremendous amount of information and Find It Cambridge is the 
place to go to access all of that information.  He suggested adding a Find It Cambridge link to the CPSD 
homepage.  He noted that this is something to think about.   
 
As it relates to the MSYEP, Mayor Siddiqui talked about previous years where there were job 
opportunities working with DPW watering trees, biking, etc.  She asked if these types of employment 
were not available this year because these jobs would have a more in-person element to it.  She asked if 
the Arts Council will be considered as a virtual site.  Ms. Semonoff responded that there are some 
physical sites this summer and there are also some recreation sites that are physical.  She explained that 
DPW issues may well be capacity to manage young people this summer.  She said that they have been in 
communication with them.  As it relates to the Arts Council, she does not know the answer to that 
questions.  Mayor Siddiqui said that it is great that 900 young people applied, and she is thinking about 
how many more sites are needed to get 900 youth participating in the program.  She said that she would 
love as many sites as possible.  In response to Mayor Siddiqui’s question regarding the possibility of 
having a young person assigned to a City Councillor or School Committee Member, Ms. Semonoff said 
that the answer is yes.  She noted that Councillor Zondervan has requested a young person.  She noted 
that there must be a plan for this young person and what project they will work on.  She said that they 
must have a supervisor and a set work schedule.  She said that they are willing to support young people in 
that regard.  She said that the goal is to have a mentor for that young person.  She noted that DHSP cannot 
commit as to who the person will be that is assigned to the City Councillor or School Committee 
Members.  She said that to some extent, you may find yourself with a young person that needs a good 
amount of support from the City Councillor or Aide.  Ms. Semonoff stated that she wants to be very clear 
that a City Councillor may be assigned a young person that is easy to supervise or a young person that 
needs a fair amount of support.  Ms. Semonoff said that DHSP is likely to have some program later in the 
summer with My Brother’s Keeper as an adjunct to the MSYEP.   
 
Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is an extended deadline if an organization wants to become a MSYEP 
site.  Ms. Semonoff said that they can e-mail Ellen Semonoff or George Hinds.

Councillor Nolan said that given that we are setting specific goals and expectations, how are the 
preassessments being done to ensure that there will be a clear sense of how the students have done.  Ms. 
MacDonald said that they had mid-year screening data for literacy and math prior to the closure.  She said 
that teachers have been forming assessment data on students.  Ms. Nolan said that it is not clear that there 
are any writing expectations for the summer.  She asked if we are setting expectations for writing and if 
not, could we encourage that.  Dr. Turk responded that there is no formal expectation for writing as the 
focus has been on reading expectation.  She added that as part of the reading, there is a journalizing 
component. 
 
Councillor McGovern said that this in unchartered territory and he appreciates the flexibility and 
willingness to try to figure things out on the fly. He said that he looks forward to in-person camps but 
there is now a foundation to offer other things such as virtual.  He said that this is a building block.   
 
Khari Milner stated that the state is coming down with different regulations, updates and modifications, 
but as a body of city leaders, please encourage employers to be flexible for the parents.  
 
Councillor McGovern thanked all those present for their attendance. 
 
The hearing adjourned at 4:30 p.m.

The Ordinance Committee will meet to conduct a public hearing on proposed amendments to the 
Cycling Safety Ordinance 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern called the meeting to order and explained that the governor's executive order 
issued on March 12 2020, has authorized the use of remote participation at meetings of the city’s public 
bodies in response to the threat posed to the public by the COVID-19 virus in issued guidelines for the 
city's use of remote participation 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler explained that this ordinance will help create a timeline to build a 
citywide protected bike network. He stated that the city has recorded more than 500 crashes between a car 
and the cyclist. A huge portion of those crashes could potentially have been avoided with a protected bike 
lane and occurred on parts of streets that are covered by this ordinance.  
 
Joseph Barr, Director of Traffic, Parking & Transportation gave a presentation the explained the changes 
that would occur if the proposed ordinance is adopted.  The basic premise of the ordinance is that requires 
the city to implement 22.6 miles of separated bicycle lanes (SBL) by May 1 of 2026. Importantly, projects 
that are built as a permanent or capital construction project only need to be begun prior to the deadline to 
qualify for that goal.  There are a few definitions that are added by the ordinance. One is a so called Quick 
built separated bicycle lane that are created with flex posts and other flexible or some sort of more easily 
installed delineators that need to be replaced year-round. The final key new definition is public 
transportation that is really focused on stops for the MBTA and other important public services and 
university and college shuttle buses that operate in Cambridge and acknowledging that in many cases, it is 
very difficult to build separate bicycle lanes through those stops.  The city manager does have discretion 
under the proposed amendments to extend that deadline by one year but needs to submit a report to the 
council a year in advance explaining why that extension will be necessary. The city manager has the right

to request some schedule adjustments in response to COVID-19 as long as that's done by the summer of 
2022. 
 
Susanne Rasmussen, Director of Environmental and Transportation Planning Director, explained that the 
Cambridge bicycle plan, which was first published five years ago in 2015, when fully realized will lay out 
100 plus mile network consisting of existing in progress and future facilities. The network of streets that's 
proposed for separation in the bicycle plan, are the subject of the cycling safety ordinance. Section k in 
the definitions, you'll see that the separated network shall mean the proposed set of separate facilities in 
the Cambridge's bicycle plan, or any plans superseding it. But a key task is to identify streets that are not 
currently planned for reconstruction but would be eligible for quick build implementation based on a high 
level of analysis and feasibility on such street segments. She further explained how the city will prioritize 
quick build and capital projects based on an analysis of the street and community input. 
 
Mr. Barr further explained that depending on the complexity of a project, usually it takes between nine to 
eleven; or eight months or a year to complete a quick build project. A construction projects is a whole 
different animal. It can take several years for a construction project, particularly if it involves utility work 
to be completed. Regardless of how it is implemented, the community outreach and design require time; 
for iteration, for discussion, coordination with businesses and local communities. These projects have 
significant impacts on the community, even if the implementation is relatively straightforward, project 
like adding separated bicycle lanes could take out something on the order of Have 150 parking spaces. 
 
Kathy Watkins, Assistant Commissioner for Engineering / City Engineer, briefly described the current 
separated bicycle lane projects in the five-year plan.  
 
Councillor McGovern opened the floor to public comment 
 
Laura McMurry, 334 Harvard Street, is in favor of the cycling safety ordinance as amended. It will 
provide rapid installation of many miles of safe protected bike lanes, some using the quick build method. 
The advantage of the quick build method is that it is faster to install and changed as necessary. 
 
With one other thing is that with COVID-19, bicycling offers less exposure than most modes of public 
transportation to COVID. I urge a vote of this ordinance out to the city council. Thank you. 
 
Kimberley Hunt, 10 Wendell street, stated that the world is accelerating bike infrastructure projects and 
believes that Cambridge should follow suit. 
 
James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, stated that he cannot traverse a simple crosswalk safely because 
of the way bicyclists in the city race through red lights and crosswalks. The city has ignored the safety of 
pedestrians. 
 
John Attanucci, 608 Huron Avenue, works at MIT in the transit lab and chairs the city's transit advisory 
committee. Generally, he supports the separated bicycle lane plan. He stated that he is concerned about 
the impact on public transit. The data show that if not done properly, separated bike lanes, slow buses, 
and this emphasis on putting fully separated bike lanes on all the major streets in Cambridge is going to

hurt transit and it is going to hurt transit riders. The city should be creating shared bike and bus lane 
priority lanes.  
 
Tina Lieu, 37 Huron Ave, stated that this ordinance, although well intentioned and going in the right 
direction, might not actually satisfy the transportation requirements that the city will need in the future. 
East Cambridge needs bicycle lanes. She would like to see more holistic approach to street infrastructure. 
 
Gavin Lund, 166 Charles Street, we need a dramatic mode shift away from fossil fuel powered vehicles, 
to more sustainable modes of transportation of which biking is one. And in particular, there's a huge 
untapped resource of people who are interested in biking but concerned about safety. And protected bike 
lanes have been shown to be the only way to really convince significant numbers of those people to bike.  
 
Galen Mook, executive director of the Massachusetts Bicycle Coalition. Spoke in support of the 
ordinance. Separated bicycle infrastructure is the safest bicycle infrastructure.  The city should encourage 
youth citizens to think about bicycling as an everyday mode of transportation. The council should take 
into mind the safety and comfort of pedestrians as well as the expediency of transit as well. Studies have 
shown that protected bicycle infrastructure actually make streets safer for all modes, especially 
pedestrians.  
 
Christopher Cassa, 103 Gore Street, stated that defining a place for cyclists to safely ride through our 
streets that will help improve the safety for cyclists, but also improve general safety on the streets. He 
supports moving forward on these issues. 
 
Amy Flax, 86 Normandy Avenue, spoke in support of this ordinance. Separated bike lanes, in fact, 
support many different modalities in terms of transportation, and pedestrians and bikers. If kids don't have 
safe alternatives for biking, then their lives are in danger.  
 
Itamar Turner-Trauring, 139 Oxford Street, is excited about this ordinance. because It is very important 
that we transition away from private cars towards things like bikes and buses and in many ways are very 
complementary, they serve different needs, so work well together. Shared bike bus lanes are actually not a 
good idea for either buses or bikes. Paris is moving away from them for example, and they're an 
extremely ambitious bike lane construction project. The real solution is to move more of the space away 
from private vehicles and storing private vehicles and parking and moving towards safer infrastructure 
and buses and using things like floating bus stops. 
 
Luis Mejias, 18 Plymouth street, strongly supports the approval of this ordinance to speed up the 
installation of protected bicycle infrastructure throughout Cambridge. If we're serious about tackling 
climate change, we must stop making driving the primary and easy choice. To do so we must do away 
with thinking that aligns with providing parking and road design that makes it more convenient or faster 
to drive then ride a bike walk or take transit. If people want to drive it should be in convenient. If they 
want to walk or bike, it should be easy and safe. There are countless people who would choose to ride a 
bicycle or tricycle and not try if the roads were designed so that they feel safe.

Marisa Carlos, 8 Kenwood Street, spoke in support of the ordinance. Cyclists sometimes race through red 
lights because of a lack of bicycle specific infrastructure. Adding bicycle specific infrastructure, like 
bicycle red lights, will help with that. Encouraged the committee to move the ordinance forward. 
 
Gleb Bahmutov, 19 Winslow Street, explained that the number one concern with biking is safety. He fully 
supports this ordinance.  
 
Sarah levy, 52 Pearl Street, cycling is a way that people can get around healthily and not cause emissions

we do not move forward.  
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan stated that he supports this compromise going forward. He stated that they 
have really come a long way in this effort to get transit justice in the city. He is disappointed that it is not 
going faster.  
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan  acknowledged challenges with implementation but is supportive of this 
ordinance. She stated that Paris took seven or eight years to change from a car centric to a bicycle centric 
city. She asked why the Transit Advisory Committee has not reviewed the ordinance She also asked how 
other stakeholder were being consulted. 
 
Susanne Rasmussen, Director of Environmental and Transportation Planning Director, explained that no 
city committees have met due to COVID19.

some significant concerns about changing street direction in general, but the city would consider changing 
the operation of the street in a more fundamental way to allow for the bicycle facility to be implemented.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern stated that there needs to pe continuous public outreach thought this process. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Timothy Toomey, Kathy Watkins explained that the portion of 
Huron Avenue between Fresh Pond Parkway and Glacken field is in the Bike Plan.  The City evaluating 
how to add a protected bike facilities and a pedestrian connection to the section of Huron Avenue. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey  expressed frustration with the lack of outreach to community members and 
small business owners who are struggling COVID-19 about this proposal that will directly impact them. 
 
Councillor Toomey moved the following amendments to the Cycling Safety Ordinance: 
 
Amend section 12.22.040(G)(b) to insert the following: 

i.  The Cycling Safety Ordinance proposes a scenario that would significantly impact the Cambridge 

St corridors ability to function as a healthy business district; and 

ii.  There are many complexities along Cambridge St corridor that deserve in depth consideration and 

a more robust planning process that may include additional investment beyond the baseline 
that this Ordinance proposes; and 

iii.  There is general agreement that a safer street for all is important, but this ordinance removes the 

opportunity for more thoughtful solutions that address the vital needs of a commercial district 
and denser residential areas; now therefore be it 

iv.  That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to convene a stakeholder group of City staff, 

business, resident, and bicycle representatives no later than spring 2021 to create a viable 
plan for Cambridge St to be implemented by 2026, and for this process to happen alongside 
of the process created by the ordinance. 

Amend “Section 12.22.040 Requirements” by adding the following the following new section “I” 
 

I.  Requirements of Cyclists. 

(a)  Upon passage of the ordinance Cambridge residents will be required to register bicycles with the 

appropriate department in the City of Cambridge.  

(b)  Upon passage of the ordinance use of bicycle safety helmets will be mandatory.

another reason to pull over residents. He stated that he could not support this portion. He stated that he 
could support a stake holder meeting for Cambridge street but wanted additional clarifications. He stated 
that he wants to make sure Cambridge street is required as part of this ordinance.  
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon stated that in comparison to other neighboring communities Cambridge is far 
behind on creating safe cycling infrastructure around the city. She encouraged the city to continue to do 
virtual outreach in order to reach more people.  She supported having additional conversation and

see permanent facilities on Cambridge street.  She stated that she shared Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
concerns about racial equity. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan suggested rejecting the proposed amendment but that the committee 
should consider it as a policy order.  He stated that he shared Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler concerns 
about racial equity.  He stated that he did not support the idea of removing Cambridge Street from the 
ordinance. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that he supported bicycle registration.  He supported providing bicycle 
lights to individuals and providing bicycle safety classes. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  agreed that there a safety component that the council must address but he did 
not believe that it belonged in an ordinance about infrastructure. 
 
Susanne Rasmussen, Director of Environmental and Transportation Planning Director, explained that a 
large percentage of cyclists in Cambridge do not live in Cambridge.  She explained the department 
provided bicycle lights and helmets at various events. 
 
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui stated that this is an iterative process. She stated that aside from the stakeholder 
group, she would not support Councillor Toomey’s amendments. She stated that she supports the 
ordinance as written. The City and the Council will take the questions raised by businesses seriously.

of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided however, that all such Separated Bicycle

(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.  

      
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  
 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated 
Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of 
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager 
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and 
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be 
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement 
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane 
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-
year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality 
along  
 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or 
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between  Beech Street and Dudley Street,      
      
within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the 
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain 
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate 
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council 
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation 
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three 
years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
 
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street from 
Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 
 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager

shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and 
H shall be shown on a publicly accessible website. Such website shall also track exactly where 
those Bicycle Lane Miles were installed, and the distance of each contiguous segment of 
Bicycle Lane Miles installed. Such website shall be established by no later than May 31, 2021 
and updated twice yearly thereafter. All other reports and updates required by this Ordinance 
shall also be uploaded to such website. 
 
J. Until July 1, 2022, if the City Manager determines that revenue shortfalls due to the 
coronavirus pandemic make any deadlines contained in subsections C through I financially 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadlines. For any such 
proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the City Council to 
be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City Council shall 
vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take place by July 
1, 2022. 
 
K. Until July 1, 2022 if the City Manager determines that unavoidable delays in public outreach

of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided however, that all such Separated Bicycle

(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.  

      
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between

(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  
 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of 
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager 
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and 
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be 
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement 
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane 
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-
year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality 
along  
 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or 
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between  Beech Street and Dudley Street,      
      
within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the 
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain 
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate 
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council 
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation 
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three 
years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
 
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street from 
Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 
 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager

shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and 
H shall be shown on a publicly accessible website. Such website shall also track exactly where 
those Bicycle Lane Miles were installed, and the distance of each contiguous segment of 
Bicycle Lane Miles installed. Such website shall be established by no later than May 31, 2021 
and updated twice yearly thereafter. All other reports and updates required by this Ordinance 
shall also be uploaded to such website. 
 
J. Until July 1, 2022, if the City Manager determines that revenue shortfalls due to the 
coronavirus pandemic make any deadlines contained in subsections C through I financially 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadlines. For any such 
proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the City Council to 
be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City Council shall 
vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take place by July 
1, 2022. 
 
K. Until July 1, 2022 if the City Manager determines that unavoidable delays in public outreach 
activities due to the coronavirus pandemic make the deadline contained in subsection C 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadline by up to four months. 
For any such proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the 
City Council to be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City 
Council shall vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take 
place by July 1, 2022.

The Ordinance Committee met to conduct a public hearing on a petition to add an Affordable 
Housing Ordinance to the City’s Zoning Ordinances 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone called the meeting to Order at 5:10pm.  He explained that the 
governor's executive order issued on March 1, 2020 has authorized the use of remote 
participation, participation at meetings of the city's public bodies in response to the threat posed 
to the public by the COVID-19 virus, and that the city council was holding this meeting 
remotely.   
 
Councillor Marc McGovern made a presentation about the procedural history of the proposed 
Affordable Housing Ordinance (hereinafter “AHO”). He explained that the City Council first 
started having formal meetings about an Affordable Housing Ordinance around November 2018. 
He explained that the Housing Committee held five meetings in which about 170 people spoke 
about the AHO. There have been five Ordinance Committee meetings in which about 50 people 
spoke on the subject. The Planning Board had three meetings related to the AHO in 2018-2019 
with about 34 public commentators. There were 15 neighborhood meetings with staff 
presentations, seven open houses in public spaces across the city on the AHO. The Housing 
Committee held a meeting on the AHO last term in which they discussed affordable housing 
financing where about 80 people spoke. In all there were about 250 public commentators and 35 
public events and meetings to discuss this topic. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern explained that the AHO was refiled in February 2020 but sat on the 
table due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The petition was refiled again on June 8. He explained 
that the Planning Board would schedule a meeting on the petition sometime in August.  He 
explained that the Ordinance Committee will have another meeting on the AHO in late August or 
early September. Councillor McGovern stated there have been over 40 amendments that have 
been added to during this process.

Ordinance Committee 

7.6

July 8, 2020 

 
Staff members from Community Development (hereinafter “CDD”) made a presentation to the 
Committee.  Representing CDD were Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community 
Development, Jeff Roberts, Director of zoning and development, Chris Cotter, housing director, 
Cassie Arnaud, senior housing planner, Daniel Messplay, Senior manager for zoning and 
development, Erik Thorkildsen, urban designer in the community planning group and Arthur 
Goldberg from the city solicitor's office.  
 
She explained that this process dated back to 2014 when the city council passed ab order asking 
us to determine what the city would need to do in order to create 1000 new affordable housing 
units by 2020. Staff met with various stakeholders and the people who are involved in 
development of affordable housing and, in 2015, presented a report to the Coty Council with a 
series of recommendations. The city has gradually been implementing those action steps in the 
intervening years.   
 
Since then the City Council has adopted and increased incentives zoning provisions which is 
essentially a funding contribution to Affordable Housing Trust that comes from non-residential 
development in the city. 
 
In addition, City funds have been allocated as part of the operating budget to at the behest of city 
council to the Affordable Housing Trust and, in principle, those funds were coming from 
building permit fees or percentage of building permit fees.  
 
Since the adoption of Community Preservation Act, the city has consistently and allocated the 
maximum amount possible, which is 80% of the funds, to the creation and preservation of 
affordable housing. The City also in 2017, adopted changes to the inclusionary zoning provisions 
which is the percentage of new residential construction that is required to be affordable to people 
who are families who make 80% of the area median income or less. That used to be it used to net 
out to just over 12% and has now been increased to 20% 
 
The Affordable Housing Ordinance would allow additional density and changes to the zoning 
ordinance that would facilitate the creation of affordable housing, make additional sites available 
and streamline the permitting process for buildings that are 100% affordable and permanently 
affordable.   
 
She explained that there are only a handful of people or entities in the city who develop 
affordable housing and most of them are nonprofit.  She explained that every affordable housing 
project in the city in recent years has required significant subsides from city, state and federal 
entities. 
 
one of the cornerstones of the petition is ensuring that affordable housing is equitably distributed 
throughout the city. Currently, there are parts of the city that do not have any, or very little, 
affordable housing while there are larger concentrations in other parts of the city.

The principal reasons for the disparity are the difficulty in competing with market-rate 
developers for sites. The second reason is the zoning itself, which creates significant limitations; 
for instance, some districts do not permit multifamily housing.  
 
She explained that historical segregation has concentrated affordable housing in areas of the city 
thought to be undesirable.  She explained that this systemic segregation has followed through in 
the current zoning ordinance.

Jeff Roberts gave a general overview of zoning in Cambridge. He explained that through a 
provision in state law, affordable housing developments currently have the option of seeking 
zoning relief through a comprehensive permit process but there is a risk of an appeal and the 
process can be time consuming and cost prohibitive.  
 
The effect of the affordable housing overlay would be to provide an alternative to the process of 
seeking zoning relief by creating an alternative set of development standards, that  would 
specifically apply to affordable housing.  
 
Those standards are intended to enable greater density to make affordable housing development 
feasible to provide a predictable as of right permitting process and to apply city wide, including 
in some of those areas that currently have more restrictive zoning.  
 
He noted that the city's green building requirements, which were just updated last year, would 
continue to be applicable to these developments. Those green building requirements would not 
be waived or relieved under the Affordable Housing overlay. 
 
All developments under the proposed overlay, regardless of their size and their location, would 
be subject to an advisory design review process conducted by the planning board.  The idea 
behind this was to create and shared vision for the qualities that were desired in new affordable 
housing.  
 
Councillor Carlone opened public comment at 6:00 pm. 
 
Margaret Drury, 1 Dudley Court, Cambridge stated that she supported ordination of the proposed 
affordable housing zoning overlay. Due to the soaring costs of housing many black, brown and 
low-income residents have suffered displacement or the threat of displacement. Statistics show

that black brown and low-income Cambridge residents are three times as likely as other residents 
to become infected with the corona virus. People who cannot afford to stay in their homes often 
end up in overcrowded under resourced, shared accommodations, where it is impossible to stay 
six feet away from other residents. more affordable housing is desperately needed. Without an 
affordable housing overlay, nonprofit builders of affordable housing will consistently be outbid 
by market rate developers can pay more and act more quickly than nonprofit developers. 
Nonprofit developers are hampered by their need to assemble complicated financing, including 
financing for the future operating costs for 100% affordable building. With the modest increase 
in density allowed in the city wide affordable housing overlay, along with more predictable 
review process, developers have 100% permanently affordable housing will be able to take 
advantage of building opportunities all over the city, and to spread the high cost of land and 
construction across more units, making them better able to compete against for profit developers 
and better able to fulfill their mission of decent and affordable housing for all members of the 
community. Most important of all, the overlay would go a long way towards ending the 
increased de facto segregation in Cambridge This segregation is neither equitable nor defensible. 
 
Brennan Waters, 466 Cambridge Street in East Cambridge. The community is hurt whenever a 
family has to leave Cambridge because the rent was raised and whenever new parents who love 
the city move out because they can't afford to buy a house or a condo here or whenever someone 
who works in Cambridge or even works for the City of Cambridge, can't afford to live here. She 
supports the affordable housing overlay. 
 
Allan Sadun, 17 pleasant place urged committee to forward the petition to city council for 
approval. He urged the committee to reject any amendments that would further restrict the set of 
possible developments or sites eligible for the affordable housing overlay. In California, there 
was a bill called sb 35 that was passed to streamline the approval of affording housing affordable 
housing developments. One affordable housing developer said last week that the bill reduced 
their average approval time from seven years to four months. That's a 95% reduction of costs on 
lawyers, consultants, public relations, etc. The biggest barrier to creating affordable housing is 
the fact that it is so hard to buy land for affordable housing to be built.  
 
James Zall, 203 Pemberton St, Unit 6, in Cambridge, there is no bigger and more consequential 
inequality than restrictive zoning. What started as a system for segregating housing by race and 
class, as evolved into a complex skein of policies and restrictions on height with density and 
other factors of building. The rules have been knotted so tightly that about 60% of the current 
housing, including buildings that most people like and admire, just couldn't be built today. And 
yet some are trying to restrict housing even further by such means is infrastructure impact 
certifications, and neighborhood historic committees.  Not enough housing is being built. A start 
on reforming the  restrictive zoning system doesn't have to wait on federal action on rule grants 
from the state legislature, or approval from the city manager. It's up to the city council to begin 
to reverse decades of damage by ordaining the affordable housing overlay promptly.  
 
Carolyn Fuller, 12 Douglass Street, spoke in support of the AHO. She hopes zoning is no longer 
allowed to be the tool used to bifurcate the city into the haves and the have nots. Restrictive 
zoning is currently hampering the city’s ability to reach stated affordable housing goals. It is time 
to loosen those restrictions for 100% affordable housing.

Jade Sylvan, 502 Green Street in Cambridge, lives in a multifamily three-story home that would 
probably not be allowed to be built under a lot of the restrictions that are currently in place. She 
stated that she supports the Affordable Housing Overlay. 
 
David Sullivan, 16 Notre Dame Avenue in North Cambridge, strongly supports the proposed 
affordable housing overlay. He believed the housing crisis in Cambridge has become worse over 
the last few years. It is important to address the long history of redlining and other racial 
segregation that has occurred in the past. Urged committee not to adopt amendments that will 
dramatically weaken the purposes of this overlay. The purpose is to give affordable housing 
developers a chance to compete fairly in all neighborhoods of the city, not just some.  
 
Loren Crowe, 8 Museum Way in East Cambridge. She supports the affordable housing Overlay. 
Council has a mandate to pass the AHO. City should choose to shift zoning ordinance from one 
that preserves the status quo to one that enables a more just community to be built. 
 
Christopher Schmidt, 17 Laurel street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The affordable housing 
overlay would help find the opportunities for new affordable housing throughout the city.  The 
median price to purchase a single-family home is nearly twice that of a condominium. Despite 
decades of families being priced out, it is extremely important to find new ways to make homes 
available for those who do not make the median area median income. Please pass the affordable 
housing overlay as soon as possible and move on to so much more. 
 
Esther Hanig, 136 Pine Street in Cambridge. The passage of the Affordable Housing overlay 
would help to restore both some diversity and social justice to the city. According to the 2017 
Cambridge Community Needs Assessment, housing affordability is the most pressing issue that 
Cambridge currently faces. While housing affordability is a challenge for many there are 
vulnerable subpopulations that face particular challenges in this issue, including Black or African 
Americans. The neighborhood with the lowest rate of affordable housing is West Cambridge, the 
percentage of affordable housing is 1.3% and only 2.2% of the population is black. Urged 
council to pass the overlay quickly so that the city can begin to meet the need for more 
affordable housing, create true economic and racial diversity in all neighborhoods. 
 
Jackson Moore-Otto, 9 Doane Street. Strongly supports the Affordable Housing Overlay. The 
city needs abundant housing that includes the affordable housing overlay. 
 
Peter Williams, 35 Homer Avenue in West Cambridge. Strongly supports the Affordable 
Housing Overlay.  Cambridge is a wonderful place to live but right now, only the wealthy can 
afford to actually buy a home here.  The restrictions that lead to this unaffordability have 
explicitly racist roots. The people who designed the policies might be gone, but many of the 
policies are saying remain, and even more of their consequences linger.  
 
Eva Martin Blythe, 7 Temple Street, Cambridge. Spoke in support of the Affordable Housing 
Overlay. The city needs for more quality, affordable multi-family housing.  The inequalities 
between neighborhoods are the result of decades of economic power and control.

Susan Schlesinger, 34 Glenwood Avenue in Cambridge port. She is a member of the Affordable 
Housing Trust Fund board. She urged the city council to act quickly on the passage of the 
Affordable Housing overlay. She asked the council to pass this ordinance in substantially the 
same form as its been presented tonight. She reminded the council that the planning board 
reviewed the affordable housing Overlay and sent its approval of the ordinance to the council. 
Last year, there was a poll where a majority of respondents were in favor of the affordable 
housing overlay.  
 
Dan Eisner, 6 Bristol Street. The city's zoning is a quintessential example of systemic racism. 
Exclusionary zoning was established about a century ago to ensure that certain neighborhoods 
would remain exclusive, wealthy and racially homogenous. To this very day, Cambridge is 
highly segregated because these laws demand it. It leads to highly disparate life outcomes. The 
affordable housing overlay is a step toward rectifying these injustices and fixing this historical 
wrong. It has become nearly impossible to build affordable housing in Cambridge, due to not 
only restrictive zoning, but also because of the high cost of acquiring land, the overlay will make 
building affordable housing much more financially feasible. This is why it is essential that the 
overlay not be amended further, and why it must be passed as is. 
 
Cathleen Higgins, 345 Norfolk Street in Cambridge. She spoke in support of the affordable 
housing Overlay. The AHO is about righting the wrongs of racist zoning policies that have 
resulted in racially segregated neighborhoods in Cambridge.  
 
Bill Boehm, 18 Laurel Street. Spoke in favor of passing the affordable housing overlay. Nearly 
all public justifications of zoning rests on the constitutionally permissible goals of protecting the 
health safety, morals and general welfare. But zones established into these goals have become 
more restrictive without substantial justification of the health or safety benefits of lower density. 
And across Cambridge's history, the most restrictive zones have unfailingly remained the whitest 
and wealthiest in the city. The affordable housing overlay is a modest step in the right direction. 
It will produce additional units of affordable housing while beginning to redress a systematic, 
systemic racist structure. 
 
Gabe Colombo, 16 Chauncy Street, architecture graduate student at Harvard. Strongly supports 
the ordination of the affordable housing loan overlay and much more action to encourage and 
increase the amount of affordable housing citywide. Segregation was never an accident; single 
family zoning and apartment bans began as racist tools to deny African Americans and other 
people of color access to housing and create exclusive white enclaves. The areas of Cambridge 
that have the most restrictive apartment bans have the lowest number of affordable housing units 
and these also happened to be the places that have been historically zoned most restrictive and 
have the fewest black residents in the city. He supports passing the AHO. He asked the council 
to consider lowering the 80% AMI cap for affordable housing occupancy in at least some 
instances. 
 
Jonathan Behrens, 115 Hampshire Street. Strongly supports the affordable housing overlay. 
November's election gave a clear mandate in support of the AHO. He urged the council to pass 
the affordable housing overlay rapidly and without compromising it with amendments.

Alexander Roederer, 119 Harvard Street. The committee should quickly pass the affordable 
housing overlay as a modest first step toward creating more affordable housing in our city. Rent 
in Cambridge is really high. Some people have decided to leave Massachusetts altogether and 
relocate. The affordable housing overlay is a good first step and it should be passed as quickly as 
possible without more amendments. This is an issue of fairness, of environmental prudence and 
it just makes good economic sense for Cambridge. 
 
Lori Thomas, 111 Magazine Street. Urged the council to pass the affordable housing overlay as 
quickly as possible without further amendment. 
 
Luis Mejias, 18 Plymouth Street. The barriers put in place that perpetuate the inequities and 
racism of redlining need to be done away with; single family zoning or rather bans on 
multifamily housing is just another form of redlining both racial and economic. Urged committee 
to move the affordable housing overlay forward. 
 
Pawel Latawiec, 2 Earhart Street. Spoke in support of the affordable housing overlay. A key 
component will be to reduce the soft costs of affordable housing construction. According to the 
linkage Nexus study, these make up over 22% of total development costs a good portion of these 
costs, which the AHO can diminish, go toward lawyers, consultants and banks.  
 
Charles Franklin, 162 Hampshire Street. Urged committee to move the affordable housing 
overlay forward to the council with a favorable recommendation. Cambridge does not need more 
luxury single family homes in the heart of the city. He would also like to see the income range 
expanded both up and down and with mixed income requirements so that everyone can afford to 
live here. 
 
Richard Krushnic, 20 Oak Street. He stated that the AHO is the best possible next step that the 
city can take to create more affordable housing. He recommended adding a 20% requirement for 
homeownership units.  He recommended a 20% requirement for three-bedroom units or larger.  
 
Suzanne Blier, 5 Fuller Place. Sher strongly supports ending zoning for single family homes 
throughout the city. She stated that the city needs to fund people to be able to buy their homes.  
 
Tina Alu, 113 and a half pleasant Street. She spoke in support of the affordable housing overlay. 
One definition of equity is described as fairness in procedures, processes and the distribution of 
resources. Equity exists when disparities in the outcomes experienced by historically 
underrepresented populations have been eliminated. Current zoning laws make housing more 
segregated and less affordable. Although prohibiting multifamily and townhouse development in 
certain areas of the city and inflexible standards regarding height, setbacks and parking don't 
explicitly discriminate by race. They effectively exclude families of colors and those with low in 
mind incomes from entire neighborhoods in the city. Areas that were zoned the most restrictively 
in Cambridge is 1943 rezoning have dramatically fewer black residents than the rest of the city 
today. The neighborhoods which have the least restrictive bans on new housing continue to be 
the most racially diverse. The overlay would be an important step in achieving equity.

Jim Stockard, 141 Oxford Street, is a member of the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. A primary 
goal for the city is to increase the number of homes for people of modest means.  The housing 
authority has a waiting list of thousands of people. The most recent affordable housing 
development had ten  applications for every apartment available. The affordable housing overlay 
is a very good next step. Affordable housing developers have a very hard time acquiring property 
on which to provide these homes.  He strongly urged the committee to pass the affordable 
housing overlay.  
 
George Metzger, 90 Antrim Street. The affordable housing overlay petition corrects patterns of 
development that denied lower income people and people of color from choice and where they 
are not able to live in Cambridge. A pattern of racial and economic alignment has denied black 
and brown people an equal opportunity to live in a neighborhood of their choice. As a 
community, we need this council to adopt this overlay.  
 
Jessica Schmidt, a resident of Cambridge for over 15 years and lives at 17 Laurel Street. Making 
housing more accessible to people can only benefit the community. She is in favor of affordable 
housing. 
 
Burhan Azeem, 35 Speridakis Terrace. We are now looking at a time when perhaps a third of 
renters are not able to pay rent. We have massive unemployment and perhaps are heading into a 
great depression and certainly a great recession. Now is not the time to take slow action. Over 
this year City Hall has passed many bills that have been difficult to pass, but we know we needed 
to get them done. This is another bill that we need to get done and we need to get it done soon.  
 
Jessica Sheehan, 99 Norfolk Street. She spoke in support of passage of the affordable housing 
overlay. The overlay will not solve the housing crisis. The crisis extends well beyond Cambridge 
and was over a half century in the making from the racist redlining maps that still look 
uncomfortably similar to our city's current zoning.  No one piece of legislation is going to undo 
that damage and certainly not overnight. The overlay is a modest step in the right direction. 
 
Aaron Rosenthal, 88 Hancock Street. Affordable housing is one of the most important issues 
facing the city. He wants the city to pass the affordable housing overlay as a first step to 
addressing the housing crisis in Cambridge. Housing is a fundamental problem in the city, which 
exacerbates issues our community is facing discrimination, inequality, homelessness, education 
and climate change just to name a few. Currently, the price of housing largely restricts 
Cambridge to the wealthiest individuals. The affordable housing overlay would help to build 
more apartment buildings.   
 
Nancy Alach, 346 concord avenue in West Cambridge. Spoke in favor of the affordable housing 
overlay. The overlay is an important next step to starting to address the affordable housing crisis 
in Cambridge.  
 
Lauren Curry, 3 Concord Avenue.  Spoke in favor of the overlay in order to provide housing for 
many waiting families.

Jean Hannon, 7 Woodrow Wilson Court, spoke in support of the affordable housing overlay 
zoning petition. She was born and raised in Cambridge but can only afford to live here because 
she found an affordable unit.  
 
Josh Cohen, 276 Huron Avenue, is a developer of affordable housing across the Northeast. He 
explained that affordable aousing is driven by the requirements of his funders. Affordable 
housing meets a need that the conventional real estate markets do not meet. Because below 
market, affordable rents do not satisfy the economic return needs of investors affordable 
developers need public funding.  The AHO will unleash innovation and transfer tremendous 
power to the City of Cambridge to guide affordable housing through its funding mechanisms. 
With the AHO local affordable housing developers will be pursuing exciting, innovative, socially 
conscious, environmentally forward-thinking developments in every neighborhood across the 
city.  
 
Teresa Cardosi, 7 Woodrow Wilson Court. A lot of  time was already put into negotiations for 
the modifications to the original 100% affordable housing overlay plan. And as no plan is ever 
perfect, there will most likely be more requests for changes to the hundred percent affordable 
house Housing overlay. We cannot afford to wait any longer during this period of COVID-19, in 
which many people are without income, more and more residents will be displaced once the 
eviction moratorium is lifted. without additional affordable housing the rate of income equal 
inequality, which is already high will surge because only those with higher incomes will be able 
to afford to live in Cambridge.  
 
Florrie Darwin, 7 Follen Street, and I'm a member of the Affordable Housing trusts and I've been 
working on affordable housing issues in Cambridge for over 25 years. And I really thrilled to 
hear all the support that my co Kenta bridges have been calling in and voicing for the affordable 
housing overlay. I agree with the all the important reasons for passing it and for passing it very 
quickly. It's been hanging around and it's been massaged and tweaked for a long time and it's in 
good shape now. The affordable housing is always at the top of the list of major concerns for the 
City of Cambridge. And although we can't change the real estate market and the direction that it's 
heading in, we can there there's many leavers at our desk. buzzle to make it possible to develop 
more affordable housing. And we've done a huge job on that so far in Cambridge, and this will 
be a very important lever to continue making progress in that direction. 
 
Kavish Gandhi, 115 Hampshire Street, spoke in favor of the affordable housing overlay. These 
changes to zoning standards and the permitting process will allow nonprofit affordable 
developers to be much more competitive for new properties. He supports bolder, faster action for 
much, much more than just the affordable housing overlay. It is shameful that Massachusetts 
homeless population has increased by over 30% in the last 10 years and similarly that Cambridge 
point in population has increased by almost 15% since 2012. And study after study has shown 
that rising housing prices are the strongest drivers of this change. With the threat of hundreds or 
thousands or hundreds of 10s of thousands of evictions looming due to the financial burden of 
the pandemic. This is the time for strong action to build more affordable housing and to embrace 
housing for solutions. We cannot continue to remain complacent and treat the disgrace of 
homelessness and rent burdened ship as the status quo.

Noah Sawyer,1035 Cambridge Street, real estate for Just-A-Start, one of Cambridge's nonprofit 
affordable housing developers. Spoke in support for the overlay. There have been several 
properties over the last few years where that Just-A-Start made what they thought were 
aggressive offers on and were outbid by developers looking to build luxury housing.  
 
Gilberte Houbart, 51 Chilton Street in Cambridge. The city has lost about 18% of the tree canopy 
in the past 10 years. Trees in the cities are critical to health, both physical and mental. Tree 
protection should never be left to the discretion of the developers as is the case in the current 
proposal. When you look at an aerial view of Cambridge, it is very clear that West Cambridge 
has most of the canopy in the City.  
 
Justin Saif, 259 Hurley Street. Spoke in support of the affordable housing overlay. The 
affordable housing overlay is a great first step to address the housing crisis in Cambridge. 
Housing prices have risen astronomically in recent years, forcing many Cambridge residents to 
move elsewhere. Survey data shows that the housing crisis is by far the number one concern of 
Cambridge residents and we have done far too little to address that concern. It will provide for 
opportunities to build affordable housing in all parts of Cambridge, including parts of 
Cambridge, where there is little to no affordable housing. The affordable housing overlay does 
not go far enough and should allow larger buildings in the current limits, particularly if any of 
these additional limits are adopted.  
 
Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street. The key to quick housing for a lot of people is density. Density 
now is lethal. Even an elevator in a high rise is lethal. We have a huge responsibility on the 
shoulders of our nine councillors to put together an affordable housing overlay that serves all the 
key points. 
 
Saul Tannenbaum, 16 Cottage Street. Spoke in support of the affordable housing overlay. This 
ordinance does not go far enough to undo the legacy of race and class that underlies the land use 
patterns that define Cambridge. While passing this ordinance will be an achievement of which 
the city should be proud, it is only a first step.  
 
Aaron Homer, 90 Grozier Road. This is a chance to make progress on two of the most critical 
problems of our time; climate change and ongoing racial inequities and housing. Urged the 
council to pass the overlay quickly and without amendments.  
 
Jacquelyn Fahey Sandell, 8 Clinton Street in Cambridge. She supports affordable housing but 
want developers to abide by current height and setback rules. The pictures that were shown of 
the unit on Bigelow and the Auburn court, are great examples of affordable housing that can 
work within the city and within the neighborhoods and keep the feel of the neighborhood. The 
proposed regulation allows many buildings to go up by 20 feet or more, which is extremely high, 
and not just a story here and there. 
 
Kathleen Moore, 9 Doane Street, asked council to move forward quickly with the affordable 
housing Overlay .

  Government Operations rules and clams committee will meet to continue the discussion on the City 

Manager’s contract extension 
 
Councillor E. Denise Simmons called the meeting to order to continue the discussion on the city 
manager's contract extension, and she opened the floor to public comment. 
 
Samuel Gebru, 812 Memorial Drive, spoke in support of the city manager’s contract renewal. He has 
worked with Mr. DePasquale in various capacities throughout the years and really thoroughly enjoyed the 
experiences with him and his staff. He said that Mr. DePasquale is a strategic steward of our city's 
resources. 
 
Kim Courtney stated that the city of Cambridge is corrupt. She said that this corruption permeates not 
only the city manager's office, but also the city solicitor's office, the license Commission, the zoning 
board, and more. She said that it’s time for the City Council to stop enabling the institutional corruption 
that exists in the government, remove the city manager, and bring democracy back to the city.  
 
Judy Johnson, 55 Antrim Street in Cambridge, stated that the city manager's whole term has been to 
garner more power and control for his position and to diminish the role of the city council. The city 
manager’s personal agenda is not in tune with the stated goals of the city council. He should be replaced 
as soon as possible.  
 
Xavier Dietrich, co-owner of Upper West, stated that it is time to hold Mr. DePasquale accountable for 
his actions and perhaps most importantly for his inactions. He stated that many departments under the 
City Manager’s supervision have improperly revoked permits. He urged the council to end Mr. 
DePasquale’s contract as soon as possible.

Hector Acevedo, 125 Portland Street, stated that he supports extending the contract of the city manager. 
He stated that Mr. DePasquale is very active in the community, working with non-profits and supporting 
community organizations. He stated that no one loves the city more than Mr. DePasquale. 
 
Henry Wortis, 106 Berkshire Street in Cambridge, stated that the City Council should select a manager 
with the best strategy to achieve these goals. He stated that allowing the requested extension is a good 
idea because it will give the council time to formulate a process to select the next City Manager. 
 
Louise Parker, 1 Warwick Park, has many concerns about Mr. DePasquale’s job performance. She said 
she is most concerned with the manager's refusal to conduct a broadband feasibility study, requests for 
inventory of city owned property. The fact that the manager is unaccountable to the public and has 
unilateral power to ignore the will of democratically elected officials is concerning. She supports the 
renewal of the city manager's contract for a single year in order to conduct a thorough, formal, and open 
evaluation of the manager based on city council stated goals. She wants the City Council to conduct a 
national City Manager search.  
 
Christopher Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said that he has been surprised by 
the lack of visibility into the city manager’s responsiveness to city council policy orders, priorities, 
reports and goals. He is concerned by the lack of a formal evaluation of the City Manager’s performance. 
He stated that, nevertheless, changing the city manager during the pandemic is not the best path. 
 
Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk Street, president of the Cambridge Residents Alliance, asked that the council 
extend the manager’s contract for one year only. She asked that the Council decide on a process to 
evaluate the manager and that the council begin that evaluation as soon as possible. She asked that the 
council establish a process and timing for starting a nationwide city manager search and hiring process. 
At public meetings of the Cambridge resonance Alliance, many members of the public expressed 
dissatisfaction with the lack of the evaluation of the manager by the Council and the lack of response to 
certain policy orders. 
 
Theresa Hamacher, 95 Raymond Street, supports extending the city manager’s contract by just one year, 
in order to conduct a search. She encouraged the council to re-examine the duties and responsibilities of 
the City Manager position. 
 
Jennifer Lin, 32 Oakland Street, encouraged the Council to revise how the city considers the city 
manager. She is concerned to find that some policy orders and legal requirements were not being met by 
the current city manager. She supports renewing this contract for a single year in order to conduct a 
thorough public review of the city manager. She said we may also want to reconsider whether or not such 
an important official should remain unelected.  
 
Ilan Levy, 148 Spring Street, spoke in support of changing the city government to remove the unelected 
city manager, and to create an elected leadership position. 
 
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, encouraged the council to select a new city manager. At most, she 
supports extending the current contract for one year.

Robert Winters, 366 Broadway, spoke in support of a multi-year contract extension for Mr. DePasquale. 
Mr. DePasquale has the right qualities of empathy, and a take-charge management style, which is exactly 
what the city needs. 
 
Kit Haines, 6 Florence Street in Cambridge, asked the council not to extend this contract. She stated that 
she is very disappointed by not being allowed to leave the house. Not the City Manager’s job to determine 
if shared streets are safe, but to implement the city council's vote. 
 
Teni Lavoie, 20 Locust Street, spoke in support renewing the existing contract. Always felt the Mr. 
DePasquale listened and never made decisions in a vacuum.

Councillor Simmons asked her colleagues to remember that is critical to move this process forward in 
these tumultuous times. She recognized that some councillors are concerned about the lack of a formal 
performance review, but that should not delay this process. She moved that the committee recommend 
to the full city council a policy order to extend the city manager's contract for a period of 24 
months.  
 
Councillor Simmons explained that this extension will allow the council time to formulate a thoughtful 
and transparent process to search for the next city manager. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern stated that no matter who served as city manager, no one will be entirely 
happy with every decision that person makes. He briefly described the process and effort that went into 
the last City Manager search. He said that s year is not enough time to find a new city manager. 
Councillor McGovern stated that he supported a national search after the proposed extension by 
Councillor Simmons. He supports the two-year extension proposed by Councillor Simmons.

In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Simmons explained that she met with 
the City Manager pursuant to the vote of the committee. She confirmed that the manager is looking for a 
24-month extension, not a full contract. 
 
Councillor Zondervan agreed that it may take more than one year to find a new city manager, but he still 
would prefer a one-year contract renewal. If the council does not find a new manager within that year, 
then it could consider an additional year extension. He moved to amend Councillor Simmons’s motion 
to recommend a 12-month extension from the end of the current contract, with an option to renew 
for an additional 12 months upon mutual agreement. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that in general, this form of government is not working for 
Cambridge, and he believes that the most powerful position in Cambridge government should be an 
elected mayor. He stated that the city manager’s role should be to carry out the will of the city council 
when it comes to policy. There have been a number of occasions where the council has put forth a policy 
order that has either not been implemented or been slow to be implemented. He stated that he could not 
support a contract extension until there has been a performance evaluation of the current city manager.  
 
Councillor Tim Toomey stated that he supported the two-year contract extension for the city manager. He 
stated that the selection of a new city manager is a long and involved process. He stated that the city 
manager has done a good job in responding to the council’s priorities. Councillor Toomey stated that the 
manager has done a good job in responding to COVID-19, and he wanted Mr. DePasquale’s continued 
leadership through this crisis. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan stated that the council should evaluate the performance of the city manager 
prior to an extension. She believes the city council should have a full discussion of the role and the goals 
of the city manager. Councillor Nolan stated that she was concerned that certain policy orders have not 
been responded to by the city manager. She stated that she could support a one-year extension, but not 
more, only because the nation is in the midst of the pandemic. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone spoke in support of completing a review of the city manager’s job 
performance. He stated that he is concerned that certain policy orders have not received a response. He 
was specifically concerned that the council has not received a list of their city-owned property, which the 
council voted to receive. He is concerned about the lack of infrastructure planning. Councillor Carlone 
stated that he is inclined to vote for an extension, but that he also wanted his concerns addressed.  
 
Councillor McGovern stated that the manager deserves better than a year-to-year contract. He stated that 
he was concerned that a year-to-year contract would have a negative impact on the pool of potential 
candidates. He expressed concerns about when a one-year contract would begin and end. Councillor 
McGovern stated that COVID-19 will impact the pool of candidates at least in the short term. He supports 
the two-year extension but could not support a one-year extension based on what he knew of the process. 
 
Mayor Siddiqui stated that she has worked very closely with the City Manager over the course of the 
pandemic. She has seen a lot of good things from him, as well as some areas that need improvement. The

mayor stated that she would be supportive of a 12-month extension, beginning January 2021, and then a 
mutually agreed-upon extension if needed. 
 
Councillor Quinton Zondervan stated that he believed that the extension would begin on January 2021. 
He stated that a one-year extension would give the council 18 months to find a new city manager. He 
encouraged the council to have a comprehensive and transparent evaluation of the city manager. He felt 
that a new city manager is required for a new vision for Cambridge. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that he would support a one-year extension, with the possibility of an 
additional one-year extension.  
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that she supported Councillor Zondervan’s amendment. She stated that a one-
year extension would give the Council 18 months to find a new city manager. She stated that she would 
not support a 24-month extension.

Councillor McGovern suggested a motion to give the chair the authority to have a discussion with the 
City Manager about whether he would prefer a 1-year or a 2-year extension. 
 
Councillor Toomey stated that, pursuant to the contract, if the city intends to continue Mr. DePasquale’s 
employment beyond January 2021, it shall give written notice to Mr. DePasquale on or before September 
14, 2020 and initiate negotiations for a successor employment contract, which shall become effective 
January 9, 2021.

Councillor Simmons opened the hearing to public comment.   
 
Valerie Bonds, 808-812 Memorial Drive, asked how a person applies for a position on the Cambridge 
Housing Authority Board.  She noted her concern about the renovations at 808-812 Memorial Drive.   
 
James Williamson stated that in Cambridge, the public does not have the opportunity for public at CHA 
meetings.  He said that it could be done in a way that is reasonably well-managed.  He asked the proposed 
new appointment about his view on this topic.  He said that another big issue is that some of the managers 
of CHA properties are good but there are many complaints about other managers.  He said that in Boston, 
the tenants are allowed to select the management company that manage the properties.  He said that it 
works well, and it would be one way of addressing the issues that some people have with managers.   
 
Councillor Simmons invited Mr. Johnston to give his remarks.       
 
Mike Johnston stated that Gerald Clark has been with CHA as a Commissioner since 1974.  Mr. Clark 
joined the CHA board in the dark days of the CHA.  He said that between Mr. Clark and other new 
Commissioners, they were able to turn the CHA around under Dan Wuenschel’s leadership.  He stated 
that Mr. Clark has been a Hearing Officer at the CHA for a number of years and is a retired law school 
professor. Although Ms. Clark is not present at today’s hearing, Mr. Johnston stated that he is prepared to 
answer any questions regarding this re- appointment.   
 
Councillor Simmons invited questions or comments regarding Mr. Clark’s re-appointment.  There were 
no questions or comments.   
 
Councillor McGovern made a motion to forward the re-appointment of Mr. Clark to the CHA Board to 
the full City Council with a favorable recommendation.

Mr. Johnston stated that as background, the CHA Board is made up of 5 individuals, consisting of one 
person appointed by the Governor and four individuals appointed by the City Manager and confirmed by 
the City Council.  He stated that of these four appointments, Massachusetts General Laws requires one of 
the four positions must be recommended by organized labor and one must be a Tenant Representative.  
He stated that Mr. Bacci would fill the seat that was vacated by the departure of Tony Pini.  Mr. Johnston 
said that Mr. Bacci is a lifelong resident of Cambridge and a member of the Local 151 Laborers Union.  
He noted that this is a five-year seat that would be held through 2024.   
 
Mr. Bacci, 18 Eighth Street, stated that he is a lifelong resident of Cambridge.  He stated that his goal is to 
represent the City in the best way possible.  He noted that he would like to see more low-income housing.  
He said that he looks forward to doing his part to give back to the community.

Councillor Zondervan stated that he has heard from tenants in public housing about their concerns 
regarding mistreatment by certain property managers.  He asked Mr. Bacci to what extent he is planning 
to represent tenants as well as the labor union and what he will do in this situation.  Mr. Bacci responded 
that he would like to represent all stakeholders equally.  He stated that both sides of a story need to be 
heard.   
 
Councillor Simmons said that the position on the CHA Board is extraordinary and important because we 
are allowing, through these appointments, for advocacy and policy development for the CHA.  She said 
that this is a commitment that will take up a lot of time.  She asked Mr. Bacci if he is able to meet the 
time commitment that is necessary for this position.  Mr. Bacci responded that he will allocate as much 
time as needed for this work.   
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked Mr. Bacci what direction he would like to see the CHA take in terms 
of improvements, etc. Mr. Bacci said that he wants to focus on improving the existing housing and he 
would like to see improvement in services by the CHA. 
 
Councillor McGovern made a motion to forward the appointment of Louis Bacci, III to the CHA Board to 
the full City Council with a favorable recommendation.

Councillor Simmons invited Maura Pensak to give an update on proposed priorities for the remainder of 
the 2020-2021 City Council term.   
 
Ms. Pensak stated that the Liaison position was created to add capacity and to support and augment the 
existing efforts and to implement and coordinate various strategies and recommendations that have been 
identified through the myriad initiatives, committees, and task forces in recent years.  She said that in 

-1 

 

Packet Pg. 992

7.9

order to actualize and operationalize the position, a three-pronged strategy was recommended and started 
in the first 6-7 months (pre-Covid). In summary, it is to adopt a Comprehensive City Housing Platform 
that would include a multifaceted public education campaign that promoted and clarified the housing 
opportunities and housing related services throughout the varied departments and establish the Cambridge 
model of a decentralized, yet robust, and active office of housing stability. The second strategy is to 
address both access and tenant displacement concerns by filling direct service gaps such as the need for 
more housing search and case management capacity and by creating and expanding tools and trainings for 
not only tenants but owners, management companies, realtors and others who impact a tenant’s ability to 
find and maintain housing.  The final strategy is to effect system change through policies, procedures, and 
best practices to include implementation of a tenant notification act, supporting pending statewide 
legislation such as support of the right to counsel for tenants and developing an alternative credit 
screening tool, coordinating efforts around key concerns such as hoarding and/or distressed buildings or 
consideration of a landlord incentive program.   
 

Ms. Pensak noted that most of these goals continue to be important, but the Covid-19 pandemic has 
brought the housing crisis to an unprecedented and critical level of concern. Fortunately, at the start of 
the pandemic, the City Manager’s Office, the Mayor, City Council, and City Departments and/or 
affordable housing partners moved swiftly to establish tenant protections and enhance and 
expand City resources and services to assist tenants in need.  An Emergency Temporary Eviction 
Moratorium Order was issued, the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund was established, and a housing 
hotline and web page were created. In addition, CHA and others led the region in implementing 
flexible and supportive policies and practices.  She explained that these efforts were essential to 
ensuring that our residents maintained their housing during the initial months of the pandemic. 
However, with unemployment at unparalleled heights, the financial impact of the pandemic 
continues to threaten the stability of our tenants and homeowners. She noted that without 
continued interventions, Cambridge will experience increased tenant displacement and a further 
decline of our socio-economic diversity. 
Ms. Pensak stated that FY21 housing priorities must respond both to the increased need for tenant 
protections and housing assistance resources and services as well as exploring opportunities that may 
have resulted from the crisis. She explained that these priorities would include the development and 
implementation of a Comprehensive Covid-19 Housing Safety Net, Improvement of Access to Housing 
Opportunities, and the Continuation of Project Development, Implementation and/or Coordination 
Activities to Address Access and Tenant Displacement Concerns.   
 
In summary, Ms. Pensak asserted that the City must continue the strategies of enhanced direct service and 
interdepartmental collaboration, explore access barriers, challenges and opportunities and enhance and 
promote a safety net with strong policies and best practice recommendations that will address this crisis 
need and ensure long term policy change. 
 
Councillor Sobrino-Wheeler thanked Ms. Pensak for update.  He asked Ms. Pensak about discrimination 
that vouch holders receive as there is a report from Suffolk University looking at discrimination that 
renters face with voucher holders as well as black residents.  He asked Ms. Pensak to talk about what 
aspect of this she has seen and what efforts the City has looked into in this regard.  Maura Pensak 
responded that there is a lot of work to do. She talked about the need for more collaboration with the 
Human Rights Commission in their fair housing work.  She said that there was some conversation pre-
Covid.  From her office, she stated that she has been talking to tenants and management companies.  She 
said that it is very tricky to put your hands around.  She said that some tenants do not want to pursue 
action.  She said that they are seeing a lot of perspective tenants being asked if they are professional or a 
student with no room for family or just a resident.  She said that some of it is financially driven.  She said 
that if a person rents to a student, there will be more turnover than if you rent to a resident or family that 
wants to be a permanent resident of Cambridge.  She explained that we do need more testing.  She said 

Packet Pg. 993

7.9

that she hopes to have a public education campaign which includes education, regulation and the creation 
of tools such as credit screening.    
 
Councillor Zondervan thanked Ms. Pensak for the great work that she is doing.  He said that it feels so 
overwhelming with so many obstacles. He worries that we won’t get there this way.  He asked what some 
of big things are that can be worked on at the policy level to help break some of these challenges and 
assist with the work.  He asked if the City Council should be working on a condo conversion bylaw.  Ms. 
Pensak responded that when we are able to pull together more specifics around management company 
practices, it is something that could turn into a policy.  She said that supporting continued funding is 
something that the City Council can do.  She said that a balance must be found between policy and best 
practice.   Councillor Zondervan said that he would like to be kept informed in how the City Council can 
best assist this work.  He noted that he is encouraged by the work on discrimination and racism or policy 
moves that can be made to help Ms. Pensak in her work. He said that these are persistent and 
longstanding problems in the housing market. He asked if there are any updates on staffing in Ms. 
Pensak’s office.  He noted that the City Council approved a reallocation during the budget process. Ms. 
Pensak said that she has not spoken with the City Manager regarding next steps in this process.    
 
Councillor McGovern thanked Ms. Pensak for her work.  He stated that he would like to talk about short-
term and long-term goals from a policy perspective.  As it relates to short term solutions, he asked that 
some sort of “Know Your Rights” pamphlet could be given to a renter in the event that they have any 
issues.  He noted that he is amazed at how many residents have month to month leases.  He asked if this is 
something that the City Council should work on.  He asked if there is lower hanging fruit work that can 
be done quickly while unpacking the bigger issues. Ms. Pensak responded that said that a “Knowing Your 
Rights” brochure when a person becomes a renter is definitely doable.  She said that it is interesting that 
Councillor McGovern raised the issue about month to month leases. She said that because of Covid and 
working on the Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund, there are people that presented that thought.  She said that 
people had a lease, but it ran out and it turned into a month to month lease.  She said this could potentially 
require a policy along with educating people that they should request a lease to be renewed from an owner 
every year.  Ms. Pensak said that the other issue that came along with Covid was that a lot of people were 
asked to renew their lease 90-120 days before the end of the first lease.  It became problematic when 
people lost their jobs and were not sure that they could commit to such a lease.  She said that if they did 
not renew, there would be a fee.  She said that they worked one-on-one with a number of places to forego 
the fee but a policy change amending the length of time that a signed lease could not be requested more 
than 60 days in advance would be beneficial.  Councillor McGovern said that it may be helpful to break 
down issues such as housing, quality of housing, and discrimination into different sections.  He said that 
rather than a long list, a break down in sections would be easier to work with.  Councillor McGovern 
asked about incentives for landlords.  He talked about a group in Charlotte that implemented a program 
with veterans wherein they provide insurance for the landlord in the event that the veteran skips out on the 
rent or damages the property.  He explained that the other thing that they do is gap vouchers.  He said that 
where the Section 8 caps out and where the floor of market rate begins there is a gap. Even with a Section 
voucher, it is difficult to find something on the market.  He asked if this is something that could be 
helpful for Cambridge to look at.  Ms. Pensak stated that this is interesting.  She said that one thing that is 
different in Cambridge is that the CHA has put in the smaller fair market rates so that has increased what 
they will pay and that has made quite a difference.  She said that there is a fine line of continuing to 
support the really high rent.  She said that the rates that the CHA is paying now are pretty good. She said 
that she is open to more discussion about Councillor McGovern’s ideas.    
 
Mayor Siddiqui stated that something that comes up regularly has been inclusionary preferences.  She 
asked about the status.  Ms. Farooq said that CDD has been working studiously on updating the 
preferences.  She noted that after previously meeting with the Housing Committee, her department went 
back to the Affordable Housing Trust to talk through the issues that came up at the Housing Committee in 

Packet Pg. 994

7.9

the last term.  She said that it fell to the back burner during Covid as the housing team has doubled down 
in making sure that inclusionary program doesn’t flag and also working on the various grant programs. 
She noted that they will be ready to come back to the Housing Committee with a revised version of the 
preference recommendations in September.   
 
Mayor Siddiqui asked if there is any update with respect to city owned property and housing.  Ms. Farooq 
said that each of the various city parcels has different characteristics that is amendable to different kinds 
of uses. She noted that Cherry Street is one property that the staff feels strongly that housing would be a 
good use on that site.  She explained that a public process was initiated that ended in an impasse.  She 
said that the neighborhood is different, and the goals are different, and the hope is that in September they 
are hoping to host a first meeting to bring everyone back to Cheery Street issue.  She said that instead of 
starting with an open-ended question, they will start with the goal of having housing on this site and then 
have a discussion with the neighborhood which will help to define the discussion. 
 
Mayor Siddiqui asked about property at the intersection of Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue.  Ms. 
Farooq responded that it is slated for housing because it is a part of a transfer agreement but the issue is 
that it is more complex because although it is dedicated housing, it is a much more complicated and very 
tight sight so CDD needs to go through a community process and more discussion with the Affordable 
Housing Trust.  Chris Cotter added that it is a challenging site so they expect that there will be complexity 
when it comes to redeveloping it.  He commented that the building is a 6-unit building that has been 
vacant and will likely involve demolition.  He said that CDD expects to go through the Affordable 
Housing Trust as they have done in the past to select the developer but they want to first think about the 
size, scale, approach, funding, and how the housing will be used, for example, would it be best family 
housing, individuals, lower income household individuals, etc.  He said that conversations need to take 
place. 
 
Mayor Siddiqui said that Cambridge and Somerville Legal Services would be another group to talk to 
because they are strong partners.  They could advise as to trends that they are seeing.  She said that the 
City Council has received some reports from the Human Rights Commission around discrimination.  She 
said that there is an Intake Form asking questions regarding discrimination, but most people don’t know 
about it.  She said that a campaign around reporting discrimination to the City via some type of 
mechanism would be beneficial to track these incidents.     
 
Councillor Carlone stated that he is curious.  He said that the work of the Affordable Housing Trust is 
something that the City Council supports.  He said that in the proposed ordinance there will be a report 
back.  He asked if there is there any evaluation of build projects done by the AHT or CDD to learn what 
worked, what didn’t work and what can be done better.  He asked if there is public access to that 
information.  Mr. Cotter responded that there is not a formal review, but they work closely with the 
housing providers and have informal discussions where they learn from each other as projects go forward.  
He said that CDD is learning from Homeowner’s Rehab as they are completing the Finch development 
and there are discussions among the housing agencies to share notes and learn. Mr. Cotter said that 
evaluation is happening continually and is informal.  Councillor Carlone said that there is mysticism 
about the Affordable Housing Trust, and it does not seem publicly open which creates a concern by 
neighbors that can be avoided.  He said that the information could be as simple as a document 
summarizes what was discussed and key points.   
 
Ms. Farooq clarified that when Mr. Cotter said that conversations were not public, he was referring to 
conversations with non-profit Affordable Housing builders.  She noted that all of the Affordable Housing 
Trust meetings are open to the public and the meeting minutes are posted on the website.  She said that 
she would be happy to send the link to Councillor Carlone.  Councillor Carlone said that he knows much 
business occurs in the committee meetings, but he was referring to conversations with non-profit builders. 

Packet Pg. 995

7.9

He asked Mr. Cotter about design discussions being public or not and that is what he was focusing on.  
He said that many decisions get made behind the scenes, but many decisions get made and if it is not clear 
why the decisions were made, it hurts the process.  He Recommend that whatever those discussions were, 
he would like to see a summary of those conversations.  Mr. Cotter said that meetings that he is talking 
about is with affordable housing builders, they are not meetings in which things are decided.  It is more 
about sharing notes.  
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that it is hard to get good data on displacement and evictions, 
especially during the pandemic.  He said that it is great to see the Housing Stabilization Fund that has 
been set up.  He said that the eviction moratorium has been extended statewide through mid-October.  He 
said that he is concerned about seeing a potential flood of evictions after that and how the city is tracking 
that.  He questions if there is data from the Housing Stabilization Fund can be aggregated.  Ms. Farooq 
responded that Ms. Pensak has led the charge and is better positioned to speak on this issue.  Ms. Pensak 
said that there is data from the Mayors Disaster Relief Fund that they are working on to figure out 
patterns and where requests have come from.  She said that the Tenant Rights and Notification Act is 
important because it will require information to be given and hopefully, we will get more calls at the early 
stages.  She said that it is imp to have a sense where we will be at.  The goal is to help people keep their 
head above water and they will not have huge arrears when this ends. 
 
As it relates to accessory dwelling units, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked how many units have been 
created. Ms. Farooq said that she does not have the specific numbers handy at the moment.  She said that 
the Inspectional Services Department keeps those records, but she will happy to provide the members 
with that information.  She said that since the Accessory Dwelling Unit ordinance focused on where there 
is existing space that is unused it was limited by the existing amount of built square footage by the date in 
the ordinance.  Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler noted that he looks forward to next steps. 
 
Councillor Simmons thanked Ms. Pensak for her hard work. She thanked Ms. Farooq and Mr. Cotter.  
She said that the next step is to synthesize.  She said that she is interested in hearing where we are in 
terms of preferences.  She said we should make it easier for people to get into the inclusionary program.  
She said that she is pleased with movement around the Cherry Street lot.  She said that the Housing 
Committee members need to focus their attention and determine what the Committee sees as important 
that we may be able to get completed in this term.  She said that she is interested in a comprehensive 
housing platform or plan.  She asked the members to find one important topic that the committee will 
focus on and will be completed by the end of the current term.     
 
Councillor Zondervan said that he appreciates the charge to the committee to think about priorities. He 
said that the work that was done last term in the task force brought forward the opportunity around condo 
conversions.  He said that this has been an ongoing problem in the city.  He said that he is wondering if 
this could be prioritized now.  Councillor Simmons said that she wants to collaborate with Councillor 
Sobrinho-Wheeler to put together a work plan in a focused way.   
 
Councillor McGovern stated that Councillor Simmons is on target.  He would like to see the committee 
develop a roadmap with priorities.   
 
Mayor Siddiqui said that Ms. Pensak has outlined the work in her office while CDD has their workplan.  
She said that there are different people working on different things.  Councillor Simmons said that the 
work can happen in tandem.   
 
Councillor Carlone said that he agrees with Councillor McGovern.  He said that it is the beginnings of a 
residential plan for the city.  He said that there is no doubt that CDD has many of these thoughts in mind.  

Packet Pg. 996

7.9

He noted that even an outline would help everyone.  He said that each expertise area has something to 
give and it is something that can begin to develop into a housing plan for the city.   
 
Councillor Simmons and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler thanked all those present for their attendance. 
 
The hearing adjourned at 3:47 p.m.

Councillor E. Denise Simmons called the meeting to order at 2:03 PM. She explained that the purpose of

Councillor Simmons suggested that at some point, the city council should have a refresher on the basic 
rules.  
 
Councillor Toomey moved on to 
open public comment

Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Kim Courtney, attorney and the co-owner of Upper West, stated that people have the right to provide 
public comment and attend public meetings anonymously. She said that the Cambridge City Council rules 
and practices requiring public speakers to provide identifying information like their name and address 
violates their constitutional rights to free speech. She said that the Cambridge City Council rules and 
practices blocking the public from criticizing the performance of our public officials’ duties is a violation 
of their constitutional rights to petition the government. 
 
Xavier Dietrich, co-owner of upper west, voiced his concerns over the rules that every person addressing 
the city council is instructed to state their name and address for the record. He said that the council is not 
allowed to make rules that violate the First Amendment to the US Constitution. He said that the First 
Amendment protects the people's right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. That is the 
right to make a complaint to, or seek assistance of, one's government, without fear of punishment or 
reprisals. He said that the right to do this anonymously is also well established, and this is for obvious 
reasons.

Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, said that the rules are a jumble with respect to reconsideration and 
that they are internally inconsistent. She emphasized the importance of public comment. 
 
John Hawkinson, 84 Massachusetts Avenue, stated that he was concerned with the possibility of reducing 
public comment. He stated that in other communities, public comment is more interactive and 
engagement between the officials and public commenters is allowed. 
 
Councillor Toomey moved to 
close public comment 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Simmons gave a brief recap of the items discussed by the committee at the last meeting. She 
expressed an interest in reviewing rule 24(c) (1)(B) due to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he wants to discuss rule 27, which governs the quorum requirement for 
committees.  
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he wanted to make sure all roundtables are televised and to fix any 
inconsistencies around reconsideration.  
 
Councillor McGovern and Councillor Simmons discussed amending rule 16 to be consistent with rule 35. 
 
Councillor McGovern moved to amend rule 16 by striking the words "any member", in the last paragraph, 
and replacing this with the words "any councillor among those whose votes prevailed". 
 
Councillor McGovern explained that historically, when any member was allowed to file reconsideration, 
a councillor or school committee member who was in the minority would file reconsideration to get 
another shot at the vote. It was not because there was new information, nor was it because there was an 
inconsistency, nor because there was a rule violation. He said that the councillor or school committee 
member merely wanted to have another few days or a week to try and convince their colleagues to put 
pressure on the Council or the school committee to change the vote. He did not believe that this was good 
governance. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not believe that this amendment is necessary, because the council 
rules are governed by Robert’s Rules, and Robert’s Rules already limit reconsideration to those who 
voted on the prevailing side. 
 
Councillor Simmons spoke in support of Councillor McGovern’s amendment. She stated that rule 16 
should be consistent with rule 35.

Councillor McGovern’s motion 
passed by the following roll call 
vote. 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Zondervan and Councillor Simmons had a discussion about changing the procedure to sign up 
for public comment. Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not feel there was a need to amend those 
procedures. 
 
Councillor Simmons stated that she supported having public commenters provide some form of 
identifying information. She stated that it is important to know who is speaking to the council because it 
gives the members some context as they determine the level of importance to assign to each speaker’s 
remarks. She said that if someone who does not live in Cambridge or work in Cambridge was 
commenting on a matter before the Council, that context would be important to know.  
 
Mayor Siddiqui suggested adding “adjournment” to rule 25A. 
 
Motion to amend rule 24A to add 
"15. adjournment" by Councillor 
Toomey. 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor McGovern explained that the council may want to amend the rules for public comment so as 
to ensure members of the public case use remote participation. Councillor Simmons expressed support for 
continuing public comment through remote participation. Councillor Zondervan asked for guidance from 
the City Solicitor on this issue. 
 
Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, explained that city council’s meetings are governed by the Open Meeting 
Law and the requirements pertaining to public participation. The emergency order of the governor is what 
is allowing remote participation. After the pandemic emergency order is lifted, she did not believe remote 
participation would be allowed in its current form. She stated that she would like to research what, if any, 
changes could be adopted through the city council rules.

Governor's emergency order is lifted by 
Councillor McGovern 
 
Councillors McGovern 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Chair - Councillor Simmons 
 
Councillor Zondervan suggested amending rule 27 to require that five members be present for a quorum 
of committees with nine members, and a three-member quorum be present for committees with five 
members. He stated that the current quorum requirements are confusing for the public and that increasing 
the quorum will increase councillor participation. 
 
Councillor Toomey stated that he believed that the current quorum rules work and do not need to be 
changed. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that he supported the change. He felt that the current quorum 
requirements made it hard to discuss issues with other councillors due to the potential to violate the Open 
Meeting Law. 
 
Councillor McGovern stated that the quorum number was lowered to make sure that committees could 
more easily obtain a quorum and hold a meeting. He stated that he believed attendance was better now. 
 
Councillor Simmons stated that the quorum requirements were decreased to allow flexibility in 
attendance due to the constraints on councillors’ schedules. 
 
Motion to set a quorum of 5 
members for the Finance and 
Ordinance committee and 3 
members for all other committees

Mayor Siddiqui asked how members felt about splitting the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning, 
Public Facilities, Art and Celebrations committee into two committees – one for Neighborhood and Long-
Term Planning, Public Facilities, and another one for Art and Celebrations. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did not believe that the committee needed to be divided, but he said 
that he would support splitting the committee if the Mayor felt that would be useful.

Councillor Simmons stated that she did not believe that it was necessary to split this committee. She 
stated that in the past, there had been too many committees and not enough councillors to populate the 
committees. 
 
Councillor McGovern suggested allowing for more than two hours for Ordinance committee meetings. 
Councillor Toomey suggested removing the two-hour limit for hearings entirely. Councillor Zondervan 
stated that he did not support removing the two-hour limit entirely, but he would support clarifying the 
rule. Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, explained that certain laws require hearings for those items and that 
those hearing require public testimony. Councillor Toomey stated that some meetings have a large 
amount of public comment, which can eat into the two hours. 
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he was concerned about deleting a limit entirely. He suggested putting a 
time limit in the call of the meeting. Councillor Simmons stated that she was in favor of removing the 
two-hour limit entirely. 
 
Motion to amend rule 32B to

Councillor Toomey 
 
Councillors McGovern

Councillor Zondervan moved to delete the first sentence of rule 32B and replace it with the following: 
“The time devoted to public hearings and committee meetings shall be determined by the chair at the time 
of scheduling.” 
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he was not sure if this should apply to committee meetings and hearings. 
Councillor Simmons stated that hearings should be maintained as a separate order. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor McGovern, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, stated 
that this hearing section relates only to hearings and not to other meetings of the council, whether 
committees or of the whole Council. 
 
Councillor Simmons stated that she was not prepared to make any amendments to this provision. 
 
Councillor Zondervan withdrew his motion.

The Ordinance Committee will meet to reconvene a public hearing on a petition to add an 
Affordable Housing Ordinance to the City’s Zoning Ordinances 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  called the meeting to order and explained that this is a reconvened public 
hearing on a petition to add an affordable housing ordinance to the city's zoning ordinances.  
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager of Community Development, described the various documents 
prepared by the Community Development department in preparation for this meeting. She explained that 
the Planning Board held  public hearing on this zoning petition on August 4, there were eight members 
present and they voted seven to one to recommend adoption of the petition as filed. The written report 
from that meeting will be submitted to the city council at a future date. The majority of board members 
expressed their view that the zoning would be an important step, both in addressing the challenge of 
affordable housing in this city and in advancing social equity goals. They agreed with the need for the 
approach to be city wide and on the significance of the “as of right” permitting processes. Some board 
members had questions about specific numbers on height and so forth, but they felt comfortable with the 
mechanism for review and evaluation that is included in the petition.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Patricia Nolan, Iram Farooq stated that the Planning Board did 
not recommend any amendments.   
 
In response to a question from Councillor Patricia Nolan about changing the facade requirement from 150 
feet to 250 feet and bike parking requirements, Iram Farooq explained that that was a changed proposed 
by the petitioner after speaking with affordable housing builders and advocates about the challenges 
related to creating these projects.  
 
Councillor Marc McGovern stated that the change was made in part to create more flexibility in projects. 
It's not to say that that there won't be times when there can be courtyards or breakups under the 250 feet, 
but to require it, builders felt would hamstring them.

Councillor Dennis Carlone  stated that studies have shown that a small percentage of affordable housing 
below grade parking is actually rented. He stated that problem with the city-wide overlay is that it does 
not relate to low density districts any differently than to high density districts. Councillor Carlone stated 
that he shared Councillor Nolan's concern about the façade requirements.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development , explained that unlike with motor vehicle parking, 
the bicycle parking requirements are not waived under the Affordable Housing overlay. There are some 
modifications in the proposal that try to allow some flexibility in how the requirements are met. There are 
some cases where if a very small amount of bicycle parking is required, it can be waived.  
 
In response to a question from Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about a statement in the submitted 
materials stating that the savings from using city owned land will be offset by other costs; Iram Farooq 
explained that the cost differential, if the site is actually being used, which it is in most cases, then that 
adds to site acquisition costs. 
 
In response to a question by Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about the average land acquisition cost 
by neighborhood, Iram Farooq explained that the averages were created with the help of data from the 
Assessing Department.  She states that the Assessing Department felt pretty strongly that analysis should 
not go too far back in terms of number of years because the prices in Cambridge change so rapidly. 
 
Christopher Cotter, Housing Director, explained that the chart shows that costs for site acquisition are out 
of reach for a feasible project. The takeaway is that if the city wants to have feasible development 
opportunities for affordable housing builders across the city, the city needs to look at a way that to help 
them understand what is feasible and to give them the advantage. The underlying idea of the overlay is 
that if they can build denser projects, they can then spread those land costs over more units to a point 
where projects are financially feasible. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Quinton Zondervan about the relationship between parking and 
the cost of an Affordable Housing project; Iram Farooq explained that existing parking that is currently on 
the surface would need to be accommodated, below grade, if deemed to be necessary.  The revenue 
generated by public parking, at current pricing, would not offset the cost of underground construction. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he did want to build on city owned parking garages. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Patricia Nolan about why the average land acquisition costs did 
not factor in the cost of the building, Christopher Cotter explained that whether there is a building on the 
site or not, the analysis is based on the price per buildable unit under the zoning to determine if the site is 
feasible opportunity. 
 
Iram Farooq added that an existing building may not need to be removed but there would be significant 
renovations costs. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Dennis Carlone, Jeffrey Roberts explained that within 35 feet 
of the rear property line, the building would need to step down from a maximum of six stories to a 
maximum of four stories. If the building were fully within the taller height districts, then the building 
could be six stories. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone asked that  next time the city show the existing zoning condition for the 
district a pretty.

Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, stated that there is not a general rule about the step 
down in the city, there are some transition requirements in certain zoning districts.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone  stated that in a low-density zone, there could be facades that have windows in 
them that could have wall 10 and a half feet away.  He felt that there should be a limit on the size of 
outdoor storage structures that could be in the back yard. He expressed concern about the lack of 
implementation language for design guidelines in the proposed ordinance. 
 
Iram Farooq explained that all of these projects work with the Affordable Housing Trust from as a 
financing entity. There is also accountability for each of these projects through the housing staff who 
work with developers from design through construction.  She also explained that AHO is not removing 
any teeth that the design review for affordable housing buildings currently.  
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that it is odd that city guidelines for retail glass is 70 percent but under 
the proposed ordinance the guideline goes from 70 percent to 30 percent.  
 
Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon moved to amend the petition with language that is attached to the minutes as 
a communication. 
 
Councillor Timothy Toomey stated that he supported the proposed amendment based on the positive 
impact that is will have on East Cambridge in terms of having commercial development on the first floor 
and residential development on the higher floors. 
 
Councillor Patricia Nolan stated that, if passed that, the Overlay will bring more people to the 
neighborhoods and those people will be interested in these ground floor retail establishments.  She stated 
that she would support a larger percentage of ground floor retail. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Nolan, Vice Mayor Mallon explained that 50 percent was the 
number that the council came to last term in agreement with the affordable housing builders and 
advocates.  She was not opposed to increasing the percentage. 
 
Councillor Zondervan expressed concern that the 50 percent first-floor retail space requirement is not 
clearly defined. 
 
Councillor McGovern  stated that he supported the amendment.  He stated that there have been several 
discussion with stakeholders to get to 50 percent.  He stated that he could not support increasing the 
percentage. 
 
Councillor Dennis Carlone stated that may be the city could provide additional fund to help developers 
provide ground floor retail 
 
Mayor Siddiqui stated that she was generally favorable of Vice Mayo Mallon’s amendment.  She did not 
believe that the percentage needed to be higher than 50 percent. 
 
Councillor Marc McGovern  stated that the City could provide funding, but it should not be in the zoning. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  stated that he supports the proposed amendment as presented. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon  stated that the city could provide additional funds in a concurrent process.  She 
stated that many Affordable Housing developers have built retail space in prior projects, so they are 
familiar with this construction.  She wanted to vote on the amendment as presented.

In response to a question from Councillor Dennis Carlone,  Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and 
Development, explained that frontage typically refers to the frontage along the entire lot.  
 
In response to questions from Councillor Carlone and Vice Mayor Mallon, Jeffrey Roberts, Director of 
Zoning and Development explained that the intent of the languages was to provide for retail on a site that 
had retail or has or has contained retail at any point within the past two years. If the space were simply 
vacant, because six months ago, business moved out, and there might have been another business moving 
in, that would count under this provision. But if a space were completely vacant for two years preceding 
the development that would not necessarily be counted.  
 
He further explained that where there is maybe one space that's taken in a building that has a row of retail 
establishments, then the provision would still apply. If there is some retail existing on the site, then this 
provision would still apply. It would not be one vacancy that would cause it not to apply. Two years tends 
to be the standard time period for what is known as abandonment.  
 
Councillor Carlone moved to 
suspend the rules to extend 
meeting to 7:30 PM

In response to a question from Councillor Toomey, Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, 
explained that under current zoning, for any development, there would not be a requirement to build new 
retail or replace retail in that district, under the Affordable Housing overlay, if the building permit were 
sought within two years of the discontinuation of the previous retail use, then this requirement would kick 
in and there would have to be some retail or other non-residential active space provided. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon  moved to amend  her proposed amendment by replacing it with the following 
language: 
 
(e) Ground Stories shall be designed to accommodate at least one space, with a total frontage equaling at 
least fifty percent (50%) of the existing retail frontage, for an active non-residential use, which may 
include retail or consumer establishments as well as social service facilities supporting the mission of the 
owner of the AHO Project, on sites that are located in a Business base zoning district, and where the 
project site contains or has contained a retail and or consumer service use at any point within the past two 
years prior to application for a building permit for an AHO Project. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that the council should be very precise and say that it's 50% of the existing 
retail frontage of the site. 
 
Councillor McGovern  that the proposed amendment to amend is clear.

between eighty and one hundred of the area median income.  The amendment would also allow 
individuals who do not meet those requirements to fill units are empty, were there is no waitlist. 
 
Christopher Cotter explained that funding middle-income units is a challenge and the demand for those 
units is also challenging. Low- and moderate-income applicants vastly outnumber the middle-income 
applicants for the units that are available.  Typical funding sources that affordable housing builders to 
access for the low- and moderate-income housing, are not available on an ongoing basis to fund middle 
income housing. That could prevent creating housing through the overlay in a situation where the 
developer is up against a required 20% ratio.  He is concerned about the challenge of financing middle-
income units.  
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he understood the financial predicament of middle-income households 
but that this zoning overlay was not the place to address this issue.  He stated that he would not support 
this amendment. 
 
Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler  stated that he could not support the proposed amendment from 
Councillor Nolan. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that  appreciated that intent but could not support the proposed amendment. 
 
Councillor Nolan’s motion to 
amend section 11.207.3 failed by 
the following roll call vote: 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon 
Councillor McGovern 
Councillor Nolan 
Councillor Simmons 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler 
Councillor Toomey 
Councillor Zondervan 
Mayor Siddiqui 
Councillor Carlone 
 
With regard to the amendment to section 11.207.11(b), Councillor Nolan explained that the amendment 
adds specific measurable targets to the ordinance. The goals of the Overlay are several but the main two 
are to increase the number of affordable units and to have greater geographic just dispersity around the 
city. The amendment set a goal of 15 to 20 units more than what was estimated by Community 
Development.  She stated that the review should be conducted every four years. 
 
Councillor McGovern  stated that he agreed with having some goals, but he did not want to  set this up for 
failure if the goals are not met. He wanted Councillor Nolan to clarify the number of units expected in her 
proposed goals. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon  stated that it felt unusual to have these goals in a zoning documents.  She felt the 
language in the proposed amendment should be codified in some other document. 
 
Iram Farooq stated that having a numerical target for production in zoning is a really challenging. She 
explained that the city cannot predict market conditions in the future, so it is hard to put hard numbers on

the amount of new buildings in the zoning ordinance.  She stated these numbers could be put in the 
Housing Trust’s goals or the city council goals. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler moved to amend Councillor Nolan's proposed amendment to section 
11.207.11(b) to read as follows: 
(b)  Four-Year Progress Review. Four (4) years after ordination, CDD shall provide to the City Council, 
Planning Board and the Affordable Housing Trust, for its review, a report that assesses the effectiveness 
of the Affordable Housing Overlay in increasing the number of affordable housing units in the city, unless 
funding increases or decreases, and recognizing that progress toward affordable housing goals are 
also influenced by other factors such as economic conditions and state and federal policy changes, 
this number shall include a non-binding goal of at least 15-20 units per year built on average 
distributing affordable housing across City neighborhoods with at least 20% of units built under this 
ordinance in areas of the city with the lowest percent of current affordable units, and serving the housing 
needs of residents. The report shall also assess the effectiveness of the Advisory Design Consultation 
Procedure in gathering meaningful input from community members and the Planning Board and shaping 
AHO Projects to be consistent with the stated Design Objectives. The report shall evaluate the success of 
the Affordable Housing Overlay in balancing the goal of increasing affordable housing with other City 
planning considerations such as urban form, neighborhood character, environment, and mobility. The 
report shall discuss citywide outcomes as well as site-specific outcomes. 
 
Councillor Carlone agreed that these goals would be better placed in the City Council goals. 
 
Councillor Zondervan agreed that the goals should be included in the zoning document.  He stated that he 
was not in favor of the amendment. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone, Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, 
stated that he was not aware of zoning that specified a numerical goal for units created.

Cambridge, by inserting a new section 11.207, AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
OVERLAY, to read as follows: 
11.207.1        Purpose and Intent  
The  purpose  of  this  Section  is  to  promote  the  public  good  by 
supporting  the  development  of  housing  that  is  affordable  to 
households earning up to 100% of area median income. The intent 
of this Section is to allow incremental increases in density, limited 
increases  in  height,  and  relaxation  of  certain  other  zoning 
limitations for residential developments in which all units are made 
permanently affordable to households earning up to 100% of area 
median  income  (referred  to  as  “AHO  Projects,”  as  defined  in 
Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance); to incentivize the reuse of 
existing  buildings  in  order  to  create  AHO  Projects  that  are  more 
compatible  with  established  neighborhood  character;  to  promote 
the city’s urban design objectives in Section 19.30 of this Zoning 
Ordinance  while  enabling  AHO  Projects  to  be  permitted  as-of-
right,  subject 
to  non-binding  advisory  design  consultation 
procedures  that  follow  all  design  objectives  set  forth  within  this 
Zoning  Ordinance  and  the  results  of  the  design  review  process 
shall be provided to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust; and 
to  apply  such  standards  throughout  the  City,  to  promote  city 
planning goals of achieving greater socioeconomic diversity and a 
more equitable distribution of affordable housing citywide.

for  an  AHO  Project  or  on  an  adjacent  lot  in  common 
ownership or under common control. 
Notwithstanding  Section  6.107.5,  up  to  20  long-term 
bicycle  parking  spaces  may  be  designed  to  meet  the 
requirements  for  Short-Term  Bicycle  Parking  Spaces,  so 
long  as  they  are  covered  from  above  to  be  protected  from 
precipitation. 
The  requirement  for  short-term  bicycle  parking  shall  be 
waived where only four of fewer short-term bicycle parking 
spaces would otherwise be required. 
The  number  of  required  bicycle  parking  spaces  shall  be 
reduced by half, up to a maximum reduction of 28 spaces, 
where  a  standard-size  (19-dock)  Public  Bicycle  Sharing

superseded by the following standards for an AHO Project. 
The  following  design  standards  shall  apply  to  new 
construction and to additions to existing structures. Except 
as otherwise provided, an existing building that is altered or 
moved  to  accommodate  an  AHO  Project  shall  not  be 
subject  to  the  following  standards,  provided  that  such 
alterations  do  not  create  a  condition  that  is  in  greater 
nonconformance  with  such  standards  than  the  existing 
condition. 

Site Design and Arrangement 

The  area  directly  between  the  front  lot  line  and  the 
principal wall plane of the building nearest to the front lot 
line  shall  consist  of  any  combination  of  landscaped  area, 
hardscaped  area  accessible  to  pedestrians  and  bicyclists, 
and  usable  spaces  such  as  uncovered  porches,  patios,  or 
balconies.  Parking  shall  not  be  located  within  such  area,

Advisory Design Consultation Procedure 

11.207.8 
Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO 
Project  shall  comply  with  the  following  procedure,  which  is 
intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and 
staff input into the design of the project. 
(a) 

to  guide 

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance 
the  City’s  desired  outcomes  for  the  form  and  character  of 
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable  housing  units,  AHO  Projects  are  permitted  to 
have  a  greater  height,  scale,  and  density  than  other 
developments  permitted  by the zoning  for a given district. 
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that 
are  compatible  with  the  existing  neighborhood  context  or 
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 
The  City’s  “Design  Guidelines  for  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay,” along with other design objectives and guidelines 
established  for  the  part  of  the  city  in  which  the  AHO 
Project  is  located,  are  intended  to  inform  the  design  of 
AHO  Projects  and 
the  Planning  Board’s 
consultation  and  report  as  set  forth  below.  It  is  intended 
that  designers  of  AHO  Projects,  City  staff,  the  Planning 
Board,  and  the  general  public  will  be  open  to  creative 
variations  from  any  detailed  provisions  set  forth  in  such 
objectives  and  guidelines  as  long  as  the  core  values 
expressed are being served. 
At  least  two  community  meetings  shall  be  scheduled  at  a 
time  and  location  that  is  convenient  to  residents  in 
proximity to the project site. The Community Development 
Department  (CDD)  shall  be  notified  of  the  time  and 
location  of  such  meetings,  and  shall  give  notification  to 
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or 
private  street  or  way,  and  abutters  to  the  abutters  within 
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which 
the  AHO  Project  is  proposed  and  to  any  individual  or 
organization  who  each  year  files  with  CDD  a  written 
request  for  such  notification,  or  to  any  other  individual  or 
organization CDD may wish to notify. 
(i) 

The purpose of the first community meeting shall be 
for the developer to share the site and street context 
analysis  with  neighborhood  residents  and  other 
interested  parties  prior  to  building  design,  and 
receive feedback from community members.

the 
required information in sufficient detail. All drawings shall 
be  drawn  to  scale,  shall  include  a  graphic  scale  and  north

The Planning Board shall evaluate the proposal for general 
compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  Section,  for 
consistency with City development guidelines prepared for 
the  proposal  area  and 
the  “Design  Guidelines  for 
Affordable Housing Overlay,” for appropriateness in terms

development  activities  in  the  vicinity,  and  for  consistency 
with  the  Citywide  Urban  Design  Objectives  set  forth  in 
Section 19.30. The Board may also suggest specific project 
adjustments  and  alterations  to  further  the  purposes  of  this 
Ordinance.  The  Board  shall  communicate  its  findings  in  a 
written report provided to the developer and to CDD within 
20 days of the design consultation. 
The  developer  may  then  make  revisions  to  the  design,  in 
consultation with CDD staff, and shall submit a revised set 
of  documents  along  with  a  narrative  summary  of  the 
Planning Board’s comments and changes made in response 
to those comments. 
The  Planning  Board  shall  review  and  discuss  the  revised 
documents at a second design consultation meeting, which 
shall  proceed  in  accordance  with  Paragraphs  (c)  and  (d) 
above.  Following  the  second  design  consultation,  the 
Planning Board may submit a revised report and either the 
revised report or if there are no  revisions the initial  report 
shall  become  the  final  report  (the  “Final  Report”).  Any 
additional  design  consultations  to  review  further  revisions 
may occur only  at the discretion and on the request of the 
developer or the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust. 
The  Final  Report  from  the  Planning  Board  shall  be 
provided  to  the  Superintendent  of  Buildings  to  certify 
compliance with the procedures set forth herein. 

Implementation of Affordable Housing Overlay 

The  City  Manager  shall  have  the  authority  to  promulgate 
regulations for the implementation of the provisions of this 
Section  11.207.  There  shall  be  a  sixty-day  review  period, 
including a public meeting, to receive public comments on 
draft regulations before final promulgation. 
The  Community  Development  Department  may  develop 
standards, design guidelines, and procedures appropriate to 
and  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  this  Sections  11.207 
and the above regulations. 

Enforcement of Affordable Housing Overlay 

11.207.10 
The Community Development Department shall certify in writing 
to the Superintendent of Buildings that all applicable provisions of 
this Section have been met before issuance of any building permit 
for  any  AHO  Project,  and  shall  further  certify  in  writing  to  the 
Superintendent of Buildings that all documents have been filed and 
all  actions  taken  necessary  to  fulfill  the  requirements  of  this 
Section before the issuance of any certificate of occupancy for any 
such project.

Review of Affordable Housing Overlay 

Annual Report. CDD shall provide an annual status report 
to  the  City  Council,  beginning  eighteen  (18)  months  after 
ordination and continuing every year thereafter. The report 
shall contain the following information:  
(i) 

List  of  sites  considered  for  affordable  housing 
development  under 
the  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay,  to  the  extent  known  by  CDD,  including 
site  location,  actions  taken  to  initiate  an  AHO 
Project, and site status; 
Description  of  each  AHO  Project  underway  or 
completed, including site location, number of units, 
unit  types  (number  of  bedrooms),  tenure,  and 
project status; and 

(ii) 

(iii)  Number of residents served by AHO Projects. 
Five-Year Progress Review. Five (5) years after ordination, 
CDD shall provide to the City Council, Planning Board and 
the  Affordable  Housing  Trust,  for  its  review,  a  report  that 
assesses  the  effectiveness  of  the  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay  in  increasing  the  number  of  affordable  housing 
units in the city, distributing affordable housing across City 
neighborhoods, and serving the housing needs of residents. 
The  report  shall  also  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the 
Advisory  Design  Consultation  Procedure  in  gathering 
meaningful  input  from  community  members  and  the 
Planning Board and shaping AHO Projects to be consistent 
with the stated Design Objectives. The report shall evaluate 
the success of the Affordable Housing Overlay in balancing 
the  goal  of  increasing  affordable  housing  with  other  City 
planning considerations such as urban form, neighborhood 
character,  environment,  and  mobility.  The  report  shall 
discuss  citywide  outcomes  as  well  as  site-specific 
outcomes.

Re: Memo Re City Manager’s Contract 

 
Dear Mr. Wilson:  
 
 
I  am  submitting  this  letter  for  inclusion  on  the  September  14,  2020  City  Council  meeting 
agenda.  In  my  role  as  Chair  of  the  Government  Rules  and  Operations  Committee,  I  have  been 
authorized by the committee to hold direct conversations with City Manager Louis A. DePasquale to 
discuss the possibility of extending his contract with the City. These discussions having taken place, I 
am now moving to make the following recommendation to the City Council: I propose that the City 
Council offer to extend the City Manager’s contract to Mr. DePasquale for a period of 18 months, 
with a 2.5 percent cost of living adjustment at signing. The contract would begin on January 9, 2021 
and would run through July 5, 2022. 
 
 
 
  
   
 

I thank my colleagues for their attention to and consideration of this matter.  

Sincerely,  

__________________________

▪  Discussing the work of Educator Collaboratives and educator tools 

 
Through these meetings, we have engaged with scholars, families, educators, as well as curriculum and 
medical experts to help inform CPSD in their planning. My colleagues and I approved the 
’Superintendents proposed reopening model 
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uScugV7Q4VKaPtK1dHRi4Nf5d5aEfs40_E_R8N8mwfY/edit> 
with seven additional requirements attached. We want to make sure that we represent the diversity of 
perspectives in our community, with safety, equity, and high-quality learning as our guiding lights. 
 
The Plan, as adopted, is not a final decision to return in-person as we must meet the requirements. Once 
we are able to safely reopen our buildings, families of our JK-3 learners, who appear to be at a lower risk 
of infection, as well as families of our students with specialized needs, will be the first to have an in-
person option available to them.  
 
On August 18th, our timeline was revised <https://www.cpsd.us/district_news/revised_timeline> to delay 
the start of in-person learning (for our opted-in scholars) until October 13th in order to provide more time 
for addressing the complex staffing and scheduling decisions, necessary professional development, and 
ensuring that the School Committee’s contingencies are met. We are prepared to continue adapting as 
necessary, as we follow the emerging public health data. 
 
In our August 20th Special Meeting, Superintendent Salim shared with us the FY21 budget implications of 
our COVID-19 response 
<https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sx4VwpOc6osDFFNwn7MNd2lkNwujldK5NawVaMTjPm0/e
dit>. CPSD estimates that the additional health and safety measures (facilities, transportation, testing and 
health assistance), technology, project planning, staff, summer work, and materials will cost between 
$13.5 million to $17.3 million (when taking into account the $6.8 million we have from state and federal 
grants, FY21 reallocations/savings, and additional City funding).  
 
In my last communication, I mentioned that I had been in many conversations with the City Manager, 
Superintendent, Broad Institute, and Cambridge Public Health Department to advocate for the 
implementation of frequent COVID-19 surveillance testing in our school community. I am proud to share 
that CPSD will be the first school district in Massachusetts providing all school staff working in-person 
with free COVID-19 testing twice per week, through a partnership with the Broad Institute. We will also 
be implementing testing for students with the help of the Cambridge Public Health Department and I will 
share those details with you as soon as they are available.  
 
I also want to provide some information about the Family Resource Fairs that my Office has been 
working to host with CPSD and the School Committee. We began these Fairs on Saturday, August 22nd at 
the Pisani Center and 808 Memorial Drive to assist families with their back-to-school enrollment forms. 
We will be continuing these safe and socially-distanced in-person events every Saturday from 10:00 AM 

Packet Pg. 1048

8.2

to 12:00 PM through September. Each event will have interpreters, a specific focus, and targeted 
outreach. Our next Fair 
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JUCEwi_kU_K7p_fFWUOloudAdluSVuLs/view?usp=sharing> will be 
for families of scholars in grades JK-1 held outside the King Open School on Saturday, September 12th. 
On Saturday, September 19th, we will have a Fair outside the Peabody School and our final one will be on 
Saturday, September 19th outside the Haggerty School. More details to come.   
 
Our upcoming School Committee meetings are as follows: 

•  September 10th, 2020 

o  School Climate Subcommittee Meeting | 6:00 PM 

▪  Discussing social emotional and mental health supports for CPSD scholars 

•  September 15th, 2020 

o  Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM 

 

Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.

decisions, necessary professional development, and ensuring that the School Committee’s contingencies 
are met. We are prepared to continue adapting as necessary, as we follow the emerging public health data. 
 
In our August 20th Special Meeting, Superintendent Salim shared with us the FY21 budget implications of 
our  COVID-19  response.  CPSD  estimates  that  the  additional  health  and  safety  measures  (facilities, 
transportation,  testing  and  health  assistance),  technology,  project  planning,  staff,  summer  work,  and 
materials will cost between $13.5 million to $17.3 million (when taking into account the $6.8 million we 
have from state and federal grants, FY21 reallocations/savings, and additional City funding).  
 
In  my  last  communication,  I  mentioned  that  I  had  been  in  many  conversations  with  the  City  Manager, 
Superintendent,  Broad  Institute,  and  Cambridge  Public  Health  Department  to  advocate  for  the 
implementation of frequent COVID-19 surveillance testing in our school community. I am proud to share

that CPSD will be the first school district in Massachusetts providing all school staff working in-person 
with free COVID-19 testing twice per week, through a partnership with the Broad Institute. We will also 
be implementing testing for students with the help of the Cambridge Public Health Department and I will 
share those details with you as soon as they are available.  
 
I also want to provide some information about the Family Resource Fairs that my Office has been working 
to host with CPSD and the School Committee. We began these Fairs on Saturday, August 22nd at the Pisani 
Center and 808 Memorial Drive to assist families with their back-to-school enrollment forms. We will be 
continuing these safe and socially-distanced in-person events every Saturday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM 
through September. Each event will have interpreters, a specific focus, and targeted outreach. Our next Fair 
will be for families of scholars in grades JK-1 held outside the King Open School on Saturday, September 
12th. On Saturday, September 19th, we will have a Fair outside the Peabody School and our final one will 
be on Saturday, September 19th outside the Haggerty School. More details to come.   
 
Our upcoming School Committee meetings are as follows: 

•  September 10th, 2020 

o  School Climate Subcommittee Meeting | 6:00 PM 

▪  Discussing social emotional and mental health supports for CPSD scholars 

•  September 15th, 2020 

o  Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM 

 

Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.  

Respectfully, 

Sumbul Siddiqui
