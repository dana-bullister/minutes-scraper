Virtual Meeting 

Overview 

The Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) will meet to advance its purpose act on the Guiding 
Principles for Community Benefits Funding set forth in the Community Needs Assessment. 

I.  Emergency Grants: Status, Updates, & Discussion 
 

CBAC Discussion: 

•  An applicant to the emergency grant that was deemed ineligible petitioned to have CBAC reconsider the 
application. The reason for ineligibility was that the proposal was to provide support to businesses, while 
the grant was focused on supporting residents. 

•  After reviewing the original application, associated emails, and additional correspondence and comments, 
CBAC affirmed its original decision not to fund this application by a vote of: Yes – 8, No – 2, Abstain – 1 

 
Status Update:  
•  Of 106 approved grantees, 91 grant agreements have been received, and we are in contact with all 
• 

Initial payments of $6000 issued to 70 grantees, 15 will be issued in the next few days, and 8 are in varying 
stages of sign off 

II.  Implementation Grants 
 

Where are we going?  
DRAFT of possible activities & timeline:  
SEPTEMBER 

•  Communications from CBAC to 
reconnect, identify forthcoming 
evaluation tools 

•  HRiA evaluation tools, each to be 
completed by one person at each 
organization in a partnership: 
•  Partner Tool – Social 
Network Survey  

•  Organizational Capacity 

Survey  

 

 

OCTOBER 

•  Check-in meeting between 
CBAC and each partnership 
•  Partnerships submit 6-month 

report to CBAC (including basic 
outputs to date)  

NOVEMBER – DECEMBER 
•  CBAC host convening with all 

partnerships (including review 
of evaluation data, if 
available?) 

CBAC Discussion:  
•  Has HRiA rethought evaluation and questions within COVID?  

o  Yes, we did scale back, not asking for family level data  
o  Goals with Partnerships – systemic change through Partnerships 
o  Wrong to expect, based on the logic model, that partnerships wouldn’t be able to affect systemic 

change, regardless of pandemic  

• 

Evaluation tools:  

City of Cambridge                                                                                                                                                                    cambridgema.gov

o  Why questions do not sit well with me – missing reality of context, we know nonprofits are chronically 

underfunded, what do we expect them to impact at systems level vs. what our role as CBAC/ City is?  

o  Question, “is this organization reliable?” – what does that mean in context of COVID?  
o  Whether we like specific questions, important to understand where nonprofit organizations are in the 

moment, understand baseline and what is happening with partners right now, in the moment we are in 

o  Acknowledge challenge of standard scale  

•  Make sure we communicate appropriately so organizations do not feel there is more pressure on them 
• 

Think about how we explain and engage others about role that CBAC plays, and history of developers’ fees that 
became Community Benefits Funds; be able to clarify why this innovative approach is important – promote 
better and clearer understanding among developers  

•  What is it we want to say with Partnerships – 

o  At end of this, we will have deeper understanding of how address needs of people living in Cambridge 
o  Soften this process – send 2 separate letters 
o  Thoughtfulness in articulating importance of baseline data and meeting with partnerships 
o  Acknowledging how difficult a time this is for nonprofit organizations  
o  Get more qualitative/ anecdotal data about where partnerships are 

•  How will Partnerships benefit from CBAC bringing Partnerships together? What is the purpose of coming 

together?  

•  What else can we do and what role can we play?  
 
CBAC Draft Communications to Partnerships:  
•  Very heavy on evaluation and related timeline – include more about what CBAC role is 
•  Divide it into two separate communications/letters – CBAC relationship with Partnerships and evaluation/ 

evaluation tools  

•  Articulate, in a short paragraph, what CBAC role is – and, what is our role/power as a committee –  

o  Consider language of ordinance  
o  Hoping to learn from nonprofit organizations what they need to serve residents 
o  Vision from logic model – improve systems and processes on behalf of Cambridge residents  
o  Not promising anything we cannot deliver  
o  We should clarify CBAC’s role/power 

• 

Include 3 things in CBAC communication:   

o  Learn what is going on and getting sense of state of affairs for each Partnership 
o  Start evaluation of implementation to inform them and us – starting with partnerships and systems level  
o  Developing ways over time to help them and learn from each other
