          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  The appointed 

hour having arrived, we're going to get started.  This is 

the February 4 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.   

          As a reminder to everyone, this meeting is being 

audio and visually recorded, and we will start off this 

evening with an Update from Community Development.           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Tonight's 

agenda is this is our annual Town Gown Report meeting, and 

the sequence of presentations tonight will be Harvard, 

followed by MIT, and then Lesley University.  As you know, 

we rotate them every year, so that's this year's sequence. 

          But before we dive into that, Cliff Cook, who is 

our Senior Planning Information Editor, will do a summary, 

which he's done a couple years prior as well, so I think the 

Board found that instructive.  So we could repeat that.  The

Board's next meeting will be February 11, when we will have 

some public hearings.   

          The first is in relation to the zoning petition to 

update the Incentive Zoning Ordinance with the amended 

amount, following the Nexus study that was completed in 

December. 

Ave project. 

          The second item is a special permit hearing, 434-

436 Hampshire Street, and then it will be followed by a 

continued discussion, a continued hearing on the 541 Mass 

          The Board's following meeting after that will be 

February 25.  We think that we might be able to cancel the 

eighteenth, unless some of these items have to carry over.  

So keep your fingers crossed. 

          And on February 25, we have a hearing on 75109 -- 

115 Smith Place, a special permit.  and then also a special 

permit for 1686 Mass Ave, which is a continued hearing, and 

possibly some design updates for you. 

          In terms of updates from the City Council, the 

Council's Ordinance Committee met last Thursday to discuss 

the Harvard Square Zoning Petition.  And they have made a 

favorable recommendation and sent it forward to the full

Council.   

          They did make us -- they accepted most of the 

Board's amendments.  They did make one further change to 

limit some of the increased density to the Business B 

district, and also have talked about writing up further, 

more detailed criteria that would assist the Board per your 

request in decision-making when special permits come your 

way. 

changes. 

          In terms of upcoming hearings, the Ordinance 

Committee will take up the Alexandria Grand Junction 

Petition on February 5. 

          And then February 12 they will be taking up the -- 

they will hold their hearing on the Incentive Ordinance 

          And then February 18, which might not be a 

Planning Board night, they will have a hearing on the 

definition of "family" in the zoning ordinance, which will 

be coming to the Planning Board in March.  So that's it for 

me.  Thank you very much.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Before we 

turn to the Town Gown Reports, we do have minutes for 

adoption for January 14 and 21, which have been reviewed by 

6

the Board.  Do I have a motion to accept the minutes?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  So moved.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Second?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All those in favor?  

          THE BOARD:  Aye.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   

          [ All vote YES ]   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Then with that, Cliff, why don't we turn it over to you for 

the summary update before we go to the individual reports?  

          CLIFF COOK:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  All right.  

So just before we get started, all the data you will see 

here tonight has come from 20 years' worth of Town Gown 

Reports.   

          We're looking at time series data, it's not going 

to be a snapshot of what the most recent information is.  

The schools, I'm sure, will fill us in on that.  We're 

looking across the to the primary reporting categories -- 

employees, students, facilities, housing, taxes and fees.   

          Initially, it took the schools a couple years to 

establish their procedures and clarify definitions.  So by

the year 2000, we think that we had fully comparable data 

school to school and from year to year.  But that's why 

we're not looking at information prior to that date. 

          A quick history for those of you who are not 

familiar with Town Gown.  1991 Mayor's report and university 

community relationships, almost 30 years ago now, 

established the basis for this reporting process.  In 1997, 

the first official reports were delivered by Cambridge 

College, Harvard, Lesley, and MIT.   

          A few events since then:  In 1998, Lesley merged 

with the Art Institute of Boston. In 2011 it became Lesley 

University.   

Report.   

          In 2014, Hult International School of Business, 

which is associated with EF, filed their first Town Gown 

          And in 2016, Cambridge College filed their last 

Town Gown Report before they moved to Charlestown. 

          The really notable story here is that this has 

been one of progressive growth throughout the period, with 

really very few hiccups.  While this certainly has presented 

challenges at times, as I think many of us know, they've 

been consistently ones of growth and not ones of decline.  I

think it's -- in some respects, Cambridge has been fortunate 

to face these kinds of problems and not the other. 

          That said, with a couple of exceptions, the rate 

of change has slowed down over the last couple of years, 

perhaps as a result of the departure of Cambridge College 

and the emergence of Hult.  We're kind of getting back to 

where we were a couple years ago, in many respects.   

          So staff and faculty employed, these are all in 

FTEs -- Full Time Equivalents -- which allow us to have 

comparable numbers from school to school.  

          Over the period, there was an absolute increase of 

almost 50 percent to 23.5 thousand from 16,000. 90 percent 

of the growth has been staff.  The compound rate of change 

has been about 2.1 percent per year overall, 2.2 percent for 

staff, 1.5 percent for faculty. 

          The departure of Cambridge College really had very 

little effect on these rates, and also, little long-lasting 

effects and recessions or outsourcing. 

          Staff and faculty residing in Cambridge:  So, 

again, FTEs, the change over the period has been about 3400 

people -- FTEs, rather -- and there was a pretty rapid rate 

of increase initially -- in that way slowed, and after a

certain amount of time it has really plateaued since 2016. 

          The big increase is 2000 to 2008, much more 

incremental since the midsummer drops. 

          I am somewhat surprised we didn't see more of an 

increase in 2008 to 2013, when housing sales prices 

stagnated in the city, but on the other hand, rents were 

also rising through that period. 

          So the compound rate of change has been much more 

than the employee growth of 3.7 percent, versus I think it 

was 2.1 percent. 

          So in 2000, just as a standard of comparison, 3.3 

percent of the overall population were institutional 

employees, and by 2018, 5.8 percent of the population of the 

city were institutional employees.  So big increase there. 

          Postsecondary students -- so this covers the full 

range; full-time, part-time, in-degree program, not in-

degree program, night, day -- not every school offers every 

kind of option there, of course. 

          So about a third increase of the period.  Compound 

rate was about 1.5 percent.  The biggest growth is at 

Harvard, about 7000 students -- about a third increased.  

Though I think the majority of those were Extension School's

enrollments.                                        

          The actual highest rate of increase was Lesley, 

and I think that's in part because of the absorption of the 

Art Institute of Boston.  However, we think that Lesley may 

not have included all of their part-time students initially.  

So that may be a false positive.   

          MIT certainly had the slowest rate, no matter how 

you cut it -- about a 48 percent compound increase over the 

period of 1600 additional students over the 20-year period. 

          The departure of Cambridge College did kind of 

cause a little bit of a decline, as you can see -- sorry, I 

don't have a pointer -- but that's largely made up since 

then by the expansion of Hult and the expansion of the other 

schools. 

          So enrollment status -- and here those red bars I 

do call this out on a few places are recessionary years.  As 

you can see, recessions themselves tend to have very little 

effect on enrollment or employment, for that matter.   

          The effect tends to come later, which is not 

terribly surprising, as the effects from recessions filter 

from the business economy and to the border economy. 

          And the schools then react to declines in

enrollment, declines in revenue from various sources. 

          So in general, the greatest rate of change has 

been of grad students; out of a 4900 person increase, or 30 

percent, about 1.4 percent compound rate.   

          Overall increases: Undergraduates increased by 0.7 

percent.  Nondegree students actually increased at a much 

greater rate.  They went up 83 percent, but they start from 

a fairly low base. 

          Now, there's a predicated demographic drop-off in 

high school graduations starting in 2025.  So it will be 

interesting to see how these numbers evolve after that 

point. 

          Postdoctoral Fellows, we just started asking for 

this data in 2014.  The schools have made the point that 

enrollment will swing back and forth between Postdoctoral 

Fellows and graduate students, depending on the stability of 

funding sources.   

          That said, there really has not been a whole lot 

of change in the number of Postdoctoral Fellows.  They've 

been around 2500 give or take, a little bit every year. 

          Students residing in Cambridge:  So the yellow bar 

is off-campus housing, the blue bars are either on-campus or 

12

affiliated housing, where the schools may choose to define 

that.  So there was an increase from 18.2 to 23.5,000 

students over the period, about 5200 people, 29 percent 

increase.   

          So 1.3 percent compound rate in students living in 

Cambridge, compared to 1.8 percent increase from the student 

body overall, and 1.1 percent for the track students, which 

is probably the most important comparison here. 

          Focusing in on institution-owned housing alone, 

there is an increase of about 2100 students, about 0.7 

percent compounded.  There was -- there was actually in the 

last couple of years you started to see some more -- other 

increases of the 350 in just the last two years.   

          39 percent of the growth of students living in 

Cambridge has taken place on campus.  However, despite best 

efforts, that rate of increase has not really kept up with 

the rate of increase in the degree-seeking student body.   

          And what we've seen is the rate -- the percentage 

of students that are housed on campus has dropped from 50 

percent to 46 percent, which was a negative compound rate of 

0.4, versus the growth rate of 1.1.  So things are heading 

in not quite the right direction.

          There are some signs of change in the horizon now.  

MIT will be opening a larger replacement dormitory for 

Eastgate in the next year or two.   

          And at some point, Harvard will probably -- well, 

hopefully -- I'm sure, they think this will finish their 

House Renewal Program, which will allow them to move all 

their undergraduates back in the dormitories, and free up 

some more of their affiliate housing for graduate students.  

          So looking a few years out, I think we'll see some 

improvements.  And there is also, I believe, plans to be 

adding graduate student housing at Volpe, if I recall 

correctly, and that will make another effect here. 

          So students residing off campus, that's one of the 

places we've seen some pretty steady increases the last few 

years.  So because the schools haven't been able to meet the 

needs or desires of their students -- they do still want to 

live in Cambridge -- they have the resources, they'll live 

off campus. 

          So 3200 more students are housed off-campus now 

than in 2000.  That's an annualized rate of increase of 3.3 

percent.  And 2000 students, or 3.7 percent of the total 

population by 2018, there were 5.6 percent.  So if you throw

in employees, in 2000, affiliates were roughly 7 percent of 

the population living in Cambridge, and now there are over 

10.   

          If we were to assume students take up -- two 

students -- there's two students to a unit, which may or may 

not be the case.  In 2000, students would have occupied 

about 4.2 percent of the housing stock, and they now 

probably occupy closer to 6 percent.   

          Education -- gross floor area, not a lot of change 

in recent years; fairly stable both in the taxable and 

nontaxable areas for land-owned.  There's just a map, which 

we have another -- a link to on our website, which shows all 

the institution property, both taxable and nontaxable 

investment and institutional use throughout Cambridge 

through all the various schools. 

          Payments to the city: This is one place we've 

certainly seen some growth, and it's been popping up again 

and again.  And it's worth noting that MIT I think is either 

the largest or one of the largest taxpayers in the city.  

And that is reflected here with their growth in income, fee 

income from all the schools in the last few years. 

          7.8 percent compounded rate of increase.  I think 

15

if I could get that return on my retirement account, I might 

not be standing here today.  A pretty large increase over 

the last two years.  And then it's worth noting that the 

lion's share of this is MIT, 31 million of the 97 million 

reported in 2019. Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do folks have 

questions for Cliff?  Corinne, do you want to start us out?          

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you, Mr. Cook.  My 

question is about the erosion of the tax base.  In the 

summary that you've given us, I see that we have 490 acres 

of land owned by the employee -- 374 acres are tax exempt?    

          CLIFF COOK:  Yes.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Can you tell us what the bill 

would be if all of that acreage was taxable?   

          CLIFF COOK:  I'm afraid I don't have access to 

that information.  Sorry I don't know.            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Is that something that could be 

provided to the Planning Board at our next meeting?      

          CLIFF COOK:  I'll point -- turn to Iram for an 

answer there.             

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Madam Chair, through you it's 

challenging -- that is -- what's it the tax that the city is

not getting is essentially assessing information.  So it 

will be -- I'm not sure that you can keep records that way.  

          The city has pilot agreements of -- 30 long-term 

pilot agreements with both Harvard and MIT that essentially 

is a negotiating number that takes into account both the 

value that the universities bring to the city, and the 

notion that the land is not pre-taxed in their non-profit 

ventures. 

          And so, keeping that in account, it's not the full 

taxable, what we would get, but recognize that Cambridge is 

the city that it is in great measure because of the presence 

of the universities here.  So in terms of our -- the city's 

economic base, that is to a great extent by the university. 

          So it sort of recognizes all of those aspects, and 

then there was this -- these very long-term -- I think that 

Harvard's is 50 years, and MIT's is 30 or 40 long.  So these 

were negotiated a while back, and they have layers built 

into them.   

          So it is -- while one can kind of argue whether 

it's the perfect number or not, I think that is the 

mechanism through which the city thinks about what is the in 

lieu of tax payments.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And this may be a question then 

better for the CDD.  Those pilot agreements:   I know for 

example that Harvard's is coming up soon.  What is the 

process by which public input figures into those 

negotiations?             

          IRAM FAROOQ:  I am not sure that Harvard's is 

coming up soon.  I will take a look at that.  But these -- 

that is not something that is a public discussion.  It is 

something that is negotiated I believe through the City 

Manager's Office in conjunction with the City's Assessor, 

just as individuals --  

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And then I only know about one 

of the universities, but I don't know if this is true for 

all four of the universities.  But I read in one of the 

pilots that what determines whether a building is taxable or 

nontaxable is whether any educational activity occurs in a 

building.   

          So using an example of a building I won't name, 

but that I know of in one of the universities, it's a four-

floor building with three floors of offices, and one floor 

of dorms.  That would be considered completely not taxable.  

          But I wonder who makes the decision about whether

we tax by square feet versus by designating an entire 

building, nonprofit, when part of the team is not 

educational.      

          CLIFF COOK:  I think I --                     

          IRAM FAROOQ:  I think we are getting into -- 

again, a level of complexity that is -- that would not be 

appropriate for me to try to answer, because what you are 

asking is an assessing question.      

          CLIFF COOK:  Okay.             

          IRAM FAROOQ:  If you want, we can try to get some 

of the that rationale.  I'm not sure -- yeah, I'm not sure 

how it's broken down.  I do think that they're -- in most 

cases, there is consideration of what are the multiple uses 

in the building.  But I'll have to defer to the Assessor on 

that question.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yeah.  If there's any way we 

could get more information about that in the future, that 

would be great.  Thank you!  Those are all my questions.      

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Any other questions for Cliff?       

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  All right, sorry.  I also have a 

question about the pilots.  So do all of the universities 

that have pilot agreements calculate their pilot payments

the same?      

          CLIFF COOK:  I'm afraid I don't really know 

anything about the pilots.  I'd have to defer to Iram in 

that way.            

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Yeah, the pilot agreements were 

negotiated a while back, and they're not calculated by -- 

just like your tax bill is calculated by the Assessor.   

          This is -- these are essentially agreements that 

were made with assessing input on what might be the value of 

the property, coupled with what group is likely to occur, 

and what the benefits are and values are that the 

universities provide to the city, and something that between 

the City Manager's office, finance and assessing that 

calculus of what the actual dollar amounts were, those were 

calculated.   

          And like I said, they in some cases have 

escalators in them.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  If -- let's restate my question.  

So are formulas the same across the universities?  Or are 

they university specific?           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  They are university-specific.         

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay, thanks.  The second question

-- so going back to the last graph, do the payments that the 

city has received in the form of these pilots include 

inclined payments, like university-provided security or 

collection, or are these cash payments?      

          CLIFF COOK:  The pilot payments that are reported 

in Town Gown are cash payments.  There may be other services 

the universities provide, and other in-kind contributions, 

but those aren’t recorded here in a cash manner anyway.  

They are sometimes described in the reports, in qualitative 

form.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  And then one other question, the 

slide 14, the slide before this one --     

          CLIFF COOK:  Okay.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Is there a related chart of 

property acquisition over time?      

          CLIFF COOK:  Let's just get this up, it's a little 

bit easier to work with.  There's no specific chart of 

acquisition over time.  You can see there has been some 

increase.   

          It's worth noting, while there has been 

acquisition, there has also been the deaccessioning.  A 

number of properties have been sold off.  MIT's investment

group will buy and sell property periodically as well, and 

they -- I believe they are treated as an ordinary taxpayer 

in that regard. 

          We may have some records that go further back.  I 

don't have -- you're looking for where specify these changes 

occurred?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah, or is this particular chart 

provided by the university?  Like who's -- like, what's 

driving the increase, if anything?      

          CLIFF COOK:  I'd have to go back.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So for example, like --     

          CLIFF COOK:  Yeah.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  -- just over the past year it 

seems totally like there's MIT expansion, but not 

necessarily a lot of property expansion in Cambridge, so --     

          CLIFF COOK:  Yeah, I don't -- MIT didn't acquire 

any property in the last year, maybe not the last two years. 

I'm not sure which school is driving the expansion here; we 

can take a look at that.   

          One thing I might note is I think that some of the 

increase is due to Lesley acquiring the Episcopal Divinity 

School property, which we have not included in this.  They 

22

never reported or were part of the process.  So that added a 

number of acres along the way to this chart.  So that's 

probably the least responsible for the bump up you see 

around 2011 or so.  The increase is then. 

          What happened prior to that date, I'm not exactly 

sure.  We could take a look at that if we are directed to.          

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sorry, last question.      

          CLIFF COOK:  Sure.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So is there a related chart of the 

-- like -- taxable property in the city over time, or, like, 

the taxable -- yeah, the taxable property in the city over 

time, and whether that has changed?      

          CLIFF COOK:  The number of acres of taxable 

property?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  No, the value, or -- I mean, the 

acres or value, or literally any other chart that's --     

          CLIFF COOK:  I would have to defer to the 

Assessor's Office for that information.  I don't have access 

to that myself.  Because this is only one type of nontaxable 

use.  There are other types as well.  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.            

          IRAM FAROOQ:  So just one thing to add, and Cliff

said this, but I just want to underscore that when it says, 

"land owned by educational institutions" just to the point 

of this Divinity School properties, this is really 

summarizing land owned by the institutions --     

          CLIFF COOK:  They report.           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  -- reporting in Town Gown.      

          CLIFF COOK:  Okay.             

          IRAM FAROOQ:  So there are certainly other -- 

there could be other non-profit tax-exempt land in the city 

that might be owned by churches or --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Secondary schools.      

          IRAM FAROOQ:  -- in other such.       

          CLIFF COOK:  Hospitals with --                   

          IRAM FAROOQ:  There you go.   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:   So, I mean, does there exist a 

list that the Planning Board has access to -- concludes I 

guess the best value of property in Cambridge over time?      

          IRAM FAROOQ:  I don't believe that there is such a 

summary list.  The Assessor -- all of the assessing 

information is public and is available through the assessing 

database, but essentially, it's parceled by the parcel 

information.   

24

15

16

18

19

20

21

22

          And I think -- it's possible it just hasn't been a 

need to agglomerate that.  Because it also -- if you're 

looking at value that changes with some frequency in 

Cambridge.   

in that.   

          And in -- when looking at square footage, or if 

you're looking just by land area, that maybe perhaps a 

little more stable, but might also -- there's also changes 

          So I guess the question is, it's not something 

that I think has been done at the Assessing Department, hut 

certainly if the -- I don't know how complex it is to pull 

that together, but if the Board has that question, we can 

certainly forward it to the Assessing Department and try to 

get that for you.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  So I can just describe 

where these questions are coming from.  So maybe this is an 

aside, but the New York Times just had an article last week 

about billionaires and how much things cost relative to 

ordinary people.  So, like, when a billionaire spends $50 

million dollars on a sports team, that's, like, equal to me 

buying a sandwich. 

          So $50 million dollars in the abstract feels like 

25

a lot of money, but relative to a billionaire it's not.  And 

so, it's hard for me to evaluate.   

          So taking that as an example, it's hard for me 

what -- like, what a pilot payment means, when I know that 

these universities have a ton of money.  And I don't know 

how much of the taxable property of the city -- the city is 

not collecting on. 

          So having any form of comparator, including how 

the pilots are calculated, what the city is losing by not 

being able to tax universities -- you know, just something 

to evaluate the pilots relative to would be helpful.  But 

looking at pilots in the abstract I don't find particularly 

useful.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Other 

questions on the summary?  Thank you very much Michelle.      

          CLIFF COOK:  Thank you, Madam Chair.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Then we 

can move on to the individual university reports, and first 

off is going to be Harvard.

          THE REPORTER:  If you could just spell your name 

and give your address please.  

          ALEXANDRA OFFIONG:  Sure, my name is Alexandra 

Offiong-- that's A-l-e-x-a-n-d-r-a O-f-f-i-o-n-g.    

          [ Technical difficulties conversation ]   

          ALEXANDRA OFFIONG:  Okay, well good evening, 

everyone.  Good evening members of the Board, city 

leadership and administration.  We are very pleased to be 

here tonight.  I am here representing Harvard University, 

and we're here giving our annual -- shall we say -- state of 

the campus address on this night. 

          So I am going to be joined by colleagues, and as 

we do, I'm going to be giving an update on the campus, in 

terms of our planning and projects, as well as we'll touch 

on sustainability and community engagement.   

          So fundamentally, Harvard University is an 

educational institution with a teaching and research 

mission.  So I just want to start by highlighting the twelve 

degree granting schools that make up Harvard, as well as the 

27

Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies, and that is based 

locally here both in Cambridge and in Boston.  Tonight, 

we're going to be focusing primarily on our campus here in 

Cambridge.                     

          So looking at our population, Harvard has about 

40,000 affiliates here in Cambridge that students comprise 

two-thirds of that.  About 20,000 degree candidates are in 

Cambridge; that's both undergraduates in Harvard College as 

well as graduate students in our graduate and professional 

schools. 

          But as Cliff mentioned, we also serve many non-

degree students that take advantage of our continuing 

education opportunities at the Extension School.   

          Harvard also has about 12,000 employees -- that's 

both faculty and staff, and that makes Harvard the largest 

employer in the city this year, and many years past. 

          So not surprisingly, Harvard does have a major 

presence in Cambridge.  We have 214 acres of land.  On that 

land, there's about 393 buildings that hold about 16 million 

square feet of space.  So that space is roughly divided.  

The biggest use of that space is residential.  So that's 

about 37 percent of our space in Cambridge.  And that's -- 

28

12

13

we have a residential campus, and that makes sense. 

          We also have another rough third devoted to our 

academic space -- that’s classrooms, libraries, labs, 

museums, and the remaining is our office and support space 

that keeps the university running. 

          So as we look at our current projects on the 

campus, I want to just -- I think it's worthwhile to note 

the programmatic drivers that guide our projects.  And 

that's the ones listed here.  So we really want to foster a 

sense of inclusion and belonging on our campus.   

          We of course need to advance research and 

scholarship and invest in science and engineering.  We want 

to support Arts and Humanities as part of a Liberal Arts 

education.  We strive to house our affiliates on campus, and 

we always want to enhance the campus experience through our 

investments in community, culture and landscape. 

          So any changes we make to the campus have to align 

with our campus planning principles, and those really focus 

on careful stewardship of our campus in terms of 

sustainability, preservation, open space, our existing 

buildings ensuring that they're maintained well and utilized 

effectively.

          We also care about respecting our community 

contacts.  We want to be a good neighbor.  And finally, we 

focus on the highest levels of design excellence and campus 

connectivity, and making sure we have a well-functioning 

campus. 

          So if you've had a chance to look at our report, 

we -- the projects on the map were all reported on.  Today 

we're going to focus on a subset of those, but this -- these 

projects represent about 800,000 square feet of projects in 

16 buildings.   

          So these are our major projects going on right 

now.  And they're in different phases.  Some have been 

completed, some are ongoing or in planning.   

          You'll notice that the majority of them are 

renovation projects, and when we do talk about new 

construction, it's typically sensitive, targeted additions 

to buildings.  So these are the projects I'm going to touch 

on tonight. 

          The first one that I want to showcase is Lowell 

House.  And we're going to go into a little bit more detail.  

This Lowell House, as you may know, is one of Harvard's 

twelve undergraduate houses.  There are -- it has about 470 

30

beds, and this is a building that was originally built in 

1930, as actually one of the original Harvard houses. 

          So we have really completed a renewal of this 

house as part of the overall House Renewal Program.  And, 

like we have done in past projects, it included a full 

restoration of the exterior, a comprehensive renovation on 

the interior. 

          It was designed to achieve LEED Gold.  And so, 

it's got far more energy efficient building systems and it's 

got an insulated envelope.  And it's actually a flagship 

project for our Harvard Healthier Building Materials 

Program.   

          So all the furniture and rugs and anterior 

products that you're going to see in the following slides 

are actually free from chemicals. 

          So the Lowell House has two enclosed courtyards.  

And so through this project we were able to renew these 

landscapes.  And part of the challenge was taking these 

historic spaces and making them fully accessible.  So you 

can see we've inserted kind of these sensitive 

interventions.  Like, you can see the new sloped walkway 

inserted here behind the brick knee wall to the left.   

31

21

22

          So the central gathering space in Lowell House is 

the dining hall.  And this is a space that was fully 

restored, but it also has a lot of very inconspicuous 

upgrades to meet today's needs.  And so, one of the things 

I'll point out is the historic lighting fixtures were 

actually fitted out with new LEED lighting. 

          This is another one of the traditional spaces, the 

library.  And again, restored but with a lot of 

inconspicuous hidden systems, new HVAC fire protection.   

          Lowell House originally was built with a number of 

squash courts in the lower levels, and we've been able to 

mine that space to meet other house needs, because we don't 

need as many squash courts.   

          So this is an example of one squash court that has 

been transformed into a screening room that can -- it has 

tiered seating, and it can be used for performances, 

seminars or movie screenings. 

          And here's another one that is used as a dance 

practice room.  We actually do have one squash court that is 

still there.   

          So one other thing that I don't have a slide for, 

but in Lowell House we have a student living suite that we 

32

call, "The Dynamic Sustainability Suite."   

          And it's actually equipped with submeters, that 

allows students to track their electricity consumption in 

the hopes of giving them the tools to reduce their own 

energy use. 

          And one of the things, it has lighting fixtures 

that promote wellness, and they -- it automatically 

transitions to different color temperatures, depending on 

the time of day.  So it promotes alertness in the morning 

and sleep, depending in the evening, so. 

          So we're going to quickly go through the rest of 

the project.  So this is across from Lowell House.  This is 

Adams House.  This is the sixth house renewal project, very 

similar in scope.  The difference is Adams House is actually 

a collection of six buildings in Harvard Square.   

          We're working with Beyer Blinder Belle Architects, 

and this is going to be a phased renovation.  What we're 

looking at here in this photo is Claverly Hall, and 

construction on that project began last summer.   

          And this was a project that was -- I think the 

Planning Board saw, and it was approved by the Zoning Board 

and the Historical Commission.

21

22

          And so, the later phases of the Adams House 

renewal focus on the other buildings that are on the 

neighboring blocks you can see here.  This is all lining Bow 

Street.   

          So moving to Harvard Yard, this is Robinson Hall, 

which is in this -- the corner of Harvard Yard near the 

Harvard Art Museums.  So this is a 1904 building that was 

actually originally the home of the Department of 

Architecture.  And now it serves as the home for the 

Department of History.   

          So the university worked with Symmes Maini and 

McKee, and recently renovated this building to improve it's 

building systems and upgrade its accessibility.  And you can 

see there's a -- this beautiful lobby space has a new, 

accessible ramp to allow access into the building.   

          So Schlesinger Library, which is in Radcliffe 

                                             th

Yard, it actually recently celebrated its 75  anniversary, 

and it is a library that has an extensive collection on the 

history of women in America.   

          So the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies 

just completed a renovation of Schlesinger.  It was a 

project that we worked with Kennedy on, and part of the

portion was to restore and repair the exterior.   

          But it also included reimagining some of the 

interior spaces, because one of the main intents of the 

project was to make this a more accessible and more useful 

building, to engage the researchers and visitors.   

          And I might mention that this is actually a 

building open to the public that you're welcome to visit.   

          So the Harvard Graduate School of Education has a 

building, Gutman Library, on the corner of Brattle Street 

and Appian Way.  And we've worked with Shepley Bulfinch to 

finish a renovation of the conference center in the 

building, and this is envisioned as a way to create a very 

effective convening space for educational practitioners and 

policymakers, so to advance the HGSCE mission. 

          And so, this is a project that not only has a lot 

of healthier building materials and furniture, but also just 

improved functionality. 

          So the former Andover Hall, which is now known as 

Swartz Hall, is the center for academic and student life for 

Harvard Divinity School.   

          So in collaboration with Ann Beha Architects, the 

Divinity School is really breathing new life into this turn

of the century academic building. And we're doing that by 

creating new spaces to support teaching, gathering and 

multifaith worship.   

          We're also addressing a lot of different 

maintenance, and improving the energy efficiency and 

sustainability of the building. 

          So this is achieved in part through what you can 

see there's a new connector, a two-story connector you can 

see in the center part of that image, which is actually a 

replacement structure.  And this is a new addition that 

faces the campus interior, and it presents a better façade 

and a lot of important space. 

          So Harvard Law School is in the process of 

renovating the Lewis International Law Center, working with 

Deborah Berke Partners.   

          So this is a renovation that will update the 

building for new academic and office uses, and it includes 

some new space, including a new fifth floor that has been 

designed to really compliment the limestone of the original 

building with a new light and glassy painted metal façade.    

          So looking across the river to Harvard's Allston 

campus, Harvard is in the final stretch to complete its new

Science and Engineering Complex, which you can see in the 

top image.   

          And this is slated to open in the fall of 2020.  

It will become home to roughly half of the faculty at the 

John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.  

          We're in the process of studying reuse 

alternatives for future institutional use for the space.  

That will be freed up in Cambridge, and that's still in 

process, but we know it's going to include some level of 

decompression and right sizing for existing academic 

programs.  

          Also in Allston, you can see in the lower picture, 

we're in the final phase of the district energy facility 

that will include systems for heating, cooling and power for 

Harvard's new development in Allston.  And another major 

activity is the advancement of the Enterprise Research 

Campus.   

          And this is planned as a -- you can see it, it's 

very pale, but it's hatched out on that map.  It's planned 

as a mixed-use development with office, lab, residential, 

retail, and open space.  And Tishman Speyer was recently 

chosen to develop the first phase of the ERC.

          So Harvard is the steward of actually 23,000 trees 

in the Greater Boston area, with 5000 of them in Cambridge.  

And we have long invested in our tree resources, because we 

know they're a real important part of our open space systems 

and a healthy environment.   

          So this year, we completed a university-wide tree 

inventory, and it was validating to confirm that the 

majority of our trees are actually in very good condition, 

and that we have a balance in terms of the diversity of 

species, and the age of the trees, both young, medium and 

mature trees.   

          And so, we track this information as part of our 

commitment to managing our tree resources. 

          So Harvard is very fortunate to be in a mode-rich 

transportation network.  And so, that network together with 

our robust commuter choice programs results in 85 percent of 

our employees commuting to Cambridge via a sustainable mode 

-- that's walking, biking, transit, carpooling.   

          And only 14.9 percent of our employees drive 

alone, which is among the lowest rates locally and 

nationally.   

          So we're always trying to improve our

transportation infrastructure.  Right now, we're working 

with the city on bridging a gap in our bike network between 

the river and mid Cambridge.  So looking at a protected bike 

path between -- on Quincy and DeWolfe Street. 

          Another initiative that we will be doing this 

spring is the introduction of new wayfinding on campus.  

That's going to include both pedestrian signage as well as 

new shuttle signage.  And the intent is to make the campus 

easier to navigate. 

Henriksen.   

          With that, I am going to hand it over to Heather 

          HEATHER HENNRIKSEN:  Do you need me to spell?  

It's Henriksen, H-e-n-r-i-k-s-e-n.        

          THE REPORTER:  Could you spell that one more time?   

          HEATHER HENRIKSEN:  It's H-e-n-r-i-k-s-e-n.  

Great.  So good evening.  Thanks for having me.  So Harvard 

is a dedicated user on campus, obviously, to translate 

research into practice, to make a healthier, resilient, 

fossil fuel future; fossil fuel-free future, it's very hard 

to say quickly in the evening. 

          I'm going to focus my updates on the built 

environment, of course, and relevance to Cambridge --

particular things you've asked in the past about how we 

share work with Cambridge and beyond.   

With that, we were excited to be recognized for our climate 

goals of fossil fuel-neutral by 2026 and fossil-fuel free by 

20/50, both of which are very holistic goals addressing not 

just climate but health.   

          And I think, you know, the reason this is 

important is these are great ways for us in the university 

and the private sector other winners in the class.   

          But to scale our work and share our work 

collectively with Cambridge, and then bring Cambridge into 

these partnerships with the private sector as well, to 

demonstrate collective action. 

          Also on the sort of global front, I don't know if 

everyone knows the stats, but 40 percent of the food is 

wasted in the United States.  And if food waste were a 

country, apparently it would be the third largest admitter.  

          So we're very focused on not just Scope 1 and 2 

emissions that are more associated with buildings like 

direct and indirect energy use, but also larger impacts like 

food, for instance. 

          So this might be something that's of interest to 

40

the City of Cambridge.  There are other cities and large 

companies involved in this.   

          And really what we're trying to do is globally, 

collectively, quickly drive down emissions related to food, 

and also, share best practices and knowledge.   

          We're very committed to data transparency and what 

we're doing in sustainability, not just to show your our 

program, but we also have very rich case studies and lessons 

learned on our website, and are frequently meeting with 

folks in the city and partnering with them, and we'll talk a 

little bit more about that in the future, and deep knowledge 

and data on climate change and buildings in particular. 

          Here's just a snapshot of our data.  If you were 

to go on the website, you'd see we're up to 100 LEED-

certified spaces in the City of Cambridge, 150 overall.  Our 

data shows that we are about half of all of Cambridge LEED-

certified spaces.  We have had LEED® Version 4 Gold 

requirements for Harvard since 2014, and we have a lot of 

firsts with LEED, of course. 

          We also have over two about 2.1 megawatts of on-

site solar on campus, about half of that in Cambridge, and 

we have our first installed storage project.  I think the

20

21

22

most exciting thing about that 2.1 megawatts is it 

represents 22 different projects across the campus.   

          Another just highlight is we're very focused, 

obviously, on reducing energy in the buildings, labs being a 

big one.  Our Green Labs Program has reduced energy in 

existing labs 33 percent.   

          We're working to translate this knowledge by co-

chairing the Cambridge Net Zero Labs Working Group with 

Novartis, and they are working on their second-generation 

data set in benchmarking further and further along to 

address energy and labs. 

          Another area that -- so I think if you hear me say 

"climate and health" a thousand times, we see them as 

inextricably linked, and we're very focused on both.   

          And another thing that we're doing in the built 

environment is to really take the research from -- we're 

very lucky to have researchers at the School of Public 

Health and Medical School Engineering as well as Humanities 

and other areas, but really trying to translate that in the 

built environment, and not just on driving down energy, 

which is really important, but also other innovations, like 

biophilic design and the impact of green spaces on health --

indoor air quality. 

          Alexander talked about healthier lighting in 

spaces -- in particular, dorms where students sleep and are 

notoriously sleep-deprived.  We want to make sure the sleep 

they get is high-quality. 

          So this is one aspect, and it's this academy that 

we started three and a half years ago with faculty from our 

schools.  And we're now up to 40 major capital projects that 

have done this with us, 3 million square feet.  We've worked 

with hundreds of manufacturers to train 10,000 plus 

products, to make them healthier and get toxic chemicals out 

of them. 

          We've also I think very notably done this without 

adding big costs.  So we feel this is very transferrable to 

public housing, to non-profit sector, and to other large 

owners.  And we think it's not only a trend in the built 

environment, but one that we want to get our there where -- 

again, the spaces are climate-friendly, but healthier. 

          Just quick updates, I think, you know, that we are 

partnering with Cambridge in many ways to transfer and scale 

knowledge, both in the compact, our work on the Net Zero 

labs, and really just stakeholder groups affiliated with all

of the things that are being discussed in Cambridge-related 

sustainability. 

          And then a new partnership that we're very excited 

about -- our office with Tom's colleagues are partnered with 

the Cambridge Public Schools.  

          And in the last year, we have really joined forces 

with science teachers to have them leverage the researchers 

-- the students' researchers as well as faculty, so that 

they are directly helping shape the curriculum for students, 

related to climate sustainability in the classrooms, as well 

as just bringing faculty and postdocs and students to 

lecture and teach and engage with the students to enhance 

their learning experience. 

colleague, Tom Lucey.   

          And with that, I think it's a good segue to my 

          TOM LUCEY:  Good evening, Tom Lucey.  Lucey is L-

u-c-e-y.  I brought my glasses this year, I forgot them last 

year, it was kind of a disaster.  So I'm going to have to 

put vanity aside. 

          I'm just going to touch a little bit about 

Harvard's engagement in the Cambridge community.  I hope you 

read the full report, because it really outlines a lot more

than I'm going to be able to cover here tonight.   

          But we always like to start with our engagement 

with the Cambridge Public Schools.  You know, we have deep 

and robust partnerships and engagements.   

          The takeaway that I'd like you to have is that 

we're in every Cambridge public school.  We're helping 

Cambridge almost at every grade level, both in a variety of 

ways with curriculum-based programs that have allowed us to 

help every student that's making his way through the 

Cambridge Public School system. 

          So as a student makes his way from grade to grade 

to grade to grade eventually through high school, he'll be -

- he or she will be touched by a Harvard program multiple 

times in that process.  We also work closely with the 

superintendent.   

          We also work closely with the Superintendent on 

professional development opportunities for the teachers and 

the administrative staff.  So that's something that we can 

provide as well.  And we also provide Cambridge families and 

parents with resources as well. 

          I'll give you a few examples, as I said, to kind 

of walk you through the elementary school up through the

high school.   

          Mind Matters is a program that we're proud of that 

is being implemented in the Cambridge Public Schools.  It's 

really about some cutting-edge research that looks at how a 

child's brain develops, and using that information to help 

both educators and parents give that child a leg up as they 

make their way through the process. 

          It also has tools for families to bring home, so 

they can engage with their students at home.  It provides 

ways for families and school staff to engage, and provides 

some guidelines there. 

          But the idea is that taking that research, putting 

it into action, in a way that helps Cambridge more than your 

neighbors and other communities around it. 

          We also, in terms of middle school, we're offering 

several STEM-related programs, a highlight of which is our 

eighth-grade science showcase.   

          Every eighth-grader works with their teachers and 

Harvard researchers that go out to the schools to create a 

semester-long program that is then featured in a showcase on 

Harvard's campus at the end of the year. 

          In terms of two of the high school programs I'll

highlight two really excellent programs.  One is for 

academically talented but financially challenged kids, and 

it provides a three-year program of support, of mentorship.  

They get a laptop.  They come and live on the Harvard campus 

in the summer, Monday through Friday.  They're given a 

stipend, so that they don't have to go get a job and don't 

have to worry about that. 

          We give them mentoring and support through their 

three years of high school, and then we work with them on 

their college application process, and then provide them a 

scholarship as well at the end of that. 

          In addition to that, one other program that we do 

is we essentially run the Cambridge Summer School.  It's 

really an achievement gap measure for the school district 

that allows students that need a little extra help over the 

summer to get that type of support through the Graduate 

School of Education -- some of our teaching program members, 

as well as Cambridge Rindge and Latin Public School 

teachers.   

          Housing, one of the unique things that I think 

that Harvard does with the City of Cambridge and other CDCs 

in the area is back in 2000, we started a -- what was called 

47

22

then the 2020, 2000 (sic) Housing Program, which was a $20 

million-dollar revolving loan program that allowed the 

Community Development corporations and affordable housing 

trust in Cambridge to access dollars to plug gaps.   

          As these groups were putting, you know, cobbling 

together their financing, if there was a funding gap that 

would make the project not possible, these monies are 

available to be plugged in and make these projects possible. 

          We worked with the city to renew that in 2019.  

It's been very successful in Cambridge.  The first iteration 

of the program helped create or preserve what was part of 

1600 different units in Cambridge.   

          Because it's a revolving loan program, actually 

more than $40 million dollars was lent out.  As the money 

comes back, it's recycled back out. 

          So we're proud that we did that.  And you see an 

example of one of the projects in place up on the screen 

there. 

          Just a couple of other engagements that I want to 

highlight are, especially given today's times, are our legal 

programs and clinics that we do through the Law School.  

These help folks with immigration, housing, all sorts of

different services for free.  We average about 400 Cambridge 

residents accessing those services throughout the year. 

          Another one that we are very proud of is our 

pregnancy with Food For Free.  We have a food rescue program 

with many of the dining halls -- in fact, all of the 

undergraduate dining halls on campus.  If you can imagine, 

we have 6700 undergraduates, three meals a day, that's about 

20,000 meals being pumped out just with the undergrads.  

There's food that can be rescued there and redistributed.   

          We made a financial contribution to Food For Free 

to increase their capacity to have this program. 

          We support it financially every year as well, and 

we're turning out about 1000 meals for those in need on a 

weekly basis. 

          And finally, we always are very proud of the 

Cambridge students that come to Harvard.  That number 

continues to be very high.  24 students from Cambridge were 

accepted this past year, including 18 from CRLS.   

          So we worked very hard to both help the schools, 

and when those kids are ready to go to college, to make sure 

that they can be a member of the Harvard community. 

          Also, I think Alexander mentioned most of our

libs, museums, there's free lectures, performances -- most 

of these things are free.  We always encourage our Cambridge 

residents to access them.  We try to get the word out the 

best we can through newsletters, through the school's 

Backpack Program.  We always hope that folks take advantage 

of all the resources that we have on campus. 

          And I'll end with just some websites and some 

resources the people can use for additional information.  If 

you're interested in any of the schools or the other 

programs that I talked about that's on the Harvard community 

program, obviously Alexander's information's on the Planning 

Office, and Heather's information's on the Office for 

Sustainability. 

our presentation.    

          So with that, I think that is the conclusion of 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  So just 

so the Board understands the format for tonight, now we will 

take kind of factual questions for Harvard, based on their 

presentation.  We'll then do the same thing with each of the 

other two universities presenting tonight.  And then we'll 

have time for Board discussion.   

          So if there are any clarifying questions that

folks want to ask now of Harvard, we can do that.  But there 

will be plenty of time for discussion kind of at the end of 

all the presentations, and after we've heard public comment 

as well.  So you're good.  Other folks, any clarifying 

questions now?  Yep, Niko.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So we have before us several 

contexts -- the Grand Junction Multi-use Path that would 

theoretically connect to some form of transportation center 

in Allston, that Harvard is affiliated with.  Do you have 

any information about that?     

          MARK HANDLEY:  Good evening Board members.  My 

name is Mark Handley, it's H-a-n-d-l-e-y.  Your question is 

about I-90.  We are not prepared to get in depth with I-90 

tonight.   

          My responsibility at Harvard is more toward the 

Allston campus and what's going on there.  And the I-90 

discussion has been going on for a long time and we're 

making great progress.   

          There is a consequential comment period that just 

ended.  And so, there's been a new round of public comments.  

The importance of the Grand Junction, we have achieved more 

and more consensus that that is high.  The pedestrian

connection that you just referred to is a supplement to that 

conversation.  An investment in the Grand Junction would 

overhaul transportation infrastructure, and it would be a 

significant addition that's really desirable. 

          So without the opportunity to go more deeply into 

it, there is a great deal of consult that that is a really 

significant element, and we're balancing many significant 

elements.   

          As you get into that throat area, the engineering 

becomes more and more complicated, and there is ongoing 

attention to exactly what elements should be on top of what, 

and how it's going to connect to the bridge.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I have another question.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Cambridge and City Council last 

year twice passed resolutions expressing their support for 

the graduate student workers.  I note that they're currently 

under mediation with the university.  Can anyone describe 

what the status of those negotiations are, what is causing 

the -- or the obstacle for future growth?     

          TOM LUCEY:  It is a complex issue, but the 

students all have come back to work.  They're no longer on

strike while we go into mediation.  So we're working hard on 

both sides.  It's the first time we've had this type of 

agreement with that type of entity.  So there are some 

challenges putting that together.   

          So I know we're working hard, we're committed to 

it.  Weave successfully negotiated with, you know, a dozen 

other types of unions on our campus, and we have good 

relationships with them, and we generally reach a positive 

resolution when those issues come up.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  And so, what's the current status 

of the negotiation?       

          TOM LUCEY:  It's heading into mediation, where 

most of the students were going for the break.  So people 

are just starting to come back to campus now.  So there was 

a little bit of a suspension of negotiations, because there 

was no one there.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Okay, but I mean so what's the 

status of the mediation?       

          TOM LUCEY:  I'm not in that on a day to day basis.   

I'm assuming they're making progress.  Both sides are 

committed to getting the deal done, so I'm sorry I don't 

have more -- that's about all I can give you for tonight.  I 

53

can try to get back information to Iram, if that's of 

interest to the Board?                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  I'd love to know what's 

causing the holdup.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any other 

questions?  All right.  Then next on our agenda is MIT.

          So I'm here tonight with several of my MIT 

colleagues, and we're looking forward to providing a little 

review of our campus activities with you from 2019 across a

variety of areas.   

          And as you can see by sort of the cover here and 

the cover of our report, the theme is MIT's open spaces.  

And you'll hear more about that very shortly. 

          So I'd like to first start by highlighting four of 

the Institute's current priorities.  So you likely heard 

that MIT is creating a new College of Computing.  This is a 

very significant move in our history, and it's in response 

to the more than ever increasing demand for advanced 

Computer Science across all of our disciplines.   

          So as you know, MIT has five schools, and these 

schools are for Engineering, Sciences, the Humanities, 

Architecture and Planning, and in Sloan Business School.   

          So this new initiative is called, a "college" 

because its curriculum will serve as sort of a foundation 

and a connected tissue across all five of MIT's schools.  

And the focus of the college is education around machine 

learning.  It's around Computer Science research, and it's 

also the ethical implications of pursuing these technologies 

in society today. 

          And we think it's in this way that we will help 

build a dual competency for all of our students coming to 

55

          So the college, as you know, is proposed to be 

located on Vassar Street, at the site of the old Cyclotron 

MIT. 

Building.   

          Another new initiative is the expansion of The 

Engine at 750 Main Street currently today.  As you probably 

know, The Engine provides wraparound services for what we 

call, "Tough Tech Startup Initiatives."  

          And these innovation initiatives require very 

patient capital.  It's not the kind of returns you get by 

equity investment that you see out there in the market 

today.  But it also provides access to very specialized 

equipment and spaces for teams to deliver their breakthrough 

technologies to the world. 

          So 20 companies have already been launched at the 

Mass Ave location.  And we anticipate another 100 companies 

will soon be supported at the Main Street location. 

          We're also pleased to report that we're on track 

to meet our graduate student housing commitment.  The 

combination of the new Kendall Residence Hall, the internal 

space reconfigurations of some of our existing rooms on 

campus, and a proposed new West Campus residence Hall, which 

was announced this past month, will add 950 new beds to our

          And finally, MIT continues to concentrate our 

focuses on sustainability and climate resiliency.  And we're 

advancing our work to reduce emisisons by 32 percent by 

campus. 

2030.   

          We have been collaborating with the city on many 

committees, and in particular to create a joint flood risk 

model to help us both inform better decisions on emerging 

climate scenarios. 

          And lastly, our Access MIT Program has infinitely 

influenced our community's commuting patterns.  And we're 

also on a path to become what we call climate positive by 

2025, and you'll hear a little bit more about that in a 

          So for a more in-depth look into our climate 

action initiatives, I'd like to turn it over to Julie 

Newman, our Director of the Office of Sustainability.  

          JULIE NEWMAN:  Thank you, Joe.        

          THE REPORTER:  spell your name for the record,

          JULIE NEWMAN:  Julie Newman, N-e-w-m-a-n. Madam 

Chair, members of the Planning Board, good to see you all 

again.  I'm Julie Newman, Director of Sustainability at MIT, 

and I'll be following up on much of what Joe just said.  So 

I'd like to begin by setting the context for the brief 

update since we last presented to you.   

          For those of you not familiar with MIT's approach, 

our sustainability is modeled our sustainability model is 

framed by a commitment that considers scales of impact in 

our understanding, analysis of and solution development for 

sustainability across the role of the individual, the 

campus, the city, and the globe. 

          And though not explicitly shown in today's update, 

underlying all of our work is a methodology of collaboration 

between research and operations and a commitment to robust 

data collection and analysis. 

          And a couple of examples we won't get in-depth 

with today, but in 2019, we worked to expand our first-of-

its kind MIT sustainability data pool.  

           Our central portal to campus sustainability data.  

We've launched a new effort to design out waste, and having 

excellent exchanges with your own waste and recycling

program here. 

          We facilitated the creation of a first-of-its-kind 

pollinator garden on campus, known as, "The Hive" and it's a 

collaboratively designed garden that features native 

pollinator-attracting plants to support birds, bees, moths, 

butterflies beneficial to our ecosystem, and I encourage you 

to swing by when you can when spring arrives, to see what 

may be in bloom.  And it's on the corner of Ames and 

Memorial Drive. 

          So today I'm going to touch upon four of our 

priority areas, each of which involve steady communication 

and collaboration with the City of Cambridge.  Climate 

mitigation, Resiliency, Materials and -- and Mobility, 

excuse me.   

          So I want to begin with this.  Since 2015, MIT has 

been working aggressively toward the goal, as Joe just said, 

of 32 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, 

as called for in the MIT Plan for Climate Action. 

          But today, thanks to our work with the city over 

the past number of years, collaboration with Harvard, we 

really now have our sights set on achieving carbon 

neutrality.

          So our strategy is organized around scaling up 

energy efficiency, renewal of the Central Utilities Plant, 

ongoing conversion from steam to hot water distribution, 

investment in renewable energy both on and off site, and in 

the valuation of and preparation for electrification of the 

campus and transportation. 

          But now we move to accelerating.  Setting our 

initial incremental goal enabled us to understand the campus 

energy landscape that has informed our path forward, and 

understand opportunities for engagement with the City of 

Cambridge and beyond.   

          So we pulled our internal teams together to build 

the capacity that is essential to achieving our goal.  And 

we're faced with the challenge of how to move the campus 

towards this goal at a more rapid pace.   

          Science is calling for an accelerated timeline for 

all of us.  So we're organizing our efforts around actions 

that can get us to fossil fuel-free, climate positive, and 

ensure climate resiliency.   

          So these are some of the examples off how we're 

accelerating these actions today. 

          So you've seen this kind of graph before where we

map out our work by charting impact and effort.  I'll just 

get them all up on the screen there for you to look at.  

We've showed it to you in the context of renewing our  

existing buildings.  The vertical scale shows the impact of 

the actions that we can take, while the horizontal scale 

measures the effort required, financial investment and 

complexity in taking these actions. 

          The bottom quadrant includes activities fairly 

straightforward and will result in some positive climate 

impact. And these are underway today. 

          The top left quadrant shows activities that we 

feel can be done and will bring further positive climate 

impact.  And these tend to be more comprehensive efforts 

working collaboratively with local, regional and global 

partners.   

          And again, some of these are not underway. 

          Whereas the top right quadrant represents the 

areas of highest impact and effort, and reflecting 

advancements in the new energy era.  We're actively 

exploring these measures today. 

          And finally, the bottom left quadrant includes 

actions that are highly complex but worth examining, because

the additional positive climate impact that can result.  So 

this will be an ongoing -- this is a living document for us.   

          And the model served us well in terms of our 

capital renewal work, which you'll hear more about, and it's 

already proven to guide us in our sustainability and 

resiliency efforts. 

          The last piece on our Carbon Mitigation Strategy 

is how are we going to get there over time?  And so, again, 

this is a living document that will continue to inform.  

With our sights set on carbon neutrality, we now have an 

approach that seeks to balance our on-site initiatives with 

off-site investments.   

          The visualization that you see here depicts our 

proposed approach moving forward to 2025,2030 and beyond.  

We continue to navigate the uncertainty of what lies beyond 

2030, with respect to the emissions profile of the ISO New 

England grid. 

          The top part of the visualization depicts our 

campus emission profile, whereas -- and strategies for 

reduction over the long term, which we just shared with you.  

Whereas the bottom part depicts our consideration and 

commitment to concurrently contributing to the reduction in 

62

global emission as soon as possible. 

          So we'll seek to mitigate through a series of 

power purchase agreements in an effort to ensure that we're 

accounting for our emissions profile in the short term, and 

in the world, while investing heavily in our campus profile 

in the long term. 

          I now move to our commitment to model for and plan 

for a climate resilient future.  So we're three years into a 

partnership with the MIT Joint Program on Science and Policy 

on Global Change, a research group at MIT, and we're working 

hand in hand to conduct research to project the impact of a 

changing climate on the MIT campus.   

          The findings will soon inform the City of 

Cambridge Climate Resiliency Plan and assist us in 

considering joint mitigation strategies at the site and 

systems level. 

real time. 

          And it's also informing our design strategies in 

          So we're currently building a dashboard that 

reflects present 2030 and 2070 flood risks, and it aligns 

with the dashboard of the City of Cambridge.  So our 

ultimate vision is that somebody from the Planning Board or

elsewhere or faculty can sign to yours and sign onto ours 

and see completely the same data.  All of that just takes 

time. 

          So MIT's partnership with the City of Cambridge 

remains vital for addressing collective urban and regional 

scale challenges of flooding and heat risk. 

          I'll end with an issue that is at the forefront of 

everyone's mind on a daily basis, which is mobility. In 

2016, we launched Access MIT, which many of you are familiar 

with, and now in its fourth year, this program has served as 

an example for redefining the culture of community, and 

encouraging sustainable transportation practices in Boston, 

Cambridge, and beyond. 

          The program incentivizes a flexible commute 

choice, combining free local MBTA access, and the daily 

parking rate to disrupt the way MIT community chooses to 

commute.   

          So we're pleased to report that in 2019, 

approximately 350 fewer people are parking per day from 

2016, when we started.  This represents -- and I did not 

steal this number from Harvard -- a 14.9 percent drop in 

parking from our parking year of 2016 to present.  So the

irony. 

          Over that same period, over 2,000 more people -- 

approximately 2,000 people are now using the MBTA per day 

than before.  So we'll be able to come back to you with more 

and more information on that as we get into deep analytics 

on that front.  We hope to come back with is where we will 

head next, now that we have better understanding. 

          So in conclusion, though, our vision at MIT is to 

educate the next generation of students to confront and 

solve complex, global challenges, leveraging the campus as a 

test bed for insight and problem-solving, to engage our 

staff as lifelong learners who grapple with the complexity 

of sustainability in their daily work, to spawn new 

sustainability research among our faculty and researchers, 

to develop new scalable solutions to these grand challenges, 

to transform our organization into an engine of 

sustainability practices, and to act as a continued 

thoughtful partner in our communities in the city. 

          So it's now my pleasure to reintroduce my good 

colleague, Joe Higgins.  Thank you.         

          JOE HIGGINS:  Thank you, Julie.  John Alverez, our 

Director of Campus Planning, sends his regards.  He was

hoping to be here this evening, but came down with a cold.   

          So I'm going to try to do my best, but he wanted 

to express what a pleasure it's been working with the 

Planning Board this past year, because there's been a lot 

going on on the MIT campus.   

          So as I mentioned earlier, a big part of our work 

is the improvement of our streetscapes across MIT, and the 

expansion of open spaces in our community.   

          And most of these green space improvements are 

associated with a lot of our major projects.  So I'd like to 

go through a couple of those.   

          So student housing, as I said earlier, is a 

primary focus for MIT.  Later this year, this summer we look 

forward to the opening of the Vassar Street undergraduate 

residence, adding 450 undergraduate beds in August.   

          And as you know, MIT also just announced a new 

550=bed West Campus graduate residence, as you see that 

little highlighted area on the map on the bottom right, and 

we're very excited to be in front of you soon to share more 

about this project as it advances. 

          So we're also opening the Kendall graduate housing 

tower this summer, and along with that opening includes

MIT's new administration -- our new Admissions Office, the 

new MIT Forum, a community facing innovation and 

entrepreneurship hub, so we have a bunch of innovation and 

entrepreneurship kind of communities across MIT, and they're 

finally going to be sort of all in one place.   

          It will also host the return of the MIT Press 

Bookstore, and some very welcome retail on Main Street.   

          And the rollout of the new MIT Gateway, as you see 

there on the bottom, right, will also continue into 2021, 

with the opening of the new MBTA Head House in Kendall, the 

MIT Museum, and a new campus wayfinding system, much similar 

to the one that Harvard talked about.   

          Other major building projects include starting 

from the upper right-hand corner here and going clockwise.  

So the Central Utility Plant is an expansion.  It's in the 

final stages and we expect the plant to be fully operational 

in 2020.   

          So this provides a significant portion of the 

heating, cooling and power from MIT's campus, and it helps 

us reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by about 10 percent 

towards our 32 percent goal. 

          MIT's music program will be getting a new home,

very central to the campus.  It will be sited adjacent to 

the Kresge Auditorium.  This new facility will meet the 

future needs of MIT's music program, and will also house a 

very new world performance space.   

          The existing surface parking that you see there 

now will be placed underground.   

          The green building, Building 54, was designed by 

the late I.M. Pei; is t headquarters for MIT's Department of 

Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.  So plans are 

currently underway to give Building 54 a major facelift, and 

it will include a new LEED-certified addition that will 

offer a window into the important work taking place inside. 

          The Earth and Environment Pavilion, as it will be 

called, will be a vital center for the environment and 

climate research on MIT's campus.  The Cambridge-based firm, 

Anmahian Winton Architects is the designer of this important 

addition. 

          The Metropolitan Storage Warehouse, which you see 

there on the bottom left is being renovated, the new home of 

our School of Architecture and Planning, and a campus wide 

Makerspace.  The massive brick structure was built in the 

late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as of great

historic significance.   

          And we've been working very closely with Charlie 

Sullivan from the Cambridge Historical Commission, to ensure 

that its redevelopment for the new twenty-first century will 

deeply respect its architectural and historic significance. 

          And lastly, the new MIT College of Computing, the 

enabling work for this project is slated to begin this year, 

and we're anticipating sharing more details with this Board 

later on in the year. 

          So all of these projects provide an opportunity to 

improve streetscapes and open space.  And the map that we 

wanted to kind of walk folks through here today shows 

several examples of how we're doing that.  So we want to 

walk everyone kind of through from east to west.   

          So the Kendall Square Gateway and Plaza replaced a 

significant amount of surface parking lots with activated 

streets and open spaces. 

          The Ames Street two-way cycle track improved the 

crossing on Memorial Drive to the Charles River with a very 

new safe, signalized intersection.   

          Design is also underway, as you all know for the 

Grand Junction Multi-Use Path, creating a pedestrian bike

          Later this year, MIT will start replanting trees 

on Vassar Street from Mass Avenue to Main Street, and as 

part of this work will be converting an unprotected bicycle 

lane up to Main Street by extending the existing cycle 

          Both the new College of Computing and the new 

Central Utility Plant will enhance and keep crossing of the 

Grand Junction Path by pedestrians and bicyclists.   

          The MIT Nano Project in the center of our campus 

created a beautiful new open space, introducing trees, a 

substantial new stormwater retention, and quality 

improvements.   

          The soon-to-be opened Vassar Street undergraduate 

residence in the top left will open this year with a 

dramatically improved crossing of the Grand Junction with 

new trees, lighting and street furniture.  

          Both the Vassar Street residence and the 

Metropolitan Storage Warehouse will have the opportunity to 

renew and transform the northern edge of Vassar Street west 

of Mass Ave, which was formerly 800 feet of loading zone and

parking garage. 

          So to hear more about MIT's plans for activating 

the use of our open space, I'm pleased to introduce Jeff 

Smith, our Director of Open Space Programming.  Jess?         

          JESS SMITH:  All right, thank you Joe.  And so, 

the name is Jess Smith, and I'm Director of Open space 

Programming.  And I'm so happy to be here this evening to 

share some updates on the Open Space Programming at MIT. 

          So, as Joe mentioned, there will be a beautiful 

green open space in the Kendall Square Initiative -- so that 

space that's just adjacent to the Kendall/MIT T stop, MIT 

museum, the sort of south of Main Street section of the 

Kendall Square Initiative. 

          And so, we've been working very hard to plan for 

the programs and activities that will take place in those 

Kendall open spaces.  We'll be offering a range of events 

and activities, and we're really thinking about those in 

these three sorts of different buckets. 

          So the first being self-serve.  So these are 

materials, activities that people can engage on on their 

own.  So different games and interactive displays, 

furniture, et cetera.

          Then we have daily programs.  So those are the 

scheduled, ongoing activities that you know you would go to 

our website and find a list of activities.  So that could 

include evening networking events, lunchtime performances, 

weekend workshops, that type of thing. 

          Then finally festival-style programs.  So that 

would be multiple activities throughout spaces.  So that 

could include hackathons, block parties.  Of course, we'll 

work really closely with our colleagues with the Cambridge 

Science Festival. 

          So we're thinking about many different types of 

programs.  And we'll organize those into different 

categories, such as fitness and wellness, programs that are 

really geared towards families and kids, social networking 

type programs, community-building type programs, arts and 

culture programming, and something we're calling MIT 

Showcase.  

          So thinking about the incredible things that 

happen at MIT and bringing those out into the open spaces.   

          So our key audiences for this open space 

programming are of course the MIT community, Cambridge 

residents and people who are working in Kendall Square.  Of 

72

12

13

15

16

18

22

course, all of our programs would be open to the public.  

Everybody is very warmly welcomed to participate.  These are 

the three key audiences that we'll be thinking about, as 

we're reaching out to potential collaborators, and also, 

promoting our programs. 

          Here in this image, you'll see the minipark we 

created as part of Cambridge Parking Day.  So we had a drop- 

in activities here in this space, including artmaking by the 

Community Art Center.   

          So because open space programming is a new 

initiative at MIT, we've created a few guiding questions 

that I've found to be really helpful in the work.  And so, 

first question is will the program help us attract and 

engage one or more of our key audiences?  So really thinking 

about those audiences, and as we're figuring out which 

programs to present, really making sure those audiences are 

top of mind.   

          Then, second question, will the program help tell 

MIT's story in an interesting way?  So again, bringing the 

work that's happening at MIT out into those public spaces in 

a way that's relevant and interesting and accessible to a 

general audience.

20

21

22

          Then third question is the program designed from 

the very beginning to be welcoming and inclusive?  So we're 

thinking about that from the very beginning.   And in 

particular thinking about that with the programming partners 

that we're working with. 

          Finally, does the program or activity strengthen 

the area's innovation ecosystem?  And really what I mean by 

that, is there a social component?  Is the program bringing 

people together?  So are you going to reconnect with a 

friend or a colleague at a program, or are you going to meet 

somebody new?  And really trying to build that in as we're 

developing the programs. 

          So I found these questions to be really helpful as 

we've started the MIT Open Space Programming.  And the work 

will continue to grow and evolve, as we get ready to active 

those Kendall spaces.  The spaces will open in phases, with 

the first big section of green outdoor space opening in the 

spring/summer of 2021.   

     The photo you see below here is a scene from our most 

recent Winter Family Day program, which happened on January 

25.  And this is a great group of students from Cambridge 

Rindge and Latin who are part of a honk band.  And they

performed on campus as part of this Winter Family Day.  We 

had about 1,200 people attend; a really wonderful mix of 

both MIT and Cambridge audiences.   

          So thank you so much for this opportunity to share 

what we're up to with Open Space Programming. 

          And now I'd like to turn it over to Michael Owu, 

who's Managing Director of Real Estate.  

          MICHAEL OWU:  Thank you Jess, Madam Chair, good 

evening members of the Planning Board.  I'm the Managing 

Director of Real Estate.  I'm joined by Katherine Brown -- 

earlier, just waiting for her. 

          I'm going to give a really quick update on Volpe 

and Kendall Activities -- yes, starting with Kendall.  So we 

have been very busy in Kendall Square with our commercial 

activities.  We have started -- I'm going to start -- focus 

primarily on the north side of Main Street.  We've started 

construction on our residential building, that will bring 

300 units of housing to Kendall Square.   

          We're very proud of that project.  You can see the 

core is going up right to about mid-level.  That project 

will include over 60 units of middle and -- affordable and 

middle-income units.

          On the top right, you see an image of a grocery 

store.  This was something that came up a lot during our 

many, many meetings with the community, the need for a 

grocery store in Kendall Square.   

          So we're very excited to be able to bring 

Brother's Marketplace to Kendall Square opened in the 

spring, serving fresh produce, food -- all the staples that 

you need serving the Kendall and East Cambridge Communities. 

          We're continuing to expand our retail offerings.  

The image on the bottom right is Shy Bird.  It's at the 

corner of Third Street and Broadway.  It opened all in the 

fall.  And as part of that project, we renovated our lobby 

at One Broadway.   

          And I would encourage you if you have the time to 

visit and sort of see how we are experimenting with the new 

model of integrating and activating lobbies -- integrating 

with retail and creating sort of a new feel for what 

otherwise could be a very dull lobby.  So please stop by, 

have lunch at Shy Bird, and then check out the lobby. 

          Not on here, but on the north side of One 

Broadway, you may recall we have a line of building, a 

single-story retail edge, created with double-sided retail

street down Broad Canal Way.  The base building for that is 

done.   

          Our first tenant is a barbershop.  They are open.  

They are actually a relocated tenant from Kendall Square.   

          We're working on the tenant fit out for the retail 

on the corner of Third Street and Broad Canal Way.  That 

should open Later this year.  So again, we're activating the 

north side of the street. 

          Not shown here are the activities on the south 

side.  Obviously, a lot of stuff going on on the south side 

of Main Street.  314 Main Street, which is the old Site 5, 

that will house the MIT Museum.  Commercial tenants will 

start moving into that building later this year.  

          238 Main Street, which is the Site 3 behind the 

clock tower building, the steel's topping off, current wall 

is going up, and that's should be going on completion 

sometime in 2021. 

          And then finally the third commercial building on 

the south side of Main Street in the location of the 

existing graduate tower, we should be coming to the Planning 

Board for Design Review for that project later this year.    

          On the Volpe parcel, we've been focused on the

design of the replacement facility for the government.  As 

you may recall, we are required to complete the design 

construction commissioning of that building, turn it over to 

the government before we can access the remaining 

development parcel that we intended.  So our focus has been 

on getting that thing up and running. 

          You can see the big image on the top right, the 

architect is SOM.  The design is complete.  Reed Hilderbrand 

is the architect of the open space.  They collaborated with 

Maya Lin to create an art insulation within the landscape, 

which will be along Fifth Street -- early call piece of art.  

We're looking forward to seeing that come into place. 

          Construction has started, and the first part of 

the construction was creating a replacement utility plant, 

so you could take down the old utility plant, and 

construction of the foundation and garage for the new 

building commenced last summer, and that should be done and 

turned over to the government sometime in 2023. 

          Now that the government project is well on the 

way, we are turning our attention back to the planning of 

the remaining 10 acres, continuing on the extensive work 

that we did with this Board and the City Council and with

the community in 2017 with all at planning that we did then.  

So again, on that project, we're going to be coming to the 

Planning Board later this year. 

          And just as a reminder, that project that was 

rezoned includes over a million square feet of residential 

development, approximately 1,300 units of housing, of which 

300 would be affordable units. 

          Other projects that I think we mentioned last 

year, and are in the report, all along Main Street, 139 Main 

Street is a small historic building right next to on 

Broadway.  This is a location of a former site of the Red 

          We did a complete historic restoration of this 

building, working closely with Charlie Sullivan, fitted out 

into small office space, and it's now fully leased and 

Cross.   

occupied. 

          On the top right is 730-750 Main Street.  That 

dimension is going to be the home -- 750 Main Street is 

going to be the home of The Engine.  That work has started.  

It's a renovation.  Again, we have the updating of existing 

buildings.  That work has started, and we hope to complete 

that in 2022.

          And then finally, you see an image at the bottom 

right, which is 792 Main Street.  This is the connector.  

That was part of our Volpe commitments, even though we 

haven't taken possession of Volpe yet, we're spending money 

for the government building.  This was an early commitment 

to demonstrate that we are very serious about supporting job 

growth in Cambridge. 

          This is up and running, and you'll hear more about 

that from Sarah in a minute. 

          Finally, throughout our engagement with the 

community, whether it's doing permitting or zoning, we have 

a lot of interactions with the community, always sourcing 

input.   

          One of the activities that we are -- we find very 

exciting and enjoyable is our block party.  We held our 

third annual block party at Senate Park back in September.  

Each year, we've actually drawn more and more people.   

          This past year, we had over 1000 Cambridge 

residents -- families, children, older folks all enjoying 

food, music, entertainment, and lots and lots of games. 

          And whenever we are out in the community, we try 

to make it a point to always solicit input on all

activities, all our plans for the future.  So what you see 

in image on the bottom right is staff in Sarah's office, the 

information about some of the programs and activities that 

we are engaged in, that we're planning.  Always seeking 

input from the community as we go through all our processes. 

          And to learn more about some of our activities in 

the community, I'd like to turn it over to Sarah Gallop.      

          SARAH GALLOP:  Thank you, Michael.  Wow.  I have 

to talk over here and read over here.  How do I -- let's see 

if I can do it.  Maybe I'll bring my glasses.  Yeah.  That's 

good.  So we just -- I want to just share a little bit about 

our community outreach work.  Just a few things.  I know 

that you've read the report.   

          And we also put out a biennial impact report that 

goes into much more depth about our community outreach 

activities.  So we hope you'll take the time to do that. 

          So I'm just going to touch on a few things.  So I 

love this picture that's on our cover slide right here, 

because that is William Gallop.  And William Gallop and I 

are very proud to share the same name.   

          He is a Youth Apprentice who works with the 

Community Art Center, and helped to create this mural that

you've probably seen on Main Street.  It's a 400-foot long 

mural.  It's the fourth mural that MIT has sponsored with 

the Community Arts Center.  There's a theme each time.  

          This really has been one of our most satisfying 

projects with the youth and with the Community Arts Center.  

So we hope you're checking those out along the way.   

          And I just want to call out -- is Anya still here? 

Oh, she left?  Anya!  Anya and our office oversee these 

mural projects, and it's just such an incredible pleasure 

for us to work with the students and work with the CAC, and 

I'm trying to give her some applies, but she's not here. 

          So -- yay Anya!  Thank you.  [Laughter]      

          SARAH GALLOP:  Michael mentioned The Job 

Connector.  This is a 792 Main Street.  This is something -- 

and also, there are many things like this in our 

presentation tonight that you should take pride in.  You 

made this happen.   

          There are -- almost on every slide tonight, you 

had your hands helping to craft our achievements.  So I hope 

you feel good about our progress and our projects. 

          So this is one of those things, The Job Connector 

by MIT is an accelerated commitment, having to do with our

Volpe zoning, and Michael's group renovated the space, which 

is right across from Bertucci's.  Does everybody know where 

it is?  And right across from Newtowne Court, which we think 

is really an excellent location for this resource. 

          So we got going right away with this program, and 

on the top left is a Just-A-Start class.  It's IT training, 

and they're in every day down at The Job Connector learning 

about IT skills.   

          To the right is a picture of Brother's 

Marketplace.  It's there because we helped to recruit 

Cambridge residents to work at the -- you know, at the 

brand-new market that we brought in.  So, you know, I love 

that full-circle kind of work.  And in the end, we hired 15, 

or we helped to hire 15 Cambridge residents to work at 

Brother's. 

          And then down below that is building Pathways.  

That's an information session.  This is the trade training 

group that's run out of Boston, but we're bringing it to 

Cambridge.  That's going to start up in late February, and 

we'll have Cambridge residents participating in that as 

well.   

          And then the flier on the right is a job

opportunity.  And that's symbolic of many of the kinds of 

fliers that we put out.  We're going to be working with the 

new hotel 907 Main to help people hire people to work in the 

hotel, work in the bar I think that's on the top, and the 

restaurant, and -- you know, again, our focus is Cambridge 

residents.   

          So we're trying to bring people -- bring Cambridge 

residents into these opportunities, and we're really excited 

so far by the progress we're making. 

          And we also are very open to ideas about how we 

can make more connections for Cambridge residents in the 

field of workforce development. 

          So I want to call out a couple of the staff who 

are here tonight from The Job Connector, Hector Acevedo.  

Hector, you have to stand.  There he is! And Ted Downy next 

to him.   

          And we have a third member of the team named 

Junardy Jean-Charles, she couldn't be here tonight, but my 

hope is that you'll go down to 792 Main Street, talk to 

these guys, share your ideas with us, and we're just going 

to keep working on putting Cambridge residents to work, 

helping Cambridge residents to gain more skills.

          And then another area that I just wanted to 

highlight is our K-12 programmatic work.  These are just a 

few examples of collaborations that we've engaged in this 

past year.  The tech experience on the left is a 

collaboration that we created with Cambridge teachers and 

administrators, and we brought the entire -- what grade, 

Rohan?   

          ROHAN KUNDARGI:  The entire ninth grade.       

          SARAH GALLOP:  The entire ninth grade, 500 

students, in to experience technology.  And they -- so we -- 

what we introduced to them was an app that taught them how 

to make apps.  Is that right Rohan?  

          And then also, we did one other thing that was so 

cool.  We played a geometry-based video game with them, and 

the -- and Rohan Kundargi, who I would like to ask to stand 

up right here, is our K-12 outreach administrator, and he 

dreams up these ideas with the CPS staff and teachers on 

behalf of the students.  So that was one thing that was very 

successful and we're going to keep on doing that. 

          The middle one is a collaboration between 

Cambridge Public School teachers and Somerville Public 

School teachers.  Rohan convened a meetup for them to talk

about STEAM and STEM opportunities, and potential 

collaborations between the two school systems.   

          And then this last one on the right is -- I have 

to read this one -- let's see -- oh, gosh.  Man.  Okay, I'm 

going to tell Rohan to describe it. There it is!  Yeah.  

It's called -- the short name is Beam, but it's Broadening 

Engagements through Engineering at MIT.   

          And so, we took -- we invited four Cambridge 

Rindge and Latin high school students to be placed in 

laboratories at MIT, where they worked and were paid, and 

then develop their research projects, which were then 

presented -- some in international settings -- and here this 

student is presenting it to the Superintendent. 

          And they did all this work, you know, became very 

immersed in the research, all while continuing their high 

school, you know, curriculum and responsibilities. 

          So I'm afraid to touch anything now.  So I just 

want to say again that Rohan is leading these efforts.  And 

so, again, if you have ideas about how we can connect MIT's 

resources to students in Cambridge and even elsewhere, 

although our focus is in Cambridge, we are all ears and we 

hope anytime you'll pick up the phone and talk to Rohan.

          So that concludes our report, and we're happy to 

answer any questions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.  All right.  Questions for MIT?  Thank you.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have a question for Joe Higgins.  

You showed us slides that showed where the new 550 student 

residence was.  But you were exactly blocking my point of 

view.  So I couldn't see it.   

          [Laughter]            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So could you tell me where that is 

going to be.         

          JOE HIGGINS:  So which residence is this?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  The new one.           

          JOE HIGGINS:  So this is Simmons.  So we would be 

-- it's actually two buildings.  It's one on this side, and 

we're going to have a new pathway from Fort Washington Park 

down to here.  So it will be one building here, and the one 

building on this side.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other questions?  No?  

Okay.  Does the Board want to take a quick break, before we 

move onto the last presentation?

as we can reconvene the Board.  Thank you.   

                         * * * * * 

(8:30 p.m.) 

Sitting Members:  Catherine Preston Connolly, Mary T. Flynn, 

                  Louis J. Bacci, Jr., Hugh Russell, Tom  

                  Sieniewicz, Corinne Espinoza and Nikolas  

                  Bowie       

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So we have 

taken more than our allotted five-minute break.  Yes, it is 

hot. And loud.  So both the TV and the people in the room 

should be able to hear.  So in an effort to keep us moving 

an on track, we're going to swing right into things, and  

start the Lesley University presentation. 

          JOHN SULLIVAN:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I guess 

we got 20 minutes to go here.  So we're all set with that.  

My name is John Sullivan.  I'm Director of External 

Relations, and I am here to -- oh, it's Sullivan, S-u-l-l-i-

v-a-n, John with an h.  All right.  Now I guess we're in 

business. 

88

          I'm here tonight -- so again, John Sullivan, 

Director of External Relations.  I'm here with my colleague 

and friend, Matthew Brownell.  He is the Director of Campus 

Planning.   

     We're also joined by Mark Collins, who's the Director 

of Real Estate and Operations, and of course behind me is 

Mary Lou Batt.  She's the Vice-President for Administration 

and Operations.  It's a pleasure to be here with you 

tonight.   

          And I can get this to -- there we go.  All right.  

So this is our Town Gown presentation.  I'm going to take 

you through the first part of this, the campus overview, 

kind of a high-level look, and then turn over the clicker 

and microphone to Matthew for the other parts that you see 

          So our campus -- we have three -- right here you 

see the map.  We have three campuses right here in the 

center of Cambridge, right between Harvard Square and Porter 

here. 

Square.   

          At the center of it all, smack dab in the center, 

is our original campus, the Doble Campus, which sprung from 

the residence of our founder in 1909, Edith Lesley.  And out

from that, up on Porter Square, is our more modern campus.  

          We have the 1801 Mass Ave, which is the Lunder Art 

Center, joined to the former North Prospect Church -- a 

great example of adaptive reuse.  And that's where the 

College of Art and Design is located.   

          Right next to that is the former Porter Exchange 

at 1815 Mass Ave, where our Graduate School of Education is, 

but it also houses the Vandernoot Gallery, as well as on the 

ground level, or the lower level state of the arts screening 

room, and animation studios.  And also, we own 815 

Somerville Ave for administrative offices. 

          And then finally down -- we have the Brattle 

campus, which you know a couple of years ago in 1818 we 

purchased the remaining buildings from our condominium 

partner, our friends at the Episcopal Divinity School.   

          And down there we have the Sherrill Learning 

Center, or the -- you know, the library, as well as 

residence halls, a dining hall and administrative offices, 

and a number of performance spaces.  That is generally the 

headquarters of the Graduate School of Arts and Social 

Sciences, as well as the College of Liberal Arts and 

Sciences our undergraduate program.

          So in addition to those buildings, our 60 

buildings, our campuses, we have 14 off-site locations 

inside and outside of Massachusetts, including community 

college partnerships.   

          Our Bunker Hill Community College partnership is 

now in its fifth year, we're excited about that, and one of 

the other things we're really excited about is the 

partnership with the DeMello International Center in New 

Bedford, where we have a number of working parents looking 

for Bachelor's degree completion, a number of English-

language learners, first-generation students, and so forth.   

          Our student makeup, you see it's a steady, 

undergraduate, graduate population that nondegree, so 6400 

in total approximately, that nondegree number that includes 

some of our centers for certificates, professional 

licensure, professional development, that sort of thing. 

          So placement -- we have the Center for Literacy 

and Reading Recovery that has a number of those students.  

Our Center for Mathematics Achievement, Special Ed, and the 

expressive therapies, and we have the Arts and Healing 

conference call.  We've hosted a foible kindergarten 

conference, so that's where that number mainly comes from.

          And so, you can see by the number of dormitories, 

dormitory beds, most of our students are commuters.  To that 

end, so last year we talked a little bit about Lesley 2013.  

          And supporting or undergirding all that are five 

pillars -- you know, student focused, educating new students 

in new ways, in new fields; diversity inclusion, which we're 

going to get back to that, a sustainable impact for 

professional development and innovation work, and then also, 

you know, as you can see the enabling connectivity between  

-- internally and externally. 

          So to get back to -- sorry -- to get back to the 

diversity and inclusion part, so we've undertaken a number 

of activities.  We built -- a couple of years ago, we 

installed an elevator for disability access on the Doble 

campus to Alumni hall.   

          What that means is that all of our key gathering 

spaces are for public performances, meetings, that sort of 

thing, are now wheelchair accessible.  So we brought that 

into line.   

          We also have the Veterans Center, which we opened 

on -- right around Veterans Day, and University Hall, a  

place for veteran students to gather, also provide them with

resources and, you know, inside and outside the university 

for approximately 100 veteran students now. 

          The other thing is, as you'll see, 34 percent of 

our undergraduate students are people of color. And that 

number is increasing up to 40 percent in our freshman class 

this year.  And then 45 percent of our students are the 

first generation to go to college.  So mentioned the DeMello 

Center thing, but also on campus. 

          Campus overview, so you can see a variety of our 

campus planning priorities.  One of the things that’s going 

to continue to be a sticking point, though it's athletic and 

recreational spaces.  Obviously, with our location there's 

not an -- you know, an abundance of open space.   

          However, we did just extend our agreement with 

Buckingham Browne & Nicholas for their athletic fields, and 

also have a partnership with the Medford Public Schools and 

their high school for basketball and volleyball. 

          With that, I think I'm going to turn it over to 

Matt.   

          MATTHEW BROWNELL:  Thanks, John.  So my name is 

spelled Matthew Brownell, B-r-o-w-n-e-l-l.  And so, just 

picking up where John left off, last couple of points here

are our Browne campus development, and continuing our 

investment in infrastructure and maintenance.  And you'll 

see on the next slide here, a lot of those dots of where 

we've been doing projects are related to those last two 

points.   

          So we're going to zoom in on a few of them now, 

and over at the Porter Campus, I'm not going to spend much 

time here, other than to say we've made some investments in 

our roofs.  We replaced some sections of roof, and a couple 

of buildings, and we've also updated some of the interiors, 

including a security desk renovation and moving it to, you 

know, better lines of site. 

          And then on the Doble Campus, what we've done is 

we've invested quite a bit in ADA repairs, and also, there's 

more roof replacements on this campus.  As John mentioned, 

this was our original campus.  A lot of the buildings from 

1971 and later, they've reached their end-of-use of life on 

several systems, so we've been replacing those. 

          Also of note, some of the buildings were built 

then with elevators that do not meet current codes.  So 

we're in the process of updating those as well.  So that's 

something we're looking forward to in the future.

          One of the points that John had on one of the 

slides was about on the equity and inclusion slide was about 

gender-neutral, or all gender bathrooms.  We've invested in 

new gender-neutral or all gender bathrooms in a few 

locations.  And also, as we've been renovating, we haven't 

made -- designated some single-use ones as all gender, and 

updated signage accordingly. 

          Over on the Brattle campus, we've -- we're going 

to take a couple minutes here, and I'll show you some photos 

here, and I'll show you some photos of some of the work 

we've done, but not in the subsequent photos, just to 

highlight:  We've made improvement to the 101 Brattle 

Street, adding a backup for accessibility to that.  That 

building is where our advancement is located and alumni 

come.   

          And we want to make sure that in case our front 

lift for the stair breaks down, we have a backup, so now we 

do.  So we added a ramp on the back side. 

          We've also made investment in several of the other 

buildings, which we'll take a look at.  And just to give you 

an overall sense of what we're thinking about in this 

campus, we're very excited about it.  It's a beautiful,

beautiful campus, and we're really thinking of this as more 

of our front door now.  We've moved our college and liberal 

arts and sciences over there. 

          So we're looking -- in the future, how can we make 

more of this great asset.  And so, just to give you an 

overview, this is the Brattle Campus in aerial here.  You'll 

see on the next slide here the buildings that we bought from 

the Episcopal Divinity School are highlighted in purple.  

Many of them are just built right after the Civil War era.  

          There's also the bigger one down in the bottom 

corner here, Sherrill Hall, and that one was built in 1965, 

and has the most square footage for us to do something that 

could have the biggest bang for our buck in terms of making 

this more of a destination for students. 

          So what we did over -- which I'll mention in just 

a minute, let me first tell you -- so this is a picture of 

what is now our President's house.  It was the former EDS 

Deanery.  We've made improvements to this building by 

replacing sections of roof, gave it a new HVAC system, and 

we've also -- as you can see, built this new improvement to 

the building and we've provided in addition to interior 

finishes, we've also provided an accessible restroom on the

first floor. 

          So now moving to Sherrill, which I was about to 

start talking about.  So this 1965 building has a lot of 

beautiful things to speak about it.  It is of its time, if 

you're into that kind of architecture, you'd love it.  

What's not always characteristic of those types of 

buildings, though, is the asset we have in the middle, which 

is a beautiful atrium. 

          And so, what we were thinking about doing with 

this is making it more of a destination for students.  We 

had a yearlong planning process where we engaged different 

constituents in the community, and tried to figure out how 

can we make use of the spaces; EDS was vacating it. 

          And with them vacating, two floors of the library 

were leaving.  So we had lots of space to play around with. 

On one side of the building, we have classrooms, and EDS was 

also using a couple of those.   

          So we looked at the those as well as part of this 

process, and really where we ended up was this idea of a 

learning commons, and making it more inviting for students.  

And so, we listened to that, and what we did was we made a 

few changes.

          So you're looking now at the atrium, and what is 

now a café that spills out into it.  This is where the old 

Circulation Desk used to be.  It's now a café, and now it 

spills out into this area here. 

          We've moved the Circulation Desk over here, and 

now this whole space is opened.  And so, in the first phase, 

we took care of the lower level and first floor, and we were 

able to move all of the stacks, all of the library 

collection downstairs.   

          And through-- you can see a picture of it here -- 

this is, looking down from the atrium, the way it's 

organized is around the periphery, around the walls, we have 

our -- some of our collection.   

          And we -- this used to be just a CNU wall that 

divided the space.  We punctured it.  We actually removed 

it.  It was not load bearing.  And then we created little 

nooks in areas that perforate that space.  And now the whole 

space flows, and people can use it.   

          So on the inside here, it's just open with student 

meeting area, it's lined.  And then on the back side here, 

we've got a door into the archives room, where we were able 

to consolidate all of our archives into one space with

compact shelving. 

          The same is true for the bulk of our collection on 

the opposite side of the library on that floor is all in 

compact shelving.  So we were able to really open this whole 

area up. 

          Up on the upper levels, you're seeing a picture 

now of a third-floor classroom that we renovated, and this 

one we added fixed seating to, and this is more of a larger 

lecture hall.   

          On the second floor, we also took a space that was 

tiered and leveled it.  And the reason we did that was 

because we heard from our faculty that they would like more 

spaces that could be used for different pedagogies.  So some 

of things we can do in that room now after levelling it, 

putting a new floor in, putting sinks, putting tackable 

surfaces around the room, technology and storage cabinets. 

          The storage cabinets roll, the tables flip down 

and roll away.  Everything's lightweight, the chairs and 

everything roll away, and it now can be used for dance 

therapy, it can be used for music therapy, it can be used 

for Art Therapy, and regular instruction, maybe you find in 

just a regular classroom setting.

          Over at Washburn dining, we have -- we also 

renovated our main cafeteria there.  As we look to this 

being more of a -- you know, front door, this is -- we want 

to invest some of the dining space.  And so, we expanded the 

server, as you can see here, and provided new finishes 

throughout.   

          Also, speaking of new finishes, we took care of a 

beautiful room in Burnham Hall called the Tyler Room, 

doubled height space, put a new ceiling -- acoustical 

ceiling in there and chandeliers and finishes -- and then 

the next thing that we have our eyes on is looking at the 

chapel. 

be used. 

          So this one is in planning right now.  We received 

a Mass cultural facilities fund to look at how we could 

reuse the space.  We know that it needs new sprinklers and 

doesn't have restrooms, which is not so good.  But it's a 

beautiful space.  And so, we want to figure out how this can 

          And just to remind us, as with any project that we 

look at, we have an eye towards sustainability.  So we -- 

even though we absorbed a lot of buildings that had lots of 

deferred maintenance with them associated, and were not very

efficient buildings, we've continued to make progress with 

our reducing emissions.  We're now up to 72 percent, despite 

a 34 percent increase in campus square footage since we 

started tracking this. 

          You know, last -- the year before, we signed a new 

contract for renewable energy, and we're starting to see 

some positives with that, and into the next year we'll see 

more, I assume. 

          This graph shows a steady trend down in our 

overall waste production, and then we had the rest of the 

Brattle campus, and started needing to deal with lots of 

asbestos that needed to be removed, and we needed to deal 

with furniture that we had no need for that we recycled or 

donating.   

          So we want to keep our eyes on this.  We know that 

as we continue to do work at that campus, our overall waste 

is up, but we're trying to have a better recycling rate, 

which we also find challenging, with contaminated recycling 

not being accepted, being much more vigilant with what we 

should have been doing anyway, and following up with our 

retail vendors and our clients in University Hall to educate 

people, and also, to follow up with assessing how that's

use.       

          So next is -- so we've met our -- we don't have 

that 14.9 percent figure.  I wish!  But we've met our goal 

this year again, and we've seen an increase in our shuttle 

          This is a new shelter that we've added to Brattle 

campus, and we've seen an increase in shuttle use year after 

year of about 19 percent, and just so you know, that doesn't 

include data that we've started to get for a change that we 

made recently.   

          This year, we changed from a two-van system that 

was circulating all around our campuses from one campus to 

the next to a three-van system, with vans just going back 

and forth between the campuses.  And we've noted just making 

that change has increased our shuttle use by another almost 

20 percent. 

report.   

          So we're going to keep tracking that.  And so now 

I want to end with just taking note of some of the Cambridge 

partnerships that I'm going to highlight a few from the 

          And the first one is the STEAM Learning Lab.  

We've been working with the Cambridge Public Schools for

quite a number of years, and this one is open to educators 

monthly, and we have a collaboration with Charlene Yang and 

participation in science festivals. 

          And really this is a place for students and 

educators to work with children.  We are part of the Foundry 

Consortium have won a few awards for our work there. 

          And then also, we note that all of our space is 

available to Cambridge Public Schools for free, and they 

have used it a lot last year.  So we also have partnerships 

with Cambridge Public Schools and Cambridge Arts for -- with 

our Creativity Commons, and we routinely have professional 

development opportunities there too. 

          One other initiative I want to really highlight 

here is the Urban Scholars Initiative.  So this one is 

building on our values of diversity, equity and inclusion, 

there are about 100 students in this program right now, just 

over 100, and it was developed a couple of years ago -- a 

few years ago.   

          And what its aim is really is to help students 

that maybe they're first-time college students or 

economically disadvantaged or immigrants, and need a little 

extra help.  This is not just a handout, but really, we're

helping people. And what they call it is "intrusive and 

holistic coaching."  

          So instead of -- we work with a lot of feeders out 

in the community in Cambridge and Greater Boston, and we 

pull in students that have need, and then we work with them, 

instead of just a student advisor.   

          In addition to that, we also have advocates.  So 

these are people that are meeting with these students 

regularly, and instilling in them self-discipline of 

introspection and learning how to be assertive to get the 

most out of their education.   

          And what we found -- and I wish that the statistic 

wasn't so much higher, but the retention rate is 91.3 

percent with these students, versus, you know, I think it's 

-- I want to say -- for the rest of the students. 

          But it's very good, and it's a high GPA of 3.0.  

And a lot of these students go onto grad school, success in 

other careers.  And we find not only they're developing 

internal disciplines, but external ones as well of service.  

A lot of these students end up being leaders at our campus. 

          And so, I also just want to highlight at the end 

here the great work that the College of Art and Design has

continued to do with the community.  We have over 50 

community partnerships who quarterly meet with our Dean and 

Director of Community Engagement to develop low cost or free 

workshops rather, and working with students to help them 

gain a vision for how arts can be incorporate into their 

lives, having workshops at the Lunder Center and also tours. 

          We have college pathway scholarships that we 

offer, and also in now its tenth year, MICE -- Massachusetts 

Independent Comics Expo celebrated their tenth year here 

with us, and we noted 4200 -- over 4200 fans and visitors 

going through Lunder and University Hall. 

          And so it's not just our Design Illustration 

majors that we're partnering with there, it's also 

animation.  We have expanded into video there over at 

Lunder.  And so, we're very happy with all of that.   

          And I'm going to end it there for questions.  

Thank you very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Board 

member questions, clarifying questions for Lesley?  Okay.  

Terrific.  Then we will move onto public comment before we 

have Board discussion.   

          All right.  So we have a number of folks who have

signed in.  Many of them appear to be actually affiliated 

with some centers.  So I'm going to call the people who are 

not giving university e-mail addresses here as their contact 

information, but there will be an opportunity if I skipped 

you erroneously, or there will be an opportunity if I 

skipped you erroneously, or you haven't signed up to be 

heard later in the evening. 

          So first nonaffiliated person is -- let's see -- 

Mike Turk.           

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Madam Chair?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep?             

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Mike Turk had to leave, but he left 

a letter for you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you.  

Jane Reagan?  Yep.  Okay.  Next person is Robert Winters, 

who I do not see, and may have also left.               

          IRAM FAROOQ:  He might be in the other room.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Well, if 

people are in the overflow space and come in, we'll 

obviously give them a chance, even if I have called someone 

else.   

          ROBERT WINTERS:  That would be me.  You're waiting

Okay?  George Disbourse?                      

          BOARD MEMBER:  George is out there in the 

bathroom.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  We'll give him 

a minute.  James, would you like to come --  

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Sure.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- to speak while 

we're waiting?   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Sure, thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So when people come 

to the mic, they will have three minutes, as indicated by 

our timer, to speak.  Speak clearly into the microphone and 

give and spell your name before you start.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  Thank you.  So James 

Williamson, 1000 Johnson Place in Cambridge.  So I'm tempted 

to say some mean things about the people -- the sort of 

people MIT get their money from, but I'm not going to go 

there in detail.  I think you all know that's one of my -- I 

think it's pretty disgraceful.  But then, who's perfect.

          I want to focus on one particular thing, but I 

want to let you all know, members of the Planning Board, 

that I got here late, missed the Harvard presentation 

because I was at the Harvard School of Design hearing all 

the top people from Harvard talk about their plans -- all 

the people involved in this -- talk about their plans for 

Allston.   

          Now, it just -- I'm sorry, why did they schedule 

all the top people, Tom Glenn and Alex Kreiger and all the 

people involved in the Allston plan, they scheduled that 

almost exactly the same time as their Town Gown presentation 

here -- well, okay maybe I guess you can go watch it on 

their YouTube channel.   

          So that was a bit unsettling to me.  So I ran over 

here, and I missed the presentation here, but I gather 

somebody did ask a question about this. 

          In fact, a lot of the people presenting did talk 

about the importance of the river and the relationship on 

both sides of the river.   

          So, you know, maybe, you know, Allston isn't Terra 

Incognita for us, or irrelevant to how we understand 

Harvard's plans going forward, and how we might want to be 

108

involved in some of that, including the Grand Junction 

Railroad, and those run up through Cambridge. 

          But the main thing I want to talk about is the so-

called "Better Bus Project" and Harvard's relation to that.  

I call it, "The Worser Bus Project." They want to eliminate 

the Dudley -- the #1 Dudley bus trip around Harvard Yard.  

They postponed that one piece of it until March.   

          It looks like they're going to go forward it, 

despite considerable opposition from people in Cambridge --  

I happen to be one of them -- who take the #1 bus from 

Johnston Gate every night and come and connect with the #83 

in Central Square.   

          There are a lot of people who take the bus over by 

the Fogg Art Museum.  Weekend events at the Sanders Theater, 

the Graduate School of Design -- people who live over in 

that area.   

          The whole idea is it's supposedly going to improve 

the trip time by two minutes to Central I think is the claim 

by sending that bus down Dunster Street.  Now, one of the 

reasons -- the arguments for moving it to Dunster -- was 

that there could be a stop there, the bus could actually -- 

people could get off there, and there would be restoring

connectivity that was lost when the #1 bus berth was moved 

back to accommodate bike line, and 5 meter parking spaces 

that were inserted there across from Holyoke Center. 

          Well, Mr. Russell said at a neighborhood meeting 

that it only went down there for two weeks, but I think 

that's mistaken.  I think it actually went down Dunster 

Street for longer than two weeks.   

          But the argument is, ok, so we're not -- it's not 

going to pick up or let off at Dunster Street, it's going to 

remain where it is, and so, the benefit in terms of 

connectivity is not going to be there for those so-called, 

"Better Bus" so-called improvement. 

          But there is an opportunity if the city 

administration goes forward with their plan for Harvard 

Square to reduce the northbound travel lane on Mass Ave.  

The bike lane could be moved over, and the bus berth could 

be restored to where it used to be, and it would make the 

same awkward left turn that it used to make years ago to go 

down Dunster Street.  And the connectivity could be restored 

if we're going to -- 

          But the Harvard connection -- one last sentence -- 

the Harvard connection is if you are going to eliminate the 

110

#1 trip around Harvard Yard, people have asked Harvard to 

allow people to board the M2 bus at those stops, and Harvard 

had rapidly said they're not interested.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much.   

          JAMES WILLIAMSON:  I think they should be.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Sir?              

          JAMES HERMS:  I'm Hames Herms, H-e-r-m-s, and I 

distributed the MIT Student attitude poll last fall, and did 

updates to that.   

          One is that MIT did fulfill the number 1 wish of 

MIT graduate students and undergrads who I polled, and that 

was to get a new supermarket, actually where they could get 

there by walking, at least about half the campus.   

          One issue that they didn't report on was the 

problem with snow removal, but the students didn't report 

that was a big deal because they hadn’t been -- about half 

the students I polled -- this was during voter registration 

by the way -- and half of them were overseas from places 

like China. 

          And they expected that all the snow would be 

removed from sidewalks, you know, so they get across from

the main campus.  And I hope that they will not be 

disappointed. 

          But the big issue which I didn't cover is that 

housing is going to be subtracted next year, and that's 

mentioned briefly about getting rehabbed. 

          But now let's talk about the Lindy Music Building.  

Because I think MIT's campus planners promised that they 

would tell the Historical Commission when they would come up 

with a plan for a replacement building for the property, 

Bexley Hall, which was located on that lot.  

          And that was five years ago, and they do not have 

an absolute deadline.  But maybe they can tell us when they 

plan to do that, because I don't know whether the donor even 

knows that that is a disputed issue.   

          The students want to get their dorm culture back.  

The alumni -- meanwhile, first of all, the students who are 

now at East Campus were, and the people who were at Bexley 

Hall, really want to have a place where they can come back 

and reunite with their former fellow students, who are also 

artists.  Some of these people have tattoos on their back of 

Bexley Hall.   

          So -- but the question is, is MIT Campus Planning 

112

prepared to say when they will have a plan for a replacement 

building where the culture that was -- you know, 

characteristic of Bexley Hall -- a reborn Bexley Hall -- can 

flourish?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you, sir.  

Okay.  So I don't have any other folks signed up who don't 

appear to be affiliated with one of the universities.  Is 

there anyone present affiliated or otherwise who would like 

to come and speak, and you have the three minutes?  

          Going once, twice, all right.  Thank you very much 

for coming.  We will now have a Board discussion.  Who wants 

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I will bravely start.  So 

obviously the institutions -- I've said this before on the 

record in the presence of these institutions -- all three of 

them are defined in large measure what Cambridge is because 

of their presence. 

          There's one statistic that we're just going all 

the way back to the very beginning of what we heard tonight 

-- that's missing, which is kind of interesting, actually 

prompted by a discussion I had with a fellow Board member 

prior to the hearing.

          I'm interesting to know how many alums might 

reside in Cambridge from any one of the three institutions.  

And I don't -- certainly, the universities would have that 

data.  I think it would be quite interesting to know that, 

because that's obviously a huge influence on the city. 

          So I'm impressed that these institutions also make 

us recession proof, and that in fact enrollment seems to go 

up during those enrollments, which might counter some of the 

issues. 

          But I'm concerned about and focused on a few 

things.  Like fellow Board members, I'm interested in issues 

of equity, and the institutions tonight in their 

presentations touched on that.   

          But it relates to kind of a new philosophy about 

something called, "anchor institutions."  There's no 

question that these are the largest employers and probably 

the largest purchasers of goods and services in -- you know, 

I can say that with confidence -- in our city. 

          And I was wondering whether we shouldn't begin to 

measure that, right?  We're talking about hundreds of 

millions of dollars of purchasing power that can be focused.  

          So if we began to measure that, if the 

114

11

12

13

14

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

institutions began to measure that impact.  So for instance 

if we set some goals, not just in the construction of the 

buildings, but maybe in the purchasing power of the 

institution, there's huge opportunities to make a big 

difference in this community.   

          For instance, if we were to say there's goals 

around minority business enterprises that might be located 

within our city or women-owned business centers, 

enterprises, we could set some goals around the institution, 

and maybe some expectations, at least begin to measure where 

their purchasing consulting services, or hiring, maybe we 

could make a massive difference in terms of our, you know, 

desires to have a more equitable city. 

          We are desperate for blue-collar jobs and blue-

collar opportunities.  There are -- there's a huge amount of 

power behind our good neighbors here to effect that.  So I 

think the first thing to do would be to set some goals 

around what we might strive for, you know, 20 percent 

minority business purchasing, or 20 percent -- another 

percentage associated. 

          So that's number 1.  It's kind of a new thing, not 

something that I think anybody anticipated as a question.   

115

          Thank you for the tree surveys; a huge focus of 

the city last year, we made that request.  And the 

institutions all responded, inspired by Lesley's initial 

survey of what they were seeing as tree canopy.   

          Harvard talks about 60 percent of their trees 

being healthy.  I sort of think looking at my family, well 

if 60 percent of my family was healthy, would that be good 

          So I think even though 50 percent I gather by some 

standard is supposed to be adequate, I think it would be 

great to strive for higher than 60 percent as a healthy 

enough? 

tree. 

          So relative to issues of sustainability, of course 

the bar gets set higher and higher and higher every year.  

There's a new initiative related to urgency around trying to 

bring carbon out of the atmosphere, which is embedded carbon 

in buildings.   

          It turns out three materials are largely 

responsible for huge carbon emissions in the construction of 

buildings.  Unfortunately, they're the best materials -- 

concrete is terrible, right?  Steel also not great in terms 

of its footprint; and aluminum.  Imagine building designs

without those three materials, and have a very different 

kind of architecture that you're looking towards. 

          The cool thing about trying to wring out those 

materials is that it has an immediate impact on carbon 

footprint right now, rather than the energy goals, which are 

over long term.   

          And by the way, we've got to make a difference 

now.  So I'd be very interested in a new measure of 

sustainability from our progressive institutions around 

embedded carbon, and what they're doing about that. 

          I've got a -- I always give a shout out and a gold 

medal Olympic sustainability medal every year.  It's got to 

go to the parking initiatives at MIT, which will -- in the 

Boston Globe for being the kind of gold standard for how you 

might change attitudes or change habits around commuting as 

a simple gesture to give every affiliate a T pass, and to 

begin to charge for parking has a huge reduction, and that 

those sites that were former garages can now be used for 

housing and dormitories, which is what happened recently. 

          So I love The Engine, but let's strive to be 

anchors.  We are anchors as institutions to start with. 

          And just a small question.  I understand that MIT 

117

has a gun range, and I wonder whether that's something that 

at an educational institution -- that that institution 

should look at, and whether we should be teaching people to 

shoot these days.  I'm not so sure.  That's my opinion.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  No comment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  No comment?  Okay.  

Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, during break I was actually 

asking one of the Board members if they understood the 

Access MIT program and how it worked, and obviously one 

member does, so I don't have to ask you to come up and 

explain it.  But I was somewhat embedded that I hadn't read 

about it, since it got such high praise in the Globe. 

          But that struck me as something that's very 

remarkable and should be modeled as much as possible, not 

only by some of your fellow institutions, but perhaps by 

large businesses throughout the city, if not the 

Commonwealth. 

          I -- that really is a very, very impressive 

program.  So congratulations on that. 

          My other thought -- and this was thinking about

the extension, the growth in part-time Extension students at 

Harvard, and sort of the Continuing Ed and special 

certificate programs at Lesley, and, you know, just I'm 

curious, like who are the people who avail themselves of 

that, those things?  Are they -- probably the typical 

programs may be older students? 

          But the Extension I'm not so sure.  Do you get 

more high school kids who can't afford to necessarily 

matriculate at a regular four-year institution, and they're 

just trying to get their feet wet?   

          And you don't need to answer all of this now, it's 

just something I think going forward would be interesting to 

know more about where are these populations coming from, and 

how much of it is economically driven, versus, you know, the 

corridor move later in life. 

          And, you know, maybe exploring some ways that we 

could address some of the -- again, equity issues through 

that sort of program.   

          I'm also really impressed with all of the things 

you do -- all do with the Cambridge Public School system.  I 

think it's very, very impressive and I thank you very much 

for all of that.

          And then my other thought was just on the Open 

Space Planning at MIT, when the Planning Board was talking 

about that project a while ago, you know, we were very 

focused on that.  So I'm happy to hear that so much great 

work is being done on it.  I would encourage you to 

definitely keep the community not only invited, but involved 

in the planning as well, so. 

          Thank you all.  You all put a lot of work into the 

reports that are very, very useful, and I thank you all for 

your presentations.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Just a few things.  For MIT, 

I wonder what happens to your 14.9 percent reduction in 

parking after your parking garage goes -- that's something.  

I'm curious what the outcome will be then.  Just interested.   

          On the other side, I think all the universities 

have done a very good job for Cambridge, and they're very 

helpful in making the city what it is.   

          There still seems to be some holes in the 

outreach.  I talked to a lot of people who know nothing -- 

very little of the programs that are available in the city 

by the universities in connection with the schools.   

120

          Sometimes the claim is that these are very clicky 

and very -- people who are associated with the universities 

know about these more than the intended communities.  So I'd 

like to just see if you couldn't do a little bit better job 

of outreach and getting the word out to people that are -- a 

lot of these are intended for that don't really get to take 

advantage of them.  But other than that, I think you're all 

doing a very good job.  Keep up the good work.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Niko?                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I don't have anything.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  So I want to echo 

and support what my colleagues have mentioned.  You all have 

reported great contributions to the community, which I want 

to acknowledge.   

          And I want to keep my questions and comments to 

under five minutes, so I'm not going to go one by one to 

highlight best practices, but I did make notes in each of 

your reports about some programs that were really fantastic. 

          And I want to acknowledge that you all might work 

together to learn from each other and think of ways to 

better serve the community and cooperate together so that

some of you who have really great programs or strengths in 

one area might work with another organization to teach them 

how you overcame institutional barriers to implements plans, 

so that that learning can happen citywide. 

          And I want to encourage you all to be creative in 

working together.  For example, what if Lesley, Harvard and 

MIT all allowed Cambridge residents to board their shuttles 

for free?  What would that mean for our community?  What 

kind of a contribution would that make to us? So 

acknowledging all of your hard work and asking you to work 

together on that.   

          And I do have questions for the universities.  I 

want to ask those questions tonight, and if you have the 

answers, I'd love to hear them.  And if you do not, I'd like 

to ask that they be reported to the Planning Board for us to 

review at a future date.   

          And I'd also like to request CDD to consider 

including them in the 2020 Town Gown questionnaire. 

          So I'm compiling comments from all the 

universities.  You've all expressed similar values, such as 

a commitment to equity and inclusion, that you want to be a 

good neighbor, that you care about how you affect the

community, that you all want to translate research into 

practice, and you understand how things like climate and 

health are inextricably linked, and you view Cambridge as a 

practice lab. 

          So all of these questions are along those lines, 

to think about ways that you can have impact on the 

community and where your values match Cambridge's stated 

values, either through City Council policy orders, or 

through ways that the community has invested in projects, to 

look at where your university may match Cambridge's goals, 

or where there may be a disparity, and how you might get 

closer to the goals. 

          So the specific things I want to call out are 

values that Cambridge has expressed of being a sanctuary 

city, caring about equity and justice, about repairing harm 

caused by incarceration.  And to that end, I would like to 

know what your investments in the present industrial complex 

are?  Specifically for Harvard, we've heard a lot of public 

comment with those specific numbers.  But I'd like to hear 

that from Harvard.  I'd like to hear it from MIT, Lesley and 

Hult. 

          The City of Cambridge has expressed in many policy 

123

orders in many ways its values of sustainability and working 

against global warming, and so, I have a similar question 

about your endowments.  What number -- what dollar amount of 

your investments -- of your endowment are invested in fossil 

fuels?   

          Another value that the city of Cambridge has 

expressed is renaming problematic streets and buildings.  

Looking -- there's currently a suggestion to look at streets 

and buildings that might be named after people who have 

enslaved people. 

          And I think that we have some of those same names 

in your institutions, and I want to encourage you to let us 

know either how you're looking at those topics, or whether 

you have plans to look at those topics. 

          And then lastly in terms of equity and inclusion, 

I would like to know the number of tenured track faculty of 

color at your university, what the gender breakdown is of 

your tenured track faculty.  I'd also like to know the 

number of upper managers of color in your universities and 

what the gender breakdown is for those involved.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So do -- if any of 

the universities have any answers to that right now?  Oh,

okay.  So I think Corinne's suggestion of submitting 

response in writing is a good one, and that information can 

be related to the Planning Board.   

          JOHN SULLIVAN:  Can we get a copy of those 

questions again in writing?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Certainly.  There's a 

transcript of tonight's meeting, and we can make sure that 

the exact questions will be relayed.   

          JOHN SULLIVAN:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Any further 

comments on the reports?  I do not have anything to add.   

My colleagues have ably summarized.  Thank you all for the 

really excellent reports, and thank you for coming tonight 

and sharing with us what is going on.   

          I believe, Iram, we have nothing else on the 

agenda, correct?  We are adjourned?  Swaathi?                

          IRAM FAROOQ:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We're good?  Okay, we 

are adjourned.  Thank you.
