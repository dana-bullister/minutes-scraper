Virtual Meeting 

The Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) will meet to advance its purpose act on the 
Guiding Principles for Community Benefits Funding set forth in the Community Needs Assessment. 

Overview 

I.  Check-in Overview 

Context for check-in meetings

The purpose of the check-ins is to strengthen direct connection between CBAC and each Partnership, and understand 
where each Partnership is and how CBAC can be helpful moving forward 
CBAC understands that the world has shifted dramatically in the past 7 months, and recognizes the severity of the 
crises we are living in, including the impact on nonprofits, their staff, and the people they serve; amid these crises 
needs have shifted, and implementation plans/strategies have changed 
CBAC funded very different kinds of Partnerships, and Partnerships may be in very different places – CBAC is seeking to 
understand how partnerships are now approaching their work and how timelines may have changed 
CBAC wants to be in partnership with Partnerships to help them meet their goals, even as these goals may become 
further modified  
CBAC still needs to bring definition to all of what it expects the Implementation phase to entail, and hearing from 
Partnerships will help; this includes considering what will be required to receive Year 2 funding 
CBAC and Partnerships may benefit from comparing Partnerships’ previous (pre-Covid) plans and their revised plans 
from Spring 2020 

 
CBAC’s expectations for these meetings 

CBAC sees these as conversations in which it is seeking to listen and learn from Partnerships to inform future 
conversations, decisions, and supports; CBAC is open to hearing what Partnerships need, even as CBAC is unsure how it 
may respond  
CBAC wants each Partnership to succeed in Implementation, and recognizes that we need to be in ongoing 
communication and hear honest feedback to learn/understand where each Partnership is and how to help 
CBAC knows that Partnerships are all at different phases in the development of their Partnerships and in their progress 
toward/ in Implementation, and CBAC is looking to view each Partnership in light of its own respective timeline/ phase 
These conversations will provide CBAC with information and insights that will complement the data HRiA is collecting 

 
Questions to ask Partnerships 

1.  What is the impact of Covid – On the people you are serving/ intending to serve? On your services? On your 

Partnership? On Partnership capacity and staffing? How have things changed?  

2.  Where are you at in your implementation, and how is that different from original and revised timelines – where are 

3.  What kinds of barriers/ obstacles have you encountered aside from Covid? What types of strategies have you 

you in relation to where you expected to be?  

developed to overcome these?  

4.  We know that HRiA is looking at partnerships in depth through the instruments they have just distributed, and we are 

also looking for you to anecdotally and briefly share with us similar feedback (if you have not already addressed it in 
your responses to the previous questions): What more are you learning about your Partnership? What are your 
observations/ reflections about collaboration?  

5.  How do you think things will play out moving forward? What are your plans for the next 3 months?  
6.  How much is Covid fundamentally impacting the goals to address the top tier needs of housing insecurity and

III. Summary of Key Themes 
 
1.  What is the impact of Covid – On the people you are serving/ intending to serve? On your services? On your Partnership? 

On Partnership capacity and staffing? How have things changed?  
•  On families: Target population is most impacted by Covid – i.e., people that are low income, many people of color, many 

single parents; people that were struggling before Covid are struggling worse; people are experiencing unemployment, 
loss of income, loss of childcare; financial challenges; hunger/ food insecurity; housing issues, and panic around end to 
eviction moratorium; increase in number and severity of domestic violence calls; isolation and mental health challenges; 
access to reliable Wi-Fi/ internet and familiarity with technology is a challenge 

•  On children: increased mental and behavioral health issues, depression, anxiety, trauma response – and particular 
concern for children with special needs/ Individualized Education Plans; children are struggling to maintain with 
Cambridge Public Schools and remote learning, and need technology and supplies 

•  On Partnerships: we had in place systems and partnership that we had started to enact with staff; able to bring different 
cross-organization groups of staff together, and working virtually has increased level of participation among some staff; 
partnership is helpful for those that started Implementation phase pre-Covid – forming strong, cohesive cohort has 
helped now that we have had to meet virtually and do most of our work by email and virtually 

•  On organizations: finances – revenue has been impacted and state funding decimated for those that provide childcare; 
providing services virtually is hard; staffing is hard – seeing increased stress, some turnover, health issues, childcare 
issues 

•  On services: Trying to respond to most basic needs – food, housing/ rent, utility payments, financial/ cash assistance – 

and, if basic needs for families are not being met, impacts everything else; many Partnerships have pivoted to virtual 
outreach, programming, and service delivery; some providing in-person childcare, food/ grocery distribution; many 
providing financial/ cash assistance in ways that they had not previously; responding to increased demand for counseling

services and legal support 

 
2.  Where are you at in your implementation, and how is that different from original and revised timelines – where are you in 

relation to where you expected to be?  

• 

Timeline impacted for all – for the first few months of pandemic, all Partnerships focused pivoted to virtual services 
and programs and supporting families  
Still meeting regularly as partners  

• 
•  Many partnerships moving forward with implementation in different ways, including: serving intended clients; hiring 
of partnership-focused positions; selection of participant cohorts and/ or participant intake; getting staff together 
across partners 

•  Many partnerships have had to slow down and/or scale back other components, including: hiring of partnership-

focused positions; outreach about the project; selection of participant cohorts and/ or participant intake; co-location 
of services; training and leadership development; participant-level data collection/ assessment 

 
3.  What kinds of barriers/ obstacles have you encountered aside from Covid? What types of strategies have you developed 

•  Among multiple Partnerships: reality of nonprofit workforce has been magnified – overworked/ increase stress and 

to overcome these?  

underpaid 

•  Among individual Partnerships: Staff changes among partner organizations; build out of database; data collection 

across different data systems; more applicants than expected 

 
4.  We know that HRiA is looking at partnerships in depth through the instruments they have just distributed, and we are also 
looking for you to anecdotally and briefly share with us similar feedback (if you have not already addressed it in your 
responses to the previous questions): What more are you learning about your Partnership? What are your observations/ 
reflections about collaboration?  

•  How powerful these projects would have been had they been up and running during Covid 
•  Reinforcing importance and benefits of partnership – synergy, thought partnership, and sharing of resources and 

practices among partners; providing wraparound support to families; staff awareness of different components that 
each partner can offer, and referring clients to partners when we see needs that we cannot meet ourselves; helpful to 
have each other as resources to respond to community issues  

 
5.  How do you think things will play out moving forward? What are your plans for the next 3 months?  

Continue to build on and tap into strength of partnership  

• 
•  What is coming down the road will be a challenge – focus on what we need to do keep people housed, fed, and 

mental health needs stable; reality of winter, another Covid surge, isolation, housing issues – especially given end to 
eviction moratorium, domestic violence, employment challenges, substance abuse and mental health issues, trying to 
educate children from home  

•  Working more closely with families: families are relying on us more – provides opportunity to deepen connection and 
engagement; connect families with safe resources; start working on goal-setting, breaking down barriers, and steps to 
progress; help with networking and getting connection for people that were already isolated and now they are even 
more isolated; as we are struggling through this time, so critical and nourishing to have something to aspire to, 
continue to think about the future; we will be out of this at some point, and are also laying the groundwork for that; 
building relationships with families will look different virtually – how to build rapport, build trust, and still provide 
services 
Partnerships have come together to address needs as best as possible given available resources, and all partners 
benefit from each organization seeking partnerships, resources, and funding beyond the Partnership; the way to move 
forward is to form meaningful, systematic partnerships with very clear goals and objectives and drawing on the types 
of services each organization can offer – collaborate widely, and partner deeply 
Supporting and keeping our staff safe and attending to wellness   
Increasing training components with staff and/ or families  
Some bringing on new staff to support project and service delivery

6.  How much is Covid fundamentally impacting the goals to address the top tier needs of housing insecurity and 

homelessness, financial insecurity, and mental/ behavioral health? What, if any, goals are most challenging to address? 
Families in such a different place then where they were pre-Covid – fundamental project goals remain the same but 
were predicated on a different context, and may be harder to reach; these were top tier needs pre-pandemic, and, 

•

through pandemic, they are top tier needs for people that they affected before and now they affect most of the 
community; what seemed reasonable as long-term goals of moving people toward greater financial self-sufficiency 
now feels so out of reach – the shift is from helping people progress to just keeping people from going under, or 
pulling them up from under water 
Financial insecurity is so hard – not many jobs that individuals feel safe to perform on a daily basis and then return to 
their families, and jobs that they could perform remotely they may not have all skills for 

• 

•  Mental health issues and stress and strain of Covid are significant  
•  Housing instability – many families in rental arrears, and end of state eviction moratorium could have significant 

impact; if people lose housing in Cambridge, they lose all related supports 

•  Macro goals include clients becoming advocates for themselves once they have and are connected with resources; 
another outcome is to look at what has been successful and what does it mean to form meaningful systematic 
partnerships to support our clients 

 
7.  How can CBAC help you – what is it that we, as a committee, can do to support you? 

•  Understanding where other Partnerships are in their progress – sharing information and what is being learned by 
other Partnerships, sharing what we can be doing to provide support to other Partnerships; create a document or 
other means for sharing even if we can’t all be in same meeting – and, if we come together, it needs to have a very 
clear goal as people are stretched very thin 

•  More understanding of what data is needed – spell out criteria explicitly  
•  Be available to provide resources and thought partnership as needs arise, including hearing from other organizations 

• 

• 

that have had successes with virtual trauma-informed work 
Continued acknowledgement of pressure our agencies are under, how rapidly things are changing, how quickly we are 
having to adapt; continue to maintain understanding of delays and flexibility as CBAC has throughout last 7-8 months  
•  March 2021 for renewal coming up soon – provide clarity on what process will be for year 2 funding, and making sure 
Partnerships have information needed to be able to provide CBAC with information it needs around potential renewal 
$250k is a lot of money, and, yet, when you look at our goals, it is actually not so much; because of pandemic, meeting 
top tier needs is more expensive now, and the number of families needing help and the help they need is so much 
greater; consider additional funding for Partnerships and/or additional emergency funding for nonprofits (like $10k 
emergency grants) 
Consider a funding extension beyond the 3 years to enable full(er) implementation over more time; some models 
predicated on a multi-year approach, and, with disruptions caused by Covid, implementation of those models as 
planned is still not possible  

• 

•  All of our partners have mentioned technology for families; thinking of technology as an essential service 
• 

Continue to hear from Partnerships what lessons CBAC is learning about the needs that families are facing and what 
the City can do – e.g., another round of disaster funding; CBAC taking what we are learning about families and making 
recommendations to City about policies and initiatives that need to shift to achieve progress on 3 top tier needs 
Feedback from CBAC and City to Partnerships – you know what partners do, and we feel like we are well/ deeply 
connected in community; it would be helpful to know if CBAC feels like there are gaps out there that Partnerships are 
missing, what we can do that we are not doing right now to address issues with the pandemic and top tier needs, and 
are there other needs rising to the top that we should be seeking to address?  

• 

•  What’s so exciting with Partnerships is that we are kind of experimenting, and I am really eager to see – how do we 

• 

think about replicating these models, identifying what works as we address these intractable problems of 
homelessness and generational poverty; we’ve got like-minded people and resources to do those experiments, so 
how do we replicate, take to scale, impact policy that comes with credibility of results we will be demonstrating? 
City – continued leadership and provision of tools – e.g., housing stabilization fund, free Covid testing, help with 
masks, tenant protections – all things, policy-wise, that are a help; dialogues and discussions that have come out of 
have dialogues and discussions that have come out of Black Lives Matter – help us look at our organizations internally 
and how we serve our clients and deal with structural racism
