WHEREAS: 

As our society continues to grapple with the aftermath of the murders of George Floyd, 
Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, and far too many other people of color, the nation 
appears to be on a path towards addressing the systemic racism that has long been 
entwined in this country’s history, and observances like Juneteenth are taking on added 
significance as a result; and 
 
For many years, Cambridge has regularly observed Juneteenth via annual City Council 
resolutions in an effort to raise awareness of the significance of this date, yet in 
keeping with the changes currently taking place in our society, it would be fitting to 
enshrine Juneteenth as a formal, annual City observance; now therefore be it  
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to consult with the appropriate City 
personnel to take the necessary measures that will ensure that June 19 be formally 
observed as the Juneteenth Holiday beginning in 2021 and every June 19th thereafter, 
and to report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely manner.

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

The Cambridge City Council recently declared racism as a Public Health crisis; and 
 
The recent murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others have elevated the 
conversation around where traditional Public Safety and policing intersects with social 
services, and there has been a national call for alternative emergency responses for 
non-emergency related situations; and 
 
Currently the definition of Public Safety only includes Police, Fire and EMTs, and said 
definition must be redefined to include Public Health and Human Services; and 
 
The Cambridge Police Department is the only response option when non-violent calls 
are received by Emergency Communications Department, calls that involve mental 
health, housing and homelessness issues, grief and trauma response, suicide prevention 
assessment and intervention and others that could be better served by an unarmed 
Public Health and Human Services response; and 
 
The Cambridge Police Department has made tremendous efforts in the last decade to 
intentionally reconceptualize public safety, which currently includes programs 
performed by non-sworn employees such as; social workers who specialize in mental 
health and addiction recovery, domestic violence advocates, an on-staff Child 
Psychologist, and more, and this model would not be intended to replace those 
program, but to enhance and create a co-response alternative model that includes the 
Public Health and Human Services departments; and 
 
Unarmed alternative emergency response programs exist across the country that can 
serve as a model for Cambridge to develop a program that works for our community; 
and

WHEREAS: 

Programs like CAHOOTS (Crisis Assisting Help on the Streets), in Oregon work in 
tandem with Emergency Communications to triage whether traditional Public Safety is 
dispatched, or an unarmed team that is better prepared to perform Health and Human 
Service functions; and 
 
The CAHOOTS model consists of a medic (either a nurse or an EMT), and a crisis 
worker (who has at least several years experience in the mental health field). 
CAHOOTS provides immediate stabilization in case of urgent medical need or 
psychological crisis, assessment, information, referral, advocacy, and (in some cases) 
transportation to the next step in treatment; and 
 
CAHOOTS offers a broad range of services, including but not limited to: 

•  Crisis Counseling 
•  Suicide Prevention, Assessment, and Intervention 
•  Conflict Resolution and Mediation 
•  Grief and loss 
•  Substance Abuse 
•  Housing Crisis 
•  First Aid and Non-Emergency Medical Care 
•  Resource Connection and Referrals 
•  Transportation to Services; and 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 
 

 
The City of Cambridge should consider and evaluate an effective, unarmed, Public 
Health and Human service response mechanism, like in Oregon, Miami, Dallas, 
Nashville and others to redefine what Public Safety looks like, and develop an 
alternative public health response with the ultimate goal of decreasing arrests, 
increasing connections to critical housing, addiction and other services, and ensuring 
that Public Safety feels safe for all residents; therefore now be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Cambridge Police Department, Emergency 
Communications Department, Department of Public Health, Department of Human 
Services and other relevant departments to determine the feasibility of  an alternative 
Public Safety Crisis Response System, which department would be responsible for it, 
and how it would be funded and implemented in FY2022, and report back to the 
Council by September 14th; and be it further  
 
That the City Manager discuss such any alternative with community members.

ORDERED: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has created financial hardship for many Cambridge residents 
and families; and 
 
Thirty percent of U.S. residents said they have had one or more disruptions in income 
or employment during COVID-19, according to a survey by Gallup released in late 
April; and 
 
Nearly 7% of Cambridge residents are unemployed and experiencing a loss or 
reduction of their income due to COVID-19, which is an alarming difference 
from the 1.9% unemployment rate in January 2020; and 
 
The loss and reduction of income impacts residents’ ability to pay rent and utilities and 
purchase household and food essentials; and 
 
The Mayor’s Disaster Relief Fund has assisted over 1,400 of those residents and 
families with rent and utility assistance for 2-3 months; and 
 
The City of Cambridge will be allocating $1,000,000 from the CPA Fund Balance to 
the Community Preservation Act Fund COVID-19 Housing Stabilization Program, 
which will provide short-term financial assistance to individuals and families who are 
experiencing financial instability due to the COVID-19 crisis and as a result may be at 
risk of losing their home because they are unable to pay rent; and 
 
Governor Baker issued an eviction moratorium on April 20, 2020 to protect tenants 
during the COVID-19 state of emergency; and 
 
The eviction moratorium expires on August 18, 2020 or 45 days after Governor Baker 
lifts the state of emergency, leaving tenants still experiencing financial distress with 
limited options on maintaining their housing long term; and 
 
The City of Cambridge must formalize our long-term plans to assist tenants as we 
approach the end of the eviction moratorium; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the City’s Housing Liaison and Multi Service 
Center to discuss a variety of long-term housing solutions and tenant protections and 
report back to the City Council on July 27, 2020.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Dear Neighborhood Representative: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation. 
 
 
 

 

 

Sincerely yours, 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

Anthony I. Wilson  
     City Clerk 

 

 

 

 

 
      

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 

hereby _______ approve      _______ disapprove of said driveway petition. 

Comments: ____________________________________________________________________

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

City Clerk; City Council; City Manager
Why is Cambridge creating more dangerous mask confusion??

In the face of a deadly pandemic, with no vaccines or cures, Cambridge wisely requires masks 
outdoors. No confusion. Very clear. The priority is to save lives.

So why in the world do the new guidelines on the City’s basketball courts, playgrounds, tot lots, and 
water play structures, read: "Wear face coverings at all times when you cannot maintain a distance of 
6 feet (2 meters) from others." 
(https://www.cambridgema.gov/covid19/News/2020/06/playgrounds,totlots,waterplaytoreopenjune29)

Please get your act together. Our family wants to use those outdoor spaces. Safely. With masks.
Which is the law.

Perez, Lori

I want to express my support for policy orders POR 2020 #138 and POR 2020 #146. Greater transparency is needed

Comments for June 22nd Council Meeting

Dear City Councillors,

My name is Katherine Wu. I’m a resident of Cambridge MA as of the last 2 years. I work 
at an education nonprofit in Boston that serves young people. Our work centers around 
how youth–especially marginalized groups– can express themselves creatively and 
civically, and succeed vocationally. I care very much about how we communicate to young 
people—in schools, in community centers, and in public spaces—that they are cared for, 
and that they have a future in our society.

I was at the City Hall earlier this month where at least a hundred people protested to 
Defund the Cambridge Police, and where over 400 people signed up to give comment on 
Cambridge budgeting.

I remain in strong support for defunding the police. I ask that we reallocate as many funds 
as possible from Cambridge Police into community programs that center real public health 
and youth programming for Black and Brown families. Policing does not serve the health, 
safety, or futures of Black and Brown communities.

In order for these fiscal shifts to happen, we need full disclosure and transparency.

I’m writing to express my support for Policy Order #1, which will make bargaining 
agreements with the city publicly available and transparent.

I also support PO #9, which would require an itemized list of the Cambridge Police 
Department inventory to be made by the City Manager.

These items are crucial steps in advancing the conversation on policing in the City of 
Cambridge. Thank you for reading. I appreciate your time.

Katherine Wu

In support of Policy orders 2, 3, 4, 5,7, 8 and more

Dear City Council,
In my letter to you yesterday I voiced support for Policy Order #6 in support of the tenant protections enabling bill 
H3924. I neglected to tell you of my support for several other policy orders and resolutions.

I agree that management companies and landlords should provide a list of tenants rights (feeble as they are) to their 
renters and to a booklet from the city which enumerates these rights and where to get help for tenant issues.

In addition I support Juneteenth being made a holiday in our city. I am behind the manager requiring the police 
department to supply a list of military-grade and other hardware and vehicles owned by the police department. I am 
also strongly in favor of the policy order that asks for alternative policing. I am probably forgetting one or two. 

Thank you for continuing to work for justice in Cambridge.

Sincerely,

Kathy Watkins

Charter right orders #2 and #4 and policy order #6

I’m writing today in support of the charter right orders #2 and #4 and policy order #6.

It is absolutely necessary to make information about all property owned by the CPD, given that we are in fact paying for 
that property through our taxes. This should be a clear first step in greater transparency and accountability within the 
CPD.

I absolutely support the beginning stages of exploring an alternative emergency program outside of the CPD. There are 
mountains of evidence that prove that police are not equipped to deescalate emergency situations, but especially those 
concerning mental health emergencies, with data showing that the mere presence of police can further re-traumatize 
those struggling with mental health emergencies. I think this is an important step to making our communities much 
safer and I hope that the voices of communities and grassroots organizations will prioritized over any input from CPD.

Finally, given the increasing data about the housing and eviction crisis horribly exacerbated by COVID-19 (including a 
report put out today by City Life Urbana and MIT), policy order #6 is a very small step in a larger discussion about tenant 
protections that should be swiftly enacted to protect the most vulnerable populations in Cambridge. I hope that more 
action building on this order will be prioritized moving forward, with community input.

Thank you,
Isabel Campbell-Gross

Support for Policy Orders 2, 3 and 4

in substitution.

My name is Kevin Wentworth, I am resident of 45 Pemberton St., Unit 2, and have previously voiced my support for

As taxpayers, we have a right to accessible information on the inventory of our city's departments, including that of the

I also would like to include my on the record support for the City Manager to determine the feasibility of an unarmed 
Public Safety Crisis Response System/Public Health and Human Service Response Mechanism for the city. Weaponry 
should not be required to be present in almost all public safety situations. Cities around the country have found success 
with similar programs, and it is the city's moral obligation to at least begin research into how it would look to implement 
a program like this in Cambridge.

Finally, I am including my support for Juneteenth to be made an official city observance.

Support for POR 146 & POR 149

I'm a Cambridge resident writing once again to express my support for POR #146, item #2 on tonight's agenda, 
requesting a detailed manifest of the police department's equipment. I'm shocked that the City Council does not already 
have this minimal level of accountability and insight into the police department's functioning. Commissioner Bard's 
statement to the Council that "we have no military equipment" and "we don't have tanks" is obviously misleading given 
that the CPD has a BearCat armored vehicle, sniper rifles, and other weapons and equipment which are clearly 
militaristic in nature. Bard has shown that we cannot trust his word on this matter. No business would be run in such a 
way as to give a certain department an enormous budget with zero accountability as to what they spend it on and what 
they have when it comes time to approve the next year's budget. 

I would also like to express my support for POR #149, the Alternative Policing PO, agenda item #4 on tonight's agenda. 
For too long, cities across the US, Cambridge included, have relied on the police as the answer to all problems, including 
those that are not criminal justice issues, such as mental health crises. Bringing armed officers into an encounter with a 
person in crisis only increases the danger for everyone involved, unnecessarily endangering the life of the person who 
most needs help, as well as bystanders and the officers themselves. In the best case scenario where nobody is hurt, 
arrest & criminalization is not an effective solution to mental health problems, and only causes further trauma.

I currently feel that when I am out and about and I see a person who is behaving erratically, even if their behavior seems 
potentially dangerous to themselves or others, I cannot morally call for help because of the likelihood that the police 
would come and only make the situation more unstable and dangerous. I do not wish harm to anyone and I do not wish 
for a person who is obviously struggling to be jailed, harassed, or physically hurt. If I knew that there was a number I 
could call that would dispatch a trained medic and mental health professional with no weapons, then I would actually 
feel empowered to help.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Logan Hughes

Re: In support of PO #1 and PO #9

Thank you for passing PO #1. It was a good step in the right direction for transparency in Police and other union 
contracts.

I see that PO #9 (Charter Right #2) is on the agenda for this upcoming monday and look forward to seeing progress on 
making the police department's inventory transparent to the public.

I wanted to write to you in support of PO #1 and PO #9 being discussed at the city council meeting today. 

As a Cambridge resident of eight years, a supporter of the movement for Black Lives and a believer in the need to 
defund and reform police practices, I have been wary of the lack of transparency and accountability around policing 
practices around Massachusetts. In Cambridge, these measures are needed so that the public can be aware of the 
privileges and resources entrusted to our police department, empowering us to ensure these are aligned with our 
vision for a safe and racially-inclusive environment.

Support for PO #9 and PO #4

My name is Elizabeth Dengal and I am a resident of Cambridge. I am writing in support of PO #9 and PO #4.

Our community should have a clear understanding of what property the Cambridge Police Department already owns.

We must also move in the direction of an unarmed response team so that we can better care for our community, rather 
than take deal with all matters with the potential for violence. This order in particular will help address systemic racial 
inequalities and if combined with defunding the police department, that money can go towards actually caring for our 
community by providing more support for things like housing and education.

I truly hope that the Cambridge City Council will choose to move in the right direction and that starts with passing PO #9 
and PO #4.

Support Regarding Policy Orders 4 and 9

I am writing in support of the following Policy Orders.
Regarding Policy Order 9, I would think this is the type of rule that should already be in place. As the national 
conversation regarding law enforcement budgets is happening, I think it is important that we look critically not only at 
the budget of the local police, but also their current inventory. Does the Cambridge police department currently have 
military grade equipment? If so, why?

For Policy Order 4, I think one of the first steps in police reform is to look at the scenarios which currently involve armed 
police, but do not necessitate it. If someone is experiencing a mental health crisis, it does not make sense to send an 
officer with a gun, especially if they are not trained in mental health services.

For Reference:

PO #9 - Charter Righted (tabled)
PO #9/ POR #146 would require the City Manager to compile and provide to the City Council an itemized list of all 
materials, tools, and property owned by the Cambridge Police Department.

PO #4 - Charter Righted (tabled)
PO #4 / POR #149 would require the City Manager to determine the feasibility of an effective, unarmed, Public Safety 
Crisis Response System/Public Health and Human Service Response Mechanism such as the CAHOOTS program in use in 
Oregon, Miami, Dallas and others.

Support for Policy Orders

I am writing to express support for three policy orders that were chartered in last week's meeting. These policy orders 
are:

•

•

•

Charter Right #2 (Policy Order #146): This policy order would instruct the police to conduct an inventory that 
they are already obligated to produce. As a lawyer who has used the MA public records law many times in order 
to shine a light on government policies, I fully support this order.
Charter Right #3 (Policy Order #148): Given the outpouring of support for Juneteenth this year, and the clear 
positive message this sent to our Black friends and neighbors, I see no reason not to pass this order.
Charter Right #4 (Policy Order 149): This policy order instructs the city to begin conversations about alternatives 
to policing. It is a fact finding mission, and having more facts is always good. Again, I see no reason not to 
support this order.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I am not requesting an opportunity to speak at tomorrow's meeting.

Support for Charter Right items 2, 3, and 4

I am writing to express support for three policy orders that were chartered in last week's meeting. These policy orders 
are:

•

•

•

Charter Right #2 (Policy Order #146): This policy order would instruct the police to conduct an inventory that 
they are already obligated to produce. Given the current debate around police funding, it only makes sense to 
get as much information as possible to aid you and the residents of Cambridge in making a sound decision.
Charter Right #3 (Policy Order #148): Given the outpouring of support for Juneteenth this year, and the clear 
positive message this sent to our Black friends and neighbors, I see no reason not to pass this order.
Charter Right #4 (Policy Order 149): This policy order instructs the city to begin conversations about alternatives 
to policing. It is a fact finding mission, and having more facts is always good. Again, I see no reason not to 
support this order.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I am not requesting an opportunity to speak at tomorrow's meeting.

June 29, 2020 

Dear  councilors: 

I am a fairly long-time Cambridge renter: ten years and counting. I am also a professional 
(journalist, university professor) who has for the first time in 30 years, now been 
unemployed for over two months.  

If I did not have a landlord who is allowing me to pay what I can for now, I would be 
getting ready to move out of my apartment.  

In fact, I would like to add, if she did not want to support my social justice-oriented career 
in general, and if we did not have a barter agreement whereby I provide some labor 
around the property, I might not even be living in this city at all because of the high and 
ever-climbing rents.  

Thanks to her largess, I have been able to stay over these past years.  

And that is ridiculous. I have been, varyingly, director of communications for a major non-
profit, full-time lecturer at Salem State University, full-time associate professor at Boston 
University and director of a major investigative journalism consortium based in Port-au-
Prince.  

Many states and municipalities across the country are considering some kind of rent 
control or stabilization law or rule. One of the best in the nation was proposed by our own 
Rep. Mike Connolly. H.3924: "An Act Enabling Local Options for Tenant Protections." 
 
I am urging all of my elected representatives to support this legislation, as it would give 
our city the opportunity to consider it more closely and then enact all or parts of it, as 
relevant.  

Section 2 reads, in part, that  "homelessness, displacement, foreclosure and excessive 
rent burden is commonplace throughout the commonwealth. This housing emergency 
impacts all but the wealthiest of the commonwealth’s residents," and I think we, in our 
very wealthy city in a relatively wealthy state, can attest to that. We have all seen and 
perhaps helped those sleeping by the Post Office or under a footbridge. 

Section 4 reads, in part, that a city or town may "regulate the rent and eviction of tenants 
in multi-family housing and provide for reasonable exemptions from such regulation" and 
may "provide for fair return standards for the regulation of rent." 

Cambridge has often led the nation by taking a stand and/or enacting progressive 
legislation. It is time for us to do so on this issue.  

I can see no reason for our entire Council to voice its support for H. 3924. Let's move the 
control back home, consider all aspects in detail, and protect our residents.

Comment on City Council Meeting

In regards to today's meeting, as a concerned Cambridge citizen, I wanted to make public comment on key items.

1.) The itemization of all police equipment is essential for documentation as well as public recognition. We as residents 
deserve to know how budgetary dollars are being allocated and among the large CPB budget, we can assume that police 
equipment is on there. Understanding these items will help the public to better understand what is used and what isn't, 
what is necessary, and what is not. This is critical to understand the complete reasoning for money being invested in 
certain items for police but not for other community-based items.

2.) Repeal the ban on rent control, this is essential. During COVID times 75% of my acquaintances have been furloughed 
and laid off. We assume that our rent will increase as it does to a year to year, however, most of our income has 
decreased. Giving more municipal power and control to oversee tenant protection is essential.

3.) Unarmed alternatives to the police, this item is both current due to it's a response to the recent police brutality 
events and eye-opening information regarding systemic oppression AND it's plainly sensical.

Why wouldn't we want an unarmed alternative to a certain situation? Why is going into any situation with a two for 
escalation and violence always the answer? Do we not owe it to the oppressed who fear the enforcers of oppression to 
offer alternatives that may assuage their fears?

Guns, tasers, and force are not needed for every situation. And yet more and more we are seeing violent responses and 
overuse of force initiated by the very people trained to serve and protect. I think this Charter is worth looking into if it 
creates a safer and more equitable environment.

Thank you,
Luke

Supporting Charter Right #2 to make Cambridge PD equipment transparent

Dear Cambridge councillors,

My name is Allan Ko and I'm a Cambridge resident at 26 Inman St. 1B. I was glad to learn that last Monday, the council 
voted to pass Policy Order #1, requiring collective bargaining agreements with the city of Cambridge to be made publicly 
available online. I'm writing again to reiterate my support for Charter Right #2 at next Monday's council meeting, which 
requires the City Manager to compile an itemized list of all the materials, tools, and property owned by the Cambridge 
PD. This is basic information to which Cambridge residents should have access, and I hope it is the first among many 
steps to rethink our city's relationship with policing.

Regarding Charter Right #2 (POR 2020 #146)

I've been following the various new policies relevant to policing in Cambridge, and noticed that POR #146 was charter 
righted by Councilor Simmons. I was a bit confused, as it seems to me that, in the interest of public safety, the obvious 
choice is to increase transparency and hold our government agencies accountable to us, both in terms of action and 
financial resources. I urge the council to pass POR #146 so that we can see where this money is going within the Police 
Department, and if used towards military-grade equipment, demilitarize CPD.

Support for Charter Right #2

Dear Members of the Cambridge City Council, 

My name is Chitti Desai and I am a resident of Cambridge, at 26 Inman St. I am glad to hear that you passed 
Policy Order #1, requiring that all collective bargaining agreements with the City, which includes police union 
contracts, be made publicly available on the City's web site. We need to do everything possible to keep the 
police accountable, and I believe passing Charter Right #2 is a critical step. Please support the passage of 
Charter Right #2, to make information about the capital that the Cambridge Police Department owns and 
acquires transparent to the City Council. Cambridge needs improved oversight over our police, and this begins 
with having easy access to detailed information concerning the Police Department's current privileges, 
obligations, capabilities, and equipment.

Thank you, 

Chitti Desai

Hello Councilors,

Vanessa Banti <vbanti44@gmail.com>
Sunday, June 28, 2020 3:42 PM
Clerk; City Council
In support of POR 2020 #149

Please accept this message in support of the policy order proposed by Councilor Zondervan and supported by several of 
his colleagues, that requests the city create an alternative public health response unit that augments efforts already 
undertaken by the Cambridge PD to reinvent our city’s model of public safety.

There are numerous skills that the employees of the departments of Health and Human services possess to help our 
neighbors and community members, especially when responding to a mental health issue or crisis, or cases of domestic 
violence, or cases of trauma and grief. The policy order outlines other cities that have taken the transformative step of 
creating groups specifically trained to respond on short notice, without firearms, to community members who are in 
need of such services.

Having a community safety group able to respond unarmed in such situations will make us all safer, including law 
enforcement professionals. Such a group will be able to build trust where an armed law enforcement officer may not 
have success.

Cambridge needs to demonstrate its progressive bona fides by leading on this important topic, especially within the 
context of a long overdue national discussion regarding police violence and brutality.

Thanks very much for the attention.

Remote Public Comment - City Council Meeting 6/29/20

My name is Michael Roberson. I live at 94 Richdale Avenue and I'm a Library Assistant at the Cambridge Public Library as 
well as a board member of the Cambridge Public Library Staff Association. I am writing with concern about policy order 
#2. 

On May 4th, Cambridge City Council passed a policy order requesting that the City Manager confer with the Director of 
Cambridge Public Libraries AND the Cambridge Public Library Staff Association to explore ways to make physical library 
materials available to Cambridge residents. Despite this, the Cambridge Public Library Staff association has received no 
direct communication from the City Manager on this matter. In addition, City Council members did not reach out to the 
Cambridge Public Library Staff Association before drafting either of these policy orders. The terms of contactless pickup 
were decided almost entirely by Library Administration, and when presented with concerns from staff, that 
administration has answered that they are under pressure from the city to push forward.

As of now, most of the staff of the Cambridge Public Library has only been back in the building for one week, and we've 
been hard at work on our contactless hold pickup system. This is a very new set of procedures for all of us, and it has 
been a struggle to keep up with, especially working with minimal onsite staff in order to minimize the risk of spreading 
COVID-19 to staff or patrons – not to mention working without the members of our staff who are unable to return to the 
building due to childcare or health concerns.

The staff of the Cambridge Public Library shares the City Council's passion for serving the community. However, we 
would like a seat at the table when it comes to making Library decisions, and we would like more time to work out the 
bugs with our current contactless hold pickup system before expanding service further. Getting library materials to the 
community is important, but it is not more important than the health and safety of Library workers.

Thank you for your time.

In support of policy order 149

I have had very positive interactions with the Cambridge police department, and I appreciate the good work that they do 
in the community.
I also support the proposed policy order 149, and recommend that the new system be distinct from the existing police 
department. It is important that there be good communication amongst all first responders.
I support this policy order because it has been implemented elsewhere with success; it emphasizes the need to include 
human services in emergency response; and it ensures that the most qualified personnel would handle a given problem.
Thank you

To whom it may concern on the Cambridge City Council:

My name is Maya and I am a Cambridge resident. I am emailing you to urge you to support PO 4 (149) during the 6/29 
city council meeting. The police are currently being asked to do too much in our city. Investing in unarmed, well-trained, 
specialized alternatives to policing would forge a smarter path to safety for Cambridge.

Council meeting 6/29

I am writing to let you know that as a constituent and voter, I support the request for a full accounting of CPD property 
(which, as I understand, is due to the City anyways - it seems very easy to provide this to the Council as well!), and that I 
support the creation of an unarmed department to respond to nonviolent calls. To this end, I am in support of Policy 
Order #1 and Policy Order #9 of this meeting.

To truly make our community safer, this department must work to lessen the scope of police involvement in health and 
housing problems, and must provide holistic community support rather than carceral solutions (i.e., there must be no 
powers of arrest or forcible mental health commitment). As such, I hope not only that the Council will vote to begin 
consideration of this department, but that the conversation will include explicitly promising that the funds for its 
creation will come directly out of the Police budget for fiscal year 2022.

Thank you for working for a safer Cambridge,
Cassandra Seltzer

support for charter righted orders #2 & 4 + regular policy orders #1, 3, & 5

I write to thank you for passing PO#1 last week, as well as to express my support once more for PO#9, which would 
provide the Council with an itemized list of all property owned by the Cambridge Police Department.

I was disappointed that PO#9 (Charter Right #2 this week) was set aside last week, and confused by the stated reason for 
it, that systemic racism exists in other departments as well. Of course systemic racism *does* exist in other 
departments, and I support efforts to identify and exorcise it. I just don't understand why we can't do both, or why the 
need to do one requires a delay in tackling the other.

I urge the Council to please pass Charter Right orders #2 and #4 without further delay, as well as Policy Orders #1, #3, 
and #5 of this week. None of these orders conflict with any of the others, and none should be controversial in a City that 
prides itself on justice, transparency, and progressive leadership.

Perez, Lori

To the City Council,

Louise Parker <parkerlouise@earthlink.net>
Monday, June 29, 2020 3:32 PM
City Council
Clerk; City Manager
Vote Yes on POR 2020 #146, #149, and #160

I am writing to strongly urge you to vote yes on the following policy orders (POR 2020 #146, #149, and #160):

POR 2020 #146
Given recent concerns about the possession and use of military grade equipment by municipal police, it is crucial that 
the public understand what such equipment (e.g., sniper rifles and armed vehicles) the Cambridge Policy Department 
(CPD) possesses. This PO requests that the City Manager obtain an itemized list of all materials, tools, and property 
owned by the CPD and disposed of any military grade equipment it does not need. There is evidence that use of such 
equipment escalates situations rather than makes the public safer. And certainly in a city with a very low violent crime 
rate, it seems unnecessary and frankly dangerous to have such equipment. I strongly urge you to vote yes on this PO.

POR 202 #149
Currently the police are the only response team that residents can call in non-emergency situations. Unarmed 
alternative emergency response programs exist across the country (e.g., Crisis Assisting Help on the Streets in Oregon) 
that can serve as a model for Cambridge to develop a program that works for our community. This policy order asks the 
City Manager to consider such alternatives for Cambridge. While I do not think this is where our work on evaluating and 
rethinking public safety in Cambridge should stop, I think this a good step. I strongly urge you to vote yes on this PO.

PO 6 (POR 2020 #160)
As you are aware, Cambridge and other cities in the region are facing a severe housing crisis leading to growing 
displacement and homelessness. With the COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting growth in unemployment the severity of 
this crisis has deepened. As you are also aware, the Commonwealth currently does not permit municipalities to enact a 
broad range of tenant protections including eviction and rent regulation, tenant deposit and fee protections, foreclosure 
protections, and creation of anti-displacement zones. House Bill H.3924 would enable municipalities to evaluate and 
enact such protections as best suited to local conditions and needs. PO 6 (POR 2020 #160) puts Cambridge on record for 
supporting H.3924. I strongly urge you to vote yes on this policy order and to encourage all our Representatives to 
champion and vote for H.2924.

Sincerely,
Louise Parker

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that Josué J. López, who earned a PHD 
in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from MIT, also received the 2020 
Mens et Manus Award at MIT’s recent commencement; and 
 
The Mens et Manus Award is in recognition of a graduating Masters or Doctoral 
candidate in the MIT community who has shown a passion and affinity for diversity 
and inclusion work, and is given to a student who has gone above and beyond to bring 
awareness to issues of diversity, inclusion, and cultural awareness at MIT; and 
 
Josué and other students have worked for years alongside MIT President Rafael Reif 
and other members of MIT Senior Administration to implement recommendations that 
were made in 2015 by the MIT Black Students’ Union (MIT BSU) and the MIT Black 
Graduate Student Association (MIT BGSA) to address racial bias at MIT; and 
 
A student-led progress evaluation of these goals published on June 2, 2020, found that 
while there has been some progress on some of the recommendations, others remain at 
0% completion; and 
 
The evaluation, which was co-authored by Josué, points to the lack of an institute-wide 
strategic plan as the primary bottleneck for the completion of these recommendations; 
and 
 
The MIT BGSA, MIT BSU, and student leaders of color across the institute have 
written an open letter calling on MIT leadership to be proactive in making MIT “a 
place where Black people and POC can exist safely and thrive”, including by 
developing plans to address racial bias at MIT and making MIT safe for all students by 
investigating and implementing new models for public safety that reduce the scale of 
policing and increase safety and well-being; and

Josué’s leadership and contributions to work on diversity, equity, and inclusion 
throughout his time at MIT are deeply appreciated by the City Council and indeed the 
entire City; now therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record congratulating Josué J. López on his 
remarkable achievements upon graduating from MIT; and be it further 
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record in strong support of the June 2, 2020 
MIT BGSA/BSU open letter, including its demands; and be it further 
 
That suitably engrossed copies of this letter be sent to Josué J. López, the MIT BSU, 
the MIT BGSA, and MIT President Rafael Reif on behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS:  Were it not for the social distancing necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic,  this 

June would have witnessed the creation of the 21st Foster Street Block Party, the 
annual neighborhood gathering that grew from the initial efforts of Dr. Jay Connor, 
Lynne Herndon, Felice Kincannon, Kathleen Moore and Bonnie Shershaw to bring 
strangers together; and 
 
Such events for getting to know one’s neighbors are a firm basis for fostering 
community safety, cohesion, and sense of belonging; and 
 
For two decades this cherished event has been organized by two residents, Meade S. 
Fasciano of 86 Foster Street, and Anne Lowell of 88 Foster Street; and 
 
These two women have announced and have faithfully and thoughtfully organized the 
gathering each year; and 
 
They have conceived the block party to be welcoming for people of all ages, making 
them inclusive for all in the vicinity; and 
 
They have set up tables for a spread of pot luck supper dishes, drinks and sumptuous 
desserts contributed by their guests and provided an array of chairs for those desirous 
or in need of sitting and have set aside play areas for young children, enhanced with 
toys suitable for various stages of development;  and 
 
They have created a festive atmosphere with their decorations as well as lively music 
played at intervals by accomplished, live musicians, rousing enough to set their 
neighbors dancing; and 
 
In inclement weather, they have not hesitated to open their homes to all, that the block 
party might take place; now therefore be it

WHEREAS: 

It is critical that the City of Cambridge re-examine our law enforcement 
practices that may endanger community members and expose them to extreme 
and unnecessary harm; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Two of the most egregious policing practices under current scrutiny are the use 

of chokeholds and “no-knock” warrants, which were used in the murders of 
George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020. “No-knock” warrants, which allow 
unannounced, forcible-entry raids into homes, have a disturbingly violent 
pattern. The New York Times found that at least 81 civilians and 13 law 
enforcement officers died during no-knock raids, and similar raids where 
an announcement is made directly before breaking in, between 2010 and 2016; 
and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The Cambridge Police Department already bans the use of choke holds, but 
does not explicitly ban the use of “no-knock” warrants; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Massachusetts State Rep. Liz Miranda and Senator Cynthia Creem have 
introduced complementary state legislation, HD.5128/SD2968, “An Act 
relative to saving black lives and transforming public safety,” to address 
targeted concerns with policing in our state. The bills are co-sponsored and 
supported by dozens of colleagues in the state house; and 
 

 

Packet Pg. 163

6.1

WHEREAS:  This state bill is targeted to mandate new standards for law enforcement 

conduct, use of force, and incident reporting. The Act mandates the use of de-
escalation tactics before the use of force, and identifies very limited 
circumstances in which a law enforcement officer can legally use deadly force. 
It bans the use of choke holds, “no-knock” warrants, tear gas, rubber pellets, 
and dogs by law enforcement. The Act also calls for clear, annual reporting 
mechanisms at the state level for all officer-involved injuries or deaths, and 
includes a “duty to intervene” by observing officers. It includes many more 
sections on conduct and public accountability; therefore be it  
 

 
ORDERED:  That the City Council go on record in full support of the state legislation “An 

Act relative to saving black lives and transforming public safety” as a first step 
in changing law enforcement standards, use of force, and reporting in 
Massachusetts; and be it further 
 

 
ORDERED:  That a copy of this resolution be sent to the Cambridge delegation in the 
Massachusetts State House, to Massachusetts State Rep. Liz Miranda and 
Senator Cynthia Creem, and to Governor Baker.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

On May 4th, 2020, the City Council passed a policy order asking the City Manager, the 
Director of Cambridge Public Libraries, and the Cambridge Library Staff Association 
to develop ways to distribute physical library materials to students and other residents, 
especially by using the Library’s online reservation system and staggered pickup 
windows; and 
 
Since then, public and school libraries have remained closed, leaving a critical resource 
gap, especially for our students and youngest residents; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  While the Library currently offers contactless holds pickup, using the online 

reservation system is a uniquely adult thing to do, and many children need more 
guidance when engaging with books, especially through personalized reading 
recommendations from librarians; and 
 
The Library is hosting its Summer Reading Program virtually this year, and although 
there are plans to give away 800 children’s books, this is not enough to reach every 
reader or last the entire summer; and 
 
By creating mobile Library opportunities that would offer checkout at sites across the 
City, we can increase access to physical library materials to young Cambridge 
residents, especially those participating in the Summer Reading Program, in a safe 
way; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Mobile checkout should be offered at locations frequented by younger residents, such 
as the Summer Food meal sites, Mayor’s Youth Summer Employment Program sites, 
Summer Camps who are holding in person sessions and other locations to enhance 
accessibility and convenience; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  With typical summer learning loss coupled with COVID-19 slide, the City has a 

 
ORDERED: 

responsibility to ensure every child has ample access to educational and enriching 
materials like physical books; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Director of 
Cambridge Public Libraries and the Cambridge Library Staff Association to develop 
new and expanded ways to distribute physical library materials to Cambridge youth 
over the summer, including possible mobile checkout sites; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

In recent weeks, the City Council has introduced resolutions and policy orders that 
have placed the City on the record of being in support of a congressional bill that 
condemns police brutality and the militarization of the police across the country, that 
have asked the City to determine whether some funding for the Police Department 
might be better utilized in other capacities, and that have asked the City to obtain a 
detailed accounting of all materials, tools, and property owned by the Police 
Department; and 
 
These items have been introduced as the nation reels from the unconscionable killings 
of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, and following the attempted, 
racially-based weaponization of the police against Christian Cooper in Central Park; 
and 
 
The shockwaves from those events (and from earlier, unconscionable killings of people 
like Eurie Stamps) have led to countless municipalities beginning to explore the 
historical roots and roles of our police departments, to ask whether there are more 
constructive and holistic ways of promoting public safety, and to seek to identify and 
dismantle any lingering racial biases that have historically been intertwined with far 
too many police departments; and   
 
To its credit, Cambridge has made important strides in establishing a police department 
that is based upon the concept of community-based policing – including hiring a 
veteran police commissioner who is heavily invested in Social Justice initiatives, 
recruiting officers with strong community ties, working to promote a racially-diverse 
police department, and hiring numerous social workers and mental health professionals 
to better address the many non-criminal challenges presented to the department; and

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Yet Cambridge has certainly not been free of troubling, racially-charged incidents and 
disturbing police responses in recent years, and these incidents illustrate why we must 
remain vigilant in continually striving for a department that seeks to achieve an ever-
more holistic, community-oriented approach that uses force only as a last resort, and 
we must continue working to ensure that any lingering vestiges of systemic racism 
within this department be identified and eradicated; and 
 
In the City’s recent discussions touching upon the role of policing in our community, it 
has accurately been pointed out that merely looking for instances of systemic racism in 
the Police Department, without concurrently doing the same work of exploring the 
municipal government as a whole, would be akin to treating the symptom of an illness 
rather than addressing the root cause of the disease itself; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City 
personnel to establish a plan designed to provide a thorough, system-wide review of 
the entire municipal government to identify and remove any vestiges of systemic 
racism and/or racial bias in any and all City departments, to establish clear, transparent 
metrics that will help further this critical endeavor, and to report back to the City 
Council on this matter no later than September 14, 2020; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to also report back to the City 
Council on any progress made in regards to the drafting of a formal Anti-bias/Cultural 
Competency Strategic Plan (as called for in the Policy Order passed on May 20, 2019) 
no later than September 14, 2020.

In service of furthering the City Council’s continued efforts to institutionalize and 
codify the work around anti-bias, anti-racist, and cultural sensitivity training, it would 
be wise to ensure that the City Council’s rules reflect the ongoing need for these 
trainings to take place on an annual basis; now therefore be it  
 
That the Chair of the Government Operations Rules and Claims Committee schedule 
hearings to discuss how to best incorporate language into the City Council’s rules that 
will call for anti-bias, anti-racist, and cultural sensitivity trainings to be held on a 
yearly basis.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

The COVID 19 pandemic has placed a tremendous burden on the business community 
and has the potential to reshape our business districts; and 
 
Our small business districts were already under tremendous pressure to attract viable 
small businesses that contribute to an active street scape, and both tenant and landlord 
will soon feel the economic pressure of an unsteady economy and uncertain consumer 
confidence: and 
 
Feedback from the business community has been to expect more business closures and 
extended vacancies; and 
 
These extended vacancies will increase pressure on landlords attempting to fill 
commercial vacancies with viable tenants, and 
 
Viable solutions such as residential conversion, could alter the commercial dynamic of 
our small business districts; and 
 
Our small business districts provide affordable commercial opportunities and services 
that support the community, create vitality for our neighborhoods, and economic 
opportunity for residents, and it is in the best interest of the city to maintain these uses; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Assistant City 
Manager of Community Development to determine how to best protect and preserve 
our commercial spaces that support our small business operators and maintain 
continuity in our commercial districts, and report back to the City Council with 
recommendations at the September 14th City Council meeting.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that H.3924, An Act Enabling Local 
Options for Tenant Protections, has been reported favorably out of the Joint Committee 
on Housing by a vote of 13 in favor and 2 opposed; and 
 
H.3924 would give municipalities like Cambridge a flexible set of tools needed to 
prevent displacement & homelessness, reduce the phenomenon of heavy rent-burden, 
and protect renters; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  While H.3924 does not require municipalities to enact specific tenant protections, it 

would empower them with the flexibility to address the housing emergency that exists 
across the commonwealth in a locally appropriate manner by removing current state-
level restrictions, meaning the City Council would retain the responsibility of 
deliberating on and approving of any changes that are ultimately made; and 
 
There are and always have been a range of views on the best way to address 
Cambridge’s housing affordability crisis, but it is clear that more local options are 
sorely needed to ensure housing justice and affordability for tenants in Cambridge, 
who make up more than 60% of all residents in the city; and 
 
The City Council believes that the State Legislature must act urgently to pass H.3924 
and allow the City to better protect renters during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; 
and 
 
Numerous organizations that prioritize housing justice in Cambridge have endorsed 
H.3924, including the Alliance of Cambridge Tenants, Our Revolution Cambridge, A 
Better Cambridge, and the Cambridge Residents Alliance; now therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record in support of the swift passage of 
H.3924 by the State Legislature and Governor Baker; and be it further

WHEREAS: 

The Old Course at St. Andrews in Scotland, the first golf course in the world and often 
referred to as “The Home of Golf,” is closed on Sundays to allow members of the 
public to access its vast open space for other leisure activities free of charge; and 
 
From May 6th to May 21st, 2020, the City Manager opened the Fresh Pond Golf 
Course, the largest open space in Cambridge, to pedestrians to allow for extra space to 
safely distance; and 
 
During the time it was open to the general public free of charge, the space was widely 
utilized by people walking, jogging, reading, and playing with their kids, which have 
all become more difficult to do in a safe fashion during the COVID-19 pandemic; and 
 
The Council has gone on record asking the City Manager to provide additional space 
across the city to ensure equitable access to open space during the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
 
Golf is an important and safe outdoor activity, and yet golfer needs should be balanced 
with the need for open public space for residents, many of whom cannot afford golf 
fees; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager work with the Department of Human Services Recreation 
Division and other relevant departments to determine the feasibility of identifying one 
evening or day per week that the Fresh Pond Golf Course can be open to the public for 
general use; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the council by the Summer meeting on July 27th, 
2020.

WHEREAS: 

Cambridge residents continue to face financial hardships during the COVID-19 
pandemic, especially low-income families and residents; 
 
According to most federal and state agencies, households that spend more than 30% of 
income on housing costs are “cost burdened,” and households that spend more than 
50% of income on housing are “severely cost burdened;” and 
 
In Cambridge, 42% and 20% of households are cost burdened and severely cost 
burdened, respectively, compared to 29% and 14% of households statewide; and 
 
Cost burden rates are typically higher among renter households, and in Cambridge, 
49% of renters are cost burdened, versus 28% of owners; and 
 

impacts the stability of Cambridge tenants and homeowners, and without continued 
interventions, Cambridge will experience increased tenant displacement and a further 
decline of its socio-economic diversity; and 
 
The Mayor’s Office, City Council, and the Housing Division of the Community 
Development Department, Multi Service Center and City Manager’s Housing Liaison 
have received thousands of emails and phone calls regarding housing and housing 
related questions to the City’s COVID-19 Housing Line; and 
 
Over 1,400 families and residents have been supported financially through the Mayor’s 
Disaster Relief Fund to help with rental payments over a three-month period; and 
 
Governor Baker’s eviction moratorium expires on August 18, 2020 or 45 days after 
Governor Baker lifts the state of emergency, leaving tenants still experiencing financial 
distress with additional stress on housing instability; and 
 
Despite our best efforts to reach as many Cambridge residents facing housing 
insecurity as possible, many residents do not know their rights and the resources 
available to them if they receive an eviction notice; and

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

In anticipation of the needs of tenants after the eviction moratorium ends, and to 
prevent the continued departure of low- and moderate-income households and families, 
it is critical to create strategies and share information and resources with landlords and 
management companies to maintain tenant housing stability; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager is requested to confer with the City Manager’s Housing Liaison 
and Multi Service Center on implementing a Tenants Rights and Resource Notification 
Act that would require owners and management companies to include tenant rights and 
resource information when issuing eviction notifications including at the initial Notice 
to Quit stage and report back to the City Council on July 27, 2020.

The Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) announced they will be closing their East 
Cambridge COVID-19 Testing site Friday, June 26; and 
 
Running through July, the Cambridge Public Health Department will begin to offer 
mobile testing in North Cambridge, The Port and East Cambridge one day each week 
during designated hours; and 
 
Additional neighborhoods may be added to the mobile testing program; and 
 
COVID-19 prevalence in Cambridge is low, and current public health evidence 
suggests schools have not played a significant role in COVID-19 transmission and that 
children, particularly younger children, are less likely than adults to be infected with 
COVID-19; and 
 
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education issued initial Fall School 
Reopening Guidance on June 25, 2020 for schools, which include that schools are not 
required to perform daily temperature checks before staff and students enter the 
building or provide COVID-19 testing; and 
 
As COVID-19 will continue to affect us for a long time, in the absence of a vaccine the 
City of Cambridge and Cambridge Public Schools should consider a plan to implement 
testing for schools; and 
 
Such testing should be made available to all staff and to students who have had 
possible exposures from a family member, household, or from the community-at-large; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Cambridge Public Health Department to discuss 
the feasibility of providing mobile testing at locations throughout the city for families, 
students and school staff; be it further 
 
That the City Manager provide an update to the feasibility of placing mobile testing 
sites by July 27, 2020 in order to provide ample time to prepare for the upcoming 
school year and keep our students and staff safe.

WHEREAS: 

In the wake of George Floyd’s murder, public outcry over the treatment of black lives 
has reverberated around the world; and 
 
Corporate businesses have joined this collective urgency for change around the 
physical and systemic ways black bodies and lives are treated throughout the United 
States; and 
 
Amazon and Whole Foods are two of the many companies that have made public 
statements regarding their support for the Black Lives Matter movement; and 
 
Furthering its verbal solidarity, Whole Foods’ parent company Amazon detailed its 
support for the movement by vowing to donate $10 million to support social justice 
organizations; and 
 
In contrast to this public company-wide support of Black Lives Matter, Whole Foods 
employees in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Washington are being 
sent home for wearing Black Lives Matter face masks; and 
 
Even in our own City, Whole Foods employees at the River Street location have been 
sent home from work for wearing Black Lives Matter face masks; and 
 
The response from Whole Foods states they are supportive of the Black community, 
but are upholding compliance with a dress code that prohibits employees from wearing 
visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising that are not company related; and 
 
This City Council argues that wearing a Black Lives Matter mask follows the dress 
code and is company related as it is aligning with Amazon and Whole Foods’ public 
statements in support of the Black Lives Matter movement; and 
 
Further, Whole Foods and constituents have raised concerns over retail employees 
expressing political statements while at work; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  We hold that the statement Black Lives Matter is not a political statement, rather, it is a 

universal affirmation of a commitment to dismantle the systems of oppression that

Vice Mayor 

 
To: Cambridge City Council 
From: Alanna Mallon, Vice-Mayor 
Date: June 25th, 2020 
Subject: CEOC Update 

 

 
To the Honorable, the City Council, 
 
Since early May, the Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee (CEOC), the Department of Human 
Service Programs (DHSP), Food For Free, and my office have collaborated on a targeted outreach 
campaign to recipients of Food For Free’s home grocery deliveries. Residents received calls from trained 
CEOC staff connecting them to resources like SNAP/WIC, Unemployment Insurance Benefits, grant 
relief programs, rental assistance programs, health insurance, Pandemic EBT, Income Tax and federal 
stimulus check assistance, and so much more. Given the critical work these callers are doing to fill in 
resource gaps in our community when many residents are struggling, I wanted to take the opportunity to 
provide a progress update on the related communication 
<http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=2641&MediaPositio
n=&ID=11827&CssClass=> I submitted to the City Council on May 7th.  
 
The hard work, dedication, and vigilance of the CEOC who made this targeted campaign possible shows 
in the attached CEOC final report. To quickly highlight their key efforts and overwhelming success, out 
of the 1,607 phone numbers we had on file, CEOC connected with and assisted 1,570 Cambridge 
residents with at least one of the above mentioned resources. 279 residents received assistance with more 
than one resource.  
 
By far, the largest resource gap among residents reached was food and nutrition assistance. Whether it 
was helping residents apply for SNAP/WIC, signing them up for Food For Free’s Home Delivery 
program, or advising on food pantry hours, locations, and availability, each resident received highly 
personalized assistance specific to their individual needs. This effort went far beyond the typical targeted

mailer or flyer, and is being thoughtfully integrated into existing onsite food pantries as we speak, to 
ensure long-term continuity of these custom connections. 
 
Over the past several weeks of quarantine, we have been working to adapt this contact model to fit the 
new normal. As food pantries begin expanding their reopening efforts in Cambridge next week, this 
targeted campaign will evolve to offer onsite assistance and connection to resources. In collaboration with 
the Cambridge Housing Authority, Just A Start, and other existing food pantry sites, CEOC will deploy 
staff members to sites, where they will provide face-to-face, real time support, while stringently following 
public health safety protocols. 
 
This public health crisis has deeply impacted nearly every part of our lives, and it has illuminated 
problems with how social services were administered pre-pandemic. As we move forward and discover 
what the new normal will look like, this new onsite, personalized assistance model can help transform 
human service programs, for the better. Food pantries were originally established in the 1970’s as a 
temporary way to address hunger, and while they serve as a critical resource to our most vulnerable 
residents, they can only act as a bandaid to the underlying cycle of poverty. It’s time we transform the 
food pantry model to a new approach that delivers human services in a humane way. Rather than 
continuing to offer temporary solutions to inter-generational problems, we must create pathways out of 
poverty through housing assistance, workforce development opportunities, access to sustainable funding 
for food costs, and more.  
 
This potentially transformative program with CEOC is a promising opportunity that we should not and 
cannot ignore. In the coming weeks, I will continue to work with CEOC to refine this innovative 
program, and I will continue to keep you, my colleagues on the City Council, updated on this program 
and its potential successes.  
 
Thank you, 
 

Alanna Mallon

Cambridge Economic Opportunity Committee - CEOC 
Food Delivery Outreach Project Report 
 

Overview: 
There were 1,892 names on the food delivery list. Of these, 285 did not provided phone numbers. CEOC 
staff called all the numbers on the list and were able to reach a vast majority, either during the first call 
or on a follow-up call. The following chart is the results of these calls and from individuals who contacted 
us through CEOC’s other outreach efforts. 
 
 

Issue 

Through 6/19 

SNAP & P-EBT applications/information 
Unemployment assistance 
Health Insurance application/updates 
Housing assistance 
CCF/City funding assistance 
Food assistance 
Taxes/stimulus payment

CEOC Staff are continuing to reach out to individuals. For those individuals who are receiving Pandemic 
Unemployment Benefits and are therefore over income for SNAP currently, may become eligible once 
this assistance ends. Staff are tracking these individuals and will contact them in July to follow up on 
SNAP and other benefits for which they may be eligible. 
 
In addition, as Food for Free discontinues food/food card delivery, CEOC Staff will be offering outreach 
efforts at the Food Pantries that are open, including CEOC’s, to ensure that patrons have information 
and support in applying for public benefits. 
 
Although we did not collect this data on all individuals, Staff provided assistance to a large number of 
individuals who spoke Amharic, Haitian Creole and Spanish. Staff translated many notices distributed in 
food bags and gift card envelopes into these languages.

Communicating considerations about reopening schools this fall

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
Last Friday, June 19th, the Building and Grounds Subcommittee 
<https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2020/6-19-
20_SC_BGSubCom_notice.pdf> had its third meeting to discuss CPSD’s facilities planning, as it pertains 
to COVID-19 recovery and the reopening of schools in September. Chief Operating Officer Jim Maloney 
shared a working draft of the CPS COVID-19 Policies and Procedures 
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mRpWDzey_D_ohtw9-jod1N62PWHbHLTP/view?usp=sharing>. 
While this document is still largely “under development”, there are many areas yet to be addressed. 
 
On Thursday, June 25th, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education released initial guidance 
on fall reopening of schools <http://www.doe.mass.edu/covid19/return-to-school/guidance.docx> and 
Governor Baker gave a press conference with Commissioner Riley. Districts, including ours, have long 
awaited this document, with hopes that it would provide clear direction in making major decisions.  
 
These guidelines state that districts must provide plans for three different scnearios 1) in-person learning 
with new safety requirements; 2) a hybrid of in-person and remote learning; and 3) completely remote 
learning. Districts must also have a focused plan for serving special student populations across each 
school and submit these plans to DESE in August. 
 
In the 28 pages of this guidance document, there is not much clarity provided. According to DESE, the 
burden of checking temperatures and getting testing falls on the parents, but I hope that we can consider 
the feasibility of both daily temperature checks as well as testing of students and staff in their next 
iteration of the CPS COVID-19 Policies and Procedures. It is also important that CPSD completes a full 
audit of the internal capacity of each classroom, as soon as possible.

Beyond the logistics of adhering to health and safety requirements in a narrow sense, we must be 
concerned about the lack of focus on curriculum and learning as well as providing adequate mental health 
supports. At what cost, will we work to provide a physical semblance of normalcy? In our planning, it is 
imperative that we: 

•  Prioritize  the  quality  of  learning-how  can  we  center  our  students  to  provide  engaging  and 

equitable curricula with the right tools? 

•  Ensure relationship building between scholars and adults they can trust. 
•  Create  a  culture  of  transparency  and  communication  between  our  district  leaders  and 

•  Adequately  address  the  mental  health  and  trauma  of  our  scholars  and  staff  with  robust 

families. 

engagement and support. 

•  Provide creative opportunities for athletics, art, music, and electives for our scholars. 

 
As a minimum, this is what I am advocating for with the support of my colleagues on the School 
Committee. Please join me at 5:00pm on Tuesday, June 30th for the School Committee’s next Special 
Meeting <https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2020/6-
30-2020_SC_SpecialMtg_notice.pdf> where we will hear a COVID-19 update from the Superintendent. I 
am also in the process of finalizing a summer meeting schedule with the School Committee, as we will 
continue to regularly convene via Special Meetings and Subcommittee meetings due to the extenuating 
circumstances. I will keep you updated. 
 
Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns.
