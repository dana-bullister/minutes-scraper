          MARY FLYNN:  Good evening, everyone.  Welcome to 

the October 13, 2020 meeting of the Cambridge Planning 

Board.  My name is Mary Flynn, and I am the Vice Chair 

acting as Chair for this meeting.   

          This meeting is being held remotely, due to the 

statewide emergency orders limiting the size of public 

gatherings in response to COVID-19, and in accordance with 

Governor Charles Baker's Executive Order of March 12, 2020, 

temporarily amending certain requirements of the Open 

Meeting Law; as well as the City of Cambridge's temporary 

emergency restrictions on city public meetings, city events, 

and city permitted events, due to COVID-19, amended on 

September 2, 2020.  

                    This meeting is being video and audio 

recorded, and is being streamed live on the City of 

Cambridge online meeting portal and on cable television

Channel 22, within Cambridge.  There will also be a 

transcript of the proceedings. 

          All Board members, applicants, and members of the 

public will state their names before speaking.  All votes 

will be taken by roll call.   

          Members of the public will be kept on mute until 

it is time for public comment.  I will give instructions for 

public comment at that time, and you can also find 

instructions on the city's webpage for remote Planning Board 

meetings.  

          I will start by asking Staff to take Board member 

attendance and verify that all members are audible.  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  Just doing a 

quick attendance check, as always, and I'll just go through 

each of the Planning Board members and check to see if the 

meeting is clearly audible to you.  Starting with Louis 

Bacci, are you present, is the meeting audible to you?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Present and the meeting is 

audible.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Lou.  H Theodore Cohen, 

are you present and is the meeting audible to you?   

          H THEODORE COHEN: [Pause]

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I am present, and the meeting is 

audible to me.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Tom.  Corinne Espinoza, 

are you present, and is the meeting audible to you?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I'm present, and the meeting is 

audible to me.       

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Corinne. Nikolas Bowie

          [Pause] Okay.  It's confirmed that Nikolas Bowie 

and Catherine Preston Connolly are absent. And Mary Flynn, 

obviously you're present.  Can you just confirm that the 

rest of the meeting is audible to me?        

          MARY FLYNN:  It is audible to me, I can hear 

everyone, thank you. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Sure.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's seven members present.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Great.  Thank you, Jeff.  The first 

item is an Update from the Community Development.  And I'd 

ask that you please also introduce the staff present at the 

meeting.  Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Mary.  I'll handle this 

again.  Just a quick run-through; Swaathi Joseph on my team 

in Zoning and Development is with me as cohost and running 

the slides.  Also -- actually that's just the two of us from 

Zoning and Development today. 

          But also from Community Development is Erik 

Thorkildsen in Urban Design and Khalil Mogassabi, the Chief 

Planner and Deputy Director of our department.  That does it 

for City Staff.

          As for updates, just a quick calendar update.  We 

have one public hearing tonight and that will be it.  Next 

week we have a meeting, October 20.   

          There is also one public hearing scheduled.  It's 

a development proposal at 325 Binney Street -- that's the 

old Metropolitan Pipe site, which is the subject of a zoning 

petition that was adopted very early this year. 

          We're also going to have a Design Update on a 

project that the Planning Board saw earlier at 55 Wheeler 

Street.  That's heading towards a building permit phase, and 

there are some changes that Staff wanted to discuss with the 

Board, so that will be an item of General Business. 

          And then October 27 we will have a preapplication 

conference on a PUD proposal for the Volpe site by MIT.  MIT 

is beginning their community engagement and outreach 

associated with that development proposal. 

          And as part of that process they'll be coming to 

the Planning Board for a preapplication conference that 

basically is -- it's not a formal application, they'll be 

coming to the Board to give a presentation of what they -- 

just the general concept of what they're proposing. 

          And it's an opportunity for some feedback and

discussion for Board members. And Staff will be there to 

contribute as well.  So that will be October 27. 

          And November 3, as I mentioned, there is an 

election.  Then we won't have a meeting. 

          On November 10 we have a meeting scheduled, and at 

this point we have that scheduled as a public hearing on the 

Canal District Kendall PUD.  This is actually a -- it's a 

restarted petition, but also kind of -- also kind of a 

continuation because the Board had a hearing on this 

earlier.  It's the constellation center site in Kendall 

Square. 

          The following week on November 17, we currently 

have scheduled a public hearing on the proposed amendment to 

the MXD Zoning District.   

          That's very close to the previous what I mentioned 

in Kendall Square, and this is a proposal to change the 

zoning that would permit more commercial development, and 

that is part of the multiparty arrangement to find a 

location for Eversource electrical transformer station.  So 

that is November 17. 

          So a lot of zoning in Kendall Square in November.  

There will be Ordinance Committee hearings on those two 

9

petitions, respectively -- November 12 for the Biomed Realty 

petition and November 19 for the MXD Amendment, for which 

the petitioner is the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. 

          That is all we have scheduled at the point, but we 

expect we'll be seeing a lot more in the late fall and early 

winter.  And I will leave it there, thanks.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you Jeff.  If there are 

any questions from any of the Board members, would you 

please say your name and then ask your question? 

          Okay, hearing none let's move onto agenda item 

number 1.

          MARY FLYNN:  A public hearing on case PB #356, an 

amendment to a special permit application by Duncan 

MacArthur, to convert an existing commercial printing 

building into three units of housing with off-street parking 

located on the contiguous property. 

          CDD Staff will begin by summarizing why this is

before us, and I believe that Erik Thorkildsen is going to 

do that for us.  Erik?   

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This 

is Erik Thorkildsen.  The Board might remember that this 

site from a hearing held back in January, when the Board 

granted relief for the conversion of a nonresidential 

building to a three-unit residence.   

          The same applicant is still proposing a conversion 

to three units, but has revised the plan in a number of 

ways, and staff determined that it was a substantial enough 

change that it should come back to the Board for a new 

hearing and a special permit decision.   

          The approval criteria are the same as before, and 

they are included in the materials we provided to the Board.  

Thank you.       

          ROBERT LIN:  Thank you, Erik.  All right, our 

presenter tonight is Robert Lynn on behalf of the applicant.  

You will have up to three minutes for your presentation, 

though the Board may allow additional time at our 

discretion.  Please begin by introducing your project team.  

Thank you.  Mr. Lin? 

          ROBERT LIN:  Hi, thank you Mary.  I'm here today

with an architect who works with me, Catherine Signal, and 

the project owner and developer, Duncan McArthur.  And I 

appreciate you guys taking your evening to hear this one 

case.   

          I was telling Jeff earlier that we were at a 

Historic Commission meeting where we were, like, seventh or 

eighth on the list and we weren’t heard until after 

midnight, and finished around 1:00.   

          So this is -- I appreciate everyone taking the 

time to hear this one case, and the fact that you're 

dividing them out more parsimoniously. 

          So when we presented to you back in January, we 

had a very similar scheme in terms of program -- still three 

units, three residential units, same amount of parking, 

same/similar parking setup and similar open space setup on 

the contiguous lot. 

          And we had every intention of moving forward after 

the special permit was granted, but the first thing we did 

was we began some site structural investigation digging some 

holes and test pits around the building and within the 

building.   

          And we were very surprised to find that the 

12

perimeter structure did not have a continuous foundation 

wall underneath the structure.   

          And it was -- it's a masonry clad building, a 

wood-frame masonry clad building, but the post and beam 

structure was actually embedded in that wood frame wall, so 

that there were some piers at each one of the post 

locations, but not a continuous footing and a beam that ran 

from pier to pier at grade level. 

          And our original design, as you may all remember, 

was really reconfiguring the interior dramatically.  We were 

within what's currently a two-story structure.   

          We were adding an additional story within that 

5.28, we were staying within the volume, but we were really 

reconfiguring the interior and moving a lot of the column 

grids around in order to do that.  And so, we had created a 

situation where we were transferring a lot of our loads out 

to that perimeter wall.             

          And so, as we were working with our structural 

engineers, we realized that really to achieve the design 

that we had been approved -- that the Board had approved us 

for, we're really going to have to underpin the entire 

foundation wall.

          And so, this was all happening -- you know, 

concurrently with a changing, you know global environment.   

          And it just felt to us that maybe there was a way 

to rework this project so that we were able to preserve more 

of the existing structure and use the perimeter pier 

structure that's in place with potentially some amount of -- 

you know, some little bit of underpinning, but maintaining 

more of the internal grid structure.   

          So Swaathi, I don't know if -- I don't know how 

quite advance -- to tell you to advance the slides, but 

yeah. 

          So our current -- our new proposal, where our old 

proposal was asking for 90 -- roughly 9700 square feet of 

gross floor area, because we were adding that additional 

floor, we're just going to keep the two levels. 

          Plus we're asking for an additional headhouse 

level that expands beyond the volume of the existing 

structure, which takes us out of 5.28, and we had some back 

and forth with Ranjit and Swaathi helped us and the Staff 

helped us kind of think through this. 

          And we realized that we would go through this 

process with the Planning Board to amend our proposal, and 

14

12

13

16

18

21

22

then if we're approved, we already have in place -- well, 

we've applied for a hearing with BZA for that additional 

gross square footage.   

          So while we're asking for roughly 1000 square feet 

less than what was approved by the Planning Board, there's 

still roughly a 500 square feet differential between the 

square footage that's in the building now and what we're 

hoping for with the addition of these head houses on the 

third floor.   

          So I won't go into all of it.  You can see the -- 

you guys have the chart in front of you, but it shows that 

we're asking for roughly 500 square feet more than what's 

there now. 

          But one of the other tradeoffs is that before you 

had granted some relief for private open space, whereas now 

we're not going to be asking for that.  We've increased some 

of the yard space, some of the permeable open space, and 

we've added the additional roof decks on the roof.   

          And this is all in response to kind of what we're 

imagining is the new normal, where people are really needing 

additional flex space, needing an outdoor space, and an 

additional kind of private outdoor space.

          So those are really the fundamental changes that 

this project is proposing relative to what was approved back 

in -- when you saw it back in January, approved in April. 

          Swaathi, if you could advance the slides?  So this 

is the context, which is the same slide that we proposed 

before.  You can see on those lower three images that, you 

know, that's the view along the tracks, and that's the 

converted warehouse to the right.  We're still in the same 

contextual family as those projects. 

          And the neighborhood to the left, which was 54 

Creighton, which is Number 2 in that little corner image, 

has been the neighbor that's been most impacted by this 

project.   

          And when we talked to Liza and Swaathi about kind 

of moving forward with this amended project, they felt that 

that was the -- or the staff, I assume the entire staff felt 

-- that they were the neighbors that we should be the most 

concerned that whatever we're changing it to felt like it 

was a change that they would appreciate, and that was, you 

know, working for them. 

          And so, throughout this process we've met with 

them, and they've been amazing.  They've hosted us again in

their back yard.  We've shown them what we're proposing a 

couple of different times between what we did before.  We've 

amended what we had proposed -- some intermediate scheme to 

get to where we are now, and I believe they are on this Zoom 

call -- Judy and Tom.  And hopefully they can speak up if 

they feel like it when it's time for community 

participation. 

          But the scheme that we're showing now is one that 

we negotiated with them.  And it changes where we had a kind 

of more open green wall for a section against their house.   

          Now we're going to keep the entire masonry façade 

and open it up with some fire-rated glass block.  So there 

will still be some light that we'll get from that back side, 

but no longer will there be any, like, true transparent 

visibility between, you know, the people on 56 and tom and 

Judy's property. 

          And then that was something they felt really -- I 

think -- I believe, and they'll corroborate this -- they 

felt good about it.  Because it preserved their very private 

and sort of unusual back yard space that has, you know, 

these two walls, which will now have glass block and brick. 

          And actually I think the process, the construction 

17

process, will be a bit less invasive for them because we 

won't be taking down quite as much.  So that was our primary 

sort of community outreach working with them to get to where 

we are now. 

          Swaathi, if you could advance? Yep.   

          So this just shows -- just a reminder -- this 

shows that the project really consists of three parcels; 56, 

which is that trapezoidal shape, 56R, which is the long, 

rectangular shape, and then I think it's Lot 1A, which is 

that funny little other small trapezoid, which are all part 

of the same project boundary footprint that we're working 

with. 

          The little trapezoid is an easement for the Regent 

Street property, where they have some rights to park on 

that.  But it's still calculated as part of our overall, you 

know, floor area when we're considering the lot area and 

setbacks and so forth.  If you could advance, Swaathi -- 

thank you. 

          So in the interim between our last hearing and 

this hearing, we started the process with DPW to work 

through the curb cut, and we've achieved curb cut approval.  

          They went through their public hearing, and the 

18

Council approved this, and it was through a bit of back and 

forth with DPW sending some information to the neighbor 

across the street, like, working with their planners to 

create a slightly different curb cut situation.   

          So there's a 20-foot opening, and it juts out from 

the opposite side of Creighton Street, and in our previous 

proposal we were imagining we were just going to be keeping 

the non-curb sidewalk that ran along Creighton Street.   

          We're now proposing a curb -- a true curb that 

runs all along the side of Creighton Street and turns that 

corner, so that there's now going to be a curb on both 

sides, and a pinched opening. 

          But that allowed for the preservation of parking 

space on the opposite side of the street and potentially for 

some parking in front of the Creighton Street side, our 

side, 56 side. 

          The layout of the parking spaces is relatively 

similar to what we've shown before.  We're still proposing 

that there are six spaces, but we've tightened it up a 

little bit to increase the open space and the yard space.   

          So actually, Swaathi, if you could advance to the 

next?  Yeah.

          So in the very lower left-hand corner, you can see 

that we've added -- we preserved all of those significant 

trees, but we're imagining that space to be a shared outdoor 

yard space.  And so, we've pulled, or tightened our parking 

up a little bit to accommodate that. 

          And then each one of the units now will have their 

own little bit of exterior yard space that will be fenced 

off from public and from each other.  So Unit 1 will have a 

little yard right there closest to Tom and Judy's.  

          And one of the things they were very concerned 

about was that they wanted to make sure that their -- when 

they pulled into their driveway, that they would be able to 

open their car door.  So that while we're showing a fence, 

it's not right there on the corner.  There's a little bit of 

a landscaping component.   

          And we'll just be sure to work with them to make 

sure that there's no pinch when they pull in their car; that 

they're able to get their door open. 

          So there's -- and then an entry to the units 

between the two, and then another for Unit 2 off of 

Creighton Street. 

          And then Unit 3 has a little outdoor space that's 

20

right at the very back corner of the long 56R, right at that 

little easement trapezoid.  They have their own little back 

yard space.  So that pulled the parking together a little 

bit tighter, so that we could give everybody that sense of 

their own private outdoor area. 

          Swaathi, if you could advance. 

          So we can flip through these quickly, but you can 

see the columns.  These are the existing drawings.  This is 

the column grid, and where the column hits the perimeter 

wall, there's also posts that are buried in the wall all 

around the perimeter.   

          So that was the -- well, maybe it shouldn't have 

been a surprise, but that was the surprise that really 

started driving the changes that we're proposing. 

          We can go to the next level.  This is just the 

second floor, same column grid. You can move on. 

          So our proposal is very much the same as what we 

had before -- three units divided roughly in the same way 

that we have been before.  But because now we're just having 

the two floors, the lower floor's really going to be more of 

a true loft space.   

          And the spaces are going to be set up so that they 

21

22

take advantage of the column grid.  And our façade is more 

related to the rhythm of the column grid.   

          So there are these very big openings that are 

happening between each one of the grid spaces all around the 

perimeter, and we're preserving as many of the interior 

posts that we can.  And I think it'll be a bit more of a 

raw, industrial sort of loft feeling, where before we were 

really -- it was essentially new construction within an 

exterior shell.   

          You know, we're truly preserving the and 

industrial building, and I think we'll try to keep a lot of 

the industrial flavor.   

          And as you see when we get closer to the exterior, 

that's really what's driving a lot of our decisions on the 

exterior as well.  So big open floor plan on the first floor 

with divisions happening at these entry locations between 

the units.   

          You can advance to the next slide. 

          And then on the second floor we have three 

bedrooms, and, you know, a master, two other bedrooms, and 

then they each -- they have, at least the one on the back 

side that's closest to Tom and Judy's and the one to the 

22

right both have patio spaces that create sort of a buffer 

between the two, but also allow for us to have our egress 

windows from our bedrooms without having to penetrate that 

back wall that's running along that column line 5. 

          And that was one of the things that was driving a 

lot of our big changes to that back wall, where we were 

having to pull away from it, pull five feet inboard so that 

we could get egress out that backside. 

          Now all the egress happens along these patio 

spaces that bring you out to the face of the building, and 

allow for -- you know, us to satisfy that code requirement.  

So we're able to preserve the privacy pulled back a way 

without having to do too much of too many gymnastics around 

those two party wall pieces on 5 and 14. 

          And then if you go to the next level. 

          These are the spaces that we're going through the 

BZA to ask for the additional gross floor area.  So we're 

staying within the 35-foot limit.  So what we've done here 

is because we didn't want the smaller bedrooms and bathroom 

spaces to have these super tall loft-like ceilings within 

small spaces, here we're going to cut down the height of the 

second floor so that we can set these a floor down below the 

23

22

-- so we're about three feet finished floor roughly three 

feet below what was the current roof line.   

          So there's a built-in guardrail around the 

perimeter of the structure, which creates both a kind of an 

auditory and visual barrier for the people when they're on 

these roof decks. 

          But then each one of the units gets their own 

flex-through, which in this day in age feels really 

important to have a home office as part of any kind of 

development project -- a home office or a, you know, whether 

they use it as a gym or just outdoor space.   

          Because I think so many people at this point are, 

you know, feeling like for the indefinite future they will 

be working from home.  And then also as I mentioned at the 

beginning, there's much more outdoor roof door space.   

          Each one of these units has a larger space than we 

had before, and it's really just bigger outdoor areas, so 

that, you know, there could be gatherings or, you know, 

whatever people want to do, where now currently people are 

wanting the outside and in a more ventilated space.   

          So I want to just say very clearly for the record, 

because we didn't spell this out, I think in our narrative, 

24

22

that we see this project as being really fundamentally -- 

hinges on BZA approving these head houses.  Because the -- 

our previous scheme had four bedrooms, and it gave us that 

flex space that we were talking -- that I'm talking about 

that we feel is so necessary in any current developments. 

          And so, without these rooms on the top, this 

project, we feel, doesn't work in the way that, you know, 

that feels like it's marketable in today's world.   

          And so, what I wanted to say very clearly for the 

record was that if BZA -- if you see fit to approve these 

changes, but BZA does not see fit to allow us this 

additional gross floor area outside of the volume that's 

allowed by 5.28, that we would probably go ahead and work 

with the scheme that was approved back in January.  Because 

that was satisfied with the four bedrooms. 

          And so, what -- you know, while it's much less of 

a preservation project, there would be many, many more 

gymnastics to kind of underpin the foundation wall around 

the perimeter.  I think it would be worth it to the 

developer, to Duncan, and to the project to revert back to 

that scheme. 

          So what I'm hoping is that if the Planning Board 

25

22

sees fit to approve these changes, that it's contingent upon 

us approving -- getting the approval by BZA.  And if not, we 

don't want to lose the ability to do the previous scheme 

that was already approved. 

          So I know that's asking a lot of, like, you know, 

moving parts.  But that's where we're going with this 

project.   

          So we can move to the next one.  So on our -- oh, 

I'm sorry, could you go back, Swaathi, for one minute.  Just 

want to just point out that in the very center between 

gridlines 9 and 10 is where we're putting all the mechanical 

space, all the mechanical units.   

          And because I was -- as I mentioned before, it's 

set down, it's three feet below, so I don't think you ever -

- no one would ever see them, and they're relatively quiet 

heat pumps, because we're thinking that it's very likely it 

would be an entirely electric HVAC system.   

          So it would be very quiet and I think entirely 

screened from the public, being so far in the middle of the 

space and set down from the parapet. 

          And then above on the roof of each one of those 

head houses that we're asking permission for will be solar

panels.   

          So if you can move on, thank you. 

          So these are the existing façades.  But you can 

see, even though they're a little bit all over the place, 

there's the sense of the rhythm of the different bays -- you 

know, clear from the fenestration and the window placement.  

          If you move on?   

          And then this is the -- this is the back wall 

that's right at the 54 Creighton, that's the Tom and Judy's 

wall that we're going to be preserving, although we'd be 

adding more glass block to it.  But we'll be removing these 

windows that are there currently that are transparent.  So 

our hope is they'll actually have more privacy in the end 

than they do currently. 

          We can move on to the next one, please. 

          So this is our scheme.  So the top elevation is 

the Creighton Street.  You know, we're trying to pick up on 

the rhythm of the bays.   

          Our glazing system we're thinking will be 

insulated glass with simulated, divided lights, and where 

before we were thinking it would be a European system, it's 

more likely to be an American system.  Duncan maybe can

22

speak to the particular manufacturer; I don't think we're 

quite there yet.  But it will be divided lights, but 

simulated insulated glass.   

          And then that back façade, which is the one that's 

facing the neighbors, all of that will be fire-rated glass 

bock, with no transparency.  All right, if you can move to 

the next --  

          Oh, and just before we -- yeah, I can talk about 

it on this one too, but the -- we're going to keep -- our 

idea is to keep even the brick veneer that's there now on 

the Creighton Street and the track side and clad it with a 

metal cladding, possibly insulated metal cladding -- rigid 

insulation behind it, but that will just go on top of what's 

there currently.   

          And exactly what it is, it's either a standing 

seam or an insulated panel or maybe even a corrugated metal.  

But we're thinking that it's a more industrial feeling.   

          Now, if you can move to the next, thank you. 

          And this is the track side façade.  And in the 

memo, the staff had talked about the question about why 

there was no window above the openings on both the last 

elevation of this one.   

28

17

18

19

20

21

22

          But right where the opening to the main entrance 

is is where the dividing the party walls are, so that if we 

were going to put some sort of glazing above that window, it 

would be divided by a fire-rated wall.   

          So to us, it was a more honest interpretation, 

just have a recess so that we were speaking to the bay 

system without, you know, trying to create some kind of 

opaque glass that was hiding where there was a real division 

between units.   

          And the other -- one of the other comments in the 

memo was the proportion of the space above those windows.  

And that's what I was referring to before, that we've 

lowered -- we're lowering -- proposing to lower the roof of 

the second floor for those head houses so that they're more 

hidden from the street creates that sort of guardrail around 

the perimeter, and satisfies the privacy for our neighbors. 

          So this is the view from Creighton, and then the 

view from the tracks. 

          And I think that's it.  Duncan or Catherine, I 

don't know if either of you wanted to add anything, if I 

forgot to say something, or --    

          DUNCAN MACARTHUR:  This is Duncan.  I think you

pretty much covered everything.     

          ERIK THORKILDSEN:  Good.         

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Well, thank you very much 

for that.  It was very helpful to get the detailed 

explanation as to the reasons for the design changes, since 

it wasn't completely clear from your application.  So I 

appreciate the amount of detail you went into. 

          This is a public hearing, so we will go to that 

now.  Any members of the public who wish to speak should now 

click the icon at the bottom of your Zoom screen that says, 

"Raise hand."  If you're calling in by phone, you can raise 

your hand by pressing *9. 

          As of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the Board had not 

received any written comments on this case.  Written 

communications received after 5:00 p.m. yesterday will also 

be entered into the record.  Let's see, now.   

          Okay, we do have one person at least who would 

like to state something.  So I'll ask Jeff to unmute 

speakers one at a time.  You should begin by saying your 

name and address, and staff will confirm that we can hear 

you.  After that you'll have up to three minutes before I 

ask you to wrap up, please.  So Jeff?

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I am going to allow you to unmute 

yourself now.  And you can, as Mary said, begin by saying 

your name and address.   

Creighton Street.   

          JUDY HIKES:  Hi, I am Judy Hikes.  I live at 52-54 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thanks.  You can go ahead.   

          JUDY HIKES:  I want to say that as Robert said -- 

he and Catherine and at some point Duncan have gone over 

everything with us every step of the way.   

          So my husband and I -- my husband Tom and I are 

definitely on board with this current plan.  We actually 

like it better than the plan that they might have to go back 

to, but we are -- I just wanted to state that we're on board 

with this plan.        

Catherine and Duncan.   

          SPEAKER UNIDENTIFIED:  Thank you Robert and 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, I heard another speaker.  

Can you say your name, please?

          TOM DALY:  D-a-l-y.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  I think that concludes 

that speaker.  So there are some other speakers.  Froylan 

Hernandez-Ruiz, you can unmute yourself.  Please begin with 

your name and address. 

          FROYLAN HERNANDEZ:  Thank you.  My name is Froylan 

Hernandez-Ruiz, and I live in 61 Creighton Street.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah.  We can hear you, so you can 

go ahead, thank you.   

          FROYLAN HERNANDEZ:  I have two comments or 

questions.  One is that in the drafts from this amendment, I 

saw that there is no clear pedestrian access from Creighton 

Street through Brighton Regent Street.   

          I'm looking at the memo from the CDD January 7.  

It says the project would benefit the pedestrian ground, so 

I didn't -- I would appreciate if that could be considered 

to review, to confirm that there will be pedestrian access. 

          The second comment is a suggestion to consider to 

continue the three-line pattern that is already in Regent 

Street over the current road right-of-way.  Because 

currently since the previous owner of that area was -- is

considering the city plans to have a bike way, the housing 

could be an opportunity for the DPW and CDD to continue that 

existing tree line pattern.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  Oh, hang on, I -- it sounded 

like you had something more to say.   

          FROYLAN HERNANDEZ-RUIZ:  Yes, I sent it in a 

communication earlier today, with these two comments.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay, thank you.  Well, it'll be 

entered into the record.   

          FROYLAN HERNANDEZ-RUIZ:  So the next speaker is 

Michael Brandon.  You can unmute yourself.  Begin with your 

name and address, please?  I believe you're -- okay, you're 

unmuted now.     

          MICHAEL BRANDON:  Thank you, Jeff.  It's Michael 

Brandon, 27 Seven Pines Avenue.  I'm a clerk for the North 

Cambridge Stabilization Committee.   

          And we were a little surprised to see this back 

before the Planning Board.  There's been no further outreach 

in terms of a preapplication community meeting to our group.  

We originally saw a very preliminary plan that was presented 

to us.  At that point, it wasn't even clear how many units 

were going to be proposed.

          There were a bunch of other issues that were 

raised that were not included in the description of the 

meeting that was submitted as part of the special permit 

application. 

          So we would appreciate an opportunity to -- you 

know, review that as a group to review this revised 

proposal, which is pretty significantly different, if it 

involves a variance.   

          There were other issues that we felt were not 

adequately addressed having to do with -- some of which the 

staff has raised, and I want to thank them.  They did a very 

good and apparently thorough job of reviewing the proposal 

and issues that I think the Planning Board would want to 

review again.   

          So I guess we would suggest that you continue this 

hearing and ask the proponents to supply the various 

drawings and details that are outlined on page 4 of CDD's 

staff memo.   

          Some of them I think were referred to tonight, but 

I'm not sure all.  There was a question about bicycle 

parking, location.  The sidewalk -- installing curbing on 

Creighton Street, which has been a question all along, and

we tried to raise that at the City Council when they had the 

curb cut before them, but unfortunately, we're not -- didn't 

have an opportunity to be heard in time.   

          Someone was going to ask about lighting, material 

and color of the fence…  Plant species; that was an issue 

that came up in our original September meeting with them 

that great concern about the loss of the tree canopy.  In 

fact, two mature trees were taken down to create what the 

current plan shows as a driveway into 56R.   

          We would like to see -- you know, what we'd like 

to see would be -- and I would think the Board might want a 

detailed landscape plan identifying what's there now, what's 

going away, and so forth.  Utility meters were also asked 

about.  That's been a controversial issue even very 

recently. 

          So I don't want to take too much time, but there 

are other issues that we think should be addressed.  Also 

I'm curious to know what -- well, I'll save that, because I 

don't want to go over my time.   

          But thank you very much for considering this.  I 

hope you will look closely at details.  Thank you.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you.  That concludes our list

of speakers.  If there's anybody else present who hasn't 

spoken yet that would like to speak, please push the, "Raise 

hand" button or *9 on your phone.  I'm seeing none, so I'll 

turn it back over to Mary, thanks.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you, Jeff.  So we will 

now move from public comment to Board discussion.  If this 

moves to a second public hearing, there will be another 

opportunity for public comment at that time.  Additional 

written comments may also be submitted.   

          Just for the record, we have also received memos 

on this application from staff at the Community Development, 

the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department, and the 

Department of Public Works. 

          So let's turn now to the Board.  Do any Board 

members have questions at this time, either for the staff or 

for the applicant?  And if you do, would you please raise 

your hand?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I have a question, Mary.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, Hugh?  We have black and white 

renderings, and I'm wondering what is the intention of the 

color or value of the vertical material, and of the spandrel 

material.

          I would note that the spandrel material appears 

three different ways on the rendering.  One is solid gray; 

one is solid white and the other is gray and white striped.  

So -- but I just think, I'd like to get an idea of what 

they're thinking about for color.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Mr. Lin, do you want 

to answer that, please?   

          ROBERT LIN:  Sure.  Our thought is that we want 

the façade to feel like it is comfortably fitting in an 

industrial aesthetic.  So the metal will be a metal color.  

          And I have a -- I have a -- if I could -- can I 

share my screen, am I allowed to show anything?  Swaathi, do 

you need to give me permission, or Jeff?  Is that possible?  

I have a little slide that I can show with some different 

metal examples.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So it should be now set so you can 

share your screen --                

          ROBERT LIN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- if we stop sharing.              

          ROBERT LIN:  Okay.  It's saying that I can't share 

because someone else still has it.      

          SPEAKER UNIDENTIFIED:  Okay, I'm trying to stop my

share.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.                 

          ROBERT LIN:  Okay.                  

          ROBERT LIN:  So I don't think -- as I mentioned 

before, we're not fully sure what the metal panel is.  But 

this is the language that we're thinking about, and I think 

there will be some wood at the underside, maybe to keep the 

entry in the canopy some vertical siding.   

          Maybe it's going to be a little bit more in a 

corrugated piece like this with some highlighted pieces for 

the spandrel.  I think we're still working our way through 

exactly what that is.   

          But it could also be, as I mentioned before, a 

standing scene, which in this case is a little bit of a 

darker gray.  But I think these gray and metal tones, I 

think this is an insulated vertical metal panel. 

          This is the language that we're thinking about, 

with the -- I think with the window mullions a darker, maybe 

a black mullion and a darker spandrel panel to match the 

infill.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Does that answer your question 

sufficiently, Hugh?

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It really does, and I very much 

also like that thinking.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you.  Other questions?  

No.  Okay.  In that case, then, we can move onto your 

thoughts on this project.  So Hugh, since you asked the 

question, do you want to start with comments?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  If I could -- this is Jeff; could I 

-- if I could interrupt for a second, I think I see 

Corinne's hand raised, I don't know.   

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, is it?  I'm sorry.  All right, 

then.  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  I wanted to ask if 

the applicant would address the questions from the public 

from Mr. Hernandez-Ruiz and Mr. Brandon, please?             

          ROBERT LIN:  Sure.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Robert, is that something you're 

going to address, or --                  

          ROBERT LIN:  Yep.  Yes, I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm 

trying to find the --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Thank you.  Let's 

see, pedestrian access, tree-lined path, et cetera.          

          ROBERT LIN:  Let's see.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Pedestrian access, tree-lined 

path, et cetera.                    

          ROBERT LIN:  Yep, sorry.  Let me -- I've just got 

to find the -- I want to show the most current scheme.  So 

our thought with this issue was that we're -- we've always 

been maintaining the idea that along this side of Creighton 

Street, we would allow access through the site to what might 

be this future pedestrian access.  That's something that's 

always been part of the process since we originally talked 

with staff.   

          So this dotted line is an area that we're --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Robert?  Excuse me for interrupting, 

but I can't see your screen yet.                   

          ROBERT LIN:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.       

          MARY FLYNN:  That's okay.                     

          ROBERT LIN:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Sorry.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yep.                   

          ROBERT LIN:  Is that better?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you, yep, yeah.                 

          ROBERT LIN:  So this dotted line here is the 

access point from what we're imagining is along this 

Creighton Street sidewalk to what may be any kind of future

path along the MBTA lines. 

          The connection from our site over to Regent Street 

we're imagining is never going to be blocked off.  Currently 

there's Jersey barriers along this edge.  But we've always 

imagined that you either move this way, and move along what 

would be the bike path along this edge, then come around 

this way of the site, or potentially even walk through this 

way.   

          But there's no intention to block off any access 

from Creighton Street over to Regent Street.  That's always 

been something that we've talked about at every one of our 

hearings that we're very open to maintaining. 

          In terms of the significant trees, there's a 

couple of trees that were here, but both were deemed unfit 

by an arborist, and we were allowed to take these two down, 

which will allow for this curb cut.   

          And all of these in red are additional significant 

trees that we're keeping, and we're assuming that we'll be 

planting some additional trees around the perimeter. 

          And our thought was that we would work with staff 

to develop exactly what this planting was and, you know, to 

kind of go through what the different species were.  We're 

41

assuming there will be lighting all around the perimeter.  

Again, we would assume that we work with staff to develop 

the finer details of that.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Corinne, does that satisfy --          

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes, thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- your question?  Okay, thank you.           

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Mm-hm.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I apologize for not seeing your hand 

up.  Okay.  So let me just double check and be sure that 

none of the other Board members have their hands up, and I 

don't see any so -- okay, let's -- then return to the Board 

and comments, and let's go back to Hugh if we could.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Thank you.  I just have a few 

suggestions.  Perhaps I should start by saying I think this 

is an excellent plan for what they're trying to accomplish.  

It's been very -- it's very thoughtful and the work with the 

direct abutter is very impressive to me. 

          I didn't actually look at the previous plan, but 

it just seems an improvement.  Now Erik in his memo brought 

up a few questions, and I have some thoughts.  One of his 

points was to reduce the height of the fence on Creighton 

Street somewhat.

21

22

          Now, the condition there is that there's a patio 

that's sort of partway up the fence, so that -- although it 

might be six feet from the street, from the patio side it's 

three or four feet tall.   

          I would suggest that six feet is okay, and that 

maybe you consider dropping the level of the patios by a 

single step, like eight inches, to get a little more privacy 

for the people who are actually sitting out there. 

          And the next comment was about providing curbside 

street trees, and of course I am supporting that.  The other 

comment had to do with the windows over the door.  And I 

have an idea that I'd like to put forward.   

          And that is that the recessed window become the 

spandrel material, which is presumably darker and closer to 

the color of the window, and the partial spandrel between 

the I think canopy be the actual base, vertically lined 

material.   

          I think that little move pulls together the façade 

at this point where there's some unusual things happening.  

So I'd ask you to consider that strategy as an alternative 

to try and put in some windows that really don't work in the 

plan because of the way that the visor walls work.

          And that's it.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Lou, 

would you like to go next?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Sure.  I agree.  This plan 

seems to be a much more livable arrangement to the more 

private open space and so forth.  I'm glad they work with 

the neighbors.   

          Street trees:  Always.  I guess they're worried 

about getting stuck with this plan, but I think this is a 

better plan.  That's pretty much all I have.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you.  Steven Cohen, 

would you go next, please?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Sure.  You know, I think this 

was a challenging project structurally and aesthetically.  

And, you know, we are maybe dealing with neighbors as well.  

And I think they've come up with good solutions for some of 

these challenging issues.  I'm delighted to hear the support 

from their neighbors.   

          I want to be sure that we make it clear now a 

decision that we recommend to the BZA that they grant the 

variance, that is necessary for this plan.   

          And the alternative, of course, is I think less

desirable than the design that they are seeking from the 

BZA.  So, you know, we should support that.   

          Overall, I think the original application was 

good.  I think this one is better.  So I certainly support 

it.         

next, please?             

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, thank you.  Tom, would you go 

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  I don't have much to add.  I 

concur with my fellow Board members that this proposal is 

stronger than the one that we saw before, which I liked.  I 

remember the hearing, and I appreciate that it's more 

livable.  And I think that the pavilions on the roof, to the 

extent they now deal with a new reality of working at home 

will provide for that. 

          It is a very positive change, and I understand how 

that works.  It also I think rationalizes the outdoor space 

in a wonderful way.  Street trees:  Yes.  We're the Planning 

Board, of course we endorse street trees.  Thank you.  

That's where I am.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Thank you.  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.  I think this is a great 

plan.  I walk by this property almost every day.  The

development in this area at the end of all these streets by 

the railroad tracks have really been excellent.  All the 

renovations of the old small commercial or factory buildings 

have really turned out very well, very attractive -- I think 

are a real addition to the neighborhood. 

          I was happy with the old plan, but I think this 

one is really an improvement.  And I think any issues that 

are left open can certainly be resolved in discussions with 

          And along with Steve, I support that if the 

application to the BZA is for what we've seen now, our 

decision, or we should just be supporting it and not have to 

come back and discuss it yet again.  But I think it looks 

staff.   

great. 

          What is there now is just barren and parking lot, 

and this will be a vast improvement to the building and for 

the neighborhood.                 

          MARY FLYNN:  Great, thank you.  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  So I think that 

most but not all of certain things that were mentioned in 

the staff memo have been addressed.   

          So my comment would be that the applicant should

work with staff to make sure that all of the details of the 

site plan are clarified as described in the Staff memo.  

          And also, that more specificity is provided 

regarding external materials and features as identified in 

the staff memo, as well as the items specifically called out 

for continuing review.  That's my only comment.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Thank you very much.  All 

right.  Well, it sounds to me that -- as though we are 

prepared to take action on this tonight.  I don't have 

anything to add.  I agree with my colleagues, I think it's a 

great project.   

          I actually did prefer the earlier design -- as I 

said, the discussion and presentation tonight made it clear 

as to why you were moving in this direction.  So I feel like 

I can support it wholeheartedly. 

          So are we as a Board, then, prepared to take 

action on this tonight? I --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  -- would say that we are, based on 

what I have been hearing.     

          COLLECTIVE:  Yes.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, all right.  Terrific.  Okay.

So then, in order to grant the special permit, the Board 

would need to find that the proposal meets the following 

criteria -- and these are outlined in the staff memo -- the 

first is a conversion of nonresidential structures to 

residential use, which is Section 5.28.2. 

          The findings are the increased number of dwelling 

units will not increase on-street parking demand in the 

neighborhood, and the developer is providing parking for the 

units. 

          The location, orientation and use of the structure 

and yard of the new housing will not impact the privacy of 

residential neighbors.   

          And we've heard tonight that the neighbors who are 

most directly impacted worked closely with the developer, 

and feel that their privacy needs have been met. 

          We have to find that due consideration has been 

given to address the impacts of a reduction in private open 

space, and this proposal actually provides more private open 

space.   

          And reasonable efforts have been taken to address 

concerns raised by abutters and neighbors.  And I think that 

has been demonstrated this evening as well.

20

21

22

          We also have to grant a special permit for 

locating parking spaces within five feet of the property 

line, which is Section 6.44.1B.   

          And the finding is that the placement of the 

parking space within five feet of the site property line 

will only be a modification.  And we've approved this 

parking plan before, so I think we can make that finding.   

          And then at last is the General Special Permit 

Criteria in Section 10.43.  It states that special permits 

will normally be granted if the zoning requirements are met, 

unless it's found not to be in the public interest, due to 

one of the criteria in that section.  And everybody is 

familiar with those.   

findings?     

          So is everyone comfortable with making those 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.  I have a comment.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I am comfortable with the 

findings.  I wonder -- I gather the BZA appearance is 

relatively soon.  Is that --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, I think it is, Hugh.  I just 

don't know the exact date, but maybe somebody on the staff 

49

or the petitioner may have the date.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So what I'm thinking is we vote 

a decision, and then it gets written up by the staff, which 

is a process measured in weeks, and then it's filed.   

          And maybe we should delay filing the decision 

until we know that the BZA is going to act favorably on the 

petition before them.  Then this whole question of which 

decision is the one that is the active one becomes clear. If 

the BZA --  

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- makes changes, they would 

come back to us, we can, you know, revise whatever findings 

need to be revised.  So it's a way to avoid the confusion if 

the BZA doesn't do the right thing.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And it doesn't really affect 

the overall schedule of the project, because our decision 

and the BZA decision both have the same waiting periods.  So 

I can't go forward.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  So we would take 

the vote tonight, but not file it until BZA has its 

hearings, has its hearing.  Yeah.  And I think we can also

12

13

send a separate letter too to the Board, stating our support 

for the project, if everyone is in agreement with that.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Could I --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I guess I would leave it up to 

staff.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I'm not sure -- I mean, if we 

delay filing it, then that doesn't start an appeal period.  

And then the Board -- the BZA is going to be told, "Well 

they voted it, but they haven't written, or they haven't 

filed their decision yet."  I think I'd be more comfortable 

just leaving it up to staff and the proponent to really 

determine what the timing would be. 

          If they had two fully granted special permits, 

they could operate under one or the other.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Obviously, they can't do both.  

And so, I don't -- you know, it's sort of like with the PUDs 

that have -- you know, one special permit on top of another 

one.  I don't see it being an issue, really.  And if it's 

done and filed, then we're done with it and we -- you know,

BZA can know we've approved this.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  I don't really have a 

preference either way; whatever is easier for the applicant 

and staff.  Is your point that both comments would be 

useable, so to speak?   

          That was my only question was, you know, if we 

voted this one, do they then have to come back if they 

decide not to go forward with this and go back to the 

earlier one?  But you're saying they could do that without 

having to come back to the Board?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I believe so.  Jeff can 

chime in, but --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Jeff, yeah.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- we're not amending the other 

permit; we're granting a separate permit.  And so, I think, 

you know, they would have their choice.  I think as it's 

been presented, they would clearly prefer doing this if they 

get the variance.       

          MARY FLYNN:  All right.  Well, maybe we can ask 

Jeff for some clarification, because my understanding was 

this it was an amendment to the permit.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  This is Jeff Roberts.  This is 

52

getting a little bit outside of my depth.  I would -- you 

know, normally there's sort of a legal determination that we 

would have to get from the City Solicitor's office.  I would 

say that it's a little bit of a semantic notion of whether 

something is an amendment or a new special permit.  Because 

really there is no provision in zoning for an amendment to a 

special permit.   

          So maybe we call something an amendment to a 

special permit just for the sake of clarity.  But ultimately 

an amendment to a special permit is a new special permit.  

So --        

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay. 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- as to the specific question of 

what happens to the previously granted special permit?  If 

this one is granted, I can't say with certainty what the 

answer to that is.   

          But I can say -- and I also wouldn't say that we 

would -- if the Board takes a vote, you know, our process 

would then be to file the decision.  You know, we do have 90 

days in which to do that, so we don't necessarily have to do 

it right away if other, you know, considerations need to be 

made.  That could happen.  I don't think we would actively

hold it, but it does often take some amount of time to file 

the decision. 

          Let me -- you know, just so that we have all the 

facts out there, can either Robert or Duncan let the Board 

know if you have a date, if you have an application to the 

BZA that's been accepted, and if you have a date for your 

hearing yet?                   

          ROBERT LIN:  The application is in ISD's hands.  

And Maria told me we'd either be heard on the fifth or the 

eighteenth of November.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Okay.  So that was Robert Lin, and 

that, I think gives us an idea of the timeframe of what 

we're looking at for the BZA.  Just the way it will work, I 

think it's helpful to have the Board's indication tonight of 

where you might go in terms of a recommendation.   

          I think for good measure, we would -- once the 

application has been provided to us on behalf of the 

Planning Board, as we always do, we would circulate that 

application to the Board members.   

          We'll be aware that that should go on the Board's 

agenda, and it can be just a small item of business for the 

Board to -- you know, we could even draft up the

recommendation based on tonight.   

          But I would come back to the Board, so you could 

make an official vote on submitting that recommendation.  We 

ordinarily wouldn't do that until we get the BZA application 

itself, and have a chance to provide that to the Board so 

you can look at the full application.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  So does the permit --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Could I make a comment?        

          MARY FLYNN:  Yes, go ahead, Hugh.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I think Ted's proposal is the 

way we should go, which is not to encumber our description, 

anything, but to simply -- we've advised the applicant and 

the staff to work together.  That's nothing new. That 

happens in every case.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.  Right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And this may provide a way to 

reduce uncertainty, but let them work it out.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Do any other Board members 

want to weigh in on this?  Okay.  I don't see anyone.  All 

right.  So Jeff, just to be clear, then the recommendation 

to the BZA and the support for the project does not have to 

happen tonight, you're going to come back when the

application is filed, is that correct?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm sorry, Mary, this is Jeff and 

that's correct.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I would say that it's better for 

the Board to make their recommendation after you get the BZA 

application.  We presumed it's going to be the same as what 

you're seeing here.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  But we want to make sure that the 

process steps are followed.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay, all right.  Okay.  So there 

were a number of conditions that were -- suggested 

conditions that were outlined in the CDD and Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation memos to be included, plus the 

standard conditions for continuing review and certification 

by Staff. 

          We've also had some design suggestions that were 

given by Hugh, and Corinne basically had just -- you know, 

she would like to see obviously more specificity provided to 

staff as it moves forward.  Are there any other suggestions 

from staff as to items to include with the comment?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Yeah, this is Jeff Roberts again.  

I just want to quickly sort of correct the record on this 

case.  I think we might have provided some sort of 

boilerplate language.   

          But just to be clear on the memo that were 

received, so the Board did receive back when this case was 

heard in January, when the previous special permit -- 

version of the application was heard.   

          There was a memo provided by the Department of 

Public Works.         

          MARY FLYNN:  Oh, correct.  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And we did not receive a new memo, 

but staff at CDD did confer with staff at Public Works to, 

you know, verify that the conditions should still hold that 

were recommended in the --      

          MARY FLYNN:  Mm-hm.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So we would suggest that that set 

of conditions related to DPW review should carry into the 

new special permit.  There is no comment from the Traffic, 

Parking and Transportation.  A project of this scale 

normally doesn't trigger transportation impact review.  

Again, we did -- you know, we have conferred with them.  We

confer with them on any project, and they didn't have any -- 

they didn't have any comments. 

          We did have -- our Transportation staff did look 

at this and just to note, since it came up, I think 

previously but not tonight, one of the features of this 

project is it leaves a space for a connection to a future 

planned pedestrian bicycle path that would be adjacent to 

the railroad. 

          But this is -- I think the recommendation would be 

to carry over the same conditions, and to include wherever 

they are not already included the Design Review items that 

are noted in the more recent CDD memo.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  All right.  Well, that was 

very well stated.  And so, thank you for the clarification, 

and we will go with your recommendation for how to phrase 

the conditions.  So any other thoughts or suggestions on 

conditions at this point?  No, okay.   

          Is there a motion, then, to grant the requested 

special permits with those conditions, based on the Board's 

findings that the applicable special permit criteria have 

been met?  And if someone would like to make that motion, 

please remember to say your name.     

58

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Steven Cohen, so moved.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Is there a second?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Second -- Louis Bacci.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Louie?  Thank you.  Jeff, could we 

have a roll call vote, please?  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  On the motion to grant the special 

permit, Lou Bacci?      

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Ted Cohen?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yes.    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Steven Cohen?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Hugh Russell?               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Tom Sieniewicz?               

          TOM SIENIEWICZ:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Corinne Espinoza?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And Mary Flynn?     

          FRANKIE LIEBERMAN:  Yes.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's seven members voting in 

favor.

who participated tonight.  Thank you all very much for your 

input.       

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.       

          MARY FLYNN:  So that concludes the business on our 

agenda.  Are there additional comments from Staff at this 

point?   

any.       

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It doesn't appear that there are 

          MARY FLYNN:  Okay.  Very good.  Do Board members 

have anything they would like to add before we adjourn?       

          COLLECTIVE:  Good night.       

          MARY FLYNN:  Nope.  It's a quiet group.  Okay.  

Then the meeting is adjourned.  Thank you all very much.  It 

was good to see everyone.  Goodnight.
