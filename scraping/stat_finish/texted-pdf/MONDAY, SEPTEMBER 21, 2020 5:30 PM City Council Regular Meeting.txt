To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of the Fair Housing Assistance Program Grant from the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the amount of $25,784 to the Grant Fund 
Human Rights Salary and Wages Account ($25,034) and the Grant Fund Human Rights Travel and 
Training Account ($750). 
 
The grant award is used to cover a portion of the salary of an Attorney-Investigator, who works on cases 
from the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP). The activities of the FHAP include case processing, 
education/outreach, and participation in mandatory HUD-sponsored training. HUD requires ongoing staff 
training on the Fair Housing Act and regulations, investigation skills and techniques, decision drafting, 
conciliation and changes in federal anti-discrimination law.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby recommending that the Cambridge City Council adopt the attached order 
authorizing the City Manager on behalf of the City of Cambridge and the Superintendent of 
Schools on behalf of Cambridge School Department to enter into a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services 
(EOHHS); the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE); and the Department 
of Children and Families (DCF) for reimbursement under the Federal Every Student Succeeds 
Act (ESSA) through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act.   
 
Through the Every Student Succeeds Act, and the Fostering Connections to Success and 
Increasing Adoptions Act (Fostering Connections), Title IV-E funding is available to reimburse a 
portion of the costs associated with transporting children in foster care to and from their school 
of origin. 
 
Students in foster care maintain their right to continue schooling in their home district regardless 
of where they may live. The district where the student attends school must provide transportation 
from their home community to and from school every day. The reimbursement occurs in the 
fiscal year following the year the expense was incurred.  In FY20, approximately $25,000 -
$50,000 was expended for this purpose.   The percentage of expenses that will be reimbursed by 
the state will likely change from year to year and is unknown at this time.      
 
In order to submit a request for reimbursement for FY20 expenses, the City Council must 
authorize the Memorandum of Understanding through a vote and approval, and file an FY20 
supplemental cost report with DESE and EOHHS by October 1, 2020

Wet-Vacuum Forensic DNA Collection System 

1.  Describe how the proposed Surveillance Technology will work, including how it will 

collect Surveillance Data.  

•  The Wet-Vacuum is a type of DNA collection device.  It is proven to collect forensic 
evidence when traditional methods (i.e. swabbing, taping, cutting) have failed to 
render results.  It is advantageous in acquiring touch DNA profiles as well as DNA 
profiles from non-traditional porous materials such as paper, clothing, and even 
bricks.  This method of collection is much more sensitive than swabbing methods and 
makes collecting minute amounts of DNA easily feasible. 

•  The Wet-Vacuum is portable to crime scenes and allows for DNA collection from 

much larger surface areas than traditional collection methods. 

•  The Wet-Vacuum collection method applies a sterile solution to the surface while 

simultaneously vacuuming up the DNA (touch, saliva, urine, blood, and/or seminal 
fluid) from the evidence item.  Next, the solution and the DNA material are captured 
in the attached collection bottle.  The collection bottle is filtered and then sent to the 
laboratory for processing.    

•  This collection method has proved specifically successful in acquiring DNA profiles 

in sexual assault cases that are often difficult by other evidence collection means.  For 
example, this technology has been successful in obtaining touch DNA from bedsheets 
where traditional methods have not yielded viable results.  Additionally, revisiting 
cold cases where DNA was not deemed suitable in the past, could now be tested 
utilizing this system. 

2.  What is the purpose of the Surveillance Technology? 

•  Gathering evidence of violations of any law in criminal, civil, and administrative 

actions 
Identifying, apprehending, and prosecuting criminal offenders 

• 
•  Evidence collection

3.  Where will the Surveillance Technology be deployed? When? 

•  The Wet-Vacuum DNA Collection Device will be used across the city.  The 

anticipated deployment date is spring of 2021. 

4.  What privacy impact will the Surveillance Technology have? 

•  This technology is a more efficient and effective means of conducting traditional 
methods of evidence collection (i.e. swabbing, taping, cutting), which are already 
legally conducted by the Department on a routine basis.  Additionally, this technology 
is only an evidence collection device, utilized on items that are in lawful police 
custody or to which the Department has lawful access.  It does not process and/or 
analyze any forensic evidence (i.e., generate or compare DNA profiles).  As with 
traditional methods of evidence collection, any potential forensic evidence is sent to 
the state laboratory for criminalistics and DNA testing.      

5.  What are the fiscal costs of the Surveillance Technology, including initial costs, 

ongoing maintenance and personnel costs, and source of funds? 

Initial costs – $41,000    

• 
•  Ongoing maintenance – Collection bottles – $1,000  
•  Personnel costs – Deployment of Crime Scene Services Staff 
•  Source of funds – Department operating budget

Re:  

Awaiting Report 20-39 and 20-40 regarding contacting the new owners of 
Jerry’s Pond and discussing next steps in the potential restoration and 
improvements to Jerry’s Pond and its surrounding areas. 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In response to the above-mentioned policy orders, the Community Development 
Department (CDD) and Department of Public Works (DPW) report the following:  
 
The North Cambridge site containing Jerry’s Pond and its surrounding environs was 
recently acquired by IQHQ from GCP Applied Technologies. CDD has reached out 
to representatives of IQHQ to schedule a meeting between the new owners of the site 
and key City departments. The purpose of this meeting will be to familiarize IQHQ with 
the recommendations of the Alewife District Plan and the Alewife Preparedness Plan; 
and to ensure they are aware of the community’s expressed desire to beautify Jerry’s 
Pond and improve connections to nearby open spaces and pedestrian and bicycle 
facilities, while understanding the environmental hazards and the need to safely 
manage the site. The Alewife District Plan outlines recommendations for open space 
improvements in the area as well as a zoning framework that could provide incentives 
to realize these improvements through development. The Alewife Preparedness Plan 
provides strategies to create a prepared and resilient Alewife area that is responsive to 
climate change threats including heat, flooding from precipitation and flooding from sea 
level rise/storm surge and provides resilience strategies that will need to implemented 
with any redevelopment of the site.  
 
Much of the 26-acre site is enclosed by fencing, including Jerry’s Pond (also known as 
Jerry’s Pit). Jerry’s Pond is an artificial pond that was created about 1870 from a disused 
clay pit. The clay pit was subsequently filled with water and an icehouse was built 
around 1907. Though the property was privately owned, Jerry’s Pit was well known as a 
neighborhood swimming hole until the Francis J. McCrehan Pool opened in 1961. The 
property has housed other uses throughout its history, including manufacturing. Today, 
a large portion of the site today is not developed.

The City anticipates working with IQHQ toward the realization of the vision for the 
district at this site. Given the potentially broad scope of open space improvements and 
the environmental risks associated with remediation and infrastructure work, discussion 
of future improvements would be expected to include property owners, residents, and 
other community stakeholders that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.   

Over the past two years the City has undertaken numerous improvements to several 
areas within its jurisdiction near the Jerry’s Pond site and adjacent to the existing public 
recreational open space areas:  

•  Completed significant athletic field improvements at Russell Field. 
•  Designed and worked with the MBTA to address flooding on the pathway to the 

•  Reconstructed the bus shelter at the Comeau Parking lot. 
•  Cleaned the detention pond and repaired drainage riprap between parking lot 

MBTA headhouse. 

and Jerry’s Pond. 

•  Planted 2 trees in the Comeau Bus Turnaround area.  An additional 6 bare root 

trees will be planted in this area in the fall.  

•  Planted perennials in the Comeau Bus Turnaround area.  Additional spring bulbs 

and flowering plants will be planted this fall. 

•  A grove of 20 trees will be planted this fall along pathways and in areas 

alongside Jerry’s Pond and playing fields. In addition, an urban 
forest reforestation pilot project has been established in Linear Park near the 
Harvey Street crossing.   
Installed four Big Belly compactors around Comeau Field.    

• 
•  Re-striped crosswalks on Rindge Avenue near the McCrehan Pool to increase 

visibility.   

•  Taken additional steps to deter rodent activity, including installation of signage 
to discourage feeding of wildlife and work with the Inspectional Services 
Department to identify rodent harborage locations and increase rodent control 
within the area.   

  
In addition, as initially indicated in the council order response dated August 27th, 2019, 
the City has engaged and coordinated with the Department of Conservation and 
Recreation (DCR) and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 
(MBTA) to encourage improvements to the broader area. The following is an update:  

•  DCR agreed to remove a portion of the post fence between the edge of Jerry’s 
Pond and Alewife Brook Parkway along Rindge Avenue. This will provide easier 
access and facilitate maintenance to this area. The City has indicated to DCR its 
willingness to maintain this area.

•  DCR did not support the City’s request to de-pave and plant sections of the 
concrete median at the intersection of Rindge Avenue and Alewife Brook 
Parkway, due to concerns with sight lines.  

•  The City requested that the MBTA remove the dead Sycamore trees near station 

headhouse and consider replanting and establishing maintenance 
procedures for new trees.  The MBTA indicated that they would work to remove 
and replace these trees. We are presently awaiting an update from them and 
will forward such to City Council once we receive it.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way that public spaces are 
designed and the need for open, outdoor space has dramatically increased; and 

 
Local businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and it is not clear when restaurants and 
retail will be safely able to have close to their full capacity of patrons inside; during 
this unknown period, outdoor retail and dining remains an important lifeline; and 

 
There have been numerous attempts to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety and slow 
traffic in Harvard Square after multiple fatalities have occurred over the past three 
years; and 

 
Recent studies have shown the myriad benefits that come from the pedestrianization of 
city centers, including an increase in commercial activity, and improved street life and 
safety; and 

 
Cities, including those with a similar climate to Cambridge, such as Burlington, 
Vermont and Boulder, Colorado, have permanently closed several blocks of central 
city streets creating open spaces for retail, restaurant and resident strolling; and cities 
in Europe of all sizes have had success with pedestrianized areas of urban centers; and  

 
The Council unanimously passed an order asking for certain streets in Harvard Square 
be closed to vehicle traffic on a select number of days during the summer of 2020; now 
the idea of having a permanent plan for open space and outdoor dining is appropriate; 
and 

 
The Envision Cambridge Masterplan states, “By encouraging vibrancy on streets in the 
city’s retail districts, Cambridge can ensure these commercial areas continue to meet 
the everyday needs of the city’s population. Vibrancy can be fostered both through 
street design and retail district programming”; and 

WHEREAS:  Moody Street in Waltham has been a vibrant destination over the summer as the entire 

street has been closed to vehicle traffic to make space for outdoor dining and retail; 
now therefore be it

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Supervising Engineer 
Cambridge Department of Public Works 
147 Hampshire Street 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
RE:  Curb Cut Application 
10 Acorn Park Drive 
 
 
Cambridge, Massachusetts 
 
 
Dear Mr. Niranjan: 
 
On behalf of SXC Alewife Hotel, LLC, BSC Group has completed the City of Cambridge’s 
online application for a curb cut at 10 Acorn Park Drive to service the AC Marriott Hotel.  
The AC Hotel is located within the Cambridge Discovery Park development and currently 
has access from Discovery Way, a private way, running parallel to Acorn Park Drive. 
 
The proposed curb cut and driveway have been designed to provide one-way only access 
from Acorn Park Drive in accordance with the City of Cambridge requirements and the 
comments communicated at our site meetings in order to improve site access for hotel guests 
and deliveries, and to provide improved emergency vehicle access to the Hotel.   
 
Visitors to the Hotel exiting Route 2 via the Alewife Station Access Road currently travel 
along Acorn Park Drive to Discovery Way in order to access the Hotel.  The proposed drive 
will have improved wayfinding and access to the Hotel by providing direct access to the 
Hotel from Acorn Park Drive, including for ambulances, fire trucks and other emergency 
vehicles.   
 
We are available to discuss further at your convenience anytime.  Please do not hesitate to 
contact our office with any questions or inquiries you may have.  I can be reached at 
dbiancavilla@bscgroup.com or at 617-896-4347 or my cell phone:  978-857-0513. 
 
 
Very truly yours, 
BSC Group, Inc.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it

of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided however, that all such Separated Bicycle

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.  

      
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  
 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated 
Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on:

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of 
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager 
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and 
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be 
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement 
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane 
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-
year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality 
along  
 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or 
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between  Beech Street and Dudley Street,      
      
within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the 
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain 
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate 
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council 
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation 
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three 
years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
 
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street from 
Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 
 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to

Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and 
H shall be shown on a publicly accessible website. Such website shall also track exactly where 
those Bicycle Lane Miles were installed, and the distance of each contiguous segment of 
Bicycle Lane Miles installed. Such website shall be established by no later than May 31, 2021 
and updated twice yearly thereafter. All other reports and updates required by this Ordinance 
shall also be uploaded to such website. 
 
J. Until July 1, 2022, if the City Manager determines that revenue shortfalls due to the 
coronavirus pandemic make any deadlines contained in subsections C through I financially 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadlines. For any such 
proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the City Council to 
be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City Council shall 
vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take place by July 
1, 2022. 
 
K. Until July 1, 2022 if the City Manager determines that unavoidable delays in public outreach 
activities due to the coronavirus pandemic make the deadline contained in subsection C 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadline by up to four months. 
For any such proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the 
City Council to be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City 
Council shall vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take 
place by July 1, 2022.

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of 
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager 
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and 
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be 
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement 
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane 
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-
year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality 
along  
 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or 
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between  Beech Street and Dudley Street,      
      
within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the 
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain 
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate 
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council 
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation 
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three 
years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
 
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street from 
Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 
 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager

removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.  

      
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  
 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle

however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated 
Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes, whether of 
Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed block, the City Manager 
shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor vehicle traffic flow and 
some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Temporary Traffic Control 
Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be 
installed. Any such installation shall not count toward the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement 
set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane 
Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-
year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane or Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lane of Adequate Directionality 
along  
 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; or 
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between  Beech Street and Dudley Street,      
      
within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of the analysis of the 
impacts of installing Temporary Traffic Control Device Separated Bicycle Lanes and or Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the City Manager shall obtain 
the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate 
Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City Manager fails to receive City Council 
approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the City Manager shall cause the installation 
of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate Directionality on such blocks within three 
years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous

Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 
(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
 
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street from 
Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 
 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and 
H shall be shown on a publicly accessible website. Such website shall also track exactly where 
those Bicycle Lane Miles were installed, and the distance of each contiguous segment of 
Bicycle Lane Miles installed. Such website shall be established by no later than May 31, 2021 
and updated twice yearly thereafter. All other reports and updates required by this Ordinance 
shall also be uploaded to such website. 
 
J. Until July 1, 2022, if the City Manager determines that revenue shortfalls due to the 
coronavirus pandemic make any deadlines contained in subsections C through I financially 
infeasible to meet, the City Manager may propose to alter said deadlines. For any such 
proposed alteration to take effect, the City Manager shall prepare a report to the City Council to 
be made public justifying why such alteration is strictly necessary, and the City Council shall 
vote to approve the alteration, provided that any such City Council vote must take place by July 
1, 2022.

Cambridge, by inserting a new section 11.207, AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
OVERLAY, to read as follows: 
11.207.1        Purpose and Intent  
The  purpose  of  this  Section  is  to  promote  the  public  good  by 
supporting  the  development  of  housing  that  is  affordable  to 
households earning up to 100% of area median income. The intent 
of this Section is to allow incremental increases in density, limited

limitations for residential developments in which all units are made 
permanently affordable to households earning up to 100% of area 
median  income  (referred  to  as  “AHO  Projects,”  as  defined  in 
Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance); to incentivize the reuse of 
existing  buildings  in  order  to  create  AHO  Projects  that  are  more 
compatible  with  established  neighborhood  character;  to  promote 
the city’s urban design objectives in Section 19.30 of this Zoning 
Ordinance  while  enabling  AHO  Projects  to  be  permitted  as-of-
right,  subject 
to  non-binding  advisory  design  consultation 
procedures  that  follow  all  design  objectives  set  forth  within  this 
Zoning  Ordinance  and  the  results  of  the  design  review  process 
shall be provided to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust; and 
to  apply  such  standards  throughout  the  City,  to  promote  city 
planning goals of achieving greater socioeconomic diversity and a 
more equitable distribution of affordable housing citywide. 
11.207.2 
(a) 

Applicability 

The provisions set forth in this Section shall apply to AHO 
Projects,  as  defined  in  Article  2.000  of  this  Zoning 
Ordinance,  in  all  zoning  districts  except  Open  Space 
Districts.  
An  AHO  Project  shall  be  permitted  as-of-right  if  it  meets 
all  of  the  standards  set  forth  in  this  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay  in  place  of  the  requirements  otherwise  applicable 
in the zoning district. Any development not meeting all of 
the standards set  forth in this Affordable Housing Overlay 
shall be subject to the requirements otherwise applicable in 
the  zoning  district,  including  any  requirements  for  special 
permits.

the  Community  Development  Department  (CDD) 
and applicable state funding requirements.  
AHO Dwelling Units shall be created and conveyed 
subject  to  recorded  covenants  approved  by  CDD 
guaranteeing the permanent availability of the AHO 
Dwelling Units for AHO Eligible Households. 

The  gross  household  income  of  an  AHO  Eligible 
Household upon initial occupancy shall be no more 
than one-hundred percent (100%) of AMI.  
At  least  eighty  percent  (80%)  of  AHO  Dwelling 
Units within the project shall be occupied by AHO 
Eligible Households whose gross household income 
upon  initial  occupancy  is  no  more  than  eighty 
percent (80%) of AMI. 

(iii)  Rent, including utilities and any other fees routinely 
charged to tenants and approved by CDD, shall not 
exceed thirty percent (30%) of the gross household

of  an  AHO  Eligible  Household  shall  be  verified 
annually,  or  on  such  other  basis  required  by  an 
applicable housing subsidy program which has been 
approved  by  CDD, 
to  determine  continued 
eligibility  and  rent,  in  accordance  with  policies, 
standards, and procedures established by CDD.  
An  AHO  Eligible  Household  may  continue  to  rent 
an AHO Dwelling Unit after initial occupancy even

income exceeds the eligibility limits set forth above, 
but  may  not  exceed  one  hundred  twenty  percent 
(120%)  of  AMI  for  more  than  one  year  after  that 
Eligible  Household’s  gross  household  income  has 
been  verified  to  exceed  such  percentage,  unless 
otherwise  restricted  pursuant 
to  an  applicable 
housing subsidy program which has been approved 
by CDD. 

(vi)  Notwithstanding  the  requirements  set  forth  in  (i) 
through (v) above, an owner may voluntarily choose 
to  charge  a  lower  rent  than  as  provided  herein  for

Advisory Design Consultation Procedure 

11.207.8 
Prior to application for a building permit, the developer of an AHO 
Project  shall  comply  with  the  following  procedure,  which  is 
intended to provide an opportunity for non-binding community and 
staff input into the design of the project. 
(a) 

to  guide 

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance 
the  City’s  desired  outcomes  for  the  form  and  character  of 
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable  housing  units,  AHO  Projects  are  permitted  to 
have  a  greater  height,  scale,  and  density  than  other 
developments  permitted  by the zoning  for a given district. 
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that 
are  compatible  with  the  existing  neighborhood  context  or 
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 
The  City’s  “Design  Guidelines  for  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay,” along with other design objectives and guidelines 
established  for  the  part  of  the  city  in  which  the  AHO 
Project  is  located,  are  intended  to  inform  the  design  of 
AHO  Projects  and 
the  Planning  Board’s 
consultation  and  report  as  set  forth  below.  It  is  intended 
that  designers  of  AHO  Projects,  City  staff,  the  Planning 
Board,  and  the  general  public  will  be  open  to  creative 
variations  from  any  detailed  provisions  set  forth  in  such 
objectives  and  guidelines  as  long  as  the  core  values 
expressed are being served. 
At  least  two  community  meetings  shall  be  scheduled  at  a 
time  and  location  that  is  convenient  to  residents  in 
proximity to the project site. The Community Development 
Department  (CDD)  shall  be  notified  of  the  time  and 
location  of  such  meetings,  and  shall  give  notification  to 
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or 
private  street  or  way,  and  abutters  to  the  abutters  within 
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which 
the  AHO  Project  is  proposed  and  to  any  individual  or 
organization  who  each  year  files  with  CDD  a  written 
request  for  such  notification,  or  to  any  other  individual  or 
organization CDD may wish to notify. 
(i) 

The purpose of the first community meeting shall be 
for the developer to share the site and street context 
analysis  with  neighborhood  residents  and  other 
interested  parties  prior  to  building  design,  and 
receive feedback from community members.

The  purpose  of  this  Section  is  to  promote  the  public  good  by 
supporting  the  development  of  housing  that  is  affordable  to 
households earning up to 100% of area median income. The intent 
of this Section is to allow incremental increases in density, limited 
increases  in  height,  and  relaxation  of  certain  other  zoning 
limitations for residential developments in which all units are made 
permanently affordable to households earning up to 100% of area 
median  income  (referred  to  as  “AHO  Projects,”  as  defined  in 
Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance); to incentivize the reuse of 
existing  buildings  in  order  to  create  AHO  Projects  that  are  more 
compatible  with  established  neighborhood  character;  to  promote 
the city’s urban design objectives in Section 19.30 of this Zoning 
Ordinance  while  enabling  AHO  Projects  to  be  permitted  as-of-

except for driveway access which shall be limited to a total 
of thirty (30) feet of width for any individual driveway for 
each one hundred (100) feet of lot frontage. 

Pedestrian  entrances  to  buildings  shall  be  visible  from  the

the street due to its location. All pedestrian entrances shall 
be  accessible  by  way  of  access  routes  that  are  separated 
from motor vehicle access drives. 

A building footprint exceeding two hundred and fifty (250) 
feet in length, measured parallel to the street, shall contain 
a massing recess extending back at least fifteen (15) feet in 
depth measured from and perpendicular to the front lot line 
and  at  least fifteen  (15)  feet  in  width  measured  parallel to

Building  façades  shall  incorporate  architectural  elements 
that project or recess by at least two feet from the adjacent 
section of the façade. Such projecting or recessed elements 
shall  occur  on  an  average  interval  of  40  linear  horizontal 
feet  or  less  for  portions  of  the  façade  directly  facing  a

The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance 
the  City’s  desired  outcomes  for  the  form  and  character  of 
AHO Projects. To promote the City’s goal of creating more 
affordable  housing  units,  AHO  Projects  are  permitted  to 
have  a  greater  height,  scale,  and  density  than  other 
developments permitted  by the zoning for a given district. 
This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that 
are  compatible  with  the  existing  neighborhood  context  or 
with the City’s future planning objectives for the area. 

The  City’s  “Design  Guidelines  for  Affordable  Housing 
Overlay,” along with other design objectives and guidelines 
established  for  the  part  of  the  city  in  which  the  AHO 
Project  is  located,  are  intended  to  inform  the  design  of 
AHO  Projects  and 
the  Planning  Board’s 
consultation  and  report  as  set  forth  below.  It  is  intended 
that  designers  of  AHO  Projects,  City  staff,  the  Planning 
Board,  and  the  general  public  will  be  open  to  creative 
variations  from  any  detailed  provisions  set  forth  in  such 
objectives  and  guidelines  as  long  as  the  core  values 
expressed are being served. 

to  guide 

At  least  two  community  meetings  shall  be  scheduled  at  a 
time  and  location  that  is  convenient  to  residents  in 
proximity to the project site. The Community Development 
Department  (CDD)  shall  be  notified  of  the  time  and 
location  of  such  meetings,  and  shall  give  notification  to 
abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or 
private  street  or  way,  and  abutters  to  the  abutters  within 
three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which 
the  AHO  Project  is  proposed  and  to  any  individual  or 
organization  who  each  year  files  with  CDD  a  written 
request  for  such  notification,  or  to  any  other  individual  or 
organization CDD may wish to notify. 

(i) 

(ii) 

The purpose of the first community meeting shall be 
for the developer to share the site and street context 
analysis  with  neighborhood  residents  and  other 
interested  parties  prior  to  building  design,  and 
receive feedback from community members.

and  oral  comments  from  the  public.  The  Board  may  ask 
questions or seek additional information from the developer 
or from City staff. 

The Planning Board shall evaluate the proposal for general 
compliance  with  the  requirements  of  this  Section,  for 
consistency with City development guidelines prepared for 
the  “Design  Guidelines  for 
the  proposal  area  and

of  other  planned  or  programmed  public  or  private 
development  activities  in  the  vicinity,  and  for  consistency 
with  the  Citywide  Urban  Design  Objectives  set  forth  in 
Section 19.30. The Board may also suggest specific project 
adjustments  and  alterations  to  further  the  purposes  of  this 
Ordinance.  The  Board  shall  communicate  its  findings  in  a 
written report provided to the developer and to CDD within 
20 days of the design consultation. 

The  developer  may  then  make  revisions  to  the  design,  in 
consultation with CDD staff, and shall submit a revised set 
of  documents  along  with  a  narrative  summary  of  the 
Planning Board’s comments and changes made in response 
to those comments. 

The  Planning  Board  shall  review  and  discuss  the  revised 
documents at a second design consultation meeting, which 
shall  proceed  in  accordance  with  Paragraphs  (c)  and  (d) 
above.  Following  the  second  design  consultation,  the 
Planning Board may submit a revised report and either the 
revised report or if there are no revisions the initial report 
shall  become  the  final  report  (the  “Final  Report”).  Any 
additional  design  consultations  to  review  further  revisions 
may occur only at the discretion and on the request of the 
developer or the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it

MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER 

KEY 
Language additions are underlined

Introduction: 
When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the 
City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development 
community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by 
City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City 
and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing “Blue Garage” within 
the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site 
is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex 
technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only 
the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing 
plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling 
interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to 
provide financial support for this alternative location.  
The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning 
Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation 
of the Eversource substation to the BXP site.  Corresponding changes will also be required to 
the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility 
infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and 
make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site.   
 
 
1.  Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text: 

 

14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping station and related utility 

uses designed primarily to serve development within the District. 

 
2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below:  
 
14.32.1 

The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District shall not exceed the sum 
of (i) three million, six hundred seventy three thousand (3,673,000) four million, four hundred 
seventy three thousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000) 
square feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as permitted in Section 
14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed four million, two hundred seventy three 
thousand (4,273,000) five million, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet.  Up to sixty 
thousand (60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of three million, six hundred seventy 

Packet Pg. 153

4.1

 

three thousand (3,673,000) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) in 
clause (i) of the preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to 
Section 14.72.  

At least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to housing uses 
shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as the “Ames Street District” 
and has been approved by special permit dated March 27,2015 (the “Ames Street Residential 
Project”).  The commencement of construction for the Ames Street Residential Project, 
approved by special permit in 2015, shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA in 
excess of three million and seventy-three thousand (3,073,000) square feet, other than the 
60,000 square feet of commercial space that may be permitted by special permit pursuant to 
Section 14.72.3. 
 
Additionally, the commencement of construction of a second residential project of at least 
200,000 square feet shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA utilizing Infill GFA 
(as defined in Section 14.32.2 below) in excess of three hundred and seventy-five thousand 
(375,000) square feet. 
 
Additionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of at least four hundred 
thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a 
building permit for any project utilizing Substation Commercial GFA (as defined in Section 
14.32.2 below). The design review process for a residential project of at least four hundred 
thousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently with, the design 
review process for any project utilizing Substation Commercial GFA, in accordance with a 
special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in Section 14.32.2 below.  
 

3.  Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2: 

 

Any additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the existing Concept 
Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as amended by Amendment #1 
(Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the “Existing Concept Plan”) may only be utilized 
in conjunction with the development by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its 
successors and assigns) of a substation within the District (“the Substation Project”) and only 
on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate thereof) that provided the land 
on which the Substation Project is to be developed. For the purposes of this Article, the eight 
hundred thousand (800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the 
subject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as “Substation 
Commercial GFA”. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project shall precede 
or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing 
Substation Commercial GFA. 

 
 
4. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.1(8) and 14.32.2.1(9) with the following text: 
 
14.32.2.1 Infill Development Concept Plan Requirements: 

 

8)     A plan describing street, public infrastructure, and utility improvements to be undertaken 
in coordination with the development program, including all proposed water, stormwater and 
sewage facilities, and (in conjunction with the Substation Project) the general location of the 
proposed substation, which shall also be submitted to the Department of Public Works for 
review.  
 
9)   A plan illustrating proposed building scale, height and massing, including a model and a 
study demonstrating the anticipated shadow and wind impacts of all proposed buildings taller 
than 100 feet, and a general description of proposed mitigation measures that will be 
employed. Additionally a set of urban design guidelines to be utilized in the design review 

Packet Pg. 154

4.1

 

process shall be included the plan will include a narrative describing the plan’s compatibility, 
coordination and consistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square 
Final Report of the K2C2  Planning Study (“K2 Guidelines”) and the Volpe Working Group’s 
Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the “Volpe Guidelines”).   

5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text: 
 
14.32.2.2   Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special permit approving a Concept 

Plan upon finding that the new development identified within the plan meets the criteria for 
approval of a Planned Unit Development set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning 
Ordinance and the criteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section 
19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall consider the objectives 
set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study ("K2 Plan")  K2 
Guidelines and the Volpe Guidelines and the Kendall Square Design Guidelines. The approval 
of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable project review requirements of Article 
19.000, and no additional Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new 
development that is identified within an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location 
of the Substation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of the 
Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special permit approving a 
Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable regulations governing the construction 
of such projects).   

  
 
6.   Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5: 
 

d)  Inapplicability to Substation Commercial GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of 
this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space requirement for any project utilizing 
Substation Commercial GFA (nor shall any such project utilizing Substation Commercial GFA 
be entitled to utilize Innovation Space in order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 
14.32.6(3) below). 
 

 
7.   Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following text: 

 

 

 

 

2) Residential Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi-family 
residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the building floor area.  
 
3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty percent (20%) of 
the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology Manufacturing Uses or one hundred five 
thousand (105,000) square feet. In order for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the 
Aggregate GFA limitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space 
utilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be set aside as 
below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to qualifying tenants for short-
term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b).  

8.  Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 
14.32.6: 
 

7)   Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from Aggregate GFA calculation 

as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio. Further, substation construction shall not 
constitute Infill GFA (or Substation Commercial GFA). 

 
8)  Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of 

educational, health or workforce training facilities operated to provide services to the general 
public (as opposed to private facilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of 

Packet Pg. 155

4.1

commercial buildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of right 
within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14 or may otherwise be 
permitted by special permit. 

  

9. Add the following new paragraph at the end of Section 14.33:  
 
 

Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, there shall be no 
maximum floor area ratio for any project utilizing Infill GFA (including Substation Commercial 
GFA).  However, the District Development Limitations in Section 14.32 shall continue to apply.  

 
10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text:  
 
14.34 
 
 

Building Height Limitation.   

 

The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty (250) feet, except 
for the area of the District more than four hundred and fifty (450) feet north of the centerline of 
Broadway, where the maximum building height for any portion of a building in such area shall 
be two hundred (200) feet. Up to two (2) mixed-use buildings may reach three hundred and 
fifty (350) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty (250) 
feet may only contain residential and associated amenity space.  Additionally, the floorplate of 
any portion of a building above two hundred and fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve 
thousand (12,000) square feet. 

The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty (250) feet.   
Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District may reach four hundred (400) 
feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet 
may only contain residential and associated amenity space.  Additionally, the floorplate of any 
portion of a building above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand five 
hundred (12,500) square feet.  
 

 
11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text: 
 
14.38  

 Active Ground Floors.  The ground floor of newly constructed buildings utilizing fifty thousand 
(50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where that ground floor fronts onto Main Street, 
Broadway or Ames Street, must be occupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as 
listed in Section 14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open), 
along a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building façade along this 
frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty percent (40%) for any building 
with a façade length of one hundred (100) feet or less along such frontage onto Main Street, 
Broadway or Ames Street.  Dimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the 
Planning Board upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are consistent 
with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively, if a Concept Plan provides for 
the redevelopment of existing buildings to include new Retail and Consumer Service uses 
along the ground floor of any of the identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may 
permit a reduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings for up to 
fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage provided in existing buildings and 
only if the Board finds that it results in a better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and 
financial institutions shall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of 
meeting this requirement.  

 
12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text: 
14.39  Letter of Commitment. 
 

The Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties Limited 
Partnership is incorporated herein by reference and shall be binding upon Boston 
Properties Limited Partnership and its successor and assigns. 

 

Packet Pg. 156

4.1

It is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 
by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby declared null and void and of no 
further force or effect, and shall no longer be binding upon Boston Properties Limited 
Partnership or its successors and assigns. 

 
13.  Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text: 
 
14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are no minimum parking 

requirements for new development in the District.  Residential development shall provide at a 
minimum 0.4 0.25 automobile parking spaces per dwelling unit.  All proposed development shall 
be restricted from constructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District, beyond 
the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than one category of use, 
then the number of spaces allowed for the development shall be the sum of the allowance for 
each category of use. Where the computation of required spaces results in a fractional number, 
only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve 
arrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces or 
otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based on review and analysis of anticipated 
parking demand within the Transportation Impact Study.   

 
14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text: 
 

14.52.3 

The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a lease agreement between 
the developer and the City, other public entity, or private consortium for use of parking spaces 
in a public or pooled private parking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the 
spaces required for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one thousand 
(1,000) two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is being 
provided, measured from property edge to property edge). The total number of parking spaces 
leased and constructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the 
maximum allowances provided for in Table 2. 

 
15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text: 
 
14.52.6   Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 6.100 of this 

Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special permit approving a Concept 
Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the bicycle parking requirements for 
individual buildings shown on the Concept Plan may be met utilizing a campus 
planning approach toward bicycle parking. 

14.52.6.1   

Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of the MXD District 

while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully planned bicycle parking and 
sustainable transportation amenities for all users, consistent with Section 6.108.2. 
Given the complexity of infrastructure requirements of the substation project, the 
bicycle parking provisions set forth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a 
comprehensive bicycle parking plan will be needed to help to balance space 
constraints and competing uses on or near the ground level.   

14.52.6.2  Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a combination of the following 

strategies, or other design provisions that meet the principles of Section 6.108.3: 

a) 

Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public Bicycle 
Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a site within five 
hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the City if located on a public 
street or other City Property, or otherwise by legally enforceable mutual agreement 
with the owner of the land on which the station is to be located. If Public Bicycle 

 

 

Packet Pg. 157

4.1

Sharing Station(s) are provided, each bicycle dock within that station may count for 
up to two (2) required bicycle parking spaces. 

Should it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing system 
by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing 
system operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements by 
providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the storage 
and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public Bicycle Sharing 
storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each designated bicycle storage 
space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a required bicycle parking space 

Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain residential and 
commercial uses having different peak parking demand times, multiple buildings 
may share parking facilities within three hundred (300) feet from each other. A 
shared bicycle parking space may count as a required bicycle parking space for 
both a residential use and a commercial use within separate buildings within a 
campus plan. 

Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided through a 
valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to users. In order to 
utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board’s 
approval a plan describing:  

i. 

 
ii. 

The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be 
required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 
6.100). 

The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking 
spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other 
pertinent information. 

 
b) 

 
c) 

 

 

 

When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet 
the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must 
either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the 
bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the 
Planning Board for an alternative approach.  

The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the 
Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of 
bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning 
Board.

September 17, 2020 
 
To the Honorable, the City Council, 
 
The Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) Board respectfully submits to the City Council the 
attached amendment to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan (KSURP) and accompanying petition 
to amend Article 14 of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the 
KSURP. 
 
As you know, early last year, Eversource announced plans for a new electrical substation to be located 
at 135 Fulkerson Street. The City Council held multiple hearings to learn more about the substation 
proposal, wherein the City learned of the significant community concerns regarding the Fulkerson site 
for a substation and its proximity to homes, the Kennedy Longfellow Elementary School and its 
accompanying playing fields.  The City Manager promptly brought together City and Cambridge 
Redevelopment Authority (CRA) staff along with representatives from the local development community 
to seek alternative sites for the facility. Shortly after these meetings, Boston Properties (BXP) 
approached the CRA with a conceptual idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing “Blue 
Garage” within the KSURP area.  This alternative electrical substation location would move this 
regional infrastructure facility out of the residential neighborhood and into the commercial district of 
Kendall Square.   
 
Throughout 2020, the CRA, along with BXP and Eversource, have organized multiple virtual community 
meetings and discussions, to outline the substation alternative and the accompanying commercial 
development proposal required to finance the project.  The CRA Board has discussed the project 
monthly at its public board meetings, held remotely since April.  In addition to the substation’s 
conceptual design, the meetings discussed above have involved extensive review of the proposed 
800,000 square feet of additional commercial development required to implement the relocation of the 
substation to the Blue Garage property, and the changes to the MXD Zoning and KSURP needed to 
allow the project to move forward. 
 
This community engagement process, described in greater detail below, led to the public meeting of the 
CRA Board held last night on September 16, 2020.  At this meeting, the CRA Board voted to file the 
enclosed petition to modify Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance - Mixed Use Development 
District: Kendall Center (MXD Zoning) for consideration by the City Council in order to implement this 
alternative substation location.  The CRA Board further voted to approve Amendment No. 11 to the

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Hello! 
I am a Cambridge Citizen sending a quick email about the bicycle safety ordinance that will have its final vote on 
October 5th. I wanted in particular to vote my support for including Cambridge St within the ordinance to have a 
protected bike lane and to support Harvard Square being more pedestrian friendly.

I live two blocks away from Cambridge St (on Thorndike St) and I know that many large trucks, vehicles and buses come 
down that street. It is near Lechmere and the highway and is a major thoroughfare for Cambridge commuters. A 
protected bike lane would make those commuters much safer, provide pedestrians some space and I think make the 
street more friendly overall. In terms of parking there are already many places to park nearby already (like the mall and 
galleria). I see people walking around everyday just like me, so I think encouraging the bike and foot traffic would be 
beneficial. It would certainly make me feel safer and that is a road I often bike to Inman Square or Union Square. 

As for Harvard - I know that there is a struggle to keep some of our local businesses there but what has always made 
Harvard Square is it's lively foot traffic and busy days. Empty store-fronts and more large trucks are not the way to go. By 
making it more peaceful and safe for pedestrians (and giving them more room and discouraging the somewhat 
ridiculous amount of traffic there) would encourage keeping the square the local hotspot we all love (at least in my 
humble opinion). I have fond memories of wandering around Harvard Square and the blessed but departed Curious 
George Book Store as a child. I hope other family's can make similar memories and feel safe doing so there. Harvard also 
has it's large student population - plenty of whom come from out of town. Making the square a welcome, comfortable 
and safe area for all would reflect well on Cambridge and preserve a beloved local spot.

Thank you for listening. Also I wanted to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, 
Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan for their continuing support and effort on this ordinance and making 
Cambridge safer and friendlier to alternative modes of transportation. We see and appreciate all your efforts!

Best,
Adonica Camp

City Manager 

Government Operations Committee:

I understand the current City Manager has requested an extension 
to his contract. I do not support an extension or reappointment 
because Mr. DePasquale has not fulfilled his fiscal obligations to 
the citizens of Cambridge.

I propose offering the current city manager a 6-month extension only so 
the Council can implement a thorough, formal and open evaluation 
of the Manager, based on the stated goals of the City Council.

Please ensure the City of Cambridge has the best candidate for the City Manager 
position. Important factors for consideration before selecting a new (or renew) City 
Manager:
1) update the City Council goals
2) establish criteria for success by which to evaluate candidate
3) evaluate manager by using City Council goals AND require public input
4) commence national search for City Manager (have a pool of qualified candidates 
instead of just defaulting to the current City Manager); selection committee should include 
city employees and Cambridge citizens
5) follow protocol for hiring School Super Intendant (job posting, recruiting, committee 
review)

Please confirm receipt of this email.

Thank you,

Tara R. Greco

Item to be Added to Upcoming City Council Agenda.

Peace Be Unto You,te
Dear City Clerk, please add the following item to the next City Council Meeting as a Communication.Thank you.
Yours In Peace
Hasson Rashid
Concerned Cambridge Citizen

"Cambridge Black American Doctor Rev. Dr. 
Robert A. Bennett, Jr. Forced Out of His 
Home."

"Retired Black American Cambridge Episcopal Divinity School Professor/ 
Harvard Doctorate is a Victim of Local Systematic Racism!"

What is most amazing about all of this is the multiple and continuing lies – most told under oath by people 

working for a state agency; by attorneys; by their clients. Are these called “grifters”.

The elderly are so badly treated in Probate and Family Court that motions are filed in their name – without their knowledge –
without their consent and everyone acting as though this is fine and the way things are and should be done in Court.

It might surprise you, but many elderly people are perfectly able to talk, think, write, walk, dance, run and more and yet they are 
portrayed as “incapacitated.” That word is used in many cases to keep the elderly from appearing in Court so they will not 
contradict the story line being used to gain access to and spend down their assets.

What follows is a notarized statement by Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett in response to papers he and his family were given by 
strangers who got them from someplace – and thank God for such caring people.

These are motions and other such papers filed in Court under Robert Bennett’s name about which he knew nothing, which were 
not signed by Robert Bennett, some were undersigned by his Court Appointed attorney who has never contacted him; never 
talked to him neither in person nor on the phone nor by email. Their first contact was when Robert Bennett started motioning the 
Court for the removal of this Court appointed attorney.

We will let these papers stand on their own because we want you to know what Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett and his wife, Marceline 
Donaldson, are going through. We want you to know every detail because others are going through the same thing. We received 
calls, and other contacts from people who are desperate and who have been made destitute when they spent their lives 
accumulating a “nest egg” for their old age and something to pass along to their children. That “nest egg” seems to be the 
reason for all of this. It is no accident that this started against the Donaldson/Bennett’s shortly after they put their house on the 
market for sale and they changed their minds and took it off the market. And then all hell broke loose.

_________________________________

Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett’s statement – sworn to and notarized

I am attaching documents that were filed in my name with Middlesex Probate and Family Court. One claim of these documents 
was that I am “indigent”.

1) “Order Appointing Counsel” was filed 3/5/2020 claiming “elder abuse”.

I knew nothing about this document. I did not request an attorney be appointed on my behalf. I knew nothing about this action
and I did not know nor had ever heard of Cheri Myette. Over the months that followed Cheri Myette did not contact me; did not 
answer my contact to her which included telephone calls and emails. Nor did she respond to my wife’s telephone calls and 
emails to her. She was apparently appointed as a space saver so other attorneys could not represent me and motions I filed on 
my own behalf would not be heard by nor taken seriously by the Court because I had a Court appointed attorney.

Attorney Myette was appointed in an “ex parte” hearing on March 6, 2020. She filed motions which claimed many things which 
are lies and apparently meant to further the case of Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services’ attempt to take over
my life; to make the end of my life miserable; to incarcerate me in a nursing home with restraints on a steady diet of anti-
psychotic medications; to make and then keep me “incapacitated” and more – things they have done to other African Americans.

Protective Services Agencies in other areas of Massachusetts besides Boston/Cambridge partnering with attorneys in 
Massachusetts have done similar things to Jews, African Americans, immigrants and other minorities.

2) A form entitled ” Motion for Funds for Independent Examination.”

I knew nothing about this motion. This was not done on my behalf by anyone. This was done to further the goals of the “grifters” 
trying to strip me of any assets I might have.

I was forced out of my home on March 3, 2020 by the Cambridge police with an order signed by Dr. Rebecca Warner, 
psychiatrist who said in the Section 12 she filed against me that “she never met me, never examined me, never visited by home 
but was signing a Section 12 to have me picked up, forced into Mount Auburn Hospital to be “sectioned”.

3) I refused to go. The police were very clear, if I did not go I would be picked up by them and forcibly put into the ambulance 
waiting outside for me.

4) My wife asked why was I being forced to go to Mount Auburn Hospital when I was just discharged two days prior from MGH. 
The police did not know, but if that made a difference they would take me to MGH instead.

5) I was taken to MGH against my will.

7) My wife and I went home.

6) I was discharged from MGH on March 4th at 3:30am with the Section 12 “lifted” and told I could go home.

8. On March 6th I was forced into MGH again by the Cambridge Police and this time supposedly on a charge of “elder abuse.” 
The claim included several things which basically said I was being “medically abused” by my wife. It claimed I was the one 
making the claim.

This motion says I swore to several things – I did not know anything about this motion and I swore to nothing. What they have 
me swearing to is a lie and I believe was conjured up so they could go after my assets as they have gone after the assets of 
other African Americans, Jews, immigrants and other minorities, after they have gone through a process of making those 
minorities “incapacitated” or as close to “incapacitated” as possible.

They used the charge of “elder abuse” to send the police to take me out of a house I lived in for 36 years with a wife I was 
married to for 37 years. They had to get me out of the house “immediately” because my life and health were at stake.

This motion says “In support hereof the Respondent swears and avers that: 1. He is indigent

5.3.a

I am not indigent and I did not swear to any such thing. Yesterday was the first time I saw that motion – dated March 6, 2020.

I did not know about this document nor about this motion nor did anyone else in my family know about this or had seen it.

2. The motion continues: “He has a right under the United States and Massachusetts Constitutions to the services of a clinician 
at the Commonwealth’s expense where, as here, the Commonwealth seeks to deprive a Respondent of a substantial liberty 
interest as a result of its allegations as to his mental status and need for inpatient psychiatric care and treatment. See, Are v. 
Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68 (1985).

I knew nothing about this. My liberty was forcibly taken away from me twice by Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective 
Services without cause and without a hearing – or rather my liberty was taken after an ex parte hearing requested by Somerville 
Cambridge Elder and Protective Services without my foreknowledge and without my request.

I did not contact them nor did I ask for help on any level. I was well taken care of by my wife, adult children and the community 
surrounding us. They made allegations as to my mental status without proof of any kind.

SCES did this to promote their services and to force African Americans into their agency forcing me and others to accept what
we did not need nor want.

3. In the alternative, the Court must, pursuant too G.L. c.261, article 27C, authorize the expenditure of funds necessary to 
secure such services where, as here, such services are reasonably necessary to assure that Respondent is able to prosecute 
this action in as effective manner as would be available to a person of means. Commonwealth v. Lockley, 381 Mass. 156 
(1980). In respect thereto, Respondent further asserts that it cannot reasonably be argued that a person of means, facing the
possibility of the involuntary Pilgrim Rehabization, would ever knowingly choose not to expend his funds to secure the 
assistance of an independent clinical expert. See e.g. Guardianship of a Mentally Ill Person, Mass. App. Ct. No. 85-0018 Civ. 
(Dreben J. 1/28/85).

This was especially amazing since such an independent clinical expert had done such a job and “lifted” the Section 12 and sent 
me home. SCES, Attorney O’Sullivan and their group were not going to let go because they thought my assets were too 
tempting nor to raid and destroy.

Again I reiterate I knew nothing about this. No one determined that I was mentally ill. In fact, MGH psychiatrists made the 
determination that the Section 12 was lifted which was filed by Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services and 
Attorney James O’Sullivan – which they have done against African Americans, Jews, immigrants and others in the past. In other 
words, MGH psychiatrist found I was not mentally ill and there was no reason for my having been picked up and forced into the
hospital. The motion ends with WHEREFORE it is respectfully requested that the above Motion be allowed. It also says on the 
signature lines “Respectfully submitted, Robert Bennett, By his attorney s/s Cheri Myette”

Again, I have never met Cheri Myette. I had never spoken to her. I had no idea these folks were running into Court to get this 
motion against me to take away my freedom. This was done in my name without my knowledge or consent and I was totally 
capable of giving both.

They took it upon themselves to accuse my wife of abusing me because that allowed them to send the police to take me out of 
my home once again and to continue on with what I consider a criminal conspiracy which has been practiced against many by 
the same people and others across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

On March 4, 2020 at 3:30 am I was discharged from MGH with “no medicines prescribed” yet as a result of this motion they filed 
the abuse charge against my wife. SCES claimed that “It is alleged that Mr. Bennett’s medical needs are not being met in part, 
he may not be taking his prescribed medications.

They did not tell the Court that Robert Bennett was discharged with “no medicines prescribed.” So what does all of the above 
mean?

The “Temporary Order” also claims Robert Bennett needs “appropriate supervision”. needs rehab; needs medical follow-up; etc. 
etc.

What they did not say was the discharge with “no medicines prescribed and all vitals normal including blood pressure made that 
a ridiculous decision.

5.3.a

What the motion also ignored was that SCES was behind forcing me into Sherrill House for rehab as the only place I could go. 
My choice was Spaulding, however, I was told Sherrill House was the only place I could go.

With that choice they sent me to a rehab, nursing home which was under quarantine and did not have the same level of 
expertise, etc. that would have been available to me at Spaulding.

Having visited Spaulding when friends were there I was able to see their level of care and rehab that I did not see at Sherrill 
House. My choice was taken away from me and my wife, as my Health Care Proxy, was also eliminated from that decision. 
When my wife and I visited both places it was clear that Spaulding was white – Sherrill House was brown to black and the way 
that was maintained was what I was experiencing with no choice as to which institution I would receive rehab.

I was also forced to accept a visiting nurse/home health care group without having a choice in the matter and in the process of 
that I was sexually abused by one of the people who were supposedly giving me better care than my wife could give.

Dr. Rebecca Warner was the psychiatrist who signed the Section 12 which was ‘lifted’ by MGH. That should have settled the 
matter. Instead, she continued to be involved pushing the matter and attempting to clearly diagnose me as “incapacitated” and 
filling me full of drugs which could have done serious damage to me mentally and physically.

With the Section 12 she was not paid the $2,000 they paid Dr. Rebecca Warner to go to MGH to give me Hallucinatory Drugs, 
anti-psychotics with no reason, anti-seizure medications for five weeks on a daily basis which probably has negatively affected 
my brain and all the other 8 to 10 drugs I was forced to take. In other words the state paid for Dr. Warner to set me on a program 
to incapacitate me so I could then me forced into a nursing home in constraints for the rest of my life.

Dr. Warner’s license should be immediately suspended pending a hearing as to whether her license should be permanently 
removed.

That “Temporary Order” is dated March 6, 2020 – the date the police forced their way into my home at 6pm and threatened to 
drag my out if I didn’t walk out with them and if they broke anything or had to break the door down they said they had the right to 
do that and they would not be financially responsible for any damage done. They also said they had to right to go all through my 
home, if that was necessary, to get me to drag me out to put me into the ambulance waiting outside to take me to MGH.

Present when this happened was my wife, Marceline Donaldson. My son, Mark Bennett, his wife Karen Bennett and my 
daughter Ann Bennett. But, somehow these African Americans were not adequate to see about my well being and could not 
satisfy what the Court thought I needed and forced upon me. What they forced on me were whites replacing the African 
American family and community within which I lived.

The person who was supposed to do this “examination of me” was Dr. Rebecca Warner, the psychiatrist who swore out the 
Section 12 which put me, against my will in MGH on March 3rd. Dr. Warner is the psychiatrist who said in the Section 12 that 
she did not know me, had never met me, had never been to my home yet she forced me out of my home with police and 
declared my home of 36 years ‘unsafe’.

To swear this out – to lie under oath saying I requested this motion be allowed when I did not and knew nothing about it violates 
every right I have and has destroyed my wife’s reputation.

This has been an unbelievable experience and has shown me clearly one does not have to be involved in claimed criminal 
activity to have these horrendous interactions with the police and the Court which were clearly totally unjustified with a clear 
attempt to destroy my life, my family, and to see that my assets would be drawn down and turned over to whites instead of being 
help in the hands of African Americans. That apparently violates this Court’s ethic. – And yes, I am angry! Wouldn’t you be 
angry?

Respectfully Submitted,

s/s Rev. Dr. Robert A. Bennett, Jr.

I did not request, submit, want the above submitted because it is a lie conjured up by Ms. Myette and probably with the help of 
Attorney O’Sullivan and Somerville Cambridge Elder and Protective Services. I did not see this document until yesterday when 
someone brought it to our house and apparently put it through the mail slot. I had never met Attorney Myette, knew nothing 
about her, did not know I needed an attorney.

We hired Burns & Levinson to represent me. They did not. They decided on their own to represent my wife instead without our 
knowledge or consent. They said they did that because I already had a Court appointed attorney. They did not talk to my wife 
about this case except very superficially and they knew they had been hired to represent Rev. Dr. Robert Bennett.

5.3.a

When they represented my wife, they omitted crucial facts –

They did not include the fact that the Section 12 had been filed by Dr. Rebecca Warner and lifted because it should not have 
been filed in the first place.

They did not let me, my wife nor the Court know the above motion had not been requested, not filed, not wanted by me.

Signed

Robert A. Bennett, Jr.

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Good morning, Cambridge City Council, 

My name is Grace Wang and I'm a resident on Amory Street. I have just recently started biking around the city, and 
have been LOVING this new form of transportation that is energy efficient, COVID-safe, and personally healthy. 

As a new city biker, I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form without any changes, and 
urge you to please keep protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the network, including Cambridge St. These 
protected bike lanes keep newbies like me feeling safe and secure to bike around. 

I'd like to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, 
and Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance.

Thanks very much for you time and attention.

Best,
Grace Wang

I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance

I am writing to voice my support for the full updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form with no changes. For 
the past 9 years I've lived in the area and for 7 of those years have utilized Cambridge on my various commutes from 
West Medford and Davis Square to downtown Boston. On numerous occasions I've avoided serious injury by being 
hyper aware but they were all very avoidable with better bike friendly infrastructure.

As a current resident of Cambridge I am using the streets not only to commute but now to run small errands from the 
house. Improved cycling infrastructure makes me feel safer to run these errands and support local business instead of 
running out to the suburbs in my car just to find parking.

I would like to voice my deep appreciation to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, 
Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan for their support of the full updated ordinance.

More bike safety means more people on bikes, less traffic, lower CO2 emissions and more pedestrian and bike cycle 
traffic in front of small businesses on key streets like Mass ave and Cambridge st.

Thank you for your consideration.

Support of the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance

I am a resident living on Pearl Street, mother of a CPS Kindergartener at King Open, and life-long city bicyclist. We often 
bike as a family, and we are encouraged by the continued efforts of the City to support safe, shared roadways for cars, 
cyclists & pedestrians. I would therefore like to express my support of the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its 
current form without any changes. I support protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the network, especially including 
Cambridge Street - given that it is a busy commercial street with multiple daycares & schools such as King Open & 
Cambridge Upper School. I would also like to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, 
McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan, for their support of the updated ordinance.

Thank you for your work to represent & protect the residents of Cambridge.

Cycling Safety Ordinance

Dear City Council,
I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, and urge you to keep Cambridge Street as part of that plan. Protected 
bike lanes on Cambridge Street would make things so much safer. We live in mid Cambridge and my kids and I biked to 
King Open and CSUS for 10 years. Cambridge Street is so dangerous that I always had them ride on the sidewalk.

I am a resident of Cambridge, writing to ask that you support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current

home on a bike. I have personally been injured biking down Mass Ave in front of the Harvard campus because

Cambridge St.

Pedestrianize Harvard Square

Our city desperately needs to close the streets surrounding Harvard Square to automobile traffic and promote 
pedestrian and bike friendly spaces. I support Policy Order #188 as a first step towards achieving the vision outlined in 
the Envision Cambridge Masterplan.

But we need to do more. Precisely the areas where two people were killed in the Square are not slated for 
pedestrianization according to the map Attachment A. The entire area around the Kiosk needs to be closed to car traffic 
INCLUDING Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle St and JFK (between Mt Auburn & Eliot).

Support for updated Cycling Safety Ordinance

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and 
Zondervan,

Thank you for your support of the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance. As a cyclist, I know that it is so important to 
have protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the network, including on Cambridge St. In addition, I welcome 
exploring pedestrianizing parts of Harvard Square to improve safety as put forward by policy order #4 at tonight's 
Council meeting.

Support for the Cycling Safety Ordinance!

Dear City Council Members,

I write to urge you to support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance for Cambridge.

I hope that you will vote in favor of the Ordinance in its current form without any changes on October 5, to help 
accelerate the deployment of protected bicycle lanes on all streets in Cambridge, including Cambridge St. I bike with my 
children daily through multiple parts of Cambridge and rely on protected infrastructure to keep me and my family safe.

I want to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and 
Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance, and I implore the Council to keep Cambridge at the forefront of 
safety for people on bikes.

Thank you for your consideration,

It occurred to me that you didn't get a copy of my comments against the AHO last night at CC.
I know they are supposed to be in by midnight but I hope it will still be able to be included

September 14, 2020. AHO Second Reading City Council   

As the AHO has its last reading, I hope you- as good stewards and representatives of all citizens, 
sincerely read remaining concerns.  I wish the council had done a deeper dive into unintended 
consequences that could be avoided.  Yes, you have the votes, but consideration would signal good 
faith instead of impatience and dismissal.  The number of meetings (which were a fiasco), and 
number of amendments are irrelevant if they enrich the product. This is not death by 1000 cuts. I 
also resent being compared to Trump and his suburban fear mongering. 
 
We all want affordable health care but implementation is the conundrum.  
 
There is still no actionable roadmap. How do you implement legislation without knowing how to 
measure success and short-comings?  We need an INDEPENDENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE 
at 5 years to review just that. Independent because otherwise, I fear the Council (which may have 
changed by then but probably not) and invested organizations may lack objectivity while reviewing 
their own potentially entrenched handiwork. Balance between urban form, neighborhood character, 
environment and mobility city-wide are mentioned, yet there is impatience with Design details and 
architectural context. Details matter. 
 For example: If a 50 ft building can go to 70 ft “above grade” and go 80 ft as measured from 
existing grade, which is it? Developers can’t be left to interpret. There are no checks and balances 
and no one is identified as being responsible. 
We need to identify building sites, number of units.  The City Manager needs to step up with more 
money to bridge opportunities. 40- 100 units a year is all that is projected with this blanket bill.  
 
Please consider parking for those working night shifts outside the city; Integrate significant trees into 
urban design; Clarify transitions between districts. We need a moratorium on single-family 
construction. This particular developer-driven model, complete with potential conflicts of interest is 
not the answer especially in a pandemic. There are a number of issues being conflated here and the 
AHO can’t remedy them all.  What we needed was a broader and smarter analysis of this very real 
problem.

Strong Support for the Affordable Housing Overlay

Hi,
I am a Cambridge homeowner and long-time Cambridge resident. I am very much in support of the Affordable Housing 
Overlay, as I was last year. I have spent most of my professional life working in affordable housing and I know that 
increasing the housing supply in rich communities like Cambridge is one of the only ways to address housing 
affordability and income inequality long term. I would be more than willing to see more multifamily housing and more 
density in my neighborhood and my city in order to make Cambridge more accessible to people of lesser means. AHO is 
a step in the right direction.
I was very disappointed the overlay did not pass last year and I hope it makes it this year.
Thank you,
Jenny Netzer

I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance

I support the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form. 

I want protected bicycle lanes on all roads in the network. This includes Cambridge St., where I often ride with my 
toddler on my bicycle with me. Safety on Cambridge St is critical. I'd travel to businesses on Cambridge St more often if it 
had protected bicycle lanes.

I'd also like to thank Mayor Siddiqui and Vice Mayor Mallon for supporting this. Also, I'd like to thank Councillors 
Zondervan, Nolan, McGovern, and Carlone for their support of this updated ordinance in its current form.

AHO follow up - collecting research results

I remain opposed to the AHO as it stands. I am deeply troubled that no amendment was 
included, even to protect the rapidly declining Cambridge tree canopy which should not be a 
partisan issue. 

The community uproar in Roxbury to remove 124 mature trees on Melnea Cass bd was well 
justified. Tree removal tends to be associated with low income areas and the densification that 
affects them.

Elected officials should be inclusive of ALL voices, beyond the group that elected them. 

Giving free rein to developers is extremely concerning. This is not about owners being to do 
what they want with their property but about enabling profit making entities.

Beyond this, the pandemic crisis we are experiencing is shaking all our previous assumptions
creating a new framework to address the job and housing challenges.

It would be irresponsible not to take that into consideration.

In researching this I find that the "polycentric" model of urban planning is a viable alternative to 
the centralized high rise city that has been touted for a long time as THE solution to energy and 
climate crisis as well as the high population growth in parts of the world like India or China.

I am urging you to consider with an open mind the following which looks at including areas away 
from the coast, the future of work and a "polycentric" urban development approach. I tried my 
best to summarize my findings below in 3 parts: 1) inclusion, 2) COVID-19 and the future of 
work and lastly 3) the "polycentric" urban model enabled by a vast array of disruptive 
technologies.

1- Inclusion of all at the state level
This country is extremely divided - to say the least - and at the local level we need leaders who 
can bring people together. 

Would you say no to that? 

The 2016 Presidential elections exposed the fact that many living outside cities felt left out. If we 
are to define a vision for the future it has to be fully inclusive. Should all the jobs and funds be 
limited to the population living by the coast? Should we leave central and western Mass. outside 
of the picture while we build urban concentration around Boston itself, essentially expanding 
Boston?

Quote from this great article of the rebirth of Lowell:

Mark Muro, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and other Brookings scholars 
have observed that a handful of large “techy” metros such as New York, Boston and San 
Francisco have flourished in this century, while many, many smaller cities have been left 
behind. 

He praised Massachusetts — “propelled by its superstar city of Boston”— for pushing against 
this problematic divergence and supporting its regional cities. The rationale is fairly obvious: a 
state with a Boston and a network of prosperous regional cities will have a stronger 
and more equitable economy than one with Boston and struggling mid-sized cities. 

Given what Cambridge has to offer it can show leadership in supporting this vision while it still 
has the momentum (that may change).

Could we design at the state level an ecosystem that creates hubs so no area will be left out? 

2- Impact of COVID-19 on the workplace (and subsequently on housing)

We can't ignore the following in long term planning:

Cambridge growth was fueled by the tech and biotech companies now present in Kendall Sq and 
other parts of the city. While biotech requires lab space, employee assigned desks may become 
obsolete. 

There is a lot of buzz around the future of work as a result of COVID-19 and many tech 
companies have already decided to let go of the huge investments in pricey offices (Twitter, 
Shopify, Invision, etc). Mark Zuckerberg said that over the course of the next decade half of 
Facebook could be working fully remotely.

I visited in January a Boston staffing company (Scout) that was no longer assigning permanent 
desks to its employees. Salesforce (over 30,000 employees) has done the same in many offices, 
particularly for sales teams (often out visiting customers).

Many US jobs are now tagged as "remote", temporarily or permanently, some require to be in 
the same time zone or at least within North America. Global companies may include more as 
they have been working multiple time zones. 

This vastly expands the talent pool and where you can work from. You could opt for a less 
expensive location, thus bringing down prices in previously highly demanded areas where jobs 
have been concentrated up until now.

Temporary office space has been around primarily for small businesses and startups but this 
could become a standard. A large company could have contracts with a provider across the 
country so their employees could meet ad hoc for workshops, and face-to-face syncup with 
white boards. 

I am old enough to have seen Silicon Valley with empty office buildings after the dot com bubble 
burst. I would not be surprised if downtown Boston or Kendall sq buildings would either 
experience the same fate or would have to reinvent themselves as "on demand" offices AND 
convert some spaces to residential living.

Post COVID McKinsey sees the role of the office as vastly changing: "Currently, the purpose in 
most offices—if you look at how much square footage is allocated to different activities—is

individual work. But if the role of the office is really meant to be about those moments of 
collaboration that can't happen remotely, then maybe instead of 80 percent individual work 
stations, it should be 80 percent conference rooms."

"Glaeser [Harvard University professor, leading scholar of urban economics] guesses that, at 
least in the short run, companies that can survive without offices will continue allowing workers 
to work remotely. Freed from having to pay obscene rents in concrete jungles, many of these 
workers, Glaeser believes, will move to lower-density college towns like Boulder, Colorado, 
or gorgeous vacation destinations like Jackson, Wyoming. There was already an exodus from 
increasingly exorbitant big cities to more affordable midsize cities before the 
pandemic, and, Glaeser says, if enough remote workers vote with their feet, big companies 
may decide to open small offices in such locations once the pandemic is over."

The other critical impact is high unemployment affecting workers who are no longer needed 
because the white collar workers are 1) losing jobs as well, 2) moving out or 3) staying home. 
[Diane] Swonk [chief economist at Grant Thornton] found that "employment in the information 
industry is down 11.4 percent now compared to 7.7 percent during the Great Recession."

"Data suggests that layoffs in white-collar industries are more likely to be permanent than 
those in frontline sectors such as restaurants or retail. The so-called core unemployment rate, 
which excludes all layoffs that are classified as temporary, has increased more for workers with 
more education, even as the unemployment rate has generally increased more rapidly for those 
with less education, according to an analysis of Labor Department data by Jed Kolko, Indeed’s 
chief economist."

“It’s in those kinds of high-wage cities like New York and San Francisco where low-wage workers 
have actually seen the steepest losses, and one reason is because of the decline in 
spending in higher-wage households,” Pollak said [labor economist with the job-posting 
platform ZipRecruiter].

At the very least we need to pause and consider this landscape before deciding how to invest 
and if we give free rein to developers to build what could be increasingly vacant buildings.

Should funding go instead to support those facing eviction and in need of education to adapt to 
the jobs that are available. 

3- The polycentric urban model and exponential technologies

"To paraphrase Bill Gates: we tend to overestimate the changes that will happen in the short 
term and underestimate those in the long term." [World Bank - Top 7 disruptive technologies for 
cities]

Advances in information technologies, AI and transportation actually enables a polycentric urban 
model that connects urban clusters where social groups develop and where jobs can be more 
evenly and equitably distributed across a state or region, relying on a smart, self routing 
transportation system that continuously adapts to passengers destinations through a mesh of 
smart highways. " 

[see the case study for Sydney and other cities] "This de-concentration approach ensured that the cities 
could easily access a talented labour pool at universities and other assets located outside the central city."

The high density, high rise, solution is about sharing resources and minimizing energy use but 
when self powering buildings and vehicles are within reach and commercial solar windows are 
getting to market, the rush to high density loses meaning. Energy is anywhere you need it.

Autonomous trains leveraging this mesh of highways and constantly adapting their routes to the 
demand, with a smart AI core to bring people from cluster to cluster is not far fetched at all. The 
Travelling Salesman algorithm is an old classic and Uber Pool pretty much works like that only 
with a regular car and driver. The subway in Paris has used driverless trains for decades.

This would allow the revitalization of areas inland and more importantly bring housing costs 
down where they have increased out of control, thus making it more affordable.

Thank you for reading this far! I hope it helps inform the shifts we are experiencing. I hope to 
continue evaluating this approach with experts.

Protected Bike Lanes--Support for the Cycling Safety Ordinance

I am writing in full support of the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form without any changes. Please 
establish protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the network, including Cambridge St. 

I have commuted from JP to Porter Square since 2001 and most days (prior to Covid 19 Working at home), I felt 
extremely lucky to have a beautiful commute. I also felt fortunate every time I arrived at my destination unscathed. 
Biking in Cambridge, Boston, and Somerville require nerves of steel as cars creep or blast through intersections. It 
requires a sixth sense to anticipate and avoid drivers making creative U-turns or last-minute turns without signals. 
Anything you can do to make biking a safer experience for novice and experienced riders alike will undoubtedly 
save drivers and cyclists from heart-stopping encounters that too often result in near misses, broken bones, missed 
work, and sometimes fatal casualties. I thank you so much for taking the well-being of cyclists seriously. 

Thank you to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, 
and Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance.

Support for updated cycling safety ordinance

I am a Cambridge resident and I am emailing to express my strong support for the updated Cycling Safety 
Ordinance for protected bicycle lanes on all streets in the bicycle network in Cambridge. As someone who 
commutes and exercises frequently by bicycle, good infrastructure is critical to keeping me safe.

In addition, I want to express my general support for pedestrianization of streets in Cambridge. Cambridge has an 
enormous density of pedestrians and they are often crammed onto crowded sidewalks while fewer cars occupy the 
majority of street real estate. Public spaces should match their use. Specifically, I want to express my strong 
support for policy order #4 regarding the pedestrianization of Harvard Square that is on the city council agenda 
tonight.

Thank you to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, 
and Zondervan for their support of this proposal.

Best,
Shira Schindel

Re: September 14, 2020 Calendar Item # 1: Relief Funding for the Arts

I wanted to send my gratitude for the passage of calendar #1 during this week's City Council meeting, allowing arts 
organizations to access relief funding. As you know, this funding will be a lifeline both for individual organizations and 
for the strong arts culture of Cambridge. It was incredibly powerful to hear artists and patrons from across the city--and 
beyond--express the impact of the arts on their mental health, on Central Square businesses, on students in local 
schools, and more. Thank you for hearing these voices (truly, it was equally powerful hearing councillors acknowledge 
our voices) and thank you for taking action to preserve the arts.

Dear City Council Members,

My name is Bridget Copes and I am writing to urge the Cambridge City Council to allow arts organizations to access the 
City's disaster relief fund. I'm a student, performer, and volunteer producer at ImprovBoston. When I moved to 
Cambridge amidst the 2015 snowstorms, I didn't expect to stay long. I moved almost every year in my 20s, afterall. 
Then I started taking classes at ImprovBoston and this city became my home.

ImprovBoston's teachers gifted me with a creative space that helped me find my voice as an artist and manage my 
depression when I was laid off. In the theater community, I found life-long friends and met my partner. While 
performing during ImprovBoston's Family Show, I witnessed the absolute joy of our young audience members seeing 
their imaginative suggestions come to life onstage...and even getting onstage themselves. It's incredible to watch a 
young volunteer go from shy and nervous to speak to beaming as a theater full of families laughs and celebrates their 
contribution to the show!

I call Cambridge home because of the arts organizations here and I know I'm not alone. Every arts organization in 
Cambridge has created a home for artists and patrons alike. They've created a vibrant city and bolstered patronage at 
other small businesses. (I can't count the number of hours I have spent with other performers and students at The 
Field, 1360, Veggie Galaxy, Andala, and more.)

The arts need the city's support today to survive. Please provide these organizations with relief funding.

Thank you,

Affordable Housing Zoning Proposal, Nonsensical Report on Transition Requirements, 
September 14, 2020 meeting, City Manager Communication 24

Would you please transmit this email to the Cambridge City Council in the Communications at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

RE: Affordable Housing Zoning Proposal, Nonsensical Report on Transition Requirements, September 14, 2020 meeting, City 
Manager Communication 24

This communication is simultaneously being provided the Cambridge City Council by email.

Cambridge, contrary to statements from the Development Department, has a district with meaningful protections for neighbors. This 
is the Residence C-2B district. These protections were kept secret in this Development Department “Report.”

The following footnote (k) governs in zoning ordinance, section 5.31, providing MEANINGFUL protections. This applies to about 
half of Mass. Ave. and side streets between .City Hall and Quincy Square zoned Residence C-2B and to various other locations on 
side streets throughout the city zoned Residence C-2B. It is copied, cut and paste, with paragraph indentation. These provisions may
have been modified in the recent Harvard Square upzoning, which of course, has no impact outside of the strikingly large area
included in the Harvard Square Upzoning.

Failure of the Development Department to inform the Cambridge City Council of this responsible part of the Zoning Ordinance is a 
distressingly NORMAL failure on the part of the Development Department..

Notice at the very beginning,

In the Residence C-2B District, buildings shall comply with these yard requirements by being set back above and below ground.  

This specifically prohibits underground construction to the property line, a highly destructive practice. It was inserted in the Anderson 
petition in the late 90's in response to destructive underground construction in the building formerly known as the Inn at Harvard. I 
was one of the more visible of the petitioners, and the principle legal draftsman.  

The City Council passed the proposal in a manner MORE RESTRICTIVE than we were requesting at the time of the vote. The actual
petition was filed in response to a request by Councilor Duehay during consideration of a typically destructive and, of course, 
confusing initiative of the Development Department.

* * * *

(k) Yard Requirements in the Residence C-2B District

1) Setbacks—In the Residence C-2B District, buildings shall comply with these yard requirements by being set back above and below 
ground.

2) Green Area—general. Two of the yards on a lot shall consist exclusively of green area as defined in section 2.000. Contrary to the 
provisions of said definition, hard surfaced walks and terraces shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the area of each yard. At a 
minimum, green area setback shall consist of permanently maintained densely planted trees and shrubs that may be expected to form 
within three (3) years after the time of planting a continuous unbroken, year round visual screen. Every effort shall be made to retain 
the best existing trees in said setbacks to meet the requirements this section in whole or in part. Plans for landscaping and maintenance

shall be approved by the Committee on Public Planting as appointed by the City Manager. No Certificate of Occupancy may be 
granted until landscaping under the terms of this section is completed.

(3) Lots with more than four yards. If the shape of a lot creates a situation where there are more than four yards, this green area 
requirement shall apply to half of the yards, rounded up in the instance of an odd number of yards.

(4) Lots in two or more zoning districts. Where a zoning district boundary line or lines split a lot, a lot partially in the Residence C-2B 
district shall comply with provisions elsewhere in this zoning ordinance with regard to lots in two or more zoning districts, except that 
the setback and green area requirements of this footnote shall apply to all parts of the lot regardless of zoning district.

(5) Lots abutting more restrictively zoned districts. When any lot abuts a more restrictively zoned district or districts, all yards abutting 
the more restrictively zoned district)s) shall be designated as yards required to comply with the green area requirements of this
footnote. This provision shall apply to that quantity of abutting yards numbering up to and including the maximum number of green
area yards required by this footnote. The total number of green area yards required on a lot shall not be changed by the provisions of 
this subsection (5).

(6) Pedestrian and vehicular access.

(a) When a yard used to satisfy the Green Area Open Space requirement of this footnote is a front yard, the Green Area Open Space 
may be interrupted by not more than one path for pedestrian access to the building. Said pedestrian path shall be constructed
perpendicular to the lot line and shall not be more than eight (8) feet wide. The green area yard may also be interrupted by not more 
than one driveway constructed perpendicular to the lot line and which is not more than twelve (12) feet wide.

(b) The sum of the width of the said pedestrian path and driveway may not exceed the setback provided by the smallest of the yards 
provided on the lot.

(c ) The areas allowed to be used for access under this subsection (6) shall be counted as part of the twenty-five (25) percent of the 
total required green area which is allowed to be use for hard surfaced walks and terraces for the front yard in which the access areas 
are constructed.

(7) Townhouse Development When a lot is used for townhouse development, the provisions of this footnote shall apply to the lot 
before subdivision into townhouse lots. Subdivision into townhouse lots shall be done in such a manner as to not affect the application
of this footnote to the entire unsubdivided lot. In particular, the pedestrian path and driveways allowed.

Fifth Street Gas outlet — Your attention is needed, thank you.
image001.jpg; image002.jpg; image003.jpg; image004-1.jpg; image004.jpg; 
image005.jpg; image006.jpg

We are writing to ask that Cambridge city officials call a halt to the dangerous, unsightly new gas connections installed 
up and down the sidewalks on Fifth Street, apparently for Eversource's convenience and some safety. See the attached 
pictures. The lack of public process combined to the fact Eversource has not always obtained the homeowner's 
permission first, and many homeowners had not understood what the work would look like when completed is wrong.

The outlets take up to 2 sqft of the public way when we have winters like 2015, every square foot of space for piling 
snow after shoveling counts! And what about if one slips and falls on one of these. They are a hazard, especially for the 
elderly and small children, and are most likely hindering anyone in a wheelchair or mobility issues.

It is not uncommon for cars to end up on the sidewalk when they crash. These relocated gas connections could be right 
in the path of one of these cars, which is hazardous.

We also understand that Winter Street will suffer the same faith, and urge you to act so as to correct this untenable 
situation.

Support for the Updated Cycling Safety Ordinance

My name is Kurt Roth, and I have been a resident of Cambridge for more than 20 years. I also often commute to work 
via bike.

To protect bike riders and encourage further bike use as a sustainable, healthy transportation mode, I ask you to support 
the updated Cycling Safety Ordinance, in its current form without any changes. This includes protected bicycle lanes on 
all streets in the network, including Cambridge Street.

I would like to thank Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-Wheeler, 
and Zondervan for their support of the updated ordinance.

To: <clerk@cambridgema.gob>, <council@cambridgema.gov>

Just a quick word to say that I support the updated Cycling safety Ordinance in its current form without any changes--
that is, I support protected bike lanes on all streets in the network, including Cambridge St.

Help make history and save lives. Vote this into law.

And a special thank you to Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Sobrinho-
Wheeler, and Zondervan for their support of the full updated ordinance.

Warmest regards,

Support for POR 2020 #188

I'm writing to express my support for the above policy order to close several blocks of streets in Harvard Square to 
vehicle traffic. I live in the Porter Square area and drive through Harvard Square as a part of my commute. However, I 
feel that a small increase in my commute time would be worth the benefits to the community of a safer, more walkable 
Harvard Square.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Luke Edson

Residents Alliance supports Manager Contract Reconsideration and negotiation

Perez, Lori

From:
Sent:

Cc:
Subject:

Importance:

High

9/20/20

Dear Mayor and Councilors,

The Cambridge Residents Alliance supports re-consideration of the vote on POR 2020 #198 to extend the city manager’s 
contract for 18 months.  We note that several councillors, including the Mayor, said publicly that they had never seen 
the contract before the city council meeting and had never discussed the terms.  The proposed contract was unclear due 
to inconsistent wording, cross-outs, and hand-written annotations.

There is no record of an Executive Session being held to discuss potential terms of the contract, which is how the Council 
would have been able to learn about, and give input, to any offer that would be extended.  In the March 12, 2020 
Government Operations meeting, Councilor Simmons, the chair of the committee, made it clear that she was only asking 
for authorization to talk with the manager to find out what he wanted, NOT to negotiate on behalf of the Council (see 
attached document from 3/12/20 meeting).  Despite her commitment to convene the full council, it appears Councilor 
Simmons did negotiate on behalf of the Council, without the Council's input.  This process was not transparent to the 
councilors.

We ask that the Council a) indicate to the manager that they want to extend his contract, and b) that the Council will 
meet in Executive Session to discuss the terms of the contract.  The Cambridge city manager is already paid $323,000 
per year, a salary that is much higher than other similar cities with a AAA bond rating.  It is far higher than Gov. Baker’s 
2018 salary of $185,000.

We would like the Council to meet in Executive Session to consider not giving the manager an additional 2.5% annual 
pay increase upon signing.  There is already an existing COLA of 2.5% in the contract.  (That COLA greatly exceeds current 
inflation, which in August was 1%.)  These may not seem like large numbers, but they affect the annual pension for many 
years.  In fact, many government leaders are forgoing pay increases or even taking pay cuts now due to tighter finances 
stemming from impacts from the pandemic, so it seems strange that the manager would insist he must have an 
additional 2.5% annual increase beyond his existing COLA or he will not accept the contract extension.  We also ask that 
the end of the contract term be June 30, 2022 (not July 5, 2022), which will also reduce future costs. 

Once the contract is agreed, the Cambridge Residents Alliance would like the Council to conduct a public review of the 
manager as soon as possible, so that the public can give input on his performance, and so he and the Council can work 
together effectively. We ask that the contract specifically mention that this review will take place.

If the Council does not meet in Executive Session, we ask that these matters be discussed during the 9/21/20 Council 
meeting.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.

Reconsider City Managers contract

Please reconsider the 18-month extension to the city manager’s because the proposed contract was proposed late at 
night, with no chance for the Council to review it in advance, was confusing, and it appears to give an unnecessary 
additional 2.5% salary increase to the manager, who already earns $325,000.

There is already an existing COLA of 2.5% in the contract (That COLA greatly exceeds current inflation, which in 
August was 1%.)  Why is the city manager getting such an increase when many government leaders are forgoing 
pay increases or even taking pay cuts now due to tighter finances stemming from impacts from the pandemic. His 
demands are excessive and inappropriate at this time. And the end of the contract term should be June 30, 2022 
(not July 5, 2022), which should also reduce future costs. 

Has the Council conducted a formal (thorough) performance  review of the performance of the City Manager? It 
appears not. Have the citizens of Cambridge been afforded a public review of this manager? It appears not.

The city manager's contract is one of the Council’s most important 
responsibilities yet there is no record of an executive session being held to 
discuss potential terms of this contract. In my personal opinion, this has legal 
ramifications and financial issues that warrants reconsideration.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.

POR 2020 #198, City Manager's contract renewal

To the Cambridge City Council, copy to City Clerk:

The Council's action to renew the City Manager's contract, outlined in the Cambridge Residents Alliance letter 
to you dated September 20, 2020, is breathtaking even in these extraordinary times.

For those of us still breathing, it is important to retain honest public process when possible. This is one such 
moment. Please vote to reconsider this Policy Order, POR 2020 #198 and at very minimum, change the 
proposed contract as the CRA letter details.

The poet Robinson Jeffers wrote decades ago, "corruption never has been compulsory" 
(https://www.antiwar.com/orig/jeffers1.html. I urge you to revise, as CRA proposes, what's in the current draft 
contract rather than approve it tonight.

Yours sincerely,

Manager's contract vote

Dear Councilors,
Given the importance of decisions related to the City Manager’s role and tenure, I ask you to postpone the 9/21 vote on 
the manager’s contract in order to give all councilors time to discuss the proposed terms. This would give you time to do 
the thoughtful job I believe you all want to do.

Reconsider POR 2020# 198

Please reconsider POR 2020#198 in accord with Councilor Nolan's motion.

I understand that the Council had not seen the contract before the Council meeting on September 14 and had not had 
an opportunity to discuss its terms in Executive Session prior to the Council meeting on September 14. That alone 
should be enough for the Council to reconsider the contract. The residents of the city should not bear the costs, financial 
and otherwise, of a decision made without the necessary procedural requirements.

Honorable Mayor Siddiqui and City Council, City Manager DePasquale,

Friends of Jerry’s Pond wishes to share the following thoughts in consideration of City Manager Louis A. 
DePasquale’s Sept. 9, 2020 communication forwarded from Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for 
Community Development and Owen O’Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works related to Report 20-39 and 20-
40:

1. We are greatly appreciative of the City’s recent consideration of Jerry’s Pond and its surrounding land as a 
matter of great importance and concern for the city and to communicate this in a meeting with the new owners, 
IQHQ. As is noted in the Sept. 9th communication:

“The purpose of this meeting will be to familiarize IQHQ with the recommendations of the Alewife District Plan 
and the Alewife Preparedness Plan; and to ensure [IQHQ is] aware of the community’s expressed desire to 
beautify Jerry’s Pond and improve connections to nearby open spaces and pedestrian and bicycle facilities, 
while understanding the environmental hazards and the need to safely manage the site. //

Given the potentially broad scope of open space improvements and the environmental risks associated with 
remediation and infrastructure work, discussion of future improvements would be expected to include property 
owners, residents, and other community stakeholders that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.”

5.33.a

2. We thank the City for acknowledging our voice and the community’s desires,

and we also highlight the urgency given the decades of neglect which this area has sustained, the immediately 
adjacent and significant environmental justice communities, the extreme climate risk the neighborhood faces in 
the future as well as the impacts it faces today including: heat island and lack of tree canopy, poor air quality 
from clogged Rindge Ave. (which feeds into major congested auto transit routes) as well as the large amount of 
real estate development which has already occurred and is projected for the adjacent areas known as the 
Triangle and Quadrangle.

3. With the community’s interests in mind, we request the City identify the stakeholders mentioned in the 
communication. These stakeholders should include: Friends of Jerry's Pond, The Alewife Study Group, Alewife 
Neighbors Inc., Green Cambridge, Friends of Alewife Reservation, and the North Cambridge Stabilization 
Committee at a minimum. 

4. The Sept. 9th letter cites the Alewife District Plan and the Alewife Preparedness Plan, however it does not 
reference the critical Activity and Use Limitation which creates permanent deed restrictions on the site and 
the City of Cambridge’s Asbestos Ordinance which dictates how any potential re-use of this land can occur. 
These protections were hard fought victories by a highly organized community, spearheaded by the Alewife 
Study Group, and should not only be defended by the engaged citizens of this community, but with every 
resource available to the City’s municipal infrastructure. 

5. The communication does not reference the base zoning code which covers the bulk of the IQHQ site which 
falls under “Special District 3” and begins with this important preamble:

“It is the intent of this Special District 3 to permit a modest level of residential and nonresidential development 
in the District consistent with the public interest in protecting regulated wetlands where they occur within the 
district; maintaining flood storage capacity in the district consistent with federal regulations; minimizing the 
amount of additional traffic passing through congested intersections on arterial streets, and on local, 
neighborhood streets, that could provide access to the district; limiting stormwater runoff onto property located 
outside the district ensuring adequate visual buffers and screening of buildings and parking facilities from 
adjacent public parks and recreation facilities; minimizing the disturbance of existing soil within the district to 
limit dispersal and exposure to possible harmful residual substances in the soil; and in enhancing the parkway 
character of the Parkway Overlay District.”

6. The communication mentions the history of the site, but does not convey the full nature of events that have 
transpired there. The 26-acre site on which Jerry’s Pond sits has been subjected to extensive contamination and 
abuse by previous ownership. As a result, neighbors including many Cambridge residents of color and other 
marginalized communities have had to live with the fear of exposure to toxic chemicals as well as the loss of 
one of their most cherished City amenities at Jerry’s Pond. In light of the above, we believe that development 
on this site is a privilege and the burden of proof lies with the owners to demonstrate a lasting benefit to the 
public. 

5.33.a

7. The communication mentions a “zoning framework that could provide incentives to realize these
improvements through development”. We reject the concept that development incentives must be offered to 
achieve the intentions for Special District 3 which are embedded in the zoning code’s language. A full build-out 
to current zoning would be immensely profitable for a developer and should require no incentives. [footnotes 
below] 

To the contrary, given its history, the developer in this district must prove a commensurate public benefit before 
a build-out is approved. We support the open space guidelines shown on the Alewife District Plan. We believe 
past site history and current realities warrant the preservation of these open spaces and require no further 
incentives to be achieved.

8. The list of improvements the City has done and is proposing is a great start, however in a show of good faith 
on the City’s recognition of the environmental injustice which has long impacted this neighborhood, we have 
asked that a new swale be created adjacent to Jerry’s Pond and the Russell Field parking lot in what is 
described in the Sept. 9th letter as a “drainage riprap” area. 

This new swale should be equivalent in quality to the swales the city has built in the wealthier West Cambridge 
neighborhood at the corner of: 1. Lexington and Brattle streets, 2. Lakeview Ave. and Vassal Lane, and 3. at 
Fayerweather and Field streets. Photos below:

Current Conditions at Jerry’s Pond:

Further, Friends of Jerry’s Pond on behalf of the neighborhood asks that the historic fence at the corner of 
Rindge and Alewife Brook Parkway not be removed. This fence represents one of the few areas of historical 
memory for the site’s more rural parkway history, as inspired by the landscape architect Charles Elliot and as 
seen in the 1932 photograph below:

9. Finally, we ask that you review the attached PDF of 90 eloquent letters that neighbors have written on the 
subject of the restoration of Jerry’s Pond, and recognize the current effort as a critical initiative to fix nearly 60 
years of environmental injustice specifically for the immigrant communities, people of color and poorer citizens 
many of whom live directly across the street. We have also collected several hundred signatures on a petition to 
“Restore and Revitalize Jerry’s Pond.”

This is not simply a matter of beautification, it can and should be a singular opportunity to create a 
transformational new publicly accessible natural reservation, restore a remaining area of The Great Swamp's
historical wetlands and biodiversity, preserve and expand tree canopy, incorporate expansive green 
infrastructure, all while providing opportunities for impacted communities to have access to nature across the 
street from their homes, in particular for the noted affordable housing facilities. There is ample scientific 
evidence of the value to mental and physical health that such access to nature provides and this community 
deserves no less, in an era when every remaining parcel is being developed for commercial purposes.

With best regards,

Friends of Jerry’s Pond (names available upon request)

1. Zoning Code for IQHQ’s acquisition of 26+ acres including Jerry’s Pond:

https://library.municode.com/ma/cambridge/codes/zoning_ordinance?nodeId=ZONING_ORDINANCE_ART1
7.000SPBUOFINDI_17.30SPDI3

Footnotes:

[Accessed September 19, 2020.]

From the Special District 3 zoning code:

“Total Development Permitted. The total Gross Floor Area (GFA) permitted in Special District 3 shall be seven 
hundred, eighty two thousand and five hundred (782,500) square feet, exclusive of Gross Floor Area occupied 
by the MBTA Red Line transit station…”

The zoning noted above for Special District 3 dictates that the owner of the site is entitled to develop 782,500 
square feet of floor area, and the City’s Envision Alewife plan below suggests that 803,750 square feet (above 
the currently allowable square footage) can be built on a quadrant of the site where current buildings and 
surface parking lots currently exist without disturbing the currently un-built and green areas of this land area.

See also pages 105, 111, 127 of the Alewife District Plan and a more detailed page from an Envision Alewife 
Working Group presentation below which identifies the location and square footage of buildings as well as the 
open space and connections on the pages noted above. [Note that these plans leave out the four large parcels on 
the north side of Whittemore Ave. within the residential neighborhood.]

2. Comparable for new lab space across the street from the IQHQ site:

Utilizing a recent real estate comparable from across Alewife Brook Parkway, suggests that new lab space in 
this neighborhood has an estimated value of ~$1486/s.f. Under the current zoning which allows a total floor 
area of 782,500 s.f., and with the comparable noted, the development of the quadrant of the site pictured above 
(and on the noted pages of the District Plan) can be estimated at greater than $1.1 billion (not including the 
parcels within the residential area.) This is approximately ten times the land cost of $125 million.

Date:  September 21, 2020 
 
 
Honorable Mayor Siddiqui and City Council, City Manager DePasquale, 
 
Friends of Jerry’s Pond wishes to share the following thoughts in consideration of City 
Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s Sept. 9, 2020 communication forwarded from Iram 
Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development and Owen O’Riordan, 
Commissioner of Public Works related to Report 20-39 and 20-40: 
 
1. We are greatly appreciative of the City’s recent consideration of Jerry’s Pond and its 
surrounding land as a matter of great importance and concern for the city and to 
communicate this in a meeting with the new owners, IQHQ. As is noted in the Sept. 9th 
communication: 
 
“The purpose of this meeting will be to familiarize IQHQ with the recommendations of 
the Alewife District Plan and the Alewife Preparedness Plan; and to ensure [IQHQ is] 
aware of the community’s expressed desire to beautify Jerry’s Pond and improve 
connections to nearby open spaces and pedestrian and bicycle facilities, while 
understanding the environmental hazards and the need to safely manage the site. // 
Given the potentially broad scope of open space improvements and the environmental 
risks associated with remediation and infrastructure work, discussion of future 
improvements would be expected to include property owners, residents, and other 
community stakeholders that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.” 
 
2. We thank the City for acknowledging our voice and the community’s desires, 
and we also highlight the urgency given the decades of neglect which this area has 
sustained, the immediately adjacent and significant environmental justice communities, 
the extreme climate risk the neighborhood faces in the future as well as the impacts it 
faces today including: heat island and lack of tree canopy, poor air quality from clogged 
Rindge Ave. (which feeds into major congested auto transit routes) as well as the large 
amount of real estate development which has already occurred and is projected for the 
adjacent areas known as the Triangle and Quadrangle. 
 
3. With the community’s interests in mind, we request the City identify the stakeholders 
mentioned in the communication. These stakeholders should include: Friends of Jerry's 
Pond, The Alewife Study Group, Alewife Neighbors Inc., Green Cambridge, Friends of 
Alewife Reservation, and the North Cambridge Stabilization Committee at a minimum.

4. The Sept. 9th letter cites the Alewife District Plan and the Alewife Preparedness Plan, 
however it does not reference the critical Activity and Use Limitation which creates 
permanent deed restrictions on the site and the City of Cambridge’s Asbestos 
Ordinance which dictates how any potential re-use of this land can occur. These 
protections were hard fought victories by a highly organized community, spearheaded 
by the Alewife Study Group, and should not only be defended by the engaged citizens 
of this community, but with every resource available to the City’s municipal 
infrastructure.  
 
5. The communication does not reference the base zoning code which covers the bulk 
of the IQHQ site which falls under “Special District 3” and begins with this important 
preamble: 
 

“It is the intent of this Special District 3 to permit a modest level of residential and 
nonresidential development in the District consistent with the public interest in 
protecting regulated wetlands where they occur within the district; maintaining flood 
storage capacity in the district consistent with federal regulations; minimizing the 
amount of additional traffic passing through congested intersections on arterial 
streets, and on local, neighborhood streets, that could provide access to the district; 
limiting stormwater runoff onto property located outside the district ensuring 
adequate visual buffers and screening of buildings and parking facilities from 
adjacent public parks and recreation facilities; minimizing the disturbance of existing 
soil within the district to limit dispersal and exposure to possible harmful residual 
substances in the soil; and in enhancing the parkway character of the Parkway 
Overlay District.” 

 
6.  The communication mentions the history of the site, but does not convey the full 
nature of events that have transpired there. The 26-acre site on which Jerry’s Pond sits 
has been subjected to extensive contamination and abuse by previous ownership. As a 
result, neighbors including many Cambridge residents of color and other marginalized 
communities have had to live with the fear of exposure to toxic chemicals as well as the 
loss of one of their most cherished City amenities at Jerry’s Pond. In light of the above, 
we believe that development on this site is a privilege and the burden of proof lies with 
the owners to demonstrate a lasting benefit to the public.  
 
7.  The communication mentions a “zoning framework that could provide incentives to 
realize these improvements through development”. We reject the concept that 
development incentives must be offered to achieve the intentions for Special District 3 
which are embedded in the zoning code’s language. A full build-out to current zoning 
would be immensely profitable for a developer and should require no incentives. 
[footnotes below]  
 
To the contrary, given its history, the developer in this district must prove a 
commensurate public benefit before a build-out is approved. We support the open 
space guidelines shown on the Alewife District Plan. We believe past site history and

Utilizing a recent real estate comparable from across Alewife Brook Parkway, suggests 
that new lab space in this neighborhood has an estimated value of ~$1486/s.f. Under 

 

 

the current zoning which allows a total floor area of 782,500 s.f., and with the 
comparable noted, the development of the quadrant of the site pictured above (and on 
the noted pages of the District Plan) can be estimated at greater than $1.1 billion (not 
including the parcels within the residential area.) This is approximately ten times the

Alewife Study Group and Alewife Neighbors, Inc., regarding Jerry's Pond and IQHQ 
Policy Order
ANI-JerrysPondOrderResponse-20200920.pdf

Honorable Mayor Siddiqui, City Councilors, and City Manager DePasquale,

The Alewife Study Group (ASG) is writing in regard to the following communications about 
Jerry’s Pond and the IQHQ property in North Cambridge:

Cambridge City Council Policy Order POR 2020 #175, as amended and approved on 
July 27, 2020

City Manager Louis A. DePasquale’s response to the above Policy Order, on September 
9, 2020, which includes communications from Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for 
Community Development and Owen O’Riordan, Commissioner of Public Works

A review of the above two documents, provided by Alewife Neighbors, Inc. (ANI), 
which is attached to this letter.  ANI is a 501(c)3 non-profit formed by residents of 
North Cambridge in 1997, in connection with the Alewife Study Group, which was 
formed by residents in 1995.

The Alewife Study Group would like to share the following comments, some of which build 
upon the review provided by ANI:

We very much appreciate the work of the City Council, CDD, DPW, and other City 
departments, that have led to numerous improvements in the area near Jerry’s Pond, at 
Russell Field, and at other nearby locations.  For example, the solution to the flooding issue 
on the path between Russell Field and the T station head house has benefitted thousands of 
residents and other users of the area.

Some of the improvements listed in the City Manager’s response also happened because of 
initiatives and work by Cambridge residents and citizen groups, in partnership with the City, 
and other governmental agencies, to identify problems and then work together to find 
solutions.

The policy order regarding Jerry’s Pond also asked the City Manager to engage citizen 
groups such as ASG, ANI, Friends of Jerry’s Pond, Friend of Alewife/Green Cambridge, 
resident groups at Fresh Pond Apartments, 402 Rindge Avenue, Jefferson Park, Jackson 
Place, and other relevant stakeholders, to work together to address the goals of the policy 
order.

The City Manager’s report does not include any steps taken so far to engage any of these 
important and knowledgeable stakeholders, and only mentions the possibility of including 
these stakeholders sometime in the future.

We ask that the City take steps as soon as possible (and before having a first meeting with 
IQHQ or communicating any City positions to IQHQ) to engage the stakeholders listed in the 
policy order with the opportunity to have representatives fully involved in the process going 
forward with IQHQ.

It is important that representatives of the listed citizen groups (with possible additions as 
noted in the policy order) be involved from the very beginning in any discussions of the 
future of a highly complex site with multiple environmental justice issues. Although City 
planning documents list various options to address these issues, it is the neighbors who will 
have to live with the impacts of specific decisions.  And, the citizen’s groups have valuable 
experience, information and ideas that should be included, and that can lead to better 
outcomes for the city as a whole.

We ask that the City Council clarify and emphasize the importance of citizen group 
involvement, from the very beginning, in the process with IQHQ.  We also request that any 
City Council committees that address this situation also include citizen participation in the 
manner that the policy order states.

Alewife Study Group and Alewife Neighbors Inc. have been researching, informing, involving 
and advocating on issues connected to the 26.5 acre site formerly owned by W. R. Grace 
(and now by IQHQ) and Russell Field, since 1995 and 1997 respectively.  Over the years, we 
have shared important updates, and opportunities to have a voice, with the residents living 
in the area, by flyer distributions (usually about 2,500 each time), emails, public meetings, 
and more.

ASG will hold a virtual public meeting soon about the development possibilities and 
associated issues at the IQHQ property.  Our publicity for the meeting will include another 
2,500+ flyer distribution to the neighborhood.

For several years, ASG researched the Grace site's industrial history, ultimately presenting 
DEP, the City, W.R. Grace, and state senators and reps with solid data that asbestos had 
been used in manufacturing on that site for years.  W.R. Grace was then required to test the 
site for asbestos. ASG, ANI, the City and W.R. Grace tested soil samples at 365 locations. 
One in six locations contained loose fiber asbestos, and 75% of the samples with asbestos 
had concentrations of greater than 1%.  A concentration of 1% represents about 1 pound of 
asbestos fibers per cubic foot of soil. According to federal agencies, no level of asbestos is 
considered "safe.”

ASG research also established that the Russell Field had been used for the storage of 
materials excavated from the Grace site during the construction of the Red Line 
extension.  Based on this information, the City of Cambridge, ASG and ANI partnered to 
design, implement, monitor and assess environment testing of Russell Field prior to the 
reconstruction of the field in the early 2000’s.  Asbestos was detected at a handful of 
locations, and was then remediated.

ASG and ANI also helped establish of an extension of the Public Involvement Plan (PIP) that 
continues beyond the end of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection 
(MassDEP) oversight for cleanup of the still heavily contaminated formerly Grace, now 
IQHQ, property. This extension of the PIP has allowed the neighbors to be repeatedly 
informed and given the opportunity for involvement as site remediation activities have 
continued.  ASG and ANI representative have continued to receive and review plans and 
maintenance reports over the past 15 years since the end of active state oversight of the 
property.

For three years running, ANI applied to Massachusetts DEP for a Technical Assistance Grant 
(TAG) to pay for the analysis of soil samples on neighbors' behalf. Each of three years, ASG 
received the maximum grant of $10,000. With that data in hand, ASG partnered with the 
City Council for the passage of the Asbestos Protection Act, which the Council passed nine to 
zero.

We also ask, and think it’s in the best interest of our city, that any discussions of possible 
future uses of Jerry’s Pond take into account all relevant issues and possibilities for the 
entire 26.5 acre IQHQ property.  Any positive or negative impacts from changes to the 
entire site will affect residents and users of the area for many years to come.  So, any 
possible changes should be evaluated as a full package, not just piece by piece.

Thank you for considering all of these comments and requests.  We look forward to hearing 
your responses, and to working with you in the near future for the benefit of our entire city.

Sincerely,

Joel Nogic, Lisa Birk, Ronnie Millar

On behalf of the Alewife Study Group

Re:  City Manager Response to CMA 2020 #200  

Dear Alewife Study Group: 

Alewife Neighbors, Inc. has reviewed the Cambridge City Council Policy Order 
POR 2020 #175, as amended and approved on July 27, 2020, and the response from 
the City Manager in CMA 202 #200 dated September 9, 2020. 

The POR 2020 #175 has two orders, one of which was to report back by September 
14, 2020, which was met, and the other which was to engage the property owner of 
Jerry’s Pond, IQHQ, to engage with certain governmental departments and resident 
representatives regarding Jerry’s Pond. 

Specifically, it was ordered that “the City Manager be and hereby is requested to 
contact IQHQ and engage the Community Development Department, the 
Department of Public Works, Public Health Department and the Department of 
Conservation and Recreation, representatives from Fresh Pond apartments, 402 
Rindge Avenue, Jefferson Park and Jackson Place, Friends of Jerry’s Pond, Alewife 
Study Group, Alewife Neighbors Inc., Friends of Alewife/Green Cambridge and 
other relevant stakeholders regarding next steps for” the site. 

The report from the Community Development Department (CDD) and Department 
of Public Works (DPW) states, “CDD has reached out to representatives of IQHQ to 
schedule a meeting between the new owners of the site and key City departments.”  
Later in the report, it is stated that “discussion of future improvements would be 
expected to include property owners, residents, and other community stakeholders 
that live, work, or otherwise engage with the area.” 

The City Manager response has excluded the stakeholders mentioned in the Policy 
Order, and has made no indication when they will be included during the initial 
discussions, if at all. 

Additionally, the narrative of history site usage in CMA 202 #200 fails to note the  
contamination at Jerry’s Pond.  As noted in the Public Involvement Plan for the site, 
filed with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), 
“During the time DAXAD was manufactured in Buildings 26 and 27, several 
lagoons were used as settling ponds and sources of cooling water.”  As shown in the 
attached maps from MassDEP, a portion of the DAXAD Process Waste Area is now 
part of Jerry’s Pond, and another waste area and the cooling channel are near the 
pond.  Unfortunately, there has not been extensive testing of Jerry’s Pond to

determine contamination levels in the sediment of the pond.  Additionally, asbestos, which 
continues to significantly contaminate much of the site, has been found near Jerry’s Pond, 
despite more limited testing locations in those areas. 

However, there has been extensive testing of much of the rest of the land on the site, which led to 
almost 20 years of active investigation and remediation under the Massachusetts Contingency 
Plan processes, which has continued at a maintenance level for an additional almost 15 years.  In 
the end, there were still significant levels of soil contamination, and the mitigation process ended 
with an Activity and Use Limitations for the site parcels, which have been filed with the Registry 
of Deeds. 

Finally, it appears that the City has highlighted that the Alewife District Plan provides a “zoning 
framework that could provide incentives to realize these improvements through development,” 
indicating a willingness to allow and discuss additional development incentives to build within 
the floodplain at the meeting with the new property owner before any plans have been discussed 
with residents.

Michael Nakagawa

HSNA - support for the Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order

Honorable Cambridge City Councillors, 

I write to you on behalf of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association (HSNA) to encourage  you to support 
the Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order introduced by Councillors Nolan, Carlone, Mallon, Sobrina-Wheeler. 
The principles of this P.O. represent an important re-start of Harvard Square that will add new dynamism and 
vitality in the selective closure of certain streets promoting new dynamism, opportunities, and accessibility. 
HSNA’s executive committee unanimously supports these principles, recognizing that several Councillors 
earlier have proposed changes to Harvard Square and we are in their debt. 

HSNA also has explored in detail the earlier multimodal traffic study commissioned by the Harvard Square 
Business Association and will meet with them this week. While this latter study was completed well before the 
fatalities, new bike lanes, and COVID – the latter leaving severe impacts on local restaurants and businesses, 
there are a number of suggestions in this multimodal study that we can get behind. However we find that 
closing certain streets to vehicles except for deliveries is an important part of the solution. 

Moreover, the time to act is now. HSNA has already begun to meet with stake holders (local property owners, 
local businesses, neighbors, and bicyclists) and look forward to our meeting this week with HSBA. As we move 
forward, we will bring our shared ideas for the redesign to Councillors, city staff, and others for their 
consideration, cognizant that already a number of urban centers have begun to revitalize their older 
commercial squares by closing certain streets strategically in a similar way. 

We urge you to support the Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order “as written “(without the proposed 
substitute language) and also to not create a separate Harvard Square study committee that will take several 
years to reach conclusions. 

Cordially,

Suzanne Preston Blier
President

Harvard Square Redesign Policy Order

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillors Sobrinho-Wheeler, Simmons, Toomey, McGovern, 
Carlone, Nolan, and Zondervan

RE: Harvard Square Redesign Policy

I write to you as a resident of Harvard Square for 32 years, an owner of a business located in Harvard Square 
and a member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association. I am also a member of 5 business networks: 
Cambridge Local First, Harvard Square Business Association, Central Square Business Association, 
Sustainable Business Network of MA, and the newly formed Cambridge-Somerville Black Business Network.

I am really excited about the opportunity to discuss the streetscape in Harvard Square and how we can tweak 
it so we can better serve residents, businesses, visitors, students, and all of Cambridge. I appreciate the 
process that was started a couple of years ago in October, 2017 by Councillor E. Denise Simmons and, now a 
renewed effort by Councillors Nolan, Carlone, Mallon, Sobrina-Wheeler with the Harvard Square Redesign 
Policy Order being introduced.  I want to acknowledge the work that Councillor Simmons and HSBA Executive 
Director Denise Jillson did in raising many valid concerns and challenges stated by HSBA years ago.

I feel that the Harvard Square Redesign policy order before us now goes a little further in recognizing that we 
need a safer and more pedestrian friendly square and now would be a good time to act on that. I do see 
tremendous value in closing some streets, adjusting delivery times and redirecting flow of traffic. I do think 
there is merit in this Harvard Square Redesign policy to help Harvard Square businesses thrive.

In my opinion, this is not an "either or" decision, but an opportunity to come together to make Harvard Square a 
better place. I am looking forward to working closely with my neighbors and the Harvard Square Business 
Association in coming up with a plan that values and respects the community, and business ecosystem in 
ensuring a vibrant, safe and active Harvard Square.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best,
Nicola

Hello,

Support for reconsidering city manager's contract

I'm emailing my support of the letter by the Cambridge Resident Alliance to reconsider the vote on the City Manager 
contract. Without record of an executive session the process lacks the proper transparency.

I especially support the chance for a public review of the city manager.

Thank you,

WHEREAS: 

The section of Concord Ave from Huron Ave to Garden Street is a dangerous 
streetscape that has seen multiple cyclists and pedestrians struck by vehicles over the 
last few years; and 
 
Cars regularly speed down the hill on Concord Ave, surpassing the 25 MPH limit, with 
no traffic calming mechanisms in place; and 
 
Efforts to increase safety, for example, an orange pedestrian cone in the center of the 
Parker Street crosswalk that is often knocked over, have not solved the concerns of the 
neighborhood; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  With a few, simple changes, the street could be safer and easier for pedestrians to cross 

and cyclists to use; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Traffic, Parking 
and Transportation Department on the implementation of traffic calming measures on 
Concord Ave between Huron Ave and Garden Street; and be it further

WHEREAS:  On September 10th, 2020, Governor Charlie Baker announced he would sign an 

 
WHEREAS: 

executive order allowing municipalities to extend the outdoor dining permitting season 
past its original expiration date of November 1st to support struggling restaurants as 
the weather turns cooler; and 
 
The City of Cambridge recently announced it will be extending the outdoor dining 
season even beyond the Governor’s executive order, provided restaurants can safely 
operate and provide snow removal when necessary; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  As residents may feel apprehensive about indoor restaurant dining, and as third party 

food delivery service fees present a significant financial burden for restaurants, 
encouraging outdoor dining and easing permitting barriers is a crucial way the City can 
support local small businesses; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Restaurants will need access to propane heaters in order to attract outdoor diners as we 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

enter into the colder fall and winter months; and 
 
The successful 2018 Patio Heater Pilot Program in Harvard Square, which allows 
restaurants to use portable propane heaters outdoors after obtaining the required 
permits, was positively received by both the local business community and by the Fire 
Department, and was later expanded to include all Cambridge businesses; and 
 
To truly support struggling small businesses, the City should remove permit fees for 
propane heater applications as they have done in Boston, as well as create an expedited 
propane heater permitting process, similar to the expedited permitting process it 
previously offered to local restaurants hoping to create or expand outdoor dining space; 
and 
 
Supplying propane heaters to restaurants free of charge, and providing a centralized 
location for them to pick up, refill, or drop off empty propane tanks would help uplift 
small businesses that are struggling financially, and protect the vitality of our Main 
Street economy; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  As this year’s outdoor dining season has been extended, and as outdoor dining will 

likely be a popular option next spring since COVID-19 vaccines are not expected to be 
widely available until mid-2021, the City must develop clear public health guidelines 
for outdoor dining to both protect restaurant workers, and ensure diners feel safe when 
supporting local businesses; and

7.2

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Expediting permitting, reducing financial barriers, and providing clear outdoor dining 
public health guidelines for restaurants aligns with the Envision Cambridge goal of 
“[ensuring] local businesses of different types, sizes, and growth stages are able to 
start, grow, and remain in Cambridge”; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the License 
Commission, the Fire Department, the Small Business Advisory Committee, and the 
local neighborhood business associations to determine the feasibility of creating a free 
and expedited permitting process to all restaurants to use outdoor heat lamps; and be it 
further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Department of 
Public Works (DPW), the Fire Department, the Small Business Advisory Committee, 
and the local neighborhood business associations to determine the feasibility of 
purchasing propane heaters to loan to local restaurants, and of storing propane tanks at 
DPW headquarters at 147 Hampshire Street or another City owned location; and be it 
further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Public Health 
Department, the Small Business Advisory Committee, and the local neighborhood 
business associations to develop outdoor dining public health guidelines; and be it 
further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back on this matter by the 
October 5th, 2020 regular City Council meeting.

WHEREAS:  The City of Cambridge has employed several strategies to reduce the spread of 

COVID-19 through increased testing, contact tracing and mask and social 
distancing practices; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Due to these strategies, Cambridge’s COVID-19 positivity rate has dropped 

from its peak of a 36.7 cases per day on a seven-day moving average in April, 
to now a 4.4 cases per day on seven-day moving average in September; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  One strategy to understand the impact of COVID-19 in our community more 

comprehensively is to capture the prevalence of antibodies in Cambridge 
residents; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Serology testing is the test that looks for proteins in the blood called antibodies, 
which are produced in response to the presence of the virus, and the presence of 
these proteins indicate that someone’s had the virus in the past; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Serology testing is one part of a strategic, holistic approach to measuring the

WHEREAS: 
 
 
WHEREAS: 
 
 
 
WHEREAS: 

The levels of antibodies can decrease over time, so antibody testing in multiple 
rounds is critical to collect the most accurate data; and 
 
Antibody testing programs can become costly, and similar antibody testing 
programs have received financial assistance from the CDC to carry out the 
labor and testing costs associated with this important data collection; and 
 
As we enter the winter months, battling both influenza and COVID-19,  
antibody testing for COVID-19 would be pertinent information to use as we  
assess our City’s strategies against COVID-19 moving forward; now therefore  
be it 
 

ORDERED:  That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with Claude Jacob, 
Chief Public Health Officer, as to the feasibility of creating such a program and 
report back to the City Council on this matter by October 12, 2020.

Reject Injustice through Student Empowerment (RISE) is a coalition of three MIT 
student groups—Graduate Students for a Healthy MIT (G4HMIT), the Black Graduate 
Student Association (BGSA), and the Graduate Student Council Diversity, Equity, and 
Inclusion committee (GSC DEI) formed to fight sexism, racism and other forms of 
injustice; and 
 
RISE has a platform of four demands, each with concrete goals for implementation; 
and 
 
The RISE platform demands that the university reform its graduate admissions and 
faculty hiring to promote under-represented minority students and faculty, increase 
anti-oppressive education, reform its policies for preventing and responding to faculty 
misconduct, and advance funding equity by guaranteeing 12-month funding for PhD 
programs and guaranteeing a minimum annual cost-of-living adjustment for graduate 
stipends; and 
 
In response to the recent Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of the murder of 
George Floyd, RISE won several racial justice commitments from MIT after 
submitting a 5,000-signature petition demanding Black student representation on the 
school’s Institute-Wide Strategic Plan committee, more accountability and 
transparency for MIT Police Department (MITPD) activities, and an external 
investigation into alternatives to policing at MIT; now therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council go on record in support of RISE and their crucial 
campaigns for racial, economic, and social justice, including their four demands and 
their Support Black Lives petition; and be it further 
 
That the City Council urges MIT to work collaboratively and openly with RISE and its 
affiliated student groups in ushering in needed reforms to align the university more

WHEREAS: 

The Charles River is an invaluable regional asset providing a host of benefits to  
the City of Cambridge and those who live and work here, including recreational  
opportunities, tourism, ecological benefits, and increased climate resilience; and 
 
Cambridge residents enjoy a multitude of recreational opportunities on and along  
the Charles River, including rowing, boating, swimming, fishing, walking, biking,  
and running. To be able to engage in all of these activities, Cambridge residents rely on 
the Charles River being clean and safe; and 
 
These uses and benefits are possible today because significant resources have  
been invested over decades in restoring water quality in the Charles River. As climate 
change brings more extreme heat to our region, the benefits provided  
by the Charles River will only become more critical; and 
 
Stormwater runoff, which carries phosphorus pollution, is the most significant  
threat to the health of the Charles River today. Phosphorus carried by stormwater  
into the Charles River degrades water quality and causes blooms of cyanobacteria,  
or blue-green algae; and 
 
Cyanobacteria blooms are known to cause health effects including skin rashes,  
fever-like symptoms, respiratory or gastrointestinal distress, and in extreme cases,  
paralysis leading to death; and 
 
Data indicate that cyanobacteria blooms are worsening each year and that the  
duration of the blooms is increasing, which threatens safe recreation and public  
health along all 80 miles of the Charles River, including the Cambridge section of  
the river. In 2020, the Lower Basin, which is adjacent to Cambridge, has had a  
public health advisory in place since June 24; and 
 
Currently-unregulated commercial, industrial, and large multi-unit developments,  
which make up only 20% of the land area in the Charles River watershed,  
contribute 50% of the stormwater pollution entering the Charles River. The  
ecological health of the Charles River cannot be fully restored unless these  
pollution sources are regulated under the Clean Water Act. Requiring large  
stormwater pollution sources to obtain permits under the Clean Water Act would  
also support the significant investments being made by municipalities to reduce  
stormwater runoff and phosphorus pollution; and

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
RESOLVED: 

In 2019, Charles River Watershed Association and Conservation Law Foundation  
petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate large  
properties polluting the Charles River with stormwater runoff under the Clean  
Water Act; and 
 
EPA has indicated that it would like to engage with key stakeholders and explore  
the development of a workable and practical permitting approach, and has solicited 
feedback from relevant parties, including affected municipalities; now therefore be it 
 
 
That the City Council go on record in support of requiring large sources of  
stormwater pollution in the Charles River watershed to obtain permits under the  
Clean Water Act in order to reduce phosphorus pollution and protect the health of  
the Charles River and those who use it.

Communicating information from the Regular School Committee Meeting  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
On Tuesday, September 15th, the School Committee had a Regular Meeting 
<https://cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69673233> where Superintendent Salim 
provided status updates <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1coCErK-wwdU_aQ1rSGJRUnEmnz-

243_Proposed_Reopening_Model_2020-2021_school_year.pdf> for the CPSD Reopening Plan. It will be 
important for us to consistently examine where we are to adapt our plans as necessary.  
In particular, there were many questions raised about the new COVID-19 Testing Program (here is the 
latest press release 
<https://www.cpsd.us/district_news/cambridge_public_schools__cambridge_public_health_>) that will 
be launching for our staff and students, particularly around ensuring that enough people will be tested, if 
the program is optional. While there are still many details that need to be ironed out, I am pleased that we 
are making significant process on this front. I hope to soon say the same about our progress with 
providing childcare options. I am continuing conversations with CPSD and DHSP on this matter and will 
share updates with you as they are available.  
I want to announce that my Office has partnered with the Work Force Program to bring Elevate Youth to 
Cambridge. Elevate Youth is a nonprofit that empowers underserved youth through regular outdoor 
experiences with the support of positive adult role models. This fall, we will be providing free and safe 
in-person outdoor programming for CPS students in grades 4 and 5 twice a week on Mondays and 
Wednesdays from September 23rd to October 28th at Danehy Park in North Cambridge and Sennott Park

in the Port. Our participating youth will be led by older youth instructors, through the Work Force 
Program.  
We are focusing on 4th and 5th grade students who live close to these parks (or can secure transportation) 
and would not typically have the chance to experience the outdoors with a structured and supervised 
program. If you know anyone with children in our target population, please share this application 
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_w0gDQCkuMkYsuimMbcAUwyinSwRBXT20fYHUP
OeXIuOaqg/viewform> with them ASAP.  
 
As you all know, my Office has been hosting Family Resource Fairs in partnership with CPS and the 
School Committee. Our next Fair is Saturday, September 19th, outside the Peabody School from 10am to 
12pm, for families of students in grades PK-1. It will be a quick grab-and-go event for answering back-to-
school questions and sharing resources.  
Our upcoming School Committee meetings are as follows: 

•  September 18th, 2020 

o  Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee Meeting | 10:30 AM 

▪  Discussing the COVID-19 Safety and Facilities Manual and the ventilation metrics

COF 2020 #52 
IN CITY COUNCIL 
September 21, 2020 

Councillor Nolan Memorandum on why I filed for Reconsideration of the contract vote 
 
Arguably the most important vote the city council takes is on hiring a city manager.  In my view, the 
vote taken earlier this week on the city manager (CM) contract was flawed, unclear, and warrants 
discussion with full transparency, which could not happen given the circumstances of a vote taken at 
1 am based on a document distributed at that time.  I requested an executive session to discuss the 
contract terms, and was told that could not happen without reconsideration.  The only path to having 
a discussion of the terms was reconsideration.  I believe and state unequivocally that it is the council, 
not the CM, who failed in this situation.   
 
Among the first meetings I attended as a city councillor were Government Operations Committee 
meetings where the question of a city manager contract was the agenda.  On February 19, the topic 
was discussed and a letter from the CM stating that he was interested in a successor contract was 
accepted.  It was explicitly stated that accepting the letter from the CM simply put on record that the 
committee had received it.  At that meeting, the question of a review of the CM was mentioned, since 
the contract calls for one, led by the Government Operations Committee.  I and several councillors 
advocated for a goal-setting and review process.  It was recognized as good practice, good 
governance, and good modeling.   
 
On March 12, the same committee met again to discuss the city manager contract.  During that 
meeting (full minutes here) there was discussion of what the process would be to move forward and 
how to proceed.  There was a suggestion that the committee state it was interested in a one-year 
extension (that motion failed).  There was discussion on what would happen over the next few 
months, how to start a search for a new CM, and other items.  During that meeting the process 
outlined for the committee members, other councillors such as myself and the public was that the 
chair of the committee would be authorized “to have a discussion with Mr. DePasquale regarding 
that request” of a new contract.  After such discussion, there would be an executive session for the 
full council to discuss what a contract might include.  An “executive session” was mentioned eight 
times during the meeting.  That is standard practice and in line with my experience on the School 
Committee and on other boards - after getting a sense of what is wanted in a contract, the full body 
meets in executive session to be apprised of any information relevant to opening negotiations, and 
review strategy and/or discuss possible terms that would be offered.  The minutes of the March 12 
meeting are very clear that the chair was authorized to open discussions only, and not to negotiate.  
The minutes of that meeting were on the July 27 council meeting, and presumably that meant that as 
of that date the chair was authorized to ask the CM what he wanted.    
 
Based on my own experience, my understanding of proper procedure and the explicit commitment at 
that meeting, I expected that before any contract would be offered the full council would weigh in, 

Packet Pg. 363

8.2

during an executive session. Instead, on our September 14 meeting agenda was a policy order from 
Councillor Simmons asking the council to extend the CM contract for 18 months “with a 2.5 percent 
cost of living adjustment at signing.”  There are several questions that arise from that 
recommendation.  The chair was never authorized to engage in negotiations with the CM, only to 
discuss what he wanted, so why were we asked to vote on terms?  And during discussion of this 
policy order, it became clear that the description of the compensation was wrong.  A COLA is given 
to non-union staff in July of each year, and the CM received a 2.5% COLA adjustment on July 1, 
2020.  During our discussion, the council was told there were “no changes”, that the contract was an 
extension of the current contract, with “what he gets anyway...following what he has in previous 
contracts as a cost of living”. Yet the draft contract which was printed and given to council members 
after midnight WAS different.  It included not just a COLA, but a separate 2.5% raise upon signing.  
  
Any potential contract should have been reviewed, discussed and jointly voted in executive session, 
as had been promised earlier in the year.  I, as a new councillor, experienced with several contract 
negotiations with superintendents, was surprised and taken aback.  How did a process which could 
and should have been professional and sensitive, become a public mess?  Many of us expressed 
confusion about what the terms were, and whether they were appropriate.  Many of us were 
exhausted, and while we wanted to respect the CM also wanted to recognize that the process through 
no fault of the CM, was disconcerting at best.  The draft had some handwritten notes, some things 
scratched out, and an end date that matched with no specific logic.  And it wasn’t clear to me if we 
were voting on an actual contract or the rough outlines of one that could be finalized later.  
 
I did wonder over the course of August when we would go into an executive session - and I did reach 
out to several colleagues about when we would next hear about the contract.  I never heard back and 
several colleagues also did not know.  In retrospect, I should have asked why we hadn’t had an 
executive session. We hadn’t had a regular meeting since the July 27 meeting when the committee 
report authorizing the beginning of contract discussion was accepted.  I know the CM was anxious to 
get this done, and he was told the process was fine. In my opinion, the council mishandled this 
process, not the CM.  
 
Why bother reconsidering since I am and was prepared to vote a contract for 18 months?  I woke up 
the next day troubled.  Troubled by a deeply flawed process that was undemocratic, unclear and 
counter to the good governance I promised to model and practice every day when I took the oath of 
office.  And floored by the fact that several of us were not entirely sure what compensation package 
we were approving.  The meeting video shows the confusion.  From an assertion that nothing was 
different about this contract, that it was just an extension on the same terms with nothing new to an 
assertion that it included a double raise to a question on why the end date did not’ match with 
anything, it was an embarrassing display that was not something the council should condone or 
tolerate or let stand.  Especially in one of the most significant votes we take, we should be very clear 
that we know what the vote means.   
 
And, I am uncomfortable that it was not clear at that moment that the vote entailed a raise separate 
from a COLA.  The public should have confidence that we are looking out for their interests and 
carefully monitoring spending of every dollar.  We are in the middle of a pandemic and the financial 
situation of the city almost certainly will deteriorate over the next year or two.  We may be asking 
our workers, our unions and our residents to tighten their belts, to lower expectations for what the 
city can offer.  We should be conscious of every dollar.  And yet, in these challenging times when 
everyone has been working overtime, many have lost their homes, their livelihoods and their savings, 
I cannot in good conscience approve a raise even of 2.5% on a salary that in my view is already far 
more than it should be.  I reviewed the salaries of mayors and city managers of several cities across 

Packet Pg. 364

8.2

the country which are our size or in some cases a few times bigger and more complex, all of which 
have AAA bond ratings.  None are paid as much any close to the current $323K (scheduled to go up 
to $339K next July 1) as Cambridge’s City Manager.  Most are paid much less.  Both Mayor Walsh 
of Boston (AAA bond rated city) and Governor Baker make far less.  I respect the CM and sincerely 
hope he will stay for the next 18 months. I wish we’d only been asked to vote on a standard contract 
per the policy order as written, without an additional raise.  Or that we’d had an executive session.  
Then this reconsideration would not have been filed.   
 
Another note: Through my years of service on School Committee, I took the responsibility for 
overseeing the superintendent seriously.  Many years back, when the School Committee failed to 
fulfill its obligation to conduct a review and got appropriate criticism, I vowed never to let that 
happen on my watch.  I took over the role of ensuring the review of the superintendent happened.  It 
was always a fruitful and helpful process - an opportunity to reflect on the past year, recognize and 
celebrate what went well and discuss how best to approach the coming year. That process is an 
essential part of any high functioning organization.  I hope that will happen in the future with any 
city manager.

thereafter on each July 1st, for the term of this Agreement, the City Manager’s annual 
salary shall increase by 2.5% of the then-current salary amount. However, in the event 
the City Manager’s annual 2.5% salary increase exceeds the annual salary increase of 
Cambridge non-union employees, then the City Managers salary increase for that 
given year shall be the same percentage increase as the Cambridge non-union 
employees.   

For the term of this Agreement, starting January 9, 2021 and ending July 5, 

2022, the City Manager’s annual salary, based on a 2.5% annual increase, shall be as 
follows: 

Dates   

                     2.5% increase  

January 9, 2021 

$330,937.00  

July 1, 2021  

$339,210.00  

July 1, 2022  

$347,690.00  

 

 

 

In the event that Mr. DePasquale serves for less than a full contract year, in 

accordance with this Agreement and the City Charter his salary shall be prorated for 
the portion of the contract year actually served.  The City Manager’s salary shall be 
subject to withholdings and deductions in accordance with applicable federal and 
state laws.  The City Manager’s per diem rate shall be calculated by dividing the salary 
for the contract year by 261.   

4.2 

The City Manager acknowledges that he is an exempt employee under 

the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”) and Massachusetts overtime provisions, 
including provisions providing for compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay, and that 
he is not entitled to any overtime pay or compensatory time pursuant to the FLSA, 
provisions in the Massachusetts General Laws, or provisions in City ordinances, 
except for compensatory time provided for under this Agreement.  

 

4.3  General Benefits 

 

The City Manager shall be entitled to all medical, dental, vision, hospital, life 

insurance, and other benefits not otherwise covered by this Agreement, and those 
generally available to other non-union managerial personnel employed by the City on 
the same terms, conditions, and limitations as such benefits are generally available as 
a matter of uniform City policy to all other non-union managerial personnel employed 
by the City.  He shall be eligible for the same holiday, personal and administrative 
leave benefits, and all such other benefits of employment, including but not limited to 
deferred compensation, flexible spending, longevity, managerial allowance, sick leave 
incentive pay, and tuition reimbursement, as are provided to other non-union 
management employees of the City, excluding any benefits which are provided only as

4.4  Vacation Time 

The City Manager shall be entitled to twenty-five (25) working days of vacation 
per contract year, exclusive of legal holidays.  Such vacation shall be awarded at the 
beginning of each calendar year, as is the practice with other managerial employees.  
Subject to the second paragraph of this Section, the City Manager may carry over up 
to and including five (5) days of accrued unused vacation time from one contract year 
to the subsequent contract year, but in no event shall the City Manager carry forward 
more than five days of vacation in any one contract year.  The City Manager may be 
compensated for up to fifteen (15) unused vacation days per year to be paid at his then 
current salary. If he elects to buy back such vacation time, he shall not be eligible to 
carry over any of the vacation time awarded for that year into the next calendar year.  

The Parties further agree that at the time of his retirement or termination, Mr. 

 
DePasquale shall be eligible to be compensated, at his then existing rate of pay, for all 
of his accumulated vacation, personal, compensatory and administrative leave that 
remained unused at the time of retirement or termination and that was earned by him 
in the position of City Manager. 

 

4.5   Sick Leave 

 

The City Manager shall be entitled to fifteen (15) days sick leave awarded at the 

beginning of each calendar year, as is the practice with other non-union managerial 
employees.  Sick leave shall accumulate unlimited, year to year.  Sick leave use shall 
be subject to the same policies and rules as govern use by other non-union employees.  
Sick leave accumulated by the City Manager prior to the signing of this Agreement 
shall be carried into this Agreement.  Upon his death, retirement, or termination 
under the terms of Section 5 of this agreement, the City Manager shall be eligible to be 
compensated for any unused sick leave at the rate then provided for management and 
non-union employees of the City.  

 

4.6 

Transportation  

The City Manager shall be provided with the use of a City owned or leased 
automobile for the City Manager’s unrestricted use.  Insurance, maintenance and 
repairs and gasoline in connection with the operation of said automobile shall be paid 
by the City.  Upon termination of this Agreement and the City Manager’s employment 
with the City, he shall return the automobile to the City. 

4.7  Cellular Phone and Equipment 

 

The City Manager shall be provided with a cellular phone, tablet, lap top and 

other necessary devices to be used in accordance with his duties for the City.  It is 
understood that some moderate personal use will be permitted in recognition of the 
City Manager’s work schedule. Upon termination of this Agreement and the City 
Manager’s employment with the City, he shall return the equipment to the City.

4.8 

 Compensatory Time 

 

The City Manager acknowledges that he is frequently required or called upon to 

perform work outside of the normal office hours of the City and he commits to 
performing such work.  The City Council recognizes that the City Manager’s hours 
require that he devote a great deal of time outside of the normal office hours of the 
City and the City shall permit the City Manager to earn and take up to three weeks of 
non-FLSA compensatory time off per year.  One week of earned but unused 
compensatory time may be carried over from one Contract Year to the subsequent 
Contract Year, on a cumulative basis.      

This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  

 

4.9 

Life Insurance 

 

The City Manager shall be covered by an insurance policy in the amount of 

$250,000 payable to the beneficiary/beneficiaries named by the City Manager.  The 
insurance may include “whole life”, “paid up” or “cash value” insurance at the 
discretion of the City Manager. The premium cost of this insurance shall continue to 
be paid by the City after and throughout Mr. DePasquale’s retirement as part of his 
supplemental benefits pursuant to this agreement. 

This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.   

SECTION 5 – REMOVAL, TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION 

5.1  Mr. DePasquale may terminate this Agreement and his employment with 

 
the City at any time by giving the Mayor and City Council written notice at least 4 
(four) months prior to the effective date of termination.  With the exception of payment 
for accrued unused vacation, and sick leave as provided in paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5 
above, and other benefits, as provided in paragraphs 4.3 above, as well as the 
compensatory time  as provided in paragraph 4.8  above and other accrued benefits as 
are due to Mr. DePasquale under the terms of this Agreement, Mr. DePasquale shall 
not be entitled to receive any other compensation or benefits after the date of 
termination under this Section 5.1.  

5.2 

Subject to the ADA and other applicable statutes, ordinances and laws, 

 
Mr. DePasquale may be suspended and/or removed as the City Manager, and this 
Agreement terminated, for “Cause,” by a majority vote of the City Council.  For the 
purposes of this Agreement, the term “Cause” shall mean conviction of a felony; 
serious conduct unbecoming a City Manager; repeated inefficiency or incompetency in 
the performance of his duties as City Manager; provided however, that the City 
Council has given prior written notice to Mr. DePasquale of any such misconduct, 
inefficiency or incompetency and thirty (30) days to cure any such alleged misconduct, 
inefficiency or incompetency. With the exception of payment for accrued unused 
vacation, and sick leave  as provided in paragraphs 4.4 and 4.5 above, and other

provided in paragraph 4.8  above and other accrued benefits as are due to Mr. 
DePasquale under the terms of this Agreement, Mr. DePasquale shall not be entitled to 
receive any other compensation or benefits after the date of termination under this 
Section 5.2. 

5.3  Mr. DePasquale may be removed as City Manager, and this Agreement 

  
terminated at any time for any reason by majority vote of the City Council.  If such 
termination is not for “Cause” pursuant to Section 5.2 of this Agreement, and Mr. 
DePasquale is willing and able to perform his duties under this Agreement, in addition 
to the other payments specified in Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8  of this Agreement, 
the City shall pay him an early termination payment in a lump sum, minus 
withholdings required by law or authorized by Mr. DePasquale, in an amount equal to 
the remaining balance due on his contract period.  

SECTION 6 - INDEMNIFICATION 

6.1 

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the City shall (1) defend, save 

 
harmless and indemnify the City Manager against any tort, professional liability, claim 
or demand, or other legal action, whether groundless or otherwise, arising out of an 
alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of his duties as City Manager, 
even if said claim has been made following his termination from employment, provided 
that the City Manager acted within the scope of his duties, and (2) shall pay the 
amount of any settlement or judgment rendered thereon.  The City may compromise 
and settle any such claim or suit and will pay the amount of any settlement or 
judgment rendered thereon without recourse to the City Manager. 

 
The City shall reimburse the City Manager for any attorneys’ fees and costs 
incurred by the City Manager in connection with such claims or suits involving the 
City Manager in his professional capacity. 

This indemnification shall continue to apply to the City Manager after he leaves 

 
the employment of the City.   

Indemnification of Mr. DePasquale shall not apply to any proceeding to 

 
terminate his employment as the City Manager pursuant to statute, or this Agreement, 
unless the City manager is found not to have violated section 5.2 of this agreement.   
Mr. DePasquale agrees to cooperate fully with the City and the City’s attorney in any 
claim, suit, or matter in which the City is indemnifying Mr. DePasquale.  Mr. 
DePasquale shall be paid the existing daily rate for his position at the time of his 
retirement or other end of his service for time spent for testimony or consultation by or 
on behalf of the City in defense of such claims or actions.  This Section 6.1 also 
applies with respect to claims, suits, or matters which arise out of Mr. DePasquale’s 
performance of his duties for the City prior to his position of City Manager.

In addition, the City agrees to review purchasing “Directors and Officers” 
 
liability insurance from an outside company for the City Manager as to coverage and 
cost. If the City Manager and the City Council agree on the purchase of such

perform work outside of the normal office hours of the City and he commits to

discretion of the City Manager. The premium cost of this insurance shall continue to 
be paid by the City after and throughout Mr. DePasquale’s retirement as part of his 
supplemental benefits pursuant to this agreement. 

This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

above, and other benefits, as provided in paragraphs 4.3 above, as well as the 
compensatory time  as provided in paragraph 4.8  above and other accrued benefits as 
are due to Mr. DePasquale under the terms of this Agreement, Mr. DePasquale shall 
not be entitled to receive any other compensation or benefits after the date of 
termination under this Section 5.1.

Mr. DePasquale may be suspended and/or removed as the City Manager, and this 
Agreement terminated, for “Cause,” by a majority vote of the City Council.  For the

SECTION 6 - INDEMNIFICATION 

6.1 

To the fullest extent permitted by law, the City shall (1) defend, save 

 
harmless and indemnify the City Manager against any tort, professional liability, claim 
or demand, or other legal action, whether groundless or otherwise, arising out of an 
alleged act or omission occurring in the performance of his duties as City Manager, 
even if said claim has been made following his termination from employment, provided 
that the City Manager acted within the scope of his duties, and (2) shall pay the 
amount of any settlement or judgment rendered thereon.  The City may compromise 
and settle any such claim or suit and will pay the amount of any settlement or 
judgment rendered thereon without recourse to the City Manager. 

 
The City shall reimburse the City Manager for any attorneys’ fees and costs 
incurred by the City Manager in connection with such claims or suits involving the 
City Manager in his professional capacity. 

This indemnification shall continue to apply to the City Manager after he leaves 

 
the employment of the City.   

Indemnification of Mr. DePasquale shall not apply to any proceeding to 

 
terminate his employment as the City Manager pursuant to statute, or this Agreement, 
unless the City manager is found not to have violated section 5.2 of this agreement.   
Mr. DePasquale agrees to cooperate fully with the City and the City’s attorney in any 
claim, suit, or matter in which the City is indemnifying Mr. DePasquale.  Mr. 
DePasquale shall be paid the existing daily rate for his position at the time of his 
retirement or other end of his service for time spent for testimony or consultation by or 
on behalf of the City in defense of such claims or actions.  This Section 6.1 also 
applies with respect to claims, suits, or matters which arise out of Mr. DePasquale’s 
performance of his duties for the City prior to his position of City Manager.

Dear Colleagues: 

Policy briefs on natural gas by Jessica Wright, BU URBAN Graduate 

The attached one-pager and three policy briefs were prepared by Jessica Wright, a 

Packet Pg. 383

participating student in the Boston University Graduate Program in Urban 
Biogeoscience and Environmental Health (“BU 
 URBAN”). Jessica’s research at BU has focused heavily on natural gas energy - 
specifically how gas leaks affect our urban canopy and research into transitions 
off of natural gas. This summer, as part of the URBAN program, she completed 
an internship with my office, researching and writing the attached policy briefs on 
the public health impacts of natural gas, the job market impacts of natural gas, and 
the climate change impacts of transitioning away from natural gas as an energy 
source for buildings in Cambridge. I hope you find them helpful and informative 
in our ongoing climate and energy policy efforts. 

Sincerely,

 Electrification & A Move Off of Natural Gas in Cambridge, MA - 
Fact Sheet 

An energy transition to electricity and a move off of natural gas will help put 
Cambridge, MA on track to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The motivations for 
moving off of natural gas are outlined below and include the public health and 
safety, job market, and climate change implications of natural gas. 
Public Health and Natural Gas: 
Natural gas energy poses a threat to public health both by diminishing indoor air 
quality and damaging street trees that provide ecosystem services beneficial to 
human health. 

● 

Indoor air quality in gas-serviced homes and businesses is degraded by 
combustion byproducts released by pilot light and gas stove burner 
ignitions. Combustion byproducts are harmful chemicals proven to 
increase asthma exacerbations (asthma attacks of coughing, wheezing, 
and shortness of breath), increase risk of respiratory infections, and 
have been linked to nausea, headaches, and fatigue. 

●  Outdoor air quality is impacted by leaking natural gas infrastructure, as 
leaks and odorant from the aging pipes pollute degrade outdoor air. Gas 
leaks are linked to street tree damage and death, which significantly 
reduces their ecosystem services, including cleaning the air, providing 
shade, reducing the urban heat island effect, absorbing carbon dioxide, 
and encouraging recreational activity. Additionally, gas leaks inhibit the 
development of Cambridge’s urban forest master plan.

Job Creation and Natural Gas: 
While the job market implications of electrification are challenging to quantify, the 
state of the science is encouraging of a multitude of jobs developing from a just 
energy transition plan: 

●  Clean energy jobs are numerous and growing as more demand for 
renewable energy develops. Solar and wind installation jobs are 
projected as two of the three most rapidly growing job markets in the 
country this coming decade. 

●  Ensuring a just transition for legacy fossil fuel and union workers will 

require complex planning. Including these workers and energy 
stakeholders throughout the planning and implementation processes of 
energy transition will be crucial to successfully address community 
needs. Prioritizing and educating low-income and environmental justice 
communities throughout the energy transition will ensure a just transition 
for all Cambridge residents. 

●  Providing security, funding, and retraining opportunities for legacy 
workers and new employees of the clean energy economy will help 
facilitate further support for an energy transition. 

Climate Change and Natural Gas: 
The climate change impacts of natural gas can no longer be ignored as Cambridge 
strives to lower carbon emissions, achieve robust climate goals, and grow their 
urban canopy. 

●  Leaking and aging natural gas distribution infrastructure corrodes and 

releases un-combusted natural gas, primarily methane, into the 
atmosphere contributing a significant source of greenhouse gas 
emissions and exacerbating climate change effects in the city. 

●  Leaks damage urban vegetation and street trees. Methane from leaks 

infiltrate street tree soil pits and push oxygen out, leading to root damage 
and tree death, damaging the existing tree canopy.

 Public Health Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo 

 

1. Introduction: 
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to 
inform decisions regarding a transition away from natural gas infrastructure in new 
construction buildings in the city. This memo will convey the state of the science 
of natural gas infrastructure and its public health and safety impacts on 
communities serviced by this energy type. A review of the science on public health 
and natural gas energy would be incomplete without noting the public health and 
safety impacts associated with hydraulic fracturing (fracking), the sourcing of 
natural gas. Fracking has become increasingly common in residential areas and has 
led to an increase in cardiovascular disease in populations near fracking sites, as 
well as significantly degraded air quality.1,2 Cambridge is not located near a 
fracking site but the health impacts throughout the natural gas lifecycle are 
significant, for example in Pennsylvania, Virginia. However, it is important to 
remember that our gas habits contribute significantly to public health issues in 
states close by. In the Marcellus Shale Region, located throughout western New 

Packet Pg. 385

York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, there is a considerable amount of natural gas 
fracking. Research has shown that the chemicals used in fracking can damage the 
lungs, liver, kidneys, blood, and brains of people living nearby.3 While these 
pollutants are more common in areas of heavy fracking, there is emerging research 
suggesting that some of these chemicals, some of which are carcinogens, may find 
their way downstream to the distribution network of the Greater Boston Area.4 
Below, the public health impacts of natural gas energy in residential households 
and municipalities like Cambridge is reviewed. 

2. Research Question & Methodology 
The goal of the following policy memo is to provide scientific evidence in support 
of building electrification with a focus on protecting the public health and safety of 
Cambridge residents, both current and future. In addition to protecting the health 
and well-being of residents, electrifying new construction buildings will help 
Cambridge stay on track to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Data to inform this 
policy brief was compiled from published peer-reviewed literature. A keyword 
search was completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases, such as 
Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the author’s 
4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and papers were 
selected for their focus on the public health impacts of methane and combustion 
byproducts associated with natural gas energy. Additional data was collected 
through publicly available databases, including the location of known gas leaks 
currently reported in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020. 

3. Key Findings 
Natural gas extraction and distribution has detrimental effects on both indoor and 
ambient air quality, which has direct impacts on public health.5 Natural gas 
generation relies heavily on combustion processes, which release particulate matter 
and harmful gases, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile

organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon monoxide. Additionally, there are 
significant greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas generation that 
contribute to global warming and can cause damage 
to urban vegetation including the tree canopy.6 Promoting a robust urban tree canopy is 
important for 
public health because trees in urban areas help to mitigate the urban heat island 
effect, lowering temperatures and providing shade while diminishing energy 
consumption, and contributing to the community’s well-being.7 

Building electrification has the potential to significantly decrease the greenhouse 
gas emissions from the city, reducing the climate change impacts associated with 
elevated levels of carbon dioxide and methane emissions.8 Methane is a 

 

 
 

 

 

8.4

Packet Pg. 386

greenhouse gas and a product of natural gas energy, however, there is little to no 
research available regarding the direct impacts of methane on human health. 
Narrowing the scope to the public health consequences of natural gas in 
Cambridge, MA brings attention to two distinct public health concerns: the danger 
of combustion byproducts in homes with natural gas powered appliances, and the 
loss of beneficial public health ecosystem services like vegetative cooling, as 
climate change impacts are intensified in urban areas.9,10 

3.1 Natural gas and combustion byproducts 
The most significant public health threat from natural gas energy occurs in homes 
serviced by natural gas powered appliances, including gas stoves, gas boilers (for 
home heating and hot water) and clothes dryers.11 Gas stoves are perhaps the most 
common and significant threat to residents because of the 
on-site combustion reaction that happens at the burner when the stove is turned on. 
These pollutants are referred to as combustion byproducts and are caused by an 
incomplete combustion reaction.12 Combustion byproducts include carbon 
monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Carbon monoxide is a 
colorless, odorless gas that can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Nitrogen 
dioxide, another combustion byproduct can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, and 
throat, and in high concentrations can lead to an increased risk of respiratory 
infections. Particulate matter released during combustion can cause irritation in the 
lungs, damage to lung tissue if inhaled, and can lead to an increased risk of cancer. 
Lastly, incomplete combustion reactions can create water vapor, which can 
increase the humidity in a home, creating an environment for mold or dust mites.13 

Combustion byproducts from gas-powered appliances are a serious threat to 
human health and serious concerns about outdated and improper use of gas-
powered appliances have emerged. A recent report published out of Australia 
found that replacing gas stoves in all homes with newer gas models or electric 
appliances and encouraging the use of proper ventilation hoods could lower 
asthma prevalence from indoor air pollutants nearly 10%.14 Proper ventilation and 
newer gas stoves, without a pilot light, have been shown to help reduce the amount 
of combustion byproducts from gas stoves and help negate the

effects on gas-powered appliances on indoor air quality.15 Newer gas stoves and 
the use of a ventilation hood when cooking can significantly reduce one’s 
exposure to combustion byproducts but these best practices are not always 
practical in every person’s home environment, especially for renters who do not 
have control over what type of appliances are in the unit.16 

There are underlying themes of environmental justice issues surrounding gas leaks 

 

 

 

 

8.4

and their impact on public health. Homeowners have a clear advantage as they 
have control over their fuel for heating/cooling and cooking. Renters can struggle 
with dictating their fuel type, although even among renters, there is a divide, as 
wealthier renters have more options and control over what type of infrastructure 
they will choose to live with. This disparity is one example of the disproportionate 
effects an energy transition can have on communities. Low-income communities 
and communities of color have historically been marginalized and disadvantaged 
when it comes to environmental stewardship and sustainable living and the energy 
transition case is no exception. Energy transition, if not handled properly, will 
negatively affect disadvantaged communities by exacerbating prevalent energy 
insecurity and issues of environmental racism.17 

3.2 Natural gas and vegetation loss 
Additional concerns about natural gas and public health are broader but equally 
important. Aging natural gas distribution infrastructure is springing leaks and from 
these leaks, uncombusted methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas, escapes into 
the urban atmosphere.18 This gas can also escape into street tree pits and damage 
urban vegetation. A robust urban canopy has many public health benefits that are 
depleted when trees die or are removed due to damage from a gas leak.19 
Massachusetts has a significant problem with leaking gas infrastructure because 
over 11% of the pipeline distribution network in the state is made of leak-prone 
pipe material, like cast iron, compared to only 0.9% of leak-prone pipes across the 
country where older infrastructure has been replaced.20 Urban vegetation is 
associated with many public health benefits including, improvement to air quality 
and associated respiratory outcomes, cooling temperatures in urban areas and 
reducing the urban heat island effect, improvement of physical and mental health 
through the promotion of recreational activity, and increased perceptions of 
personal 
safety.21,22 A recent study in Chelsea, MA demonstrated that unhealthy or dying 
street trees were 30x more likely to have elevated methane in their soils from a 
nearby gas leak than healthy street trees.23 

As Cambridge is working to improve their urban forest, considering the effects of 
gas leaks on street trees is of the utmost importance. Cambridge has developed a 
comprehensive Urban Forest Master Plan with the aim of protecting and 
promoting a robust, healthy, and sustainable urban canopy.24 The benefits of

such an urban canopy cannot be overlooked from both an environmental and a 
public health perspective. As highlighted by the study in Chelsea, MA from above,

8.4

gas leaks pose a significant threat to street trees and can seriously degrade the urban 
canopy over time.25 Promoting a robust urban canopy can also help to alleviate 
environmental and public health stressors, not only related to gas leaks but issues of 
air pollution and the urban heat island effect, in low-income environmental justice 
communities. To successfully reach the goals outlined in the Urban Forest Master 
Plan and to provide street trees for the most dire communities, Cambridge will be 
forced to address the issues of aging gas infrastructure lying under the street. 

4. Recommendations / Next Steps 
Encouraging building electrification will prepare the City of Cambridge to reach 
its goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce the public health impacts of 
natural gas energy. Improving the indoor air quality of Cambridge residents, 
homeowners, business workers, and renters alike, can be achieved by switching 
from natural gas to electric appliances and heating. Incorporating electric 
infrastructure in new construction buildings from the start of construction will save 
health effects, time, and money down the road as Cambridge looks towards a clean 
energy future. Additionally, aging natural gas infrastructure will continue to leak 
and spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing 
to the greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and 
street trees. In order to maintain Cambridge’s urban canopy and the countless 
public health services provided by these street trees, reducing the mortality of 
these trees due to leaking gas infrastructure will be key. 

Electrifying new construction buildings is a logical place to start because there will 
be no additional reliance on the aged natural gas system moving forward. 
Beginning a climate forward development plan for the city, and creating jobs in the 
process, will help the city not only achieve its climate action goals but improve the 
health and well-being of its residents.

 Job Market Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo 

1. Introduction: 
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts 
to help inform decisions regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction 
buildings in the city. This memo will convey the job market possibilities from 
electrification and a clean energy transition in Cambridge and highlight the 
opportunities for job creation. Investing in natural gas energy in any new 
construction building will commit the City of Cambridge to further reliance on 
fossil fuels and further delay the city from reaching their climate action goals. In 
order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with natural gas will need 
to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging electrification from the 
onset will expedite the city’s climate agenda. Protecting current gas workers and 
providing proper training and job security will be crucial in implementing 

8.4

Packet Pg. 391

 

 
 

 
 
 

electrification that services all concerned stakeholders. 
Additionally,  to  ensure  a  just  transition  for  all  communities,  incorporating  a 
commitment to job training and economic development support for those likely 
to be negatively impacted by an energy transition is key. 

2. Research Question & Methodology 
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey the job market growth 
opportunities of building electrification in Cambridge. Reducing reliance on 
natural gas and promoting electrification throughout the city’s built environment 
would diminish greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel energy and 
push the city in the direction of carbon neutrality by 2050.26 Data to inform this 
policy brief was compiled from environmental economic research, interviews with 
industry professionals, and a review of the published peer-reviewed literature. A 
keyword search was completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases, 
such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the 
author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and 
papers were selected for their focus on the politics and economic impacts of 
electrification and energy transition at the municipal level. Additional data was 
collected through publicly available databases. 

3. Key Findings 
A transition to electrification and a clean energy economy is challenging to 
envision because of the variety of jobs that could be created as an outcome. An 
energy transition at the municipal level could be associated with dramatic job loss 
and an increase in unemployment. However, research has shown that a just energy 
transition can occur that maintains well-paying jobs, continues to provide for 
workers and their families, and promotes a healthy and sustainable energy future 
that is beneficial for all. The key findings from this research included two main 
takeaways: 1) how to incorporate and partner with the current gas infrastructure 
work force and related stakeholders in creating and implementing an energy 
transition plan that works for everyone, and 2) how to retrain workers and create 
new jobs to build and manage electrified infrastructure. 

26 Cameron & van der Zwaan, 2015. 
However, before diving into the literature of how an energy transition off of 
natural gas could take shape, it is important to review the state of the science on 
energy equality and just transition from areas around the world in the midst of 
transitioning their energy supply. Commonly, when imagining stakeholders who 
would be ill-affected by an energy transition, legacy workers from the fossil fuel 
industry come to mind. While those legacy workers would be adversely affected, it 
is important to realize that energy transition can also affect low-income 
communities and communities of color by worsening issues of energy insecurity 
and failing to educate and engage these disadvantaged groups in the transition 
process.27 Scholars recognize that research on how to address these disparities is 

8.4

Packet Pg. 392

generally under-developed but for stakeholders and decision makers planning 
energy transitions, incorporating these disadvantaged communities will be integral 
in making any energy transition plan equitable.28 A piece published in Nature 
argues that decision makers at the forefront of energy transition policies need to, 
work to redistribute welfare so as to avoid undue burden on any specific 
population and provide sufficient energy services to all, and… provide an 
adequate safety net for all populations, especially those most marginalized 
or burdened.29 

Incorporating these themes of a just energy transition is important when 
considering the job market possibilities in a Cambridge energy transition plan. 

3.1 Coordinating an energy transition plan 
In partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a study out of 
the University of California highlighted the importance of protecting gas workers in 
a transition off of natural gas energy.30 Important to remember when considering an 
electrification plan for the City of Cambridge is that such a transition does not 
occur overnight, meaning that for some current gas workers their job requirements 
will not change. Gas infrastructure projects will still occur and home service calls 
will require expert repair. 

However, maintaining the gas infrastructure during a phase of electrification will 
not require the full force of the gas workers that exist today, meaning some 
workers will face a transition in their career. A major concern for governments 
considering an energy transition or electrification plan is backlash from displaced 
gas workers. Therefore, a robust municipal plan to transition off of gas must be 
created in collaboration with gas workers. This will not only ease the concerns of 
the gas workers but ensure that a transition plan will provide the job security and 
economic benefits workers deserve. 

Key findings out of a report conducted in California, a state considering a gas ban 
and push towards electrification, found the following components to be essential to 
a comprehensive transition plan: 

1.  Establishment of a buyout program that could cover the costs of 

retirement systems for older workers 

2.  Establishment of a committee that could address how to best manage a 
shrinking gas workforce, while still safely maintaining any existing gas 
infrastructure throughout the transition period 

3.  Wage protection for transitioning workers 

27 Healy & Barry, 2017. 
28 Oppenheim, 2016. 
29 Carley & Konisky, 2020. 
30 Borgeson, 2019. 

4.  Provide funding and training/retraining for gas workers looking to 

transition to clean energy or electrification positions.31 

Prioritizing communication with gas workers throughout the planning and 

 

 

 

 
 

 

8.4

Packet Pg. 393

implementation of an electrification and gas transition plan is crucial for 
maintaining job security and incorporating the existing skilled workforce into a 
clean energy workforce.32 In addition to engaging with gas workers throughout the 
planning phase, stakeholder groups such as residents can help develop a transition 
plan tailored to tbe communities’ specific needs. A recent study in Michigan found 
that when citizens and other stakeholders were involved in the planning process, 
they were more likely to perceive the positive benefits of energy transition, in this 
case wind turbine installation, than communities not at all included in the planning 
process.33 

3.2 Job creation in the transition stage 
A major component of electrification and energy transition at the municipal level 
will be creating jobs and retraining utility workers, often unionized labor, to 
provide well-paying career opportunities.34 Researchers and non-profits are 
working to develop energy transition plans that not only serve the planet but also 
the work force required for such robust implementation. One such organization, 
based in Cambridge, MA, HEET (Home Energy Efficiency Team) has been 
researching the feasibility of a GeoMircoDistrict project.35 The GeoMicroDistrict 
would replace aging natural gas distribution infrastructure with ground-source heat 
pumps that could service a small group of homes and businesses in a micro-
district. Installation of the ground-source heat pumps may need specialized skills 
but all maintenance could easily be handled by the existing gas workers. 
Geothermal infrastructure carries water, not gas, under and through city streets to 
deliver heating and cooling services so a switch from natural gas to water 
maintenance would not only require minimal training but also promote a healthier 
and safer work environment.11  36 

Research from around the world suggests that a energy transition and shift towards 
renewable and more efficient low-carbon energy will lead to employment 
opportunities, ranging from manufacturing, construction, and installation to fuel 
extraction, supply, and transmission.37 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 
recently reported that solar photovoltaic installers (51%) and wind turbine service 
technicians (61%) will be two of the three fastest growing occupations in the 
country in the coming decade, trailed only by nurse practitioners at 52% .38 

To address concerns about achieving energy efficiency and transitions to 
renewable energy throughout marginalized communities, various programs from 
municipalities are developing. Some examples include Colorado’s community 
solar program that reserved 5% of all projects for low-income residents,

during the community energy project development phase, and the community 
programs run by the Inclusive Financing for Energy Savings program which aims 
to provide financing and host sessions for community members and utilities to 
build demand for energy efficiency and/or renewable energy investments for their 
communities.39,40,41 

4. Recommendations / Next Steps 
While the job market implications of a clean energy transition take multiple forms, 
it is crucial to realize that a clean energy economy enables significant job creation, 
both directly and indirectly, and may produce more jobs per unit of installed 
capacity than fossil fuel based energy.42 Additionally, in a report published by 
Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), nationwide clean energy jobs outnumbered 
fossil fuel based jobs nearly 3:1 at the end of 2018.43 These numbers are 
encouraging and demonstrate the job creation possibilities brought forward by a 
just transition to clean energy. 

However, at the local scale, there are real and significant fears brought to light by 
gas workers and unions concerned about their futures were gas energy to be 
phased out. Therefore, incorporating these parties in the decision making process 
and ensuring security, retraining, and funding opportunities throughout the 
transition will be crucial to success. Implementing clean energy alternatives that 
utilize the existing skills of the gas workforce, such as the GeoMircoDistrict 
heating and cooling plan, will lower costs and time associated with retraining and 
could provide for healthier working conditions.44 Additionally, ensuring an 
equitable and just energy transition across low-income and communities of color 
by engaging and educating these communities throughout the planning and 
implementation processes will be crucial to provide a healthier and more energy 
efficient city for all residents.

 Climate Change Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo 

1. Introduction 
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to 
help inform decisions regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction 
buildings in the city. This memo will convey the state of the science of natural gas 
infrastructure and highlight how incorporating natural gas energy into new 
construction buildings will have negative environmental consequences for decades 
to come. 
Investing in natural gas energy in any new construction building will commit the 
City of Cambridge to further reliance on fossil fuels and further delay the city from 
reaching their climate action goals. Natural gas energy has potential to contribute to 
climate change across its lifecycle, from production at the site of hydraulic 
fracturing (“fracking”) to distribution under city streets. Natural gas fracking has 
potential to significantly damage watersheds and pollute the air and water in nearby 
communities, while fugitive emissions from leaking natural gas distribution 
infrastructure contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and can lead to street tree 
mortality/morbidity. In order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with 
natural gas will need to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging 
electrification from the onset will expedite the city’s climate agenda. 

2. Research Question and Methodology 
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey scientific evidence in support 
of building electrification and reducing or eliminating natural gas energy in newly 
constructed buildings in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Data to inform 
this policy brief was compiled from published 
peer-reviewed literature dating back to the 1970s, through current research. A 
keyword search was completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases, 
such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the 
author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. 
Keywords and papers were selected for their focus on the climate change impacts 
of natural gas energy, both at the site of fracking and at the point of distribution 
through infrastructure underneath urban streets. Additional data was collected 
through publicly available databases, including the location of known gas leaks 
reported by the gas utility company in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020.

3. Key Findings 
Three specific climate change impacts of natural gas energy stand out considerably 
in the literature including, 1) air and water pollution at the site of fracking, 2) 
significant methane emissions from leaking and aging natural gas distribution 
infrastructure, and 3) damage and death to street trees serving urban populations. 
Although there are serious climate change and environmental justice issues at the 
site of fracking for natural gas, no fracking sites are located in Cambridge, MA so 
while worth noting, this environmental impact will not be reviewed in this memo. 

3.1 Methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure 
Important for Cambridge to consider when planning for their energy future is the 
age and condition of natural gas distribution pipelines running under the streets 
across most of the city. Originally brought onto the energy market as a greener 
alternative to coal, natural gas energy had been associated with climate 
benefits since its installation decades ago.45 Recently, research has emerged to 
show the leakage of methane associated with natural gas sourcing and distribution 
infrastructure erases any climate benefits of natural gas.46 Atmospheric methane is 
a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 86 times more potent than 
carbon dioxide over a 20-year time period and methane is the primary constituent 
of uncombusted natural gas traveling through distribution pipelines.47,48 As the 
distribution pipelines age underneath city streets, pipes spring leaks. Some pipes 
are more leak-prone than others, such as cast iron, wrought iron, and unprotected 
steel.49 These leak-prone distribution pipes make up roughly 30% of the 
distribution infrastructure in the MA contributing to many gas leaks across the 
state.50 Figure 1 shows the location of currently unrepaired natural gas leaks in 
Cambridge, MA as reported by the gas utility to the Massachusetts Department of 
Public Utilities.

Although pipeline replacement projects have increased in recent years, gas leaks 
across municipalities still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Measuring 
exact methane concentrations from leaking natural gas infrastructure has proved 
challenging, in part due to the outdated standards for estimating 

45 Delborne et al. 2020. 
46 Howarth, 2014. 
47 Brandt et al. 2014. 
48 Global warming potential - “Each gas has a specific global warming potential, which 
allows comparisons of the amount of energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb 
over a given time period… compared with the emissions of 1 ton of CO2” - Valero, 2019. 
49 EPA, 1996. 
50 D.O.E., 2017. 
methane emissions from gas pipelines that the US Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) is still utilizing.51 Recent studies have tried to update these methane 
emission standards to better understand the contribution of leaking gas 
infrastructure to total greenhouse gas emissions. Hendrick and co-authors focused 
in the Greater Boston Area and found that not all gas leaks are equal and from their 
survey of 100 gas leaks, found that the top 7% of leaks contributed to 50% of the 
total methane emissions measured.52 Although the science of methane emissions 
from natural gas distribution infrastructure is still emerging, there is consensus that 
methane emissions from natural gas leaks cannot be overlooked when making 
decisions about achieving carbon neutrality and electrifying Cambridge. 

3.2 Natural gas leaks and street trees 
Another area of climate change concerns associated with natural gas infrastructure 
is the damage to urban vegetation and street trees that results from aging and 
leaking distribution pipelines. When methane leaks from a pipe buried underneath 
a city street, a path of least resistance for the gas to reach the atmosphere exists in 
the soil pits where street trees and other urban vegetation is planted. Studies dating 
back to the 1970s characterize the interactions between methane and the soil of 
tree pits.53,54 As methane enters the soil, it begins to displace the oxygen in the soil, 
leaving less oxygen available for the roots of urban vegetation to take up.55 
Additional changes occur in the microbial communities in these tree pits, as the 
influx of methane causes a growth in methanotroph populations, which further 
deplete oxygen available for the tree.56,57 

More recent research conducted in Chelsea, MA aimed to quantify the effects of 
natural gas leaks on urban street tree health.58 This study concluded that dead or 
dying street trees across Chelsea were 30 times more likely to have been exposed 
to methane, compared to healthy control trees. Damage to urban street trees and 
vegetation have significant climate change impacts due in large part to the 
ecosystem services provided to cities by a robust urban canopy. Street trees have 
demonstrated ability to reduce urban temperatures through shading and

evaporative cooling which can help address issues associated with the urban heat 
island effect.59,60,61 Additionally, street trees provide flood control, consume 
carbon

52 Hendrick et al. 2016. 
53 Davis, 1977. 
54 Hoeks, 1972. 
55 Trees and other vegetation require oxygen in the soil to respire. When the sun is 
not out, or it is night, plants require oxygen from their roots to create energy to 
grow. - Plaxton et al. 2006.

58 Schollaert et al. 2020. 
59 Norton et al. 2015. 
60 Evaporative cooling - refers to a phenomenon in trees caused by the evaporation 
of  water  on  the  leaves.  Trees  release  water  into  the  atmosphere  through 
transpiration,  and as this water turns from  a liquid  to  gas, the surrounding air is 
cooled. USDA. 2019.

temperatures are significantly higher in cities than in rural areas due to the 
absorption and accumulation of heat in pavements and other physical interactions”

dioxide, and provide aesthetic and recreational value.62,63,64 According to the 
Cambridge Urban Canopy report from 2016, Cambridge does well at caring for 
their tree canopy, compared to estimates in other cities at 96.7% for young trees 
and 90.8% for old trees.65 Maintaining current practices for caring for street trees 
and removing further threat from natural gas leaks will be crucial moving forward 
to promote a robust urban canopy in Cambridge. 

4. Recommendations / Next Steps 
Promoting building electrification will help to prepare the City of Cambridge to 
reach its goals of carbon neutrality by 2050 and reduce the environmental impacts 
of natural gas energy. Aging natural gas infrastructure will continue to leak and 
spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing to the 
greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and street 
trees. In order to maintain and grow the beauty of Cambridge’s urban canopy and 
promote a sustainable and equitable future for the city, transitioning off of natural 
gas will be key. Banning natural gas in new construction buildings in favor of 
electrification is a logical place to start because there will be no additional reliance 
on the aged natural gas system moving forward. Beginning a climate forward 
development plan for the city, and creating jobs in the process, will help the city 
achieve its climate action goals. A failure to do so could delay achievement of the 
city’s climate change goals, continue to damage the environment, and commit the 
city to a future reliance on natural gas and fossil fuels that is unnecessary.

Electrification & A Move Off of Natural Gas in Cambridge, MA - 

Fact Sheet 

An energy transition to electricity and a move off of natural gas will help put Cambridge, MA on track to 
reach carbon neutrality by 2050. The motivations for moving off of natural gas are outlined below and 
include the public health and safety, job market, and climate change implications of natural gas.  

Public Health and Natural Gas: 

Natural gas energy poses a threat to public health both by diminishing indoor air quality and damaging 
street trees that provide ecosystem services beneficial to human health.  

● Indoor air quality in gas-serviced homes and businesses is degraded by combustion byproducts 
released by pilot light and gas stove burner ignitions. Combustion byproducts are harmful 
chemicals proven to increase asthma exacerbations (asthma attacks of coughing, wheezing, and 
shortness of breath), increase risk of respiratory infections, and have been linked to nausea, 
headaches, and fatigue. 

● Outdoor air quality is impacted by leaking natural gas infrastructure, as leaks and odorant from 

the aging pipes pollute degrade outdoor air. Gas leaks are linked to street tree damage and death, 
which significantly reduces their ecosystem services, including cleaning the air, providing shade, 
reducing the urban heat island effect, absorbing carbon dioxide, and encouraging recreational 
activity. Additionally, gas leaks inhibit the development of Cambridge’s urban forest master plan. 

Job Creation and Natural Gas: 

While the job market implications of electrification are challenging to quantify, the state of the science is 
encouraging of a multitude of jobs developing from a just energy transition plan: 

● Clean energy jobs are numerous and growing as more demand for renewable energy develops. 
Solar and wind installation jobs are projected as two of the three most rapidly growing job 
markets in the country this coming decade. 

● Ensuring a just transition for legacy fossil fuel and union workers will require complex planning. 
Including these workers and energy stakeholders throughout the planning and implementation 
processes of energy transition will be crucial to successfully address community needs. 
Prioritizing and educating low-income and environmental justice communities throughout the 
energy transition will ensure a just transition for all Cambridge residents. 

● Providing security, funding, and retraining opportunities for legacy workers and new employees 

of the clean energy economy will help facilitate further support for an energy transition.  

Climate Change and Natural Gas: 

The climate change impacts of natural gas can no longer be ignored as Cambridge strives to lower carbon 
emissions, achieve robust climate goals, and grow their urban canopy. 

● Leaking and aging natural gas distribution infrastructure corrodes and releases un-combusted 
natural gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing a significant source of 
greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating climate change effects in the city.  

● Leaks damage urban vegetation and street trees. Methane from leaks infiltrate street tree soil pits 
and push oxygen out, leading to root damage and tree death, damaging the existing tree canopy.

Public Health Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo 
 
1. Introduction: 
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to inform decisions 
regarding a transition away from natural gas infrastructure in new construction buildings in the city. This 
memo will convey the state of the science of natural gas infrastructure and its public health and safety 
impacts on communities serviced by this energy type. A review of the science on public health and 
natural gas energy would be incomplete without noting the public health and safety impacts associated 
with hydraulic fracturing (fracking), the sourcing of natural gas. Fracking has become increasingly 
common in residential areas and has led to an increase in cardiovascular disease in populations near 
fracking sites, as well as significantly degraded air quality. ,  Cambridge is not located near a fracking site 
but the health impacts throughout the natural gas lifecycle are significant, for example in Pennsylvania, 
Virginia. However, it is important to remember that our gas habits contribute significantly to public health 
issues in states close by. In the Marcellus Shale Region, located throughout western New York, 
Pennsylvania, and Ohio, there is a considerable amount of natural gas fracking. Research has shown that 
the chemicals used in fracking can damage the lungs, liver, kidneys, blood, and brains of people living 
nearby.  While these pollutants are more common in areas of heavy fracking, there is emerging research 
suggesting that some of these chemicals, some of which are carcinogens, may find their way downstream 
to the distribution network of the Greater Boston Area.  Below, the public health impacts of natural gas 
energy in residential households and municipalities like Cambridge is reviewed. 
 
2. Research Question & Methodology 
The goal of the following policy memo is to provide scientific evidence in support of building 
electrification with a focus on protecting the public health and safety of Cambridge residents, both current 
and future. In addition to protecting the health and well-being of residents, electrifying new construction 
buildings will help Cambridge stay on track to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. Data to inform this 
policy brief was compiled from published peer-reviewed literature. A keyword search was completed 
using a variety of peer-review journal databases, such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as 
citations collected from the author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and 
papers were selected for their focus on the public health impacts of methane and combustion byproducts 
associated with natural gas energy. Additional data was collected through publicly available databases, 
including the location of known gas leaks currently reported in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020. 
 
 
3. Key Findings 
Natural gas extraction and distribution has detrimental effects on both indoor and ambient air quality, 
which has direct impacts on public health.  Natural gas generation relies heavily on combustion processes, 
which release particulate matter and harmful gases, such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile

organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon monoxide. Additionally, there are significant greenhouse gas 
emissions associated with natural gas generation that contribute to global warming and can cause damage 
to urban vegetation including the tree canopy.   Promoting a robust urban tree canopy is important for 
public health because trees in urban areas help to mitigate the urban heat island effect, lowering 
temperatures and providing shade while diminishing energy consumption, and contributing to the 
community’s well-being.  7
 
Building electrification has the potential to significantly decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from the 
city, reducing the climate change impacts associated with elevated levels of carbon dioxide and methane 
emissions.  Methane is a greenhouse gas and a product of natural gas energy, however, there is little to no 
research available regarding the direct impacts of methane on human health. Narrowing the scope to the 
public health consequences of natural gas in Cambridge, MA brings attention to two distinct public health 
concerns: the danger of combustion byproducts in homes with natural gas powered appliances, and the 
loss of beneficial public health ecosystem services like vegetative cooling, as climate change impacts are 
intensified in urban areas. ,
 
3.1 Natural gas and combustion byproducts 
The most significant public health threat from natural gas energy occurs in homes serviced by natural gas 
powered appliances, including gas stoves, gas boilers (for home heating and hot water) and clothes  
dryers.
 Gas stoves are perhaps the most common and significant threat to residents because of the 
on-site combustion reaction that happens at the burner when the stove is turned on. These pollutants are 
referred to as combustion byproducts and are caused by an incomplete combustion reaction.
byproducts include carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Carbon monoxide is a 
colorless, odorless gas that can cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Nitrogen dioxide, another 
combustion byproduct can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat, and in high concentrations can 
lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections. Particulate matter released during combustion can cause 
irritation in the lungs, damage to lung tissue if inhaled, and can lead to an increased risk of cancer. Lastly, 
incomplete combustion reactions can create water vapor, which can increase the humidity in a home, 
creating an environment for mold or dust mites.
 
Combustion byproducts from gas-powered appliances are a serious threat to human health and serious 
concerns about outdated and improper use of gas-powered appliances have emerged. A recent report 
published out of Australia found that replacing gas stoves in all homes with newer gas models or electric 
appliances and encouraging the use of proper ventilation hoods could lower asthma prevalence from 
indoor air pollutants nearly 10%.
 Proper ventilation and newer gas stoves, without a pilot light, have 
been shown to help reduce the amount of combustion byproducts from gas stoves and help negate the

hood when cooking can significantly reduce one’s exposure to combustion byproducts but these best 
practices are not always practical in every person’s home environment, especially for renters who do not 
have control over what type of appliances are in the unit.
 
There are underlying themes of environmental justice issues surrounding gas leaks and their impact on 
public health. Homeowners have a clear advantage as they have control over their fuel for heating/cooling 
and cooking. Renters can struggle with dictating their fuel type, although even among renters, there is a 
divide, as wealthier renters have more options and control over what type of infrastructure they will 
choose to live with. This disparity is one example of the disproportionate effects an energy transition can 
have on communities. Low-income communities and communities of color have historically been 
marginalized and disadvantaged when it comes to environmental stewardship and sustainable living and 
the energy transition case is no exception. Energy transition, if not handled properly, will negatively 
affect disadvantaged communities by exacerbating prevalent energy insecurity and issues of 
environmental racism.
 
 
3.2 Natural gas and vegetation loss 
Additional concerns about natural gas and public health are broader but equally important. Aging natural 
gas distribution infrastructure is springing leaks and from these leaks, uncombusted methane, a highly

and damage urban vegetation. A robust urban canopy has many public health benefits that are depleted 
when trees die or are removed due to damage from a gas leak.
 Massachusetts has a significant problem 
with leaking gas infrastructure because over 11% of the pipeline distribution network in the state is made 
of leak-prone pipe material, like cast iron, compared to only 0.9% of leak-prone pipes across the country 
where older infrastructure has been replaced.

in urban areas and reducing the urban heat island effect, improvement of physical and mental health 
through the promotion of recreational activity, and increased perceptions of personal 
safety.
more likely to have elevated methane in their soils from a nearby gas leak than healthy street trees.
 
As Cambridge is working to improve their urban forest, considering the effects of gas leaks on street trees 
is of the utmost importance. Cambridge has developed a comprehensive Urban Forest Master Plan with 
the aim of protecting and promoting a robust, healthy, and sustainable urban canopy.

 A recent study in Chelsea, MA demonstrated that unhealthy or dying street trees were 30x

such an urban canopy cannot be overlooked from both an environmental and a public health perspective. 
As highlighted by the study in Chelsea, MA from above, gas leaks pose a significant threat to street trees 
and can seriously degrade the urban canopy over time.
 Promoting a robust urban canopy can also help to 
alleviate environmental and public health stressors, not only related to gas leaks but issues of air pollution 
and the urban heat island effect, in low-income environmental justice communities. To successfully reach 
the goals outlined in the Urban Forest Master Plan and to provide street trees for the most dire 
communities, Cambridge will be forced to address the issues of aging gas infrastructure lying under the 
street. 
 
4. Recommendations / Next Steps 
Encouraging building electrification will prepare the City of Cambridge to reach its goals of carbon 
neutrality by 2050 and reduce the public health impacts of natural gas energy. Improving the indoor air 
quality of Cambridge residents, homeowners, business workers, and renters alike, can be achieved by 
switching from natural gas to electric appliances and heating. Incorporating electric infrastructure in new 
construction buildings from the start of construction will save health effects, time, and money down the 
road as Cambridge looks towards a clean energy future. Additionally, aging natural gas infrastructure will 
continue to leak and spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere contributing to the 
greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and street trees. In order to maintain 
Cambridge’s urban canopy and the countless public health services provided by these street trees, 
reducing the mortality of these trees due to leaking gas infrastructure will be key.  
 
Electrifying new construction buildings is a logical place to start because there will be no additional 
reliance on the aged natural gas system moving forward. Beginning a climate forward development plan 
for the city, and creating jobs in the process, will help the city not only achieve its climate action goals but 
improve the health and well-being of its residents.

Job Market Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo 
 
1. Introduction: 
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to help inform decisions 
regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction buildings in the city. This memo will convey the 
job market possibilities from electrification and a clean energy transition in Cambridge and highlight the 
opportunities for job creation. Investing in natural gas energy in any new construction building will 
commit the City of Cambridge to further reliance on fossil fuels and further delay the city from reaching 
their climate action goals. In order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with natural gas will 
need to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging electrification from the onset will 
expedite the city’s climate agenda. Protecting current gas workers and providing proper training and job 
security will be crucial in implementing electrification that services all concerned stakeholders. 
Additionally, to ensure a just transition for all communities, incorporating a commitment to job training 
and economic development support for those likely to be negatively impacted by an energy transition is 
key. 
 
2. Research Question & Methodology 
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey the job market growth opportunities of building 
electrification in Cambridge. Reducing reliance on natural gas and promoting electrification throughout 
the city’s built environment would diminish greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuel energy 
and push the city in the direction of carbon neutrality by 2050.
compiled from environmental economic research, interviews with industry professionals, and a review of 
the published peer-reviewed literature. A keyword search was completed using a variety of peer-review 
journal databases, such as Web of Science and Science Direct, as well as citations collected from the 
author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. Keywords and papers were selected for 
their focus on the politics and economic impacts of electrification and energy transition at the municipal 
level. Additional data was collected through publicly available databases. 
 
 
3. Key Findings 
A transition to electrification and a clean energy economy is challenging to envision because of the 
variety of jobs that could be created as an outcome. An energy transition at the municipal level could be 
associated with dramatic job loss and an increase in unemployment. However, research has shown that a 
just energy transition can occur that maintains well-paying jobs, continues to provide for workers and 
their families, and promotes a healthy and sustainable energy future that is beneficial for all. The key 
findings from this research included two main takeaways: 1) how to incorporate and partner with the 
current gas infrastructure work force and related stakeholders in creating and implementing an energy 
transition plan that works for everyone, and 2) how to retrain workers and create new jobs to build and 
manage electrified infrastructure.

However, before diving into the literature of how an energy transition off of natural gas could take shape, 
it is important to review the state of the science on energy equality and just transition from areas around 
the world in the midst of transitioning their energy supply. Commonly, when imagining stakeholders who 
would be ill-affected by an energy transition, legacy workers from the fossil fuel industry come to mind. 
While those legacy workers would be adversely affected, it is important to realize that energy transition 
can also affect low-income communities and communities of color by worsening issues of energy 
 27
insecurity and failing to educate and engage these disadvantaged groups in the transition process.
Scholars recognize that research on how to address these disparities is generally under-developed but for 
stakeholders and decision makers planning energy transitions, incorporating these disadvantaged 
communities will be integral in making any energy transition plan equitable.
Nature argues that decision makers at the forefront of energy transition policies need to,

work to redistribute welfare so as to avoid undue burden on any specific population and provide 
sufficient energy services to all, and… provide an adequate safety net for all populations, 
especially those most marginalized or burdened.

 29

Incorporating these themes of a just energy transition is important when considering the job market 
possibilities in a Cambridge energy transition plan. 
 
3.1 Coordinating an energy transition plan 
In partnership with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), a study out of the University of 
 30
California highlighted the importance of protecting gas workers in a transition off of natural gas energy.
Important to remember when considering an electrification plan for the City of Cambridge is that such a 
transition does not occur overnight, meaning that for some current gas workers their job requirements will 
not change. Gas infrastructure projects will still occur and home service calls will require expert repair. 
 
However, maintaining the gas infrastructure during a phase of electrification will not require the full force 
of the gas workers that exist today, meaning some workers will face a transition in their career. A major 
concern for governments considering an energy transition or electrification plan is backlash from 
displaced gas workers. Therefore, a robust municipal plan to transition off of gas must be created in 
collaboration with gas workers. This will not only ease the concerns of the gas workers but ensure that a 
transition plan will provide the job security and economic benefits workers deserve. 
 
Key findings out of a report conducted in California, a state considering a gas ban and push towards 
electrification, found the following components to be essential to a comprehensive transition plan: 

1. Establishment of a buyout program that could cover the costs of retirement systems for older 

workers 

2. Establishment of a committee that could address how to best manage a shrinking gas workforce, 
while still safely maintaining any existing gas infrastructure throughout the transition period 

3. Wage protection for transitioning workers

 In addition to engaging with gas workers throughout 

 
Prioritizing communication with gas workers throughout the planning and implementation of an 
electrification and gas transition plan is crucial for maintaining job security and incorporating the existing 
skilled workforce into a clean energy workforce.
the planning phase, stakeholder groups such as residents can help develop a transition plan tailored to tbe 
communities’ specific needs. A recent study in Michigan found that when citizens and other stakeholders 
were involved in the planning process, they were more likely to perceive the positive benefits of energy 
transition, in this case wind turbine installation, than communities not at all included in the planning 
process.
 
3.2 Job creation in the transition stage 
A major component of electrification and energy transition at the municipal level will be creating jobs and 
retraining utility workers, often unionized labor, to provide well-paying career opportunities.
Researchers and non-profits are working to develop energy transition plans that not only serve the planet 
but also the work force required for such robust implementation. One such organization, based in 
Cambridge, MA, HEET (Home Energy Efficiency Team) has been researching the feasibility of a 
GeoMircoDistrict project.
infrastructure with ground-source heat pumps that could service a small group of homes and businesses in 
a micro-district. Installation of the ground-source heat pumps may need specialized skills but all 
maintenance could easily be handled by the existing gas workers. Geothermal infrastructure carries water, 
not gas, under and through city streets to deliver heating and cooling services so a switch from natural gas 
to water maintenance would not only require minimal training but also promote a healthier and safer work 
environment.
 
Research from around the world suggests that a energy transition and shift towards renewable and more 
efficient low-carbon energy will lead to employment opportunities, ranging from manufacturing, 
construction, and installation to fuel extraction, supply, and transmission.
Statistics recently reported that solar photovoltaic installers (51%) and wind turbine service technicians 
(61%) will be two of the three fastest growing occupations in the country in the coming decade, trailed 
only by nurse practitioners at 52% .
 
To address concerns about achieving energy efficiency and transitions to renewable energy throughout 
marginalized communities, various programs from municipalities are developing. Some examples include 
Colorado’s community solar program that reserved 5% of all projects for low-income residents, 

 The GeoMicroDistrict would replace aging natural gas distribution

energy project development phase, and the community programs run by the Inclusive Financing for 
Energy Savings program which aims to provide financing and host sessions for community members and 
utilities to build demand for energy efficiency and/or renewable energy investments for their 
communities.
 
4. Recommendations / Next Steps 
While the job market implications of a clean energy transition take multiple forms, it is crucial to realize 
that a clean energy economy enables significant job creation, both directly and indirectly, and may 
produce more jobs per unit of installed capacity than fossil fuel based energy.
 Additionally, in a report 
published by Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), nationwide clean energy jobs outnumbered fossil fuel 
based jobs nearly 3:1 at the end of 2018.
creation possibilities brought forward by a just transition to clean energy. 
 
However, at the local scale, there are real and significant fears brought to light by gas workers and unions 
concerned about their futures were gas energy to be phased out. Therefore, incorporating these parties in 
the decision making process and ensuring security, retraining, and funding opportunities throughout the 
transition will be crucial to success. Implementing clean energy alternatives that utilize the existing skills 
of the gas workforce, such as the GeoMircoDistrict heating and cooling plan, will lower costs and time 
associated with retraining and could provide for healthier working conditions.
equitable and just energy transition across low-income and communities of color by engaging and 
educating these communities throughout the planning and implementation processes will be crucial to 
provide a healthier and more energy efficient city for all residents.

Climate Change Impacts of Natural Gas - Policy Memo 
 
1. Introduction 
This policy memo is presented to the City Council of Cambridge, Massachusetts to help inform decisions 
regarding natural gas infrastructure in new construction buildings in the city. This memo will convey the 
state of the science of natural gas infrastructure and highlight how incorporating natural gas energy into 
new construction buildings will have negative environmental consequences for decades to come. 
Investing in natural gas energy in any new construction building will commit the City of Cambridge to 
further reliance on fossil fuels and further delay the city from reaching their climate action goals. Natural 
gas energy has potential to contribute to climate change across its lifecycle, from production at the site of 
hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to distribution under city streets. Natural gas fracking has potential to 
significantly damage watersheds and pollute the air and water in nearby communities, while fugitive 
emissions from leaking natural gas distribution infrastructure contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and 
can lead to street tree mortality/morbidity. In order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, any building with 
natural gas will need to be transitioned to electric energy therefore encouraging electrification from the 
onset will expedite the city’s climate agenda. 
 
2. Research Question and Methodology 
The goal of the following policy memo is to convey scientific evidence in support of building 
electrification and reducing or eliminating natural gas energy in newly constructed buildings in order to 
achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Data to inform this policy brief was compiled from published 
peer-reviewed literature dating back to the 1970s, through current research. A keyword search was 
completed using a variety of peer-review journal databases, such as Web of Science and Science Direct, 
as well as citations collected from the author’s 4 years of research in the field of natural gas energy. 
Keywords and papers were selected for their focus on the climate change impacts of natural gas energy, 
both at the site of fracking and at the point of distribution through infrastructure underneath urban streets. 
Additional data was collected through publicly available databases, including the location of known gas 
leaks reported by the gas utility company in Cambridge as of the summer of 2020. 
 
3. Key Findings 
Three specific climate change impacts of natural gas energy stand out considerably in the literature 
including, 1) air and water pollution at the site of fracking, 2) significant methane emissions from leaking 
and aging natural gas distribution infrastructure, and 3) damage and death to street trees serving urban 
populations. Although there are serious climate change and environmental justice issues at the site of 
fracking for natural gas, no fracking sites are located in Cambridge, MA so while worth noting, this 
environmental impact will not be reviewed in this memo. 
 
3.1 Methane emissions from natural gas infrastructure 
Important for Cambridge to consider when planning for their energy future is the age and condition of 
natural gas distribution pipelines running under the streets across most of the city. Originally brought onto 
the energy market as a greener alternative to coal, natural gas energy had been associated with climate

Although pipeline replacement projects have increased in recent years, gas leaks across municipalities 
still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. Measuring exact methane concentrations from leaking

 Recent studies have tried to update these methane emission standards to better understand the 

methane emissions from gas pipelines that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is still 
utilizing.
contribution of leaking gas infrastructure to total greenhouse gas emissions. Hendrick and co-authors 
focused in the Greater Boston Area and found that not all gas leaks are equal and from their survey of 100 
 52
gas leaks, found that the top 7% of leaks contributed to 50% of the total methane emissions measured.
Although the science of methane emissions from natural gas distribution infrastructure is still emerging, 
there is consensus that methane emissions from natural gas leaks cannot be overlooked when making 
decisions about achieving carbon neutrality and electrifying Cambridge.  
 
3.2 Natural gas leaks and street trees 
Another area of climate change concerns associated with natural gas infrastructure is the damage to urban 
vegetation and street trees that results from aging and leaking distribution pipelines. When methane leaks 
from a pipe buried underneath a city street, a path of least resistance for the gas to reach the atmosphere 
exists in the soil pits where street trees and other urban vegetation is planted. Studies dating back to the 
1970s characterize the interactions between methane and the soil of tree pits.
 As methane enters the 
soil, it begins to displace the oxygen in the soil, leaving less oxygen available for the roots of urban 
vegetation to take up.
influx of methane causes a growth in 
for the tree.
 
More recent research conducted in Chelsea, MA aimed to quantify the effects of natural gas leaks on 
urban street tree health.
 This study concluded that dead or dying street trees across Chelsea were 30 
times more likely to have been exposed to methane, compared to healthy control trees. Damage to urban 
street trees and vegetation have significant climate change impacts due in large part to the ecosystem 
services provided to cities by a robust urban canopy. Street trees have demonstrated ability to reduce 
urban temperatures through shading and

 According to the Cambridge Urban Canopy 
dioxide, and provide aesthetic and recreational value.
report from 2016, Cambridge does well at caring for their tree canopy, compared to estimates in other 
cities at 96.7% for young trees and 90.8% for old trees.
 Maintaining current practices for caring for 
street trees and removing further threat from natural gas leaks will be crucial moving forward to promote 
a robust urban canopy in Cambridge. 
 
4. Recommendations / Next Steps 
Promoting building electrification will help to prepare the City of Cambridge to reach its goals of carbon 
neutrality by 2050 and reduce the environmental impacts of natural gas energy. Aging natural gas 
infrastructure will continue to leak and spew uncombusted gas, primarily methane, into the atmosphere 
contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions of the city and damaging urban vegetation and street trees. 
In order to maintain and grow the beauty of Cambridge’s urban canopy and promote a sustainable and 
equitable future for the city, transitioning off of natural gas will be key. Banning natural gas in new 
construction buildings in favor of electrification is a logical place to start because there will be no 
additional reliance on the aged natural gas system moving forward. Beginning a climate forward 
development plan for the city, and creating jobs in the process, will help the city achieve its climate action 
goals. A failure to do so could delay achievement of the city’s climate change goals, continue to damage 
the environment, and commit the city to a future reliance on natural gas and fossil fuels that is 
unnecessary.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL  

  

Alanna Mallon  

Vice Mayor  

  
To: Cambridge City Council  
From: Alanna Mallon, Vice-Mayor  
Date: September 17th, 2020 
Subject: Universities’ Return to Campus 

  

  
To the Honorable, the City Council,  
 
At this time in the fall, Cambridge would usually begin the academic year by welcoming in thousands of 
college students. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, has fundamentally changed each aspect of our lives, 
including the ways we educate students, and bring new neighbors into our community. To learn more 
about how our local universities are adapting, I chaired an Economic Development and University 
Relations Committee meeting on August 11th. Since hearing directly from MIT, Harvard, and Lesley on 
their reopening strategies, they have each allowed a small, select number of students to return to the area 
for on-campus living, learning, or research experiences.  
 
Students and staff at each university must follow stringent public health guidelines to be allowed to return 
to campus, including testing and quarantine on arrival, as well as routine testing throughout the academic 
year. To date, 24 MIT community members have tested positive, compared to 54,448 tests that have been 
administered; their total positivity rate is just .044%, lower than Cambridge’s .16% two week positivity 
rate. The below chart illustrates MIT’s testing and positivity numbers during the past week.

Of the 48,434 tests that have been taken by Harvard students and faculty since June, 43, or .089%, were 
positive. Below is a seven-day visualization of new COVID-19 cases in the Harvard community during 
this past week. 

8.5.a

 

 
Anyone who tests positive is immediately quarantined and given access to medical care, if needed. Daily 
updates on these results are also available online by visiting MIT’s and Harvard’s respective testing 
dashboards. Although Lesley’s data is not yet available, they are working closely with the Public Health 
Department to track and respond to any cases, and I will share another update when that data is available. 
 
With low numbers like these, it’s clear that the universities’ vigilance and conservative approach is 
helping keep Cambridge safe in these uncertain times. As the Chair of the Economic Development and 
Universities Committee, I will continue working with each MIT, Harvard, Lesley, and our Public Health 
Department on public health strategies, and I look forward to exploring and developing creative ways each 
university can support our own public school students as we enter the new school year. 
 
 
Thank you,  
  

Alanna Mallon  
Cambridge Vice-Mayor
