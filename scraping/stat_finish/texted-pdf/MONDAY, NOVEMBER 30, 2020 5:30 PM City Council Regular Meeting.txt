Vaccinations for Health Care 
Workers:  Massachusetts expects to 
receive first doses of Pfizer vaccine 
by mid/late December. Supplies will 
be very limited and health care 
personnel with potential for direct or 
indirect hospital exposure will be 
prioritized.

Vaccine Priority Groups: MDPH will 
prioritize other high risk groups 
based on state and CDC/ACIP 
recommendations.

The Nov. 14 flu clinic at CambridgeSide 
doubled as a “practice run” for the mass 
dispensing of COVID-19 vaccine next year.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $1,250,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment 
Fund Emergency Communications Extraordinary Expense account.  Funds will be used for site 
maintenance and the replacement of critical infrastructure to support the City of Cambridge radio 
system.   
 
This request will support a technology refresh for the replacement of all repeaters and 
transmitters.   Replacement of all repeaters with identical gear is necessary for all sites to ensure 
connectivity with radios and infrastructure as well as IP based comparators for remote 
monitoring.  Due to the design of the radio infrastructure, they all must be replaced at the same 
time to ensure operational continuity with make and models.  In addition, site maintenance is 
required to ensure that there is sufficient back up power and that HVAC and grounding systems 
continue to operate effectively.    
 
Radio replacement and infrastructure funding was considered as part of the City’s FY21 capital 
budget plan, but it was determined that a separate appropriation from Free Cash during the fiscal 
year was the best way to finance this equipment.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the following two (2) appropriations related to the Foundry: 

1)  First, I am requesting an appropriation of $6.0 million from Free Cash to the Public 
Investment Fund Department of Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account; 
2)  Second, I am requesting an appropriation of $3.5 million received from the Cambridge 
Redevelopment Authority (CRA) to the Public Investment Fund Department of Public 
Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account.     

 
The total cost for the design and construction for the Foundry Building is now $45.5 million.    
 
This includes a total construction cost, or Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), with our 
contractor, of $37.5 million; and design, administration and contingency costs of $8 million.  
This brings the City’s total contribution for the design and construction of the Foundry to $35 
million and the CRA’s contribution to $10.5 million. (The CRA is also contributing an additional 
$500,000 for a total of $2.5 million to operating costs once the facility opens.) 
 
This is a substantial increase from the original budget estimates and a $9.5 million increase over 
our 50% construction estimates which were pre-pandemic.  Unanticipated costs are related to the 
following factors: 
 

•  Significant structural deficiencies with the existing wood trusses, including possibly the 

need to replace the existing wood roof sheathing. 

•  The new structural steel frame for the interior floors and required seismic reinforcement 
of the building needed a more significant foundation system which requires significantly 
more removal of contaminated soil and installation of a vapor mitigation system required 
by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to vent the underside of 
the floor slab.

•  The publicly bid Trade Contractors were $2 million over estimates ($10 million vs. $8 

•  Additional costs for wood windows, the exterior metal panel selection, & interior 

million estimated)  

woodwork.  

•  Roadway reconstruction on Rogers and Bent Street and a new intersection design at 

Rogers and Third Streets that is intended to help draw the public from Toomey Park and 
the intersection to the Foundry Building. The roadway and landscaping is presently 
estimated to be $2.2 million but is also actively being evaluated for cost reductions.  

 
Total additional cost now needed to complete this project is $9.5 million. We are actively 
exploring ways to reduce costs for this project, and any savings to the $37.5 million GMP will be 
returned to the City at the completion of the project. We expect to share this savings 
proportionately with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. 
 
I recommend your approval of these appropriations.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $450,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law 
Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account.    
 
The funds will be used to cover unanticipated increases in costs relating to legal matters handled by 
outside counsel legal services, stenographers and court reporters, constable services, consultants 
and experts, as well as filing fees and related costs in matters pending in courts and/or 
administrative bodies. These were necessary expenses used to manage litigation and other important 
legal matters essential to the City of Cambridge.   Funds are anticipated to cover expenses through the end 
of the current fiscal year. 
 

 

 

Very truly yours,

WHEREAS: 

Beginning in 2019, the City of Cambridge began internal deliberations on how to 
properly commemorate the August 2020 centennial anniversary of the passage of the 
19th Amendment, which enshrined the right of women to vote in this country’s 
elections; and   
 
Even before the Covid-19 pandemic dictated that the City’s efforts would largely focus 
upon the establishment of a public arts display as a centerpiece of this commemoration, 
this was an idea that was rapidly gaining currency by the Fall of 2019; and   
 

 
WHEREAS:  While a process was initiated to find a suitable artist to bring forth ideas on what this 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

public arts display might ultimately look like, it has concurrently been recognized that 
an additional public arts display underscoring the fact that for women of color, the 
rights enshrined in the 19th Amendment, which are rightfully being recognized for their 
centennial anniversary this year, for the most part in much of the country excluded 
women of color (among many other groups of women), who were forced to wait an 
additional 45 years for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to ensure that they, too, had a 
full voice in their democracy; and   
 
In establishing a separate public arts display to draw attention to the fact that women 
and men of color were largely denied the right to vote until 1965 in much of the 
country, the City of Cambridge will once again show how communities can celebrate 
our history, in all its complexity, as both a way of better understanding our past and of 
engaging us all to think more critically about how we can work to build a better, more 
inclusive future; now therefore be it   
 
That the City Council formally go on record in asking the City Manager to work with 
the appropriate City Staff in formulating an RFP for a public arts project that will 
acknowledge the unfinished work of the 19th Amendment, the importance of the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, and how the two pieces of legislation ultimately 
complemented one another in helping to shape a more perfect union, and that the City 
Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on this matter in 
a timely manner.

The City of Cambridge has many community and neighborhood organizations formed

These groups provide effective ways for residents to have a voice in the shaping of

practice many city boards and agencies seek their input for planning purposes, since 
they seek to represent the neighborhood, and

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS  
  

Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives in General Court 

assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:  

 
SECTION 1.  
  

Beginning in the year 2019, notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, 

the City of Cambridge may offer early voting for municipal elections.

chapter 51 of the General Laws, to cast a ballot for any biennial municipal election during the 

early voting period.

this act not inconsistent with section 25B of chapter 54 of the General Laws and with other 

election laws applicable in the City of Cambridge, including those governing proportional 

representation voting.  Such regulations may include, but are not limited to, a process for 

establishing early voting locations, dates, staffing, and a process for applying for, receiving, 

separating, compiling, recording, and securing early voter ballots. Each early voting site shall be 

accessible to persons with disabilities.  

 

 SECTION 2.   EFFECTIVE DATE  
  

the City Council of said City, but not otherwise. 

This act shall take full effect upon its acceptance and appropriation by majority vote of

The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge has a long history in recognizing the variety of 
relationships that exist outside the system of marriage, and enacted its Domestic 
Partnerships Ordinance to the City Code in 1992; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance (“Ordinance”) defines 
“domestic partnership” as an entity that is formed by two persons who support a 
number of criteria, namely that they are (1) in a relationship of mutual support, 
caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship, (2) they 
reside together; (3) they are not married, (4) they are not related by blood closer 
than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, (5) they are 
each other’s sole domestic partner (6) they are competent to contract, and (7) 
they consider themselves to be family; and 
 
Chapter 2.119 of the Ordinance defines family relationships to include (1) the 
manner in which the people live their daily lives, (2) how they hold their 
relationship out to the world, (3) their emotional and financial commitment, (4) 
their reliance on each other for daily family, (5) the longevity and exclusivity of 
their relationship, and (6) any other factors that may be relevant; and 
 
This Ordinance was enacted to allow individuals in domestic partnerships to 
access the same legal benefits as married couples under the law; and 
 
This Ordinance is limited in its scope of domestic partnerships, however, 
namely that is provides that only two people in a partnership may access the 
benefits listed in the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance; and 
 
There is a growing number of adults in relationships that include two or more 
people in a given relationship; and 
 
The City of Somerville signed its Domestic Partnerships Ordinance into law on 
June 29, 2020, which defines domestic partnership as an “entity of people” and 
gives equal access to the same legal benefits as married couples; and 
 
In order to recognize these relationships and grant equal access to legal 
benefits, we must change the language of the Ordinances of the City of 
Cambridge to include “two or more people”; now therefore be it

2.6

For any significant tree removal not subject to Section 8.66.050, a permit will be 
required from the City Arborist. In all cases, the City Arborist shall keep a record of 
the type and size of tree removed, the reason for the removal, photographs of the tree 
documenting the reason for removal, the date, the contractor(s) involved, and the name 
and address of the property owner. No such permits will be issued until February 28, 
2021 December 31, 2020 or sooner by further amendment to this section, except for 
emergency circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects undertaken 
pursuant to State or Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, or where a 
tree poses significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or for dead or 
dangerous trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the removal of 
certain significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree canopy. Any 
tree removed in violation of this section, prior to February 28, 2021 December 31, 
2020, shall require a payment into the tree replacement fund as per Section 8.66.070 
according to a schedule as follows: Ten percent (10%) of the replacement value for 
property owners who qualify for the City of Cambridge residential real property tax 
exemption, no fee for property owners that receive established forms of financial 
assistance, and the full replacement cost in all other circumstances. The value to be 
paid into the tree replacement fund shall be equivalent to the cost of purchasing, 
planting, watering and maintaining said Replacement Trees for a period of not less 
than five years. 

ORDERED 

That the city manager communicate this extension to the residents and property owners 
of the City of Cambridge as done previously.

Re: Policy Order 4 Regarding Neighborhood Organizations 
 
Dear Councilors: 
 
I write to express my concern about this policy order, on the Council Agenda for 
November 23, and respectfully request that both the spirit and the letter of the order be 
reconsidered.  
 
It is my understanding the policy order addresses an incident in which a member of the 

East Cambridge Planning Team board made comments that were offensive to a community 
member based on their identity.  I understand that the Council wants to encourage a respectful 
and inclusive culture across all organizations, both governmental and civic.  But I also feel that 
civic groups should have sovereignty over how they decide to function internally and deal with 
conflict and inappropriate behavior.   While I admire and applaud the Council’s good intentions, I 
feel that respecting the autonomy of civic groups to operate without government oversight 
should take precedence in this case.   

 
While the ECPT incident is regrettable, the offending board member both apologized 

and resigned, and thus was held accountable.  We shouldn’t judge either individuals or 
community groups based on one negative incident, particularly when they make a concerted 
effort to learn from the mistake, hold the offending party accountable, and move forward to 
become a better, more inclusive group in the future.  Based on my interactions with ECPT board 
members – both as a former East Cambridge resident and as current member of the Linden 
Park Neighborhood Association board – I am convinced that ECPT is committed to fostering an 
inclusive and respectful environment, and that the referenced incident was an anomaly.  The 
preponderance of ECPT members fully embrace the Council’s vision of an inclusionary city in 
which civic groups respect the diversity of community members and in which board members 
refrain from making exclusionary or degrading comments.    

 
Finally, I would argue that the Council should be deferential, to the utmost extent 
possible, to the autonomy of self-governing civic groups such as the ECPT.  If anything, groups 
such as the ECPT should be holding the city government accountable for standards of conduct, 
rather than vice versa.   

 
For the reasons outlined above, I would discourage the Council from monitoring or 

otherwise seeking to influence the way in which neighborhood groups operate.  Thank you for 
considering this feedback and for your continued dedication to improving our city.    
 

Sincerely, 

3.1.b

High risk settings for SARS-CoV-2 transmission

Unfortunately a prior commitment kept me from being able to attend the entirety of the special 
council meeting yesterday. I have been given to understand however that some discussion took 
place after I left, to the effect that scientists ‘do not know’ where transmission occurs in this 
infection. I want to state that this is not the view of infectious disease professionals, CDC or WHO 
among many others. You can find current consensus in this letter, authored by myself alongside 
many others and which has attracted the support of multiple national and international bodies 
such as the Federation of American Scientists and European Medical Association 
(https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)32153-X/fulltext and 
https://www.johnsnowmemo.com/endorsements.html).

While uncertainty exists over the exact amounts of transmission that occur via the droplet, 
aerosol and fomite routes, and the challenging nature of contact tracing limits our ability to 
accurately delineate clusters where they occur, we have a lot of valuable data that we can use to 
slow the spread of the virus – which should be all the more our goal as the promise of vaccines 
becomes closer to real.

For a virus such as this, scientists do not examine specific settings in order to identify one of them 
as responsible for the majority of transmission events. Instead we ask what those settings with an 
elevated risk have in common.

We know that Closed spaces with poor ventilation, close Contact and Crowds are all associated 
with both transmission and the presence of transmission clusters in which many individuals 
become infected. Any setting that permits those conditions, whether it is a meat packing plant, a 
crowded factory, a packed bar, gym or place of worship will be risky for transmission. A 
recent locally relevant example is clusters associated with Ice Hockey leagues, where distancing is 
hard, and large groups are in close contact indoors for a period of time more than enough to 
facilitate transmission. You should base your thinking on those simple facts, educating the public 
about the risks, and directing interventions at reducing exposures under those conditions. 
Remember that there is no silver bullet and interventions are more effective in combination.

We know that essential workers are more likely to become infected, and that infection in this 
group is facilitated by inadequate PPE. We even know that complaints to Occupational Safety and

Health Administration (which handles workplace safety) at both state and federal levels forecast 
deaths 16 days later (Hanage et al 2020, EJ Epid).

In the absence of a vaccine, important ways to control transmission while cases remain low are 
through so called cluster busting (backward tracing to detect clusters of transmission) and ‘non 
pharmaceutical interventions’ directed at denying the virus the opportunities it needs to find new 
hosts – in other words ‘physical distancing’. While cases are rare, milder interventions are 
possible, and have benefit. But in a situation where cases are increasing, and the risks to 
healthcare along with them, any suggestion that we do not know enough about where 
transmission occurs to take action is misleading, false and dangerous.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Ventilation as a means to keep restaurants and gyms safe

Dear Mayor Siddiqui and Cambridge City Council Members,

Thanks for having me at the city council meeting on COVID-19 yesterday. Here is a Wall Street Journal video that was 
just released explaining some of the ventilation strategies I discussed yesterday for reducing risk in restaurants and 
gyms.

This video features Joesph Allen and Linsey Marr, two of the US-wide experts on ventilation as a way to reduce 
infectious disease risk.

Dear Director Barr,
 
I submitted a Public Records Request for any City's own, independent, pre-COVID19 traffic study for the Mass Ave and Walden Street (St) intersection.  Public
Records Access Officer Seah Levy sent me the CC HRE commissioned Vanasse & Associates' Parking and Traffic Assessment - Proposed Residential
Development 2072 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts memo stating that "was the only responsive record we have, there is no study by the
City."   I find it hard to believe the City had never conducted a traffic study at this very busy intersection.
 
We in the community can only offer our observations of traffic and parking conditions which Mr. Korb of Capstone Communities characterized as "anecdotal and
perceptual and do not provide data pre-Covid".  We desperately need guidance from the Traffic, Parking and Transportation (TP&T) Department to all
developers in Cambridge and require them to adjust COVID-19 traffic and parking data to normal, pre-COVID-19 data.  If developers are allowed to build new
projects under the current, lighter traffic and parking conditions, we will have nightmarish problems when "normal" conditions return.
 
Your response “as a residential project with limited parking that is located within a five minute walk of the Porter Square MBTA Station, I wouldn’t expect this
proposed development to have a significant impact on traffic volumes."   This ignores many key factors.
 
It ignores the pre-COVID19 traffic gridlocks caused by residents and other commuters, including those on Walden St and nearby side streets, trying to merge with
southbound traffic on Mass Ave from Alewife Parkway heading into Harvard Square and beyond in the morning and vice versa in the evening.  Even now during
this pandemic when traffic is much lighter due to people working from home, I witnessed eastbound traffic backed up on Walden St at 3 PM last Fri.  I managed to
pull into the city parking lot to take some photos which I am attaching here.  While taking these photos, I noticed the traffic sometimes backed up well beyond
Sycamore St.  A westbound vehicle trying to enter this development shortly after turning into Walden St from Mass Ave (less than 150 ft) will most likely get stuck in
traffic waiting for a break in the eastbound lanes quickly causing a gridlock.  And any vehicle trying to leave this development will be stuck trying to cut into the
backed up eastbound traffic.
 
Your statement ignores the safety of pedestrians and cyclists from this development.  The proposed plan calls for 51 total long-term bike parking spaces.  The
safety of all these bicyclists must be considered as Walden St is too narrow (even with the proposed widening of the street to three 10’ wide driving lanes) for
bicycle lanes.  Furthermore, this project is supposed to be family oriented with 71% of the units being 2 and 3 bedrooms.  Even with just one child per such unit,
there would be at least 35 children living in this proposed development who will be going to/from nearby schools during busy morning commuting hours.  The
additional school buses to accommodate these children population at 2072 Mass Ave will exacerbate the traffic congestion.
 
Your statement ignores the fact that the City or developers can’t mandate car ownership.  Boston Globe reported on February 18, 2019
(https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/18/cambridge-wanted-big-drop-car-ownership-that-hasn-exactly-happened/sBu3TbWIBQLi5Nlo00L6AM/story.

(w)ith six subway stations, multiple bus lines and bike lanes, and compact neighborhoods everywhere, Cambridge offers plenty of ways to get around without a
car... The city appears all but certain to fall short of its 2020 goal of reducing the ratio of cars owned by Cambridge residents by 15 percent from 1990 levels. The
target, set in 2014, was to lower ownership to about 0.8 cars per household, but with about a year left on the clock, Cambridge is less than halfway there."  Unless

Gmail - Parking and Traffic Assessment for proposed 2072 Mass Ave project

3.4.a

there was a sudden, dramatic decline in car ownership since the article was published, the traffic congestion along Mass Ave during the rush hour is real and will
not improve unless the City institutes mitigating measures and requires developers to submit Transportation Impact Study (TIS) for any development along major
traffic corridors.  You stated that Chapter 40B Comprehensive Permit project does not require a TIS and TP&T does not have the authority to compel the developer
to prepare one.  But then who has such an authority? 
 
Time is of utmost essence as the developer has already filed Chapter 40B Comprehensive Permit and the Planning Board and Board of Zoning Appeal hearings
have been scheduled for early December.  I beg you to exercise your leadership to ensure that traffic and parking studies reflect the true conditions at this very
dangerous intersection and that the building is designed with safety of the residents, bicyclists, commuters and neighbors.   And please take the golden opportunity
of 78 Porter Road being currently undergoing renovation and empty to conduct a comprehensive, around the clock parking study during different days of the week
for Porter Road/Regent St loop.  Then repeat the study once the renovation is completed and the building is fully occupied to measure the true impact of 100%
affordable housing with no parking spaces.  Matter of fact, this would establish a parking requirement baseline for any large new development near public transit.     

On Wed, Oct 28, 2020 at 5:21 PM Barr, Joseph <jbarr@cambridgema.gov> wrote: 

I’m not aware of any counts specifically at the Walden Street/Massachusetts Avenue intersection, but any existing traffic counts would be available through the
City’s open data portal: https://www.cambridgema.gov/departments/opendata. In terms of suggesting a methodology for extrapolating current volumes to
represent “normal” conditions, I am not aware of any specific factor that can be used, particularly since time of day and day of week patterns are very different
from typical.

Regarding any requirement for a TIS, because this project is applying for a Chapter 40B Comprehensive Permit, it does not require a TIS and TP+T does not
have the authority to compel the developer to prepare one. However, as a residential project with limited parking that is located within a five minute walk of the
Porter Square MBTA Station, I wouldn’t expect this proposed development to have a significant impact on traffic volumes.

Subject: Re: Parking and Traffic Assessment for proposed 2072 Mass Ave project

Dear Director Barr,

I posted the pertinent sections of the email (see below) I sent to you and the City Council regarding the parking and traffic assessment for the proposed 2072
Mass Ave project on its website.  Mr. Korb responded to my observations of pre-COVID 19 traffic conditions along Mass Ave stating "your comments are
anecdotal and perceptual and do not provide data pre-Covid, if you have actual data to present regarding pre-COVID traffic and parking
counts please provide those."

When a developer presents plans for a new project to the community as part of a community outreach, the residents can only offer
comments based on their observations as I did; they do not have the wherewithal to provide data to back up their observations.

I don't think I am not the only one who has noticed marked reduction in traffic since COVID-19 began.  I beg you to require all
developers of new projects, including 2072 Mass Ave project, to factor in the effect of COVID-19 in their parking and traffic
assessments. 

For 2072 Mass Ave project, I would like to ask the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department (TP&T) to provide any available pre-
COVID 19 traffic data at Mass Ave/Walden Street intersection to Capstone Communities LLC (CC) so that they can assess the impact of
their project at this very busy intersection under "normal" conditions.  If no recent data is available, could TP&T provide CC with some
guidelines on how to extrapolate current COVID-19 conditions to "normal" conditions?

As I mentioned in my email below, the parking and traffic assessment didn’t go far enough.  I strongly believe, as do other people I
talked to, that because of the location of the project, a full Transportation Impact Study (TIS), certified by the City, is required.  The TIS
should include assessment of the current road configuration (westbound Walden Street being one lane all the way past Sherman Street
and eastbound Walden Street in front of the property being 2 turning lanes).  Parking is also a very complicated situation due to
competition with retail customers looking for parking spaces.  Of course, after 8 PM all the meter parking spaces will free up but that
will not be much of a help for commuters coming home in the evening.  Through you, I would like to request that TP&T require CC to
include TIS in their Comprehensive Permit application to the Board of Zoning Appeal.

Dear Honorable Mayor, Councillors, and Director Barr,

I would like to thank Mr. Korb for the independent parking and traffic assessment conducted by Vanasse & Associates (V&A) for the proposed 2072 Mass Ave
(2072) 100% affordable housing project (AH project) at the southwest corner of Mass Ave and Walden street (intersection).  This is an impressive, well
conducted study that was made public in perfect timing to my request for a comprehensive parking study around 78 Porter Road Apartments (appended
below), also an AH project. 

I am sure V&A followed the City’s guidelines for such a study, but it has several flaws and it didn’t go far enough.  I am not a parking or traffic expert by any
means but offering my comments as a retired system engineer and a long-time resident of North Cambridge.  

The most glaring flaw is that the effects of COVID-19 on parking and traffic were not factored in.  I live on Norris Street and the normal, pre-COVID-19,
morning rush hour traffic heading into Porter Square and beyond regularly backed up to Norris Street making it very difficult to exit the street to get onto Mass
Ave in either direction.  The reverse was true in the evening on the northbound side heading towards Alewife Brook Parkway compounded by two traffic lights
separated only by a block at Cameron Ave and Cedar Street intersections.  And there were hardly any parking spaces available on Norris Street after 6 PM. 
But since COVID-19 shut-down began, there have been plenty of parking spaces available and I hardly have to wait to make the turn onto Mass Ave, just
enough time to come to full stop and observe the oncoming traffic.

The second flaw is that the study was not done from the point of view of residents in the neighborhood nor did it consider the effect of the business
establishments of the neighborhood.  It is impressive that V&A surveyed parking availability within a quarter-mile, 1320 feet, radius.  That is almost 4 football-
field lengths, including the end zones!  Can you imagine yourself circling around to find a parking space and then trudging home in a pouring rain or blinding
snowstorm that far?  Mr. Korb stated that the proposed 2014 AH Project was planned with family in mind.  Can you imagine dragging your child even half that
distance with groceries?  When you purchased your house, I am sure your expectation was to be able to park on your block if you didn’t have a driveway.

The meter and unrestricted parking spaces around the project will be taken up by the customers of the existing businesses as well as the proposed 1040
square feet on-site ground floor retail during the business hours.  The stay-at-home parents or caregivers of children/elderly, let alone the customers of the
proposed retail space, will have a hard time finding parking spaces during these hours.

Another example of this flaw is that the study was conducted for just one weekday, namely Tues, ignoring the bustling social activities around that
neighborhood on weekends starting from Fri evening.

Gmail - Parking and Traffic Assessment for proposed 2072 Mass Ave project

3.4.a

The traffic study didn’t go far enough in only considering the estimated trip generated by the project.  The study should have considered the road configuration
at that intersection and the impact of the project on the traffic flow.  Walden Street at the intersection is a 3-lane road; one westbound lane and two eastbound
lanes with one for right turn only and the other left turn only.  The solid lane marking separating the turning lanes starts well west of the property; and the two
turn arrows start just about even with the curb cut into the current Darul Kabab.  It is not hard to imagine the gridlock a delivery truck would cause when it
attempts to turn into the property after turning into Walden Street during the rush hour from Mass Ave.  It will immediately get stuck trying to cut across two
lanes of eastbound traffic waiting to turn left or right onto Mass Ave.

The study should also have counted the current traffic volume at the intersection and counted the number and duration of cars waiting to make turns either
onto Mass Ave from Walden Street or vice versa during the peak commuting hours.  This could have been done easily by using strategically placed traffic
counters.  These counts should then have been extrapolated into normal, pre-COVID estimates to be used in assessing the impact of the new vehicle traffic. 
Furthermore, the study should have addressed the issue of bicycle traffic and pedestrian foot traffic at this very busy intersection for people trying to get to
Porter Square T station or to their destinations.  Finally, the study should have assessed the social issue I mentioned above.  When we return to “normal” after
COVID-19, I envision a vibrant neighborhood with area restaurants and other businesses running at full capacity creating a heavy congestion at this
intersection during peak social gathering times.

I beg you to consider my noted flaws and shortcomings of the parking and traffic assessment for the proposed 2072 AH project and address them in the
parking study around Porter Road/ /Regent Street loop I have requested.  Going one step further, I beg you to update the parking and traffic assessment
guidelines for future developments to include but not limited to:

1)      Conduct community outreach meeting with neighborhood residents to assess their current concerns with parking and traffic in their
neighborhood

2)      Employ traffic counters to analyze current traffic volume and rate

3)      Factor in road configuration and commercial establishments in the neighborhood

4)      Reduce the parking survey to an eighth-mile (660 feet) radius

5)      Conduct the parking survey for at least two days, one weekday and one weekend (starting from Fri evening)

6)      Include any special situation in that neighborhood (playground, church, school for example) and its mitigation plan in the transportation demand
management plan

I am more than willing to discuss this further with you and volunteer to work with you in any way I can.

Thank you for your consideration.  

Respectfully yours,

Young Kim

3.4.a

Attached please find the independent parking analysis for 2072 Mass Ave. At the peak demand time (8pm) on Tuesday, September 22, 2020, there were
318 available spaces out of a total of 1,145 on-street spaces within ¼ of the site. The traffic engineer projects our proposal will generate 25 additional on-
street vehicles and has concluded “there is more than adequate on-street parking to accommodate the Project.”

Subject: 100% Affordable Housing and Parking

Dear Honorable Mayor, Councillors, and Director Barr,

I trust you and all your loved ones are safe and healthy during this unprecedented pandemic.  I want to thank you for your leadership in keeping all the
Cantabrigians safe during these trying times.

Now that the 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Amendment (the Amendment) has been adopted, I would like to bring to your attention a golden opportunity
to prove (or disprove as case may be) couple of the arguments the proponents of the Amendment used in justifying no/limited parking spaces at these
100% affordable housing developments (developments): 

1) tenants of these developments will be relying on public transit as they will be near public transit hubs such as Porter Square

2) City's stated goal is to reduce car ownership (target set in 2014 was about 0.8 cars per household by end of this year, a reduction of the ratio of cars
owned by 15 percent from 1990 levels (https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/02/18/cambridge-wanted-big-drop-car-ownership-that-hasn-exactly-
happened/sBu3TbWIBQLi5Nlo00L6AM/story.html))

These arguments have also been used for large development projects in requesting special permits to waive the parking requirements.

It came to my attention that 78 Porter Road, which to my best knowledge is a 100% affordable development, is currently undergoing renovation and is
empty.  I am writing to urge you to conduct a comprehensive, around the clock parking study during different days of a week for Porter Road/Regent Street
loop while 78 Porter Road is empty and repeat the study once the renovation is completed and the building is fully occupied to measure the true impact of
100% affordable housing with no parking spaces.  Matter of fact, this would establish a parking requirement baseline for any large new development near
public transit.  Opportunities like this will be very hard to come by and I beg the City and Capstone/Hope to take advantage to prove that indeed one parking
space/dwelling unit is no longer necessary.

Opposing 2072 Mass Ave Project
Affordable Housing Comparison Submit.xlsx; Parking and Traffic Assessment email w 
City.pdf

Dear Chairwoman Connolly and Members of Planning Board,

I am writing to beg you to reject the Comprehensive Permit application for the proposed 2072 Mass Ave 100% 
affordable housing (AH) project (Development) which is too dense in that neighborhood occupying the entire 
lot at a busy intersection of Mass Ave and Walden Street (intersection) with no setbacks or ground 
greenspace.

As much as I appreciate the need for AH in Cambridge, there are already (or soon to be) four 100% AH 
projects within a half mile of Porter Square on or near Mass Ave (analysis attached) with 133 units with 
average floor area ratio (FAR) of 2.1.
49 units, a unit growth of 36.8%, with FAR of 6.7, 315% of the average FAR. This is a far cry from a 
reasonable growth by any measure.

In comparison, the Development will be 9 stories facing Mass Ave with 

Before the COVID-19 pandemic the intersection was notorious for gridlock during rush hours. Yet, the 
developer is depending on Vanasse & Associates' Parking and Traffic Assessment conducted during COVID-
19 lull in traffic and parking demands. The developer has dismissed neighbors’ observations as "anecdotal 
and perceptual and do not provide data pre-Covid". The residents around this intersection have a 
daunting task of competing with customers of nearby retail businesses for parking and traffic.
pdf copy of my communications with the City officials including Director Barr (with recent photos of traffic 
backed up on Walden Street) on this issue as well as a plea to conduct a thorough parking study at 78 Porter 
Road which is undergoing renovation to study the parking impact of AH in a residential neighborhood.

I am attaching a 

Using every available square foot of the lot with no ground level greenspace for this 
Development is a far cry from their more reasonable Frost Terrace and is out of character of 
the surrounding residential area. CC HRE did a beautiful job of restoring the houses that were 
on their three property lots blending in a 5-story building that complements Lesley’s Lunder 
Arts Center. At that location, the developer had 2.5 times the lot area (22000 sq. ft.) to add 
comparable 40 units of AH units.

To achieve a similar number of units, the developer had nowhere to go but up and hence the 9-
story building facing Mass Ave although I must complement the developer for reducing the 
height to 6 stories facing the Walden neighborhood. Children coming home from school to 
Frost Terrace would feel a lot more like coming to their own houses than to this high-rise tower 
at a busy intersection.

A 6 story (to be in line with Russell Apt)/4 story building with ground level greenspace would be 
more in line with the character of the neighborhood.  

Thank you for your consideration,

Respectfully yours,

How has it Come to be? .... on the Nov. 23'd P.O.4 (charter-righted) attacking 
neighborhood groups

Dear Cambridge City Councillors, 

How has it come to be that Council now wants to malign an entire neighborhood group because of one member’s 
irresponsible pushback against:

•
•

•

•

•

•
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

An individual who repeatedly has attacked members of ECPT (and other) voluntary neighborhood associations
An individual who has publicly attacked citizens who undertook their legal right to create a ten person petition 
seeking a conservation district
An individual who has published meeting information and publicly invited his supporters in Cambridge and 
elsewhere to participate in the extreme disruption of them
An individual who achieved the desired result of terminating a public meeting run by city staff shortly after it 
commenced.
An individual who distributed pamphlets at this meeting and wrote blogs and articles promoting demonstrably 
false information for purposes of conveying inaccurate information
An individual who, with his friends, publicly attacked paid city staff who were doing their jobs
An individual whose disruptions have been called out publicly by a city commission and staff for what they were, 
and have vowed this will not be allowed to happen again
An individual who attacked publicly on social media those who spoke at public meetings with a different point of 
view
An individual who illegally trespassed on State property, risking the health of many neighbors in order to make a 
political point

And, how has it come to pass that City Council is here:

Taking sides with another individual voted off the voluntary group Board in question democratically after one 
term, an individual now maligning this same Board
Taking sides against a voluntary group supporting more affordable housing in decisions such as the highly 
fraught Sullivan Court house case by taking sides with their detractors.
Taking sides against a voluntary group to support individuals closely linked a well-known attorney for developers 
who has been encouraging opposition to this voluntary neighborhood group and to this effort
Taking sides to support allies of a pro-development Political Pac (ABC) with which a majority of the Council is 
now affiliated and in this case against the independent interests of  voluntary neighborhood groups and 
residents who work with them.

I look forward to a Council Policy Order in the near future that will:

Seek to admonish individuals and groups who foment disruption, disrespect, and uncivil behavior toward other 
city residents and city staff
Seek to lessen the tension and uncivil behavior by providing better models of governance and relationships by 
all elected officials, city staff, and members of official city commissions and committees

November 30, 2020 
Cambridge City Council, Clerk-Cambridge City Council 
 
Apparently, some of our City Councilors want to appoint themselves the Cambridge Thought 
Police to teach us ordinary citizens how to organize our various neighborhoods.  Since the 
proponents of Proposal Order 4 believe in the dignity of all people and their right to respect 
and equality of opportunity and participation in civic life free of abuse, they also propose that 
the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee of the City Council discuss ways to 
strengthen community bonds and ensure equitable access to neighborhood organizations. 
 
What I find ironic is that a few of the City Council proponents of this proposal have themselves 
been participants in this type of behavior during discussions regarding the Affordable Housing 
Overlay.  I recall the cries and accusations of racism from the Council proponents of the AHO 
directed at the Council opponents of the AHO.  Perhaps, having gone through an experience of 
name calling and judgmental thinking, now the proponents of PO4 feel they are experts in 
abusive behavior.   
 
Also, the proponents of Proposal Order 4 want to discover how the City of Cambridge can 
establish or partake in our own private citizen organizations to support neighborhood 
organizations and other community groups to create rules and regulations that ensure greater 
diversity and representation on boards and in membership of these groups and formal codes of 
conduct to ensure that these groups create safe and supportive environments for all 
participants. 
 
I find it ironic that the formal codes of conduct that are already in place for Council meetings, 
but, as shown in the video of some of the Council meetings on the AHO, are not followed by 
Councilors.  Yet these same Councilors feel qualified to enforce codes of conduct on the public? 
 
I feel that PO4 is a ridiculous, frivolous and highly inappropriate policy order.  It assumes that as 
private citizens of Cambridge we don’t know enough to establish nor appropriately conduct 
ourselves in our own civic organizations.  This policy order is being proposed by those who 
supported the AHO.  During the discussions and Council meetings on that topic, as well as the 
Zoom meetings that replaced the live meetings, we who opposed the AHO were castigated not 
only by the ABC organization and its supporters, but also by the City Councilors who supported 
the AHO.  We were vilified as NIMBYS, racists and elitists who were opposed to any and all 
affordable housing, which was a lie.  I find that the total arrogance of Councilors who propose 
to regulate us are themselves the ones in dire need of being regulated.   I am convinced that 
the only qualities of civic participation we will learn from these same counselors who would 
critique us are deceit, deception, deviousness and dishonesty.

November 30, 2020 + Cambridge City Council + AGAINST Charter right PO #3- 
 
Dear Council, 
 
I am grateful to Councilor Nolan for charter-righting PO #4 which is now PO# 3. I also understand that 
this policy order has been reconfigured into two parts. It would be nice if the public could see the 
current version of this re-write. As it stands, I REMAIN AGAINST THIS POLICY challenging the autonomy 
of neighborhood groups while using the very real individual civil rights issue as a gateway to a bigger 
agenda. This is no longer about anti-defamation in an isolated case. It is intertwined with civil rights of 
non-profit gathering of citizens who care about city government and neighborhood issues.  
 
Protecting individual rights has been inflated to get to the bigger goal of unregulated development by 
disassembling neighborhood groups and conservation and historical districts.  One only has to look at 
certain twitter feeds to see on the same thread mis-information about “BANNED RENTALS IN 
CAMBRIDGE”, and the complainant’s displeasure at a different neighborhood association signing a 
general letter of support “without reaching out to him to verify claims”—enmeshing the two issues.  I 
find the sponsoring councilors either naïve or complicate in this line of attack. This gives an aggressive 
voice (s) immense power by badgering Council who should represent ALL Cantabridgians with an even 
hand.  And there continues to be inequity in this Policy order.  
 
Any individual with a moral compass would abhor prejudiced, disrespectful, intimidating behavior of 
ANY citizen in the city, and groups should monitor their own behavior as ECPT did. This Policy order is 
now on a very slippery slope. It asks Council not to empower groups or individuals who bully, harass, or 
abuse other residents based on color, AGE, race, religion, sex. And yet it is OK for development 
proponents to label a faction of the population as old, white, rich, prejudiced, bigoted, property owners 
(as if that is a swear word) repeatedly without council intervention.   
 
I also find this Policy Order heavy-handed and premature.  If the sponsoring councilors were really 
thoughtful, there would have been a “listening” meeting of neighborhood associations, which they have 
no jurisdiction over, BEFORE A CITY-WIDE POLICY ORDER. It asks for formal codes of conduct, policies 
and practices which many organizations already have included in their charters. This Policy Order was 
based on one-sided constituent complaints of a certain voting bloc and lacks objective investigation.  I 
also find these sponsoring councilors part of the problem when they ignore formal protocol, ethical 
behavior, make sarcastic comments in personal emails to residents, and contribute to the inflammatory 
language in social media threads.  These issues didn’t have to get so blown out of proportion and could 
have been handled “equitably” and honorably with thoughtful leadership.  This Policy Order un-
constitutionally interjects itself into citizens’ organizations with a perceived hidden agenda.  The city 
could still sponsor an inclusive summit without this policy order and still garner good intentions on both 
sides. What happens if some people decide not to participate? Will lack of “diversity” be questioned as 
intentional?

Hello Board of Zoning Appeals,

Gabriela Cipriano <gabi.cipriano@yahoo.com>
Monday, November 30, 2020 8:38 PM
Pacheco, Maria; Clerk
BZA-017326-2020

My name is Gabi Cipriano and I live at 79 Allston St in Cambridge. I am asking you to support the development of 
affordable housing units at 2072 Massachusetts Ave, case number BZA-017326-2020.

I support this development in Cambridge because it will make Cambridge a more equitable city to live in and is one small 
step in the right direction to relieving our current housing shortage. The development can benefit others in a mix of ways; 
it can ease the burden of rent on current residents who are currently paying the market rate or allow new people to move 
to Cambridge who could not otherwise have afforded it. I think it would be a shame to deny people these benefits over the 
concern of parking - a reason which is likely overstated given that the apartment is within blocks of transit so it is unlikely 
that every new resident comes with their own car.

Regardless of how many cars are added to the nearby streets from this development, our first priority should be to allow 
more people to live, work, and thrive in our community since it can offer many benefits to an individual and, reciprocally, 
new residents would benefit our community in many ways including, but of course not limited to, increased foot traffic, 
participation in civic institutions, and spending at our local small businesses.

Thank you,

Gabi

Withdraw it, and if you do not like what a group of residents, keep ignoring them just as you have been since I 
lived here, unless it fits your agenda.
These policy orders are bringing bickering into the council chamber and public discourse.

we do have more pressing matter to discuss, such as:

A Neighborhood Organization for the Betterment of East Cambridge 

 

November 30, 2020 

Cambridge City Council 
Cambridge City Hall 
795 Massachusetts Avenue, 2nd Floor 
Cambridge, MA 02139 
 
      RE: Charter Right #3 – Neighborhood Groups 
 
Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillors Carlone, McGovern, Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-
Wheeler, Toomey, and Zondervan: 
 
This letter is to clarify the East Cambridge Planning Team’s operating procedures, outreach, and position on 
undue Council influence.  
 
Everyone who lives in East Cambridge can become a member of ECPT by coming to a meeting and signing 
in with their name and address. Anyone from anywhere can attend a meeting; it’s not restricted to East 
Cambridge. Voting privileges are acquired by an East Cambridge resident after attending two consecutive 
meetings. When one arrives at the meeting, they write down their name and address, that’s it. We do not 
have a database with everybody’s name. We do not ask members their race, religion, national origin, sexual 
orientation, familial status, whether they own property, etc. We feel questions like those are inappropriate, 
potentially discriminatory, and an invasion of privacy. 
 
Many of our members do not have high speed internet or computers capable of handling Zoom sessions. For 
those we simulcast the ECPT Zoom Meeting on CCTV Channel 9 and have them e-mail or phone in 
questions. Every meeting on Zoom was simulcast and audited by CCTV. For example, Rich McKinnon, an 
East Cambridge resident, used to watch ECPT on Channel 9 rather than Zoom-in. Many people write in and 
we read those letters when time permits.  
 
We record, but do not publish, the meetings. People from a certain group took video clips from the 
Cambridge Historical Commission East Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District study group meeting 
and used them to mock some of the study group members, including the way one spoke, and posted them 
on Twitter to invite ridicule of them by the group’s followers. The tweet was quickly deleted, but not before 
accomplishing its purpose. We do not want to subject our members to such cruelty. 
 
Some sample outreach: 

  Pre-COVID, we held neighborhood events to solicit new members. Two recent events were a free 
holiday party and a summer party. The holiday party featured a live 4-piece band and singer, food, 
beer and wine, door prizes, and a photographer. The free summer party included a free duck tour 
ride on the river. Party goers were picked up at the East End House, taken for a ride on the Charles 
River and dropped off at the party at NorthPoint, where there was free food, beer and wine, music, 
and door prizes. 

  We advertise elections in the Cambridge Chronicle, O’Connell Library, local churches, Councilor 

Toomey’s office window, and other locations.  

  We have delivered thousands of postcards at our own expense and with volunteer shoe leather over 

the past few years on various issues. ECPT is regularly mentioned in the Chronicle and Cambridge 
Day.

3.10.a

 

 
 
One problem we have is that East Cambridge has fewer long-term residents than it used to, even fifteen or 
twenty years ago. More and more often, people stay for one to three years and leave.  I regularly field 
requests to delete people from the group as they move out of the city or, more frequently, the state. We see 
value in long-term residents whether they rent or own since they are more likely to care about the quality of 
life in the neighborhood and feel they have a stake in its future, but all are welcome.  In fact, this is one of the 
reasons we have continued to advocate for housing that is intended for longer-term residence. 
 
We follow our by-laws, which are based on Robert’s Rules of Order, in non-COVID times. If something isn’t 
covered in our by-laws, it defaults to Robert’s Rules. The president sets the agenda and runs the meeting. 
The president cannot make motions or vote. The membership makes motions, which are voted upon by the 
members present. Typically, motions are to have the president write a letter to a City department. The board 
only steps in when there is a time issue, and it typically runs the business of the organization, like budgets. 
At meetings, a member can only address the presenter or the president and request the floor. Only one 
person has the floor at a time. Behavior at Zoom meetings has been exemplary, but we have relaxed the by-
laws. Where a problem is local, greatly affecting direct abutters, we typically suspend the voting rules and 
allow direct abutters in attendance to vote, even if they have not established voting privileges.  
 
Our problems arise from an unmediated Google group, where anybody in the world is allowed to say what 
they want, within the law and Google’s terms of service. Sometimes social media brings out the worst in 
people. As we sometimes have a few hundred posts a day, moderation is difficult. We originally moderated 
the group, but various members of the Google group complained we were stifling the free flow of ideas and 
engaging in censorship. Anyone on the Google group is free to report a violation of terms of service to 
Google, where Google may take punitive actions.  
 
As a result of the Matthews-Crowe event, we are taking steps to prevent heated verbal altercations. We have 
purchased a replacement to the Google group software that will allow us to moderate the group efficiently. 
The current Google group is being used for announcements only. ECPT is working with its attorney to 
develop new rules and a system of set measures to deal with people who violate the rules of conduct. We 
are also working with our attorney to add an anti-discrimination section to our by-laws. 
 
The City Council does not have police powers to regulate non-profit 501(c)(4) organizations, and we are 
outraged and horrified at this cleverly orchestrated and blatant attempt to stifle free speech. This is an 
attempt to bully our members into silence in fear of the City. Our First Amendment rights of free speech and 
to peaceably assemble to petition the government for redress of grievances, among others, are being 
infringed upon in an un-American manner. Not one City Councillor contacted us to ask what happened; you 
just took the word of someone who has publicly wished us ill for almost two years. You have already 
defamed and injured us.  
 
We demand an apology from the City Council and the order’s sponsors for this unwarranted attack on ECPT 
and its members. 
 
Very truly yours, 
 
 
 
Charles T. Hinds 
President, ECPT

Charter Right 3:
There will be a separate email for this.

Unfinished Business 6:
This needs to be passed. We’re so close to the finish line where we’ll find comprehensive tree protection.

PO1:
Most certainly do this. One of the only reasons I felt safe going to my dentist over the Summer was because she had 
enough air filters to cycle all of the air multiple times per hour.

PO2:
Comcast is the worst company in the world. I swear their M.O. is Less for More. I know someone who’s considering 
leaving the city between the high rent, university power, and Comcast.

All other POs:
Look good to me

Committee Report 1:
I only gave a cursory overview of the attachment, but from what I can tell that neighborhood really needs this. Please 
move this forward.

Public Comment: Charles Franklin

I am a board member of the Inman Square Neighborhood Association, or ISNA for short. That being said, I’m speaking 
for myself tonight. My understanding is that Charter Right #3 will be amended tonight to no longer read like a general 
indictment of neighborhood associations and to now be better balanced between both recognizing the important work 
that neighborhood associations do while also acknowledging that we sometimes struggle with representation. I cannot 
understate how hard the ISNA board works to make our meetings welcoming and inclusive. We under no circumstances 
tolerate hostile, bigoted, or rude comments from any members. I have personally enforced this. We announce our 
meetings via email, social media, and occasionally postering around the neighborhood including in low-income buildings. 
I welcome any genuine offer to help us increase our attendance and representation. With the amendments, I can 
support the PO that offers this help.

Divided Again

Prolog:
It’s my understanding that there are amendment that will separate the community strengthening parts from the 
community shaming parts. These will be welcome as the PO as currently written addresses two related but different 
issues that should be handled separately. I will gladly support the “Ordered” section of the PO if and when these 
amendments are passed.

Main Body:
Once again our city has been divided over something that we should all agree upon. Our neighborhood organizations do 
need more diversity and to have better representation. However, last weeks PO has done damage and will now make 
this goal harder to achieve. ISNA last week received an email asking why we cosigned the joint letter from various 
neighborhood associations, accusing us of defending Chris Matthews of all people. Of course we’re not defending that 
or any other repugnant behavior. I thought we should cosign the letter for the reasons I pointed out in my last email, but 
I guess that message got lost too. Now it’s impossible to have a nuanced position on this issue cause apparently asking 
for a PO to be balanced is now equated with being unwelcoming. Something that should’ve been simple has now been 
politicized.

Is this really how we want to do things? Break people up and try and grab more than half of the pieces? Make everything 
about morality so that if someone disagrees with any part they get painted as being on the wrong side? Maybe I’m 
wrong. I hope I’m wrong. But from down here that’s what it looks like.

P.S. The ISNA board is half renters and has board members in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 70s, and 80s. You called out ECPT for 
being bad. Can you give us a shout out for being good?

RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that Comcast plans to impose a 
home internet data cap on customers across the United States, including in 
Cambridge; and 
 
Starting in March 2021, customers who exceed 1.2TB of data in any given 
month will be charged $10 per additional 50GB of data used, up to $100 per 
month in additional fees; and 
 
Comcast has long admitted that its data caps are not necessary to manage 
network congestion, and network congestion has not been a major problem 
this year despite increased use due to the pandemic; and 
 
It is unjust for working families to be hit with such frivolous fees in the middle of 
a pandemic and economic recession that has necessitated realities like remote 
K-12 learning and online eviction court; and 
 
These fees will disproportionately impact people of color and other vulnerable 
groups, including many who are already struggling with limited, uneven, or 
non-existent digital access; and 
 
It is essential that the FCC stand up for working people across this country by 
preventing ISPs like Comcast from abusing their monopoly power to nickel-
and-dime consumers who rely on internet access as a daily utility; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record urging Comcast to reconsider the decision 
to impose a data cap and additional fees on consumers starting next year; and 
be it further 
 
That the City Council go on record asking Cambridge’s Congressional

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

On October 5th, 2020, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health issued updated 
guidelines for mandated surveillance testing programs in nursing homes and assisted 
living facilities; and  
 
If there are no COVID-positive staff, and a nursing home belongs to a county with less 
than a five percent positivity rate under a 14 day rolling average, testing only has to be 
conducted on 50% of staff every two weeks; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Weekly testing of all staff is only required if there is a COVID-positive staff member 

or resident, and residents are only required to be tested if they were in close contact 
with a COVID-positive staff member, and are not required to undergo regular 
surveillance testing; and 
 
COVID had a devastating impact on the older, highly susceptible nursing home 
residents during the early days of the pandemic, and 72 of the 100 deaths caused by 
COVID in Cambridge are of residents in assisted living facilities; and 
 
As we are heading into another COVID case surge, as there were recently some cases 
in a local nursing home, it is critical to ensure cases are quickly identified, COVID-
positive staff and residents receive treatment as soon as possible, and further 
transmission is prevented; and 
 
The City conducted a Testing Pilot Program in local nursing homes in April, and could 
implement a similar testing program again to complement the surveillance testing 
mandated by the Commonwealth to ensure all staff and residents are being tested with 
greater frequency, and therefore are better protected from the threat of COVID; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the Public Health 
Department and other relevant City departments to explore the feasibility of providing 
more regular COVID testing for residents and staff in nursing homes and assisted 
living facilities; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back on this matter by the 
December 14th, 2020 regular City Council meeting.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

Each Monday night the City Council is presented with data from the state’s weekly 
report on COVID-19, which is published on the Thursday prior to the meeting; and 
 
These reports show a comparison between Cambridge and other towns based on the 
14-day average of newly reported cases per 100,000 population as of 10 days prior to 
the Council Meeting; and 
 
New COVID-19 cases are assigned retroactively to the date the test was taken rather 
than the date the results were reported, so by the time the 10-day old figure is reported 
to the council it is no longer even an accurate reflection of the case count average as of 
that day, and is reliably an undercount when case counts are increasing; and 
 
On November 23, 2020 the council received a presentation from area experts, 
including data from the Harvard Machine Intelligence Lab showing regional case count 
doubling times, testing positivity, heat maps, wastewater viral loads, hospitalizations, 
web search analytics, and other data creating a more comprehensive picture of the 
rapidly evolving pandemic in and around Cambridge; and 
 
It is critical that the council receives the most up to date and comprehensive data 
during weekly updates to inform policy making decisions regarding the city’s 
pandemic response; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to present the City Council with a 
comprehensive data report on a weekly basis, for the duration of the pandemic 
emergency, including (but not limited to) regional and Cambridge-specific trends (as 
opposed to point-in-time data like the 14-day average from 10 days prior) as outlined 
above.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

On November 23, 2020 the council received a presentation from area experts 
to help inform what actions should be taken to slow the spread of the virus; 
and 
 
The experts made it clear that the highest risk of spreading is attached to 
indoor activities where people go unmasked such as dining; and 
 
One of the critical pieces of missing information identified by the experts is 
locations of transmission using “backwards” contact tracing to identify 
transmission clusters; and 
 
This technique has been successfully applied in many other places to identify 
outbreaks by finding recently shared locations among several individuals 
testing positive for the virus; and 
 
Identifying specific locations of outbreaks can help the city perform more 
targeted interventions to improve the safety of those specific locations, as well 
as reduce the spread by identifying additional individuals who should 
quarantine and seek COVID testing; and 
 
Until an effective vaccine is in widespread use, contact tracing to identify and 
suppress clusters is the most efficient way to limit spreading of the virus and 
can help avoid more widespread closures of businesses and other indoor 
gathering spaces; and 
 
Backwards contact tracing is greatly facilitated by the use of mobile devices 
that can track and compare locations securely, by providing an easy way for 
people to “check in” to a place of business by scanning a QR code unique to 
that location upon entry; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with relevant 
departments to implement comprehensive contact tracing in Cambridge 
including the ability to conduct backwards contact tracing facilitated with 
technology such as the use of QR codes, and to report back to the City Council 
on this matter as soon as possible.

The City of Cambridge currently offers 7 day a week testing at 4 sites; and 
 
Access to testing and geographic proximity to testing is critical; and

COVID-19 testing; and 
 
Currently, data is not available about who is taking advantage of the city’s free 
COVID-19 testing; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Mobile testing vans can be deployed in Cambridge to increase access and ensure that 
there are no neighborhoods with disproportionately low COVID-19 testing rates; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager confer with the Cambridge Department of Public Health on the 
feasibility of launching mobile COVID-19 testing vans in December and report back to 
the City Council as soon as possible.

RESOLVED: 

 
RESOLVED 

In October 2020, a board member of the East Cambridge Planning Team (ECPT) 
directed homophobic and sexually harassing comments at a resident on a public 
neighborhood email group after that resident wrote an op-ed opposed to an ECPT 
policy position; and 
 
No resident should ever have to expose themselves to bigotry and intimidation based 
on who they are in order to participate in community life; and 
 
The City of Cambridge has a duty not to empower groups or individuals who bully, 
harass, or abuse other residents based on their race, creed, color, religion, national 
origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, or physical/mental disability; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the Cambridge City Council believes in the dignity of all people and their right to 
respect, and equality of opportunity and participation in civic life free of abuse, and 
values the strength that comes with difference and the positive contribution that 
diversity brings to our city; and be it further 
 
That we condemn homophobic bullying and intimidation anywhere in the city, and we 
encourage all neighborhood groups and organizations to enact policies to prevent and 
sanction such abusive behavior that serves the opposite goal of these groups and 
organizations

Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, explained that the Planning Board 
held a hearing in September on the last version of the petition.  She stated that BioMed made changes 
based on the planning board's discussion at that time.  
 
Jeffrey Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, explained that the proposal really affects two sites, 
this constellation site and then the what's been called the Gas Transfer site, parcel C. In 1999 or 2000, the 
development plan for this site is for a large complex of buildings.  
 
Councillor Carlone opened the floor to public comment. 
 
Christopher  Hope, 872 Massachusetts Ave., unit 1-5,  Director of the loop lab. He stated that the 
petitioner has offered a free space for the organization in Kendall Square to reenergize the area as a 
destination location for the arts. He stated that some residents coming from Afro-Latino communities, the 
Latino communities, but also Afro-Caribbean communities feel that there is a major disconnect between 
them and the opportunities that are available. There is potential for the intersection of the arts and the 
local community to finally be connected. He supports the petition. 
 
Maure Aronson, 720 Massachusetts Avenue, Executive Director of Global Arts Live.  He stated that the 
petitioners have the support of Global Arts Live. This project is visionary in its architectural approach, it 
is also visionary in its approach to make a Culture Center to the identity of Kendall Square. The year-
round indoor space that biomed has proposed is unlike anything else in Cambridge or the region.  
 
Nagesh Mahanthappa, 7 Old Dee Rd., Cambridge, MA.  He supports this project. He is chair of the Board 
of global Arts Live. The project will not only bring a world class theater space, but community space.  . 
 
Dan Marshall, 500 Kendall Street, Executive Artistic Director, Brookline/Cambridge Community Center 
for the Arts, Inc. Spoke in support of the proposal. This is a visionary and amazing mixed-use design.   
 
Brian Amador, 199 Pemberton Street, spoke in support of the project. The city is in dire need of 
performance spaces that are medium sized and small, and this project would provide both of those smaller 
informal spaces on the ground floor and a medium sized, beautiful theatre on the third floor.  
 
Ken Field, 108 Pleasant Street, spoke in support of the project. At this time, performing performers and 
audiences are experiencing an ongoing loss of Performing Arts venues due in large part to the economic 
realities of the pandemic. But the dearth of medium sized public performing venues in the city was a 
problem before the pandemic hit. In addition to the closing of music venues, the city has lost dance 
studios, visual art studio space and other performance venues. He strongly encouraged the developers and 
the committee to think carefully about the details of the operating model for the arts and cultural 
component of the proposal to ensure its longevity.  
 
Brian Lim, Cambridge Community Center for the Arts, 500 Kendall Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, Co-
founder and Operations Director of the nonprofit organization called The Flavor Continues. BioMed has 
been a good partner or providing dancing space.  He fully supports the project. 
 
Carl Nagy-Koechlin, Executive Director at Just-A-Start, 1035 Cambridge Street. He spoke in favor of the 
project. Kendall Square is really at the center of that quest to get low- and moderate-income people, in 
Cambridge, plugged into the economy and moving forward with living wage jobs that have a future. He is 
impressed with BioMed Realty’s commitment to making that connection and helping to link people that 
Just-A-Start trains to jobs in that building with their eventual tenants.

Anna Myer, 60 Dudley Street, spoke in support of the project. Not only does it bring people into the city, 
but people that go out to eat, they go shopping, it creates community at Kendall Square. 
 
Alex Ambila, 47 Strathmore Road, Brighton MA, spoke in support of the project. This project will allow 
artists to connect with other communities and create a better foundation for the arts in Boston, and in 
Cambridge. 
 
Scott McBurney, representing the center the energy and the Kendall green energy plant and district 
energy system in Cambridge. They have over a decade's long relationship with BioMed both as a direct 
abutter and as a business partner. He spoke in support of the project. 
 
Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, she stated that she wants the arts, space and the other community 
spaces to come to pass but does not want to pay too big a price for them. She hopes that in the 
understandable zeal for the project that Kendall Square is not overloaded with buildings.  
 
Michael Monestime, 4 George Street, spoke in favor of the project.  This is not a project that's going to be 
an eyesore to the neighborhood. 
 
William Harris, 8 Arlington Street, spoke in support for the project. The connection of indoors and 
outdoors will be truly unique.

In response to a question from Councillor Nolan about the sustainability and financial sustainability of the 
community space, Mr. Zinno stated that the space would be provided with at no cost, no rent, it has carve 
it out as a condo, so there will be no real estate taxes on the space, it would be deeded to a nonprofit. 
BioMed realty would also help to offset any operating costs. 
  
Councillor Nolan encouraged the petitioner to provide more operational details about the arts space. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about open space on the second floor. Mr. Zinno 
stated the second and third floors of the building would be glassy theater space. 
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon about the timeline to move the Gas Transfer 
Station, Mr. Zinno stated he expects that in the course of a few months, they will be in front of the city to 
request a special permit and potentially a variance to allow the Gas Transfer Station to be situated on the 
proposed site behind 500 Kendall.

In response to a question from Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon about additional sustainability measures used 
in the building, Mr. Zinno stated that the project will include significant green space and there will be no 
new parking spaces.  The green roofs were brought down on the four terraces that run alongside the east 
and west sides of the building. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor McGovern  about the height of the proposed building in 
relation to its neighbors, Mr. Zinno stated that the watermark, building, the taller of the two towers,

Councillor Carlone asked for more information about how the project will change if the Gas Transfer 
Station deal does not happen.  In response to a question about the arts space, Mr. Zinno explained that the 
has a vested interest in the success of that space because it is the “front-door” of the building. 
 
Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, stated that the City and its consultant

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 
Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use 
district that is comprised of high quality general and technical office and 
laboratory  uses  with  diverse  active  commercial  retail  and  community 
uses; to promote and enhance the existing open space network within and 
surrounding  the  district  through  the  public  open  space  connections 
among  Termeer  Square,  the  plaza  abutting  the  Broad  Canal,  the  Broad 
Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street; and to provide unique community 
benefits through community arts and public gathering spaces. The PUD-
CDK District creates incentives to (A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and 
culture  facility  within  the  district  that  will  further  diversify  the  mix  of 
uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade 
utility and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station 
on Third Street to enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street 
and provide an attractive connector corridor between the district and the 
East  Cambridge  neighborhood.  The  parcel  on  which  the  existing  gas 
regulator/transfer  station  is  located  is  referred  to  herein  as  the  “Gas 
Transfer Station Parcel”. 
PUD-CDK Special Permit 
Eligible  Development  Parcel.  To  further  the  purpose  of  this  Section 
13.200,  an  applicant  may  submit  a  Development  Proposal  and  obtain  a 
special permit from the Planning Board approving a Final Development 
Plan  for  a  Development  Parcel  located  within  the  PUD-CDK  District 
that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK special permit, consists of 
at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the foregoing, the Final 
Development  Plan  for  a  currently  vacant  or  undeveloped  Development 
Parcel  under  this  PUD-CDK  overlay  zoning  shall  include  an  Arts  and 
Culture Center, as further provided in Section 13.204.1(b) below. 
PUD-CDK  Special  Permit  Approval.  The  Planning  Board  may  grant  a 
PUD-CDK  special  permit  approving  a  Final  Development  Plan  for  a 
Development  Parcel  upon  finding  that  the  Final  Development  Plan  is 
consistent  with  the  criteria  set  forth  below,  and  all  other  criteria 
applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought.

such  other  areas  or  spaces  determined,  or  approved,  by  the  Planning 
Board to be open space. 
Perimeter  and  Transition:  Any  part  of  the  perimeter  of  a  PUD  which 
fronts on an existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed 
as to complement and harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to 
scale,  density,  setback,  bulk,  height,  landscaping,  and  screening. 
Development  in  the  PUD-CDK  District  should  provide  integrated 
pedestrian  circulation  systems,  particularly  strong  linkages  between  the 
Broad Canal and Kendall Square. 

Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the 
off-street  Parking  and  Loading  Requirements  set  forth  in  Article 6.000, 
except as modified by this Section 13.205. 
Parking: 
Minimum  Parking.  There  shall  be  no  minimum  parking  requirements 
within the PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in 
approving  a  Final  Development  Plan  may  specify  a  minimum  parking 
requirement  based  on  review  and  analysis  of  Transportation  Impact 
Studies  and  other  relevant  information  on  parking  demand  provided  in 
application documents, and with the guidance of City agencies. 
Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a Development Parcel 
within the PUD-CDK District shall be limited by applying the rates set 
forth  below  to  each  use  within  a  Development  Parcel  subject  to  PUD-
CDK and taking the summation of the result for all uses. For any use not 
listed below, the maximum parking ratio set forth in Article 6.000, to the 
extent  provided,  shall  apply.  Exceeding  the  maximum  allowed  parking 
shall  require  a  waiver  of  maximum  parking  required  under  the  general 
provisions of Article 6.000. 
i. 

Maximum  of  0.8  spaces  per  1,000  square  feet  of  Gross  Floor 
Area for office and laboratory uses. 
Maximum  of  0.5  spaces  per  1,000  square  feet  of  Gross  Floor 
Area for retail space. 

ii. 

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall  make  a  finding  that  that  the  Final  Development  Plan  provides 
adequate parking for the proposed uses and that the Final Development 
Plan  does  not  substantially  increase  net-new  off-street  parking  spaces 
within the PUD-CDK District. 
The  parking  requirements  of  this  Section  13.205.2  may  be  satisfied  (a)

Bicycle  Parking:  Bicycle  parking  shall  be  provided  in  accordance  with 
Section  6.100  of  this  Zoning  Ordinance,  provided  that,  in  accordance 
with  Section  6.108,  any  of  the  requirements  in  Section  6.100  may  be

Development Plan. 
Special  Requirements,  Standards,  and  Provisions  Applicable  to 
Development  Authorized  by  the  Planning  Board  in  the  PUD-CDK 
District. 
Relationship  to  PUD-3.  The  previously  issued  PUD-3  special  permit(s) 
shall  remain  valid  and  in  full  force  and  effect  for,  and  govern  with 
respect  to,  all  remaining  land  of  the  PUD-3  District  outside  of  a 
Development  Parcel,  including  without  limitation  with  respect  to  a 
rebuilding due to casualty, provided that the terms of such PUD-3 special 
permit(s) shall be applied to such remaining land without regard to any 
rights granted to a Development Parcel pursuant to a PUD-CDK special 
permit. For the avoidance of doubt and subject to this Section 13.206.1, 
the Planning Board shall administer the applicable PUD special permits 
in  accordance  with  the  applicable  PUD  overlay  zoning  provision  that 
govern such special permits (e.g., PUD-3 or PUD-CDK, as the case may 
be). 
Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit to a Development 
Parcel shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-
3 special permit to that Development Parcel, and the PUD-CDK zoning 
shall govern with respect to such additional rights. A PUD-CDK special 
permit  application  may  request  that  the  Planning  Board  simultaneously 
issue  a  minor  amendment  to  any  special  permit  under  PUD-3  covering 
such  Development  Parcel,  including  to  establish  that  the  Development 
Parcel is no longer subject to such special permit, so long as such minor 
amendment  does  not  alter  the  remainder  of  the  development  that  is 
subject to such special permit under PUD-3. 
To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more  special  permit(s),  site  plan  approval(s)  and/or  variance(s)  issued 
prior  to  the  issuance  date  of  a  PUD-CDK  special  permit  granted 
hereunder and the provisions of such existing approval(s) conflict or are 
inconsistent  with  the  PUD-CDK  special  permit,  the  provisions  of  the 
PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 
Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District 
shall comply with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 
22.20 of this Zoning Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain 
documentation showing how the development at an aggregate level will 
comply with the requirements of Section 22.20. The conditions of a PUD 
special  permit  shall  set  forth  procedures  to  meet  the  requirements  of 
Section 22.20. 
The  Sustainability  and  Resiliency  Plan  component  of  a  Development 
Proposal shall describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will 
incorporate  a  comprehensive  design  approach  and  incorporate  the  best 
practices  for  meeting  sustainability  as  outlined  in  the  City’s  Net  Zero 
Action  Plan,  Climate  Change  Preparedness  and  Resilience  Plan,  and 
other sustainability plans and guidelines promulgated by the City at the 

Packet Pg. 133

time  the  Development  Proposal  is  submitted.  The  conditions  of  a  PUD 
special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be reviewed as 
part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within  an  approved  Final  Development  Plan.  At  a  minimum,  buildings 
shall incorporate best practices in the following areas: 

to 

the  potential 

the  extent  practicable, 

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve 
reduce 
building  energy  and, 
carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new building within 
the  PUD-CDK  District  will  evaluate 
for 
implementation  of  net  zero  ready  measures  and  on-site  energy 
generation  (which  may  include  rooftop  solar  pv)  within  the 
PUD-CDK  District  in  the  context  of  ownership,  economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a 
greenhouse  gas  emissions  analysis  for  such  new  building  and 
will implement energy efficiency mitigation for such building to 
achieve  the  maximum  energy  reductions  possible  identified  in 
such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial 
building  shall  include  a  study,  prepared  by  the  developer, 
considering the feasibility of connecting the proposed building to 
the existing district steam system, if available. 
(b)  Urban  Site  and  Landscaping;  Water  Management.  The 
developer  of  a  new  building  must  explore  opportunities  for 
potable  water  use  reductions  and  the  ability  to  enhance 
indigenous plantings in and around the development site. 
(c)  Cool  Roofs.  All  new  buildings  approved  in  the  PUD-CDK 
District  must  employ  Functional  Green  Roofs  (as  such  term  is 
defined in Article 22.000 of this Zoning Ordinance), high-albedo 
“white” roofs, or a functionally equivalent roofing system. 
(d)  Monitoring.  All  new  buildings  in  the  PUD-CDK  District 
shall  be  required  to  conform  to  the  requirements  of  the 
Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure Ordinance, Chapter 
8.67 of the Municipal Code. 
(e) Healthy Living and Working.  All new buildings in the PUD-
CDK  District  shall  provide  people  with  access  to  daylight  and 
enhance  the  visual  and thermal  comfort  of  people  living  within 
the PUD-CDK District. 
(f) Transportation. A Final Development Plan within the PUD-
CDK District shall encourage multimodal transportation, provide 
facilities  for  cyclists  and  provide  an  infrastructure  to  support 
alternative energy vehicles. 
(g)  Flood  Resiliency.  All  new  buildings  must  incorporate  the 
City  of  Cambridge’s  most  up-to-date  standards  to  address 
projected future flooding impacts. 
(h) Site Cooling Strategies. A Final Development Plan within the 
PUD-CDK  District  shall  incorporate  measures  to  reduce  urban 
heat  island  effects  and  identify  interior  and  exterior  spaces  in 
designated locations to act as cooling areas. 

Letter  of  Commitment.  The  Letter  of  Commitment  date  ____________ 
13.206.3 
by _____________ is incorporated herein by reference and made a part of the Cambridge 
Zoning  Ordinance  and  shall  be  binding  upon  ______________  and  its  successors  and 
assigns. To the extent the provisions of the Letter of Commitment are inconsistent with 
the provisions of this Section 13.200, the more stringent provisions shall govern.

Re: Re-Submission of Zoning Amendment Petition 

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, Vice Mayor Mallon, Ordinance Committee Co-Chair Carlone, Ordinance 
Committee Co-Chair McGovern, and Councilors Nolan, Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, Toomey, 
and Zondervan: 

On behalf of BMR-Third LLC, a subsidiary of BioMed Realty, L.P., we are pleased to re-

submit for your review the enclosed rezoning petition for a proposed amendment to the Zoning 
Ordinance and the Zoning Map of the City of Cambridge, which, upon adoption, would result in 
a new Planned Unit Development (“PUD”) District CDK. As you know, on March 11, 2020 we 
submitted the enclosed rezoning petition to the City Clerk, and the City Council referred the 
rezoning petition to the Planning Board and the Ordinance Committee at the March 16, 2020 
City Council meeting. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Planning Board cancelled its 
meetings for the months of April, May and early June, and has since re-commenced remote 
meetings on June 16, 2020. Accordingly, in July we re-submitted the PUD-CDK rezoning 
petition but due to certain scheduling constraints we are re-submitting the enclosed rezoning 
petition. The enclosed rezoning petition is exactly the same as the March and July petitions other 
than any revised dates or references to this re-submission, as the case may be. 

As you know, we have worked closely with the City to see to the stewardship of what is 

now branded as Canal District Kendall (formerly Kendall Square and Cambridge Research Park) 
since completing the acquisition of the former Lyme Properties portfolio in 2007. Specific 
stewardship projects include ongoing improvements to the public realm (including renovation of 
the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the introduction of public art, improvements to the ice

skating rink and boat launch, a commitment to local retail, and the on-going redevelopment and 
dedication of Termeer Square) and the development of 450 Kendall Street. We now come to you 
with what we hope is the final step in finishing what Lyme Properties started in 1999 by 
realizing on the longstanding goal of having a significant arts and culture facility in the 
neighborhood. At the same time, we hope to replace the Eversource gas facility located along 
Third Street to make way for an iconic architectural building that enhances the public realm and 
the connections among surrounding open spaces. As you will see in the enclosed proposed 
Zoning Map amendment, the new overlay district covers the portion of the Canal District 
Kendall that was originally developed as Kendall Square plus the Eversource site (referred to 
here as the gas transfer station site, or “GTS Site,” for ease of reference). 

A. Background. We submit this petition after soliciting extensive public feedback 

through community open houses, surveys, deeply engaging with the arts community, and other 
means to determine what type of arts and culture facility the City wants to see at 585 Third 
Street, the former Constellation Center site (also known as “Parcel C”). As you know, 
Constellation acquired the site in 2002 and spent over 15 years trying to raise the capital for a 
theater complex at the location. In the interim, the rest of the area within the proposed PUD-
CDK has been improved to now include approximately 757,970 square feet of office and 
laboratory space, 75,500 square feet of retail and restaurant uses, and 465 residential units. 
Unfortunately, a standalone theater proved not to be economically viable on Parcel C. We 
acquired Parcel C in 2018, and have subsequently entered into an option agreement with 
Eversource that creates the possibility of combining Parcel C with the abutting GTS Site. The 
finite duration of the option agreement and the unique ability to  relocate the GTS in 
coordination with a development spanning both parcels makes this a one-in-a-generation 
opportunity. We continue to work diligently on establishing a new location for the GTS facility, 
and are nearer than ever to achieving our goal, but have not yet completed that effort. 

We and our affiliates are the owners of abutting first class laboratory facilities that serve 
as key locations for companies like Takeda, Alnylam, and Eli Lilly; the success of development 
on Parcel C was and is highly important to us and our shareholders. As majority owners in the 
association that manages the public realm of the Canal District Kendall, the public realm is also 
essential to us and to our tenants – both biotech and retailers alike. We are convinced that we can 
make a significant impact with an arts and culture facility in a way that fits into the 
neighborhood, is attractive to a diverse set of Cambridge residents and visitors, enhances the 
public realm, is economically viable, and otherwise furthers the development goals of the 
community, while being within the guidelines of our mission as a real estate investment 
company focusing on high quality life sciences space. 

B.  Summary of Petition. Our zoning petition memorializes the previously approved and 

constructed density at each site within the proposed PUD-CDK, and allows for additional 
development on Parcel C and the GTS Site to achieve the project concept described below. The 
proposed amendment permits a mixed use development project that is a new building containing 
an arts, culture, and public space component that complements the existing 465 apartments and 
commercial space, and, as noted above, creates incentives for incorporating the GTS Site by 
allowing for greater bulk and height, and public realm amenities, if the GTS Site is included. The 
height and floor area, under a scenario where the GTS facility is removed from Third Street,

would be 250 feet and up to 550,000 gross square feet, respectively. The proposed amendment 
does not grant further development potential to the existing buildings constructed within PUD-
CDK. 

C. Project Concept. Since acquiring Parcel C, we have worked tirelessly with our 
consultant team to unlock the full potential of the site. The renderings enclosed show the fruits of 
our labor. To accommodate the building and concepts shown, the proposed PUD-CDK allows us 
to combine Parcel C with the GTS Site and construct mixed use laboratory and office above 
approximately 40,000 square feet of arts, culture, and public space, all in a striking 21st-century 
building consistent with existing and other proposed building heights in the vicinity. This 
building will significantly enhance the open spaces surrounding it, and will help strengthen the 
pedestrian corridor that ties together Termeer Square to the north, the Broad Canal and Broad 
Canal Way retail to the south, and the future Volpe Center project to the west (across Third 
Street).  All of this can be done in a manner that meets the sustainability practices of modern 
construction and caters to a community as economically and culturally diverse as Cambridge. 

Compare the renderings of our proposed project to the existing condition, also shown in 

the enclosed renderings. Parcel C is the “missing tooth” in the Canal District Kendall, and the 
location of the GTS Site (the last remnant of an industrial zone on Third Street) exacerbates the 
problem from an urban planning perspective. We believe that the project facilitated by the 
enclosed rezoning is a massive improvement, and a welcome addition, to the Cambridge 
pedestrian environment. 

We note that we have every intention of including the GTS Site in our proposed project. 
Although the ability to move the GTS facilities is not entirely within our control, we have been 
working continuously with Eversource and others to reach agreements that are necessary for the 
exercise of our option to acquire the GTS Site and move its facilities to a non-residential 
location. However, some details remain to be worked out and, out of an abundance of caution, 
we have drafted the petition allowing for the possibility that the project might not include the 
GTS Site by providing for a more limited scope of improvements utilizing only Parcel C to 
advance the vision of a community arts facility on the ground floor of a mixed use building. 
While not our preference because its impact would be less transformative and enriching for the 
neighborhood, we believe it is a viable alternative project. 

D. Benefits. Our preferred proposed project, utilizing the GTS Site, will result in many 

benefits for the East Cambridge community, and the community close to PUD-CKD in 
particular. Those benefits, many of which will be memorialized in a commitment letter to be 
submitted to City Council, have an approximate value of at least Sixty Million Dollars 
($60,000,000), and include the following: 

 A commitment to use reasonable efforts to relocate the existing utility facilities 

from the GTS Site to a non-residential location. 

 An arts and culture component of 30,000 square feet, inclusive of a 250-300 seat 
state-of-the-art theater, if the GTS Site is included (and, in any event, arts and 
culture space of at least 15,000 square feet).
10,000 square feet of indoor all-season public space.

Practical  measures to support  a diverse,  inclusive,  and  sustainable  operatine
model  for the arts and culture component.
No new parking.
Use of best practices  for meeting  sustainability goals in areas  such  as energ).
emissions, water,  materials,  urban site reuse,  and landscaping.
No new  gas connection.

Our proposal  is the end result  of many  community  meetings  and public  presentations

with neighbors,  neighborhood  stakeholders, and with stakeholders  at City Hall, including  three
open  houses, multiple  meetings with an Arts Advisory Committee  comprised  of community  arts
advocates,  a public  survey,  and solicitations for public  comment  on presentation  boards  that we
displayed  at our open houses.  Key takeaways from  the public  process  included a focus on the
need for flexible performing  arts spaces  for small  and larger  productions,  community  arts  spaces
(such  as classrooms for leaming art and exhibit space),  public gathering  spaces  available  across
all four  seasons,  and relocating  the GTS facility away from  Third Street.  Our proposed zoning
overlay  text and map encourages  achievement  of these goals, with the publicly  accessible
facilities  within  and commanding  the lower  levels  of a unique  and beautiful  commercial  building
that will provide over an acre of new  landscaped  area (indoors and outdoors),  subject  to further
detailed  review by the Planning  Board  under the contemplated  special  permit process.

We  are excited to work with you in the formal  review process  for the zoning amendment
and again  upon  submission  of an application for a PUD-CDK  special  permit.  We  are committed
to East  Cambridge  and to doing all that we can to make Canal District Kendall  a shining  example
of the best of mixed-use  transit-oriented  development  for the 21st century.

Very truly  yours,

13.201

Planned Unit Development at Canal District Kendall 

Purpose. The PUD-CDK District is intended to provide for a mixed-use district that is 
comprised of high quality general and technical office and labs with diverse active 
commercial and community uses (including retail and restaurant uses, and arts and 
cultural uses), all of which promote, create corridors among, and enhance the existing 
open space network within and surrounding the district, and provide benefits to the 
surrounding community through community arts and publicly accessible interior 
gathering space. In particular, the district facilitates strengthening the public open 
space connections among Termeer Square, the plaza abutting the Broad Canal, the 
Broad Canal, public recreation pathways leading towards the Charles River, and 
future open space west of Third Street. The PUD-CDK District creates incentives to 
(A) incorporate a high-caliber arts and culture facility that will further diversify the 
mix of uses within the neighborhood, and (B) remove the existing above-grade utility 
and industrial facilities located at the existing gas transfer station on Third Street to 
enhance the streetscape experience along Third Street and provide an attractive 
connector corridor between the district and the East Cambridge neighborhood. The 
parcel on which the existing gas regulator/transfer station is located is referred to 
herein as the “Gas Transfer Station Parcel”. 

13.202

PUD-CDK Special Permit

13.202.1 Eligible Development Parcel. To further the purpose of this Section 13.200, an 

applicant may submit a Development Proposal and obtain a special permit from the 
Planning Board approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel 
located within the PUD-CDK District that, at the time of application for a PUD-CDK 
special permit, consists of at least 30,000 square feet in area. In addition to the 
foregoing, the Final Development Plan for a currently vacant or undeveloped 
Development Parcel under this PUD-CDK overlay zoning shall include either an Arts 
and Culture Center or Community Arts Facility, as further provided in Section 
13.204.1(b) below. 

13.202.2 PUD-CDK Special Permit Approval. The Planning Board may grant a PUD-CDK 

special permit approving a Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel upon 
finding that the Final Development Plan is consistent with the criteria set forth below, 
and all other criteria applicable to approval of any other special permits being sought. 

13.202.3 PUD-CDK Special Permit Requirements. Within the Development Parcel the 
locations of the open spaces, the quantities of proposed land uses, the building 
envelope, and heights shall be indicated in sufficient detail that the Planning Board 
can reasonably assess the impact of the PUD-CDK special permit and its general 
consistency with the PUD-CDK Special Permit Criteria set forth in Section 13.202.4 
below. At a minimum, a Development Proposal and subsequent Final Development 
Plan must contain the following components:  

(a) Site Development Plan: describing how the Development Parcel is divided 
into use areas and their development characteristics, including potential uses and 
Gross Floor Area.

Culture Center that may be required by Section 13.204.1(b) and strategies for 
programming and activating such spaces.  

(g) Sustainability and Resiliency Plan: describing: (1) how the sustainability 
requirements set forth in Section 13.206.2 below will be met; (2) how the proposed 
development will promote best practices for environmental sustainability and 
resiliency; and (3) how the proposed development serves nearby East Cambridge 
community-wide needs for emergency refuge or shelter during heat or storm 
emergencies in coordination with the Cambridge Climate Vulnerability Assessment 
dated February 2017.  

(h) Transportation Plan: incorporating: (1) a Traffic Study as required by Section 

19.20 of this Zoning Ordinance or a Transportation Assessment pursuant to Section 
13.205.2; (2) a shared parking study to demonstrate that the district’s parking supply 
can accommodate future anticipated demands at full build out; (3) a study of the 
impacts of increased demand on public transportation services in the East Cambridge 
area; (4) a description of the development’s relationship to future regional rail, bus, 
pedestrian/bicycle and other transportation system connections in the area; and (5) a 
Transportation Demand Management and Mitigation program describing measures 
which may be incorporated by the Planning Board into a condition of a PUD-CDK 
special permit to offset or mitigate the development’s impacts on transportation 
systems, including measures set forth in this Zoning Ordinance and the City’s 
planning efforts to be linked to milestones, thresholds or performance standards.

(a) If Section 13.204.1(b) of this PUD-CDK overlay zoning requires a 
Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, such Community Arts 
Facility or Arts and Culture Center (i) takes into consideration the orientation of the 
uses, location of building entrances, pedestrian connectivity between such uses and 
adjacent open space areas, and the ability of such uses to promote diversity and serve 
all residents of the City of Cambridge; and (ii) creates a facility available for the 
neighborhood that supports or promotes small arts or theater organizations, 
independent artists, art co-working opportunities, or partnerships among the 
foregoing and the local community. Furthermore, the developer of such Community 
Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center shall have demonstrated a commitment to 
establishing an arts and culture operational plan for space within the new building 
that will be made available for teaching, learning, rehearsing, or idea exchange.

individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel, of any 
provision of this Section 13.200 shall not constitute a violation with respect to any 
other individual PUD-CDK lot or ownership unit within the Development Parcel. A 
PUD-CDK special permit may specify that certain modifications to the Final 
Development Plan do not alter the concept of the PUD and such modifications shall 
be considered minor amendments under Section 12.37 of this Zoning Ordinance 
subject only to written approval of the Planning Board if the developer demonstrates 
that such modification(s): (i) constitute a reallocation or reconfiguration of Gross 
Floor Area among uses in the Final Development Plan or otherwise allowed in the 
PUD-CDK District, (ii) do not require a new type of zoning relief (other than the 
categories of relief previously granted for the proposed development project, whether 
by existing PUD special permits or otherwise), and (iii) maintain the same percentage 
of Minimum Open Space as approved by the PUD-CDK special permit. 

13.202.7 Pre-Application Conference. In the course of preparing a development proposal for a 

Development Parcel, the developer shall be required to participate in at least one PUD 
Pre-Application Conference as established in Section 12.33 of this Zoning Ordinance. 
The purpose of the conference will be to discuss the conceptual alternatives for site 
arrangement, building massing, and public space arrangement, as well as general 
approaches to architectural and landscape design, and for the Planning Board to 
provide the developer informal feedback prior to preparing the Final Development 
Plan materials. As set forth in Section 12.33.2 of this Zoning Ordinance, any 
statement made by the Planning Board or the developer at the Pre-Application 
Conference shall not be legally binding. Notwithstanding Section 12.33.3 of this 
Zoning Ordinance, the developer shall present graphic and written materials as 
needed to illustrate and describe conceptual development alternatives.

increased to 250 feet if the proposed development project will abut and/or have 
frontage along at least 75 linear feet of Third Street or otherwise, at the developer’s 
option, provide an appropriate pedestrian corridor between the existing or planned 
open space in the PUD-CDK District and open space to the west of Third Street. In 
addition to the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its review of a special permit 
application under this Section 13.204.3, may except from the calculation of the height 
of buildings and structures in the PUD-CDK District chimneys, water towers, air 
conditioning equipment, ventilators, and other necessary features appurtenant to 
buildings which are otherwise typically carried above roofs and are not used for 
human occupancy, including mechanical floors within a building where for functional 
or aesthetic reasons such equipment, structures, or features are on above-grade levels 
of the building other than the roof level or above. 

13.204.4 Other Dimensional Requirements: There shall be no minimum lot area, no minimum 
lot width, no minimum frontage, and no minimum front, side or rear yard 
requirements for the Development Parcel or any lot within the PUD-CDK District.

building dimensional requirements other than as provided by this Section 13.204. 

13.204.5 Open Space: Any Final Development Plan within the PUD-CDK District shall 

demonstrate that, following completion of such development, there shall be not less 
than fifteen percent (15%) open space as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 in 
the PUD-CDK District except as modified below.  

13.204.5.1

13.204.5.2

The Planning Board, in its review of any special permit application for a 
development containing a Community Arts Facility or an Arts and Culture Center, 
may consider indoor or covered pedestrian ways, decks, arcades, loggias, and 
gallerias appurtenant to the Community Arts Facility or Arts and Culture Center, 
even if located on a different Development Parcel in the PUD-CDK District, to be 
open space provided that the same is publicly accessible during normal business 
hours. The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, 
shall make a finding that there is no net-loss of open space already existing within 
the PUD-CDK District (other than within any previously undeveloped or vacant 
Development Parcel). 

Open space, whether already existing within the PUD-CDK District or to be 
constructed by the developer or its affiliate, shall include, without limitation, the 
following: parks; plazas; lawns; landscaped areas substantially open to the sky; 
playgrounds; balconies; roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage; 
pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified 
by the Planning Board; and such other areas or spaces determined, or approved, 
by the Planning Board to be open space.   

13.204.6 Perimeter and Transition: Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an 
existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and 
harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, 
height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-CDK District should 
provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages 
between the Broad Canal and Kendall Square.

Parking and Loading Requirements.

13.205.1 Generally: Development in the PUD-CDK District shall conform to the off-street 

Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as modified by 
this Section 13.205. 

13.205.2 Parking:  

13.205.2.1 Minimum Parking. There shall be no minimum parking requirements within the 
PUD-CDK District; provided, however, the Planning Board in approving a Final 
Development Plan may specify a minimum parking requirement based on review 
and analysis of Transportation Assessments and other relevant information on 
parking demand provided in application documents, and with the guidance of City 
agencies.  

13.205.2.2

13.205.2.3

13.205.2.4

13.205.2.5

The Planning Board, through its approval of a Final Development Plan, shall 
make a finding that that the Final Development Plan provides adequate parking 
for the proposed uses and that the Final Development Plan does not substantially 
increase net-new off-street parking spaces within the PUD-CDK District. 

The parking requirements of this Section 13.205.2 may be satisfied (a) anywhere 
in the PUD-CDK District, or if located outside of the PUD-CDK District, within 
2,000 feet of the use being served, notwithstanding anything to the contrary 
contained in Article 6.000; and (b) in total or in part by an easement, lease 
agreement, occupancy agreement, license or other comparable legal instrument 
between the developer and the City, other public entity or private owner or 
consortium for use of parking spaces in the public or shared parking facilities 
within said area. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 6.000, this Zoning Ordinance 
shall not restrict the management and assignment of parking spaces in a way that 
will most efficiently utilize the existing and proposed parking spaces to serve all 
approved uses. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 19.20, the Planning Board 
may permit the Developer to substitute a Transportation Assessment in form and 
substance acceptable to the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department if the 
Planning Board otherwise determines that the materials submitted with the Final 
Development Plan adequately describe the impacts of traffic and parking on the 
area surrounding the Development Parcel.  

13.205.3 Loading: The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan, may 
waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of loading facilities 
within the PUD-CDK District, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across 
various uses within the PUD-CDK District or the adjacent PUD-3 District. 

13.205.4 Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking shall be provided in accordance with Section 6.100 
of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that, in accordance with Section 6.108, any of the 
requirements in Section 6.100 may be modified by the Planning Board through its 
approval of a Final Development Plan.

13.206

Special Requirements, Standards, and Provisions Applicable to Development 
Authorized by the Planning Board in the PUD-CDK District.

13.206.1 Relationship to PUD-3. The previously issued PUD-3 special permit(s) shall remain 

13.206.2 Sustainability. New buildings constructed within the PUD-CDK District shall comply 

valid and in full force and effect for, and govern with respect to, all development 
projects constructed pursuant thereto and existing prior to the enactment date of this 
Section 13.200 for the PUD-CDK District, including without limitation with respect 
to rebuilding due to casualty. Rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit 
shall be in addition to any rights previously granted under a PUD-3 special permit, 
and the PUD-CDK zoning shall govern with respect to such additional rights, except 
however any rights granted pursuant to a PUD-CDK special permit shall 
automatically supersede any undeveloped rights for the applicable development 
parcel as provided for under the PUD-3 zoning. Such undeveloped rights, and any 
associated outstanding obligations with respect to such rights, under a previously 
issued PUD-3 special permit shall be deemed automatically extinguished as of the 
date that the subsequent PUD-CDK special permit becomes valid and effective, and 
such automatic extinguishment shall be deemed to be a minor amendment of such 
previously issued special permit under PUD-3 under Section 12.37.2 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. To the extent a Development Parcel is subject to the provisions of one or 
more special permit(s), site plan approval(s) and/or variance(s) issued prior to the 
issuance date of a PUD-CDK special permit granted hereunder and the provisions of 
such existing approval(s) conflict or are inconsistent with the PUD-CDK special 
permit, the provisions of the PUD-CDK special permit shall govern. 

with the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning 
Ordinance. The Development Proposal shall contain documentation showing how the 
development at an aggregate level will comply with the requirements of Section 
22.20. The conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth procedures to meet the 
requirements of Section 22.20.  

The Sustainability and Resiliency Plan component of a Development Proposal shall 
describe how new buildings in the PUD-CDK District will incorporate a 
comprehensive design approach and incorporate the best practices for meeting 
sustainability as outlined in the City’s Net Zero Action Plan, Climate Change 
Preparedness and Resilience Plan, and other sustainability plans and guidelines 
promulgated by the City at the time the Development Proposal is submitted. The 
conditions of a PUD special permit shall set forth sustainability guidelines to be 
reviewed as part of any continuing design review procedure for individual buildings 
within an approved Final Development Plan. At a minimum, buildings shall 
incorporate best practices in the following areas:  

(a) Energy and Emissions; Steam. A new building must conserve building energy 
and, to the extent practicable, reduce carbon/GHG emissions. The developer of a new 
building within the PUD-CDK District will evaluate the potential for implementation 
of net zero ready measures and on-site energy generation (which may include rooftop 
solar pv) within the PUD-CDK District in the context of ownership, economic 
viability and phasing constraints. The Developer will conduct a greenhouse gas 
emissions analysis for such new building and will implement energy efficiency

mitigation for such building to achieve the maximum energy reductions possible 
identified in such analysis. The Development Proposal for a new commercial building 
shall include a study, prepared by the developer, considering the feasibility of 
connecting the proposed building to the existing district steam system, if available. 

(b) Urban Site and Landscaping; Water Management. The developer of a new 
building must explore opportunities for potable water use reductions and the ability to 
enhance indigenous plantings in and around the development site.  

(c) Cool Roofs. All new buildings approved in the PUD-CDK District must 
employ Functional Green Roofs (as such term is defined in Article 22.000 of this 
Zoning Ordinance), high-albedo “white” roofs, or a functionally equivalent roofing 
system.  

(d) Monitoring. All new buildings in the PUD-CDK District shall be required to 

conform to the requirements of the Cambridge Building Energy Use Disclosure 
Ordinance, Chapter 8.67 of the Municipal Code.

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR

          Mayor 
 

 
To: 

From:   

Date: 

 

 

Cambridge City Council 

Sumbul Siddiqui, Mayor 

November 25, 2020 

Subject: 

Communicating information from the School Committee  

 
To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
For the next Regular Meeting of the School Committee on Tuesday, December 1st, I have filed a motion, 
cosponsored by Member Weinstein and Vice-Chair Bowman, asking the Superintendent work with the 
Safety, Health, and Facilities Working Group and Cambridge Public Health Department to explore the 
possibility of implementing a pool testing strategy—similar to what the Somerville and Medford Public 
Schools are employing—and whether it can be effective and applicable to the Cambridge Public School 
community.  
 
In addition, I have cosponsored a motion with Member Rachel and Member Wilson requesting that the 
school department work with the City to determine how soon the Field House can be made for school 
use and that the school department work with scientific advisors, community partners, and volunteers 
to explore the provision of wellbeing and social opportunities for students at the Field House during 
the remainder of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
In planning for a potential shift to district-wide remote learning, Assistant Superintendent Michelle 
Madera has been working with school principals to identify action steps that include: 

•  Schedules for students who are transitioning to remote learning 
•  Plans for staff that will continue to be in buildings and processes for staff to access buildings 
•  Transition plans for students with disabilities and English language learners 
•  Technology links and device support 
•  Schedules for families to pick up materials 

 
Cambridge Public Health School Nurse Manager Tracy Rose-Tynes has informed us that school nurses 
are doing record reviews on all immunizations. In-person students who did not receive a flu vaccine 
will be offered vaccines onsite from early to mid-December. CPSD hopes that 6th-12th graders will take 
advantage of the Teen Health Center and the nurses continue to receive documentation from families 
who have received their flu shots elsewhere (in the community, from their primary care providers, and 
at pharmacies).

The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) Board of Directors met on November 
20th to review and vote on the guidelines for the winter sports schedule. A recommendation is planned 
for  the  December  1st  School  Committee  meeting  agenda  for  approval  regarding  the  winter  sports 
guidelines for CRLS remote learners.  
 
CPSD  began  its  Chromebook  distribution  on  November  17th,  following  the  backlog.  Requests  that 
come into ICTS are prepared for pickup at the mobile helpdesk on Felton St. by 8:00 AM the next day. 
Between  Tuesday,  November  17th-Thursday,  November  19th,  over  400  devices  were  distributed  to 
families. 
 
In  CPSD’s  most  recent  YTD  report  on  chronic  absenteeism,  we  see  that  there  are  more  students 
chronically absent in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 district-wide as well as in the elementary and 
upper schools. However, we see that a smaller percentage of currently active students at the high school 
are chronically absent compared to the previous two years. Please see the table below: 
 

 
As I announced last week, my Office and the WorkForce Program are continuing our partnership 
with Elevate Youth this winter to launch a virtual program for 4th, 5th, and 6th grade CPS students to 
stay connected and engage with interactive activities and challenges.  
 

•  Our goal is to promote outdoor education, movement, and wellness in the students we serve, 

while maintaining social connection through weekly check-ins.  

•  The fun, project-based curriculum will begin the week after Thanksgiving and will run until at 

 

least mid-February. 

•  Weekly themes will include: learning about wildlife in our neighborhoods, cooking and eating 
new and interesting foods, participating in group yoga and exercise classes, learning tips and 
tricks to get outside in the winter months, and much more!
