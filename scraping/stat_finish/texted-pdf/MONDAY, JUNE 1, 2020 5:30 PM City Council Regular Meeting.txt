OF TONIGHT'S VOTES WILL BE ROLL CALL.  NO SUBMISSION OF THE RECORD.  
WE'LL OPEN PUBLIC COMMENT.  AS I SAID, BASED ON THE SITUATION, 
COVID-19, WE'RE ASKING MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK THROUGH 
ZOOM.  SO, WE'LL START WITH SUE BUTLER.  AND EVERYONE WHO HAS 
SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR 
ADDRESS FOR THE RECORD.  AND THE ITEM YOU WILL SPEAK ON.  AND YOU 
WILL HAVE THREE MINUTES.  SUE, YOU CAN HEAR ME?  (SILENCE) IS BEN 
ROBERTS ON THE ZOOM?  BEN, ARE YOU THERE?  BEN, CAN YOU HEAR ME?   

(SILENCE).  

>> PARTICIPANT:  CAN YOU HEAR ME.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  GO AHEAD.  THREE MINUTES.  STATE YOUR NAME AND 
ADDRESS AND THE ITEM YOU SPEAK ON.  

>> I'M BEN ROBERTS.  LIVING IN THE HARVARD DORMS AND I SPEAK ON 
POLICY NUMBER 7.  ABOUT THE COURSE OF ACTION, IN TERMS OF WHAT THE 
CITY IS DOING FOR THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY IN CAMBRIDGE.  AND I JUST 
WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS.  AT THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS, THE CITY 
COUNCIL HEARD FROM THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY IN CAMBRIDGE AND 
THEY NEED HELP AND SHELTER AND NEED IT NOW.  ESPECIALLY IN THE 
PANDEMIC.  AND THIS NEW PROPOSAL IS TAKING ACTION TO PROTECT THE 
PEOPLE, IT IS ABANDONING THE COMMUNITY TO DISEASE AND RECKLESS 
SHELTER.  IF THIS WERE A COST-CUTTING MEASURE, IT ACTIVELY WOULD 
COST MORE TO FUND THE SHELTER IN THE WAY PROPOSED.  THAN IT WOULD 
TO RENT HOTEL ROOMS AND PURSUE A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WOULD 
PROTECT A HOMELESS PICTURE FROM MORE -- IN GENERAL, I DON'T HAVE 
MORE TO SAY THAN THAT.  WHETHER YOU WILL LOOK AT THIS IN TERMS OF 
HUMAN SUFFERING OR YOU WILL LOOK AT THIS IN TERMS OF JUST PURE 
COST, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE, FRANKLY.  TO PURSUE POLICY NUMBER 7.  
AND HARM THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY IN THIS WAY.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  I BELIEVE THAT WAS ON THE CITY MANAGER AGENDA 
ITEM NUMBER 7.  NOT POLICY ORDER NUMBER 7.  NEXT PERSON WHO 
SIGNED UP IS -- BEFORE WE GO TO THE NEXT PERSON, I KNOW THAT 
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN, COUNCILLOR CARLONE, AND COUNCILLOR 
SOBRINHO-WHEELER ARE NOW ON THE LINE.   

>> PARTICIPANT:  YES.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?  COUNCILLOR CARLONE?   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  YES, I AM.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR CARLONE, CAN YOU HEAR ME?   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  VERY WELL.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  WE'LL MOVE TO JOEL GREENBERG.  JOEL, ARE YOU ON 
THE LINE?   

(SILENCE) 

IS JOEL THERE.

>> PARTICIPANT:  CAN YOU HEAR ME?  I'M ALSO COMMENTING ON POLICY 
ORDER NUMBER 7.  ON HOUSING.  I'M SORRY.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  CITY MANAGER AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 7.   

>> PARTICIPANT:  THANK YOU FOR ASSEMBLING HERE.  I BELIEVE YOUR 
OBLIGATION IS TO KEEP THE CITIZENS SAFE AND ACCOUNTED FOR TO THE 
BEST OF YOUR ABILITY AS ALLOWED BY LAW.  I READ A LITTLE TODAY ONLINE 
COMMENTS FROM A NUMBER OF COUNCILLORS AND I COMMEND THOSE 
WHO HAVE BEEN OPEN TO CONSIDERING THE USE OF MOSTLY VACANT 
HOTELS AS HOUSING FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS.  ESPECIALLY AT A 
TIME WHERE WE NEED URGENT HOUSING FOR THESE FOLKS, IN PARTICULAR, 
CLEAN AND ISOLATED HOUSING TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS.   

AND YOUR CHOICE TO INADEQUATELY HOUSE HOMELESS FOLKS PUT ALL OF 
US AT FINANCIAL AND HEALTH RISK.  AND WE WOULD PREFER THAT YOU NOT 
PAY A PREMIUM FOR A WORST EXPERIENCE FOR THE FOLKS IN ORDER TO 
SAVE YOURSELF FROM WHATEVER SCRUTINY THAT MAY FOLLOW.  AND I 
RECOGNIZE THIS IS A REALLY HARD MOMENT, THIS IS A HARD JOB, BUT I 
BELIEVE ALL OF YOU KNOWINGLY SOUGHT ELECTION TO THE SEATS YOU 
HOLD.  PROMISING THAT YOU WOULD BE EQUAL TO THE TASK TO MAKE 
HARD CHOICES AT CRUCIAL TIMES LIKE THESE.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  THANK YOU.  COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN IS ON THE 
AUDIO BRIDGE WITH US TODAY.  NEXT PERSON WHO HAS SIGNED UP FOR 
PUBLIC COMMENT IS PIPER WINKLER.  ARE YOU THERE?   

>> PARTICIPANT:  YES.  YOU CAN HEAR ME.  GREAT.  I'M HERE TO COMMENT 
ON CITY MANAGER 7.  SO, ALONG WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE CALL HAVE 
BEEN TO AT LEAST TWO CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS ALREADY TO SPEAK ON THIS 
TOPIC.  A LOT OF US HAVE HEARD MEMBERS FROM THE HOMELESS 
COMMUNITY TALK ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THEY FACE WHILE LIVING ON THE 
STREETS AND IN MASS SHELTERS DURING THE PANDEMIC.  SOME DON'T HAVE 
ACCESS TO RUNNING WATER, THEY CAN'T RELY ON THE BASIC MEASURES OF 
SAFETY FROM EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS.  THE COVID-19 HAS OFFERED THE 
POWERFUL VOICES A CHANCE TO SHOW US WHICH SIDE THEY ARE ON.  
HARVARD AND MIT -- TRYING TO CREATE A SHELTER WHOSE ENVIRONMENT 
IS DANGEROUS.  WE TURN TO THE ELECTED COUNCILLORS FOR LEADERSHIP.  
IT IS EVIDENT THAT CONNECTING UNHOUSED RESIDENTS WITH HOTEL 
ACCOMMODATION WOULD HAVE BEEN VASTLY LESS EXPENSIVE IN 
COMPARISON TO THIS BILL.  CAMBRIDGE LEADERSHIP THAT THROWS 
AROUND THE PHASE, HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT, CAN BE EXPECTED HOW 
MUCH MORE SAFE, PLEASANT AND APPROPRIATE TO HUMAN NEEDS HOTEL 
ACCOMMODATIONS ARE COMPARED TO ACCOMMODATIONS AT WAR 
MEMORIAL.  I HAVE POSE THE SOLUTION SO FAR IN MULTIPLE CALLS.   

WHICH SIDE ARE WE ON AS THE CITY?  IT SEEMS WITH THE BILL SHOWING 
HOW THE CITY HAS THUS CHOSEN TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE MOST 
VULNERABLE POPULATION, MOST OF THE THOSE IN POWER ARE NOT ON THE 
SIDE OF THE POWER.  NO END TO THE PANDEMIC AND QUOTE TO "NORMAL" 
LIFE WILL ERASE THIS FROM THE MEMORY.  WE DON'T SEIZE TO FORMULATE

OPINION OF THEM ONCE PUBLIC COMMENT ENDS.  YOU FAIL US BECAUSE IN 
THIS COMMUNITY AN INJURY TO ONE IS AN INJURY TO ALL.   

PREVENTING OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH DECENT LIVABLE 
ACCOMMODATIONS, RATHER THAN TRYING TO CUT CORNERS, IS A STEP IN 
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  I HOPE YOU AGREE YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE 
HOUSING AND SECURE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT EVAPORATE 
WITH THE END OF THE VIRUS.  YOUR VOTERS CHOSE YOU BECAUSE OF THE 
VISION OF BETTER CAMBRIDGE OR OUT FUNDRAISE YOUR OPPONENT.  WE 
WISH YOU CONSIDER EQUITY.  THANKS.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  NEXT PERSON WHO SIGNED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT 
IS SAM.   

>> PARTICIPANT:  HELLO.  I'M SAM.  I'M COMMENTING ON CITY MANAGER 
AGENDA ITEM 7.  IT IS DISHEARTENING TO SEE THE UNSYMPATHETIC 
TREATMENT THE CITY HAS GIVEN IN TREATING ITS PEOPLE.  ENOUGH WITH 
THE ARE TALKS OF EMPATHY AND COMPASSION.  IT IS BEYOND ME HOW 
MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL CAN SAY THEY HAVE STRIVE TO A VALUE 
CELT OF SUPPORTING MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND THEN 
COMPLETELY DISREGARD ANY ACTION.  THE HOMELESS POPULATION HAVE 
NEEDED HELP FOR MONTHS, WHAT DO -- WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO TO GET 
CHANGE.  HOW LONG DO WE HAVE TO BEG YOU.  ASSISTING UNHOUSED 
RESIDENTS WITH HOTEL ACCOMMODATION WOULD BE LESS EXPENSIVE IN 
COMPARISON TO THE BILL.  THE LIVING CONDITION OF THE SHELTER ARE 
DISRESPECTFUL AND THE GESTURE YOU ARE PRESENTING WITH IT IS ONE OF 
UTTER CONTEMPT.  TREAT PEOPLE WITH DIGNITY THEY DESERVE AND PLEASE 
HOUSE THEM IN THE HOTELS.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.   

NEXT PERSON WE HAVE IS HEATHER HOFFMAN.  ARE YOU ON THE LINE?   

>>  YES, I AM.  HEATHER HOFFMAN, 213 HURLEY STREET.  AND FIRST, I 
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE PAYING FOR MEALS 
FOR PEOPLE.  THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM AND I'M GLAD TO SEE IT IS GOING 
TO CONTINUE AND I'M SORRY IT NEEDS TO.  WITH RESPECT TO COOLING 
CENTERS, YES, THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT.  AND I HOPE WE 
THINK ABOUT HOW MANY WAYS WE CAN SPREAD PLACES WHERE PEOPLE 
CAN COOL OFF THROUGHOUT THE CITY SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO FIGURE 
OUT HOW TO GET THERE.  REUSABLE BAGS.  EVEN THOUGH I'M NOW 
BUILDING A MARVELOUS RESERVOIR OF PLASTIC BAGS, I'LL BE PLEASED TO BE 
ABLE TO USE MY REUSABLE BAGS AGAIN.  I HOPE YOU CAN PERSUADE THE 
COMMONWEALTH TO DO THAT.   

WITH RESPECT TO THE TESTING KITS, I'M SORRY THAT THIS VERY GOOD IDEA 
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED MUCH EARLIER WHEN IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN EVEN OF MORE USE.  I'M GLAD IT HAS BEEN AND I HOPE THAT WE 
CONTINUE TO MAKE TESTING AS AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO 
WANT TO USE IT.   

WITH RESPECT TO HIRING AN OUTREACH WORKER.  I DON'T THINK THERE'S 
ANY QUESTION IN ANYONE'S MIND THAT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO 
MAKE THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS POLICING POWERS WORK BETTER FOR THE

PEOPLE.  AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE THE COMMEMORATIVE OCCASIONS 
ELSEWHERE ON THIS AGENDA, PRIDE MONTH.  JUNETEENTH, THEY ARE ALL 
INDICATIONS WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.  AND EVERYTHING WE CAN DO 
TO MAKE THE POLICING POWER OF OUR GOVERNMENT OPERATE IN A WAY 
THAT IS COLLABORATIVE AND WORKS WITH PEOPLE RATHER THAN IN A 
PUNITIVE WAY AND IN AN US VERSUS THEM WAY, WOULD MAKE OUR 
SOCIETY BETTER.  

AND THEN I HAVE COMMENTS ABOUT PUBLIC COMMENT.  NOT THAT IT IS AN 
ISSUE TODAY, FOR SEVERAL MEETINGS, YOU CLOSE IT BEFORE 6:00, WHICH I 
DO BELIEVE VIOLATES THE CITY COUNCIL'S RULES.  AND LAST THURSDAY'S 
MEETING, DIDN'T HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT.  I BELIEVE IF YOU READ THE 
CHARTER, YOU WILL SEE EVERY MEETING --  

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  HEATHER?  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.  IF YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO EMAIL THE REST OF THE COMMENTS, PLEASE DO.  NEXT 
PERSON WHO HAS SIGNED UP IS MIKE.  ARE YOU THERE?   

>> PARTICIPANT:  CAN YOU HEAR ME?  I'M LIVING IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY.  I 
WILL COMMENT ON CITY MANAGER ITEM NUMBER 7.  I'M VERY DISTURBED 
WITH THE CITY'S APPARENT LACK OF CONCERN FOR THE HOMELESS 
COMMUNITY.  I CAN ONLY CONCLUDE ARISES FROM THE REALITY THAT ITS 
POPULATION IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT VOTER CONSTITUENCY.  AND DOESN'T 
HOLD FINANCIAL POWER.  I LIKE TO URGE, RATHER THAN TRYING TO PACK 
THEM INTO A SHELTER LIKE ANIMALS, YOU HOUSE THEM IN HOTELS LIKE 
HUMAN BEINGS.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PANDEMIC.  FOR THEIR OWN 
SAFETY, BUT ALSO FOR THE WELL-BEING OF THE ENTIRE CITY.  AFTER THE 
CRISIS, WE SHOULD ALSO WORK TOWARD BUILDING PUBLIC HOUSING AND 
FUNDS CAN BE SECURED BY DEFUNDING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.  THANK 
YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  NEXT PERSON WHO SIGNED UP IS BRYCE.   

>> PARTICIPANT:  CAN YOU HEAR ME?  WE ARE AT A TIME WHEN IT IS CLEAR 
THE COUNTRY'S LEADERS HAVE NO INTENTION ON HELPING THE MOST 
VULNERABLE IN THE COUNTRY AND A TIME WE NEED IT TO HAPPEN.  SO, IT IS 
INSULTING THAT OUR PROGRESSIVE CITY COUNCIL WOULD RATHER DUMP 
MONEY INTO A HALF-MEASURE HOUSING SOLUTION.  THIS IS ABOUT ISSUE 
NUMBER 7.  THAT COULD EASILY BE MADE BETTER FOR CHEAPER USING 
LOCAL AREA HOTELS.  LOOK AROUND YOU, YOU ARE FAILING CITIZENS AS A 
PANDEMIC.  YOU HAVE VISUAL YOU HAVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE RENEW 
THE COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE, TOLERANCE AND EQUALITY.  
CONSIDER DOING BETTER ON THAT COMMITMENT OR WE'LL ALL BE THRILLED 
TO FIND REPRESENTATIVES THAT WILL.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  NEXT PERSON WHO IS JAMES COLEMAN.  ARE YOU ON 
THE LINE?   

>> PARTICIPANT:  YES.  I'M HERE.  THANK YOU.  I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A 
MOMENT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST 
OF AN UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC AND UNREST.  BEING ON THE STREETS AT 
NIGHT WITH POLICE AND USING BRUTALITY AGAINST CITIZENS, EVERY DAY

THE PEOPLE ARE LEFT ON THEIR OWN ON THE STREET, IT IS ANOTHER DAY 
THEIR LIVES ARE AT RISK.  OFFICIALS ARE WARNING US OF A SECOND WAVE 
OF CORONAVIRUS IN THE FALL AND THIS PLAN TO TEMPORARY HOUSE 
PEOPLE IN PACKED SHELTERS IS INSUFFICIENT.  IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO SEE 
THE CITY ACT THIS WAY.  WE HAVE THE FUNDS AND THE VACANT HOTEL 
ROOMS IN CITY, WE HAVE SEEN CITIES SUCCESSFULLY PROVIDE SHELTER AND 
SAFETY FOR THE HOMELESS IN THE VACANT HOTEL ROOM AND THIS -- THIS IS 
NOT A NEW OR RADICAL IDEA.  AND THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE CAN'T DO 
THE SAME.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  NEXT PERSON WHO SIGNED UP IS DYLAN GRIFFITH.  ARE 
YOU ON THE LINE?   

>> PARTICIPANT:  I'M HERE.  HELLO.  FORMER CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT.  I WILL 
SPEAK IN POLICY ORDER NUMBER 5.  I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE 
MAYOR AND THE CITY MANAGER, TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND TO COUNCILLOR 
TOOMEY FOR HELPING YOU WITH THIS INITIATIVE.  AS A CURRENT STUDENT, 
I'M PROUD OF THE RICH LEGACY OF SPORT, SERVICE, AND SACRIFICE.  WE 
CALL OURSELVES A FAMILY BECAUSE OF THE LOVE FOR ONE ANOTHER AND 
THE CARE AND SUPPORT WE OFFER TO THE COMMUNITIES.  WE AS STUDENTS 
COME FROM ALL DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH, NATION, AND 
WORLD.  A GREAT BLENDING OF CULTURE, BELIEFS, AND TRADITIONAL WILL 
CREATE A WELL-VERSED STUDENT BODY AND TAKE ON CHALLENGES THAT 
THE WORLD REQUIRES.  EVERY SCHOOL DAY, NOT DURING THE PANDEMIC, 
STUDENTS TAKE MULTIPLE BUSES AND TRAINS TO ARRIVE, EXCITED TO LEARN 
AND BECOME THE NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS.  LEADERS WHO ARE 
GOING TO BE TASKED WITH TACKLING ECONOMIC AND RACIAL INJUSTICE, 
CURING DISEASES AND LEAVING A HABITUAL WORLD.  AND AM IN SUPPORT 
OF POLICY ORDER 5, SET ON PROGRESS, CHANGE AND INCLUSION.  VALUES 
THAT WE ALL HOLD.  IT IS A MERELY A NAME AND IT IS A LEGACY FOR US.  
THANK YOU AND I ASK THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT POLICY ORDER NUMBER 5.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  NEXT PERSON IS JAMES WILLIAMSON.  HE IS NOT ON.  
ANYONE ELSE?  I WANTED TO CONFIRM.  THAT CONCLUDES -- COUNCILLOR 
ZONDERVAN?   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  THANK YOU.  I'M IN COMMUNICATION WITH 
MR. WILLIAMSON.  I BELIEVE HE IS TRYING TO SPEAK.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  SO.  THANK YOU.  WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT -- WE 
CAN'T SEE HIM ON THE ZOOM CURRENTLY.  MR. CLERK?   

>> MR. CLERK:  I DON'T SEE HIM IN ZOOM.  MY UNDERSTANDING IS, AT ONE 
POINT, HIS NAME WAS IN THE ZOOM, AND NOW HE DOESN'T APPEAR.   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  HE SAYS THE MEETING ROOM IS NOT LETTING 
HIM IN.   

>> MR. CLERK:  THERE IS NO WAITING ROOM.

PILOT TESTING PROGRAM SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DID TO THE PORT TO NORTH 
CAMBRIDGE.  AND I'M PROUD OF THE CITY -- I WANT TO THANK CLAUDE, THE 
ENTIRE TEAM, AND THE CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE I WOULD SAY THERE IS NO 
CITY WHO HAD MORE TEST SITES AVAILABLE THAN CAMBRIDGE RIGHT NOW.  

YESTERDAY, WAS THE SECOND SUNDAY THAT THE RIVERBEND CLOSURE OF 
MEMORIAL DRIVE WAS IN PLACE.  I WAS DOWN THERE, SAW THE VICE 
MAYOR.  IT WAS SUCCESSFUL AND I CALLED DCR TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT 
ENDING THE PILOT, RESUMING THE ROLL SCHEDULE AND TALKING ABOUT 
POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL TIMES THAT MAY WORK.  WE'LL TALK TO THE HEALTH 
DEPARTMENT ABOUT THAT AS WELL.  SO FAR SO GOOD.  AND I THANK THE 
RESIDENTS FOR CONTINUING TO WORK HARD TO AGREE WITH THE PUBLIC 
HEALTH ADVISORIES.  AS WE BEGUN TO REOPEN THE ECONOMY, WE'LL WORK 
HARD TO COMPLY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES.  I THINK WEARING 
THE FACE MASKS HAS BEEN SUCCESS AND THANK YOU.  AS YOU HEARD LAST 
THURSDAY, THE CITY IS CREATING SEVERAL SHARED STREETS.  DURING THE 
PRESENTATION TO THE COUNCIL, JOE LAID OUT A VISION OF THE PROGRAM 
AND HOPING TO MOVE FORWARD QUICKLY.  AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT 
TO CLEARLY STATE, DURING THE PRESENTATION LAST WEEK, WE CLEARLY 
STATED BEFORE WE PROCEED, WE'LL BE SEEKING PUBLIC INPUT INTO THIS 
PROCESS AND PLAN.  BUT WE ARE PLANNING TO DO THIS IN AN EXPEDIENT 
WAY.  THERE WILL BE TIME FOR DISCUSSION. 

AND FINALLY, YOU ARE HEARING AN OVERVIEW TO REOPEN THE BUILDING TO 
ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES TO THE PUBLIC.  TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE 
THREE-PRIORITY BUILDING.  CITY HALL, CITY HALL ANNEX AND THE 
LOMBARDI.  IT WAS OPEN WITH LIMITED CAPACITY.  I THANK ALL EMPLOYEES 
WHO CAME IN ALL THREE BUILDINGS TODAY.  IT WAS A SUCCESSFUL DAY.  
THE WORK LET UP BY PUBLIC WORKS COMMISSIONER TO GET US IN THE 
RIGHT POSITION.  LISA AND HER TEAM HAVE PAID OFF TO A SUCCESSFUL DAY 
AND THANK THE BUILDING CHAIRS FOR WORKING WITH THE STAFF AND 
LETTING THEM KNOW THEIR NEEDS ARE BEING MET AND THEIR CONCERNS. 

WE'LL CONTINUE THAT PROCESS.  WE'LL CONTINUE TO BRING BACK STAFF, 
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT OTHER BUILDINGS AND LISA CAN GET INTO 
THAT.  BEFORE WE BRING IN THE PUBLIC, WE'LL PROBABLY START WITH 
APPOINTMENTS ONLY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THIS DONE IN THE WAY WE 
FEEL IS SAFE FOR EMPLOYEES AND RESIDENTS.   

THE CITY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO OUR RESIDENTS.  WE 
ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC TO USE THE CITY VIRTUALLY WHEN POSSIBLE, WE'LL 
OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO DO TRANSACTIONS IN PERSON IN THE 
UPCOMING WEEKS.  AS I SAID, BUT NOW ALL PHONES IN THE THREE 
BUILDINGS SHOULD BE PICKED UP AND WE CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS 
QUICKLY.  AND BEFORE I TURN IT OVER, I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY TALK 
ABOUT THE FIRE THAT HAPPENED ON SUNDAY NIGHT.   

IT WAS A THREE-ALARM FIRE.  STARTED ABOUT 2:30 IN THE MORNING.  I 
THINK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS CALLED ME ABOUT 2:45.  SHE HAD A CLEAR 
VIEW OF IT.  AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A THREE-ALARM FIRE.  I WANT TO 
THANK THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED TO THAT ONE

BUILDING.  THERE WAS NO INJURIES FROM THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE 
BUILDING.  AND THERE WERE TWO FIRE FIGHTERS WHO WERE TRANSPORTED 
TO AREA HOSPITALS WITH MINOR INJURIES.  BUT THE ONE THING I SAY, THAT 
I HAD THE MISFORTUNE, YET OPPORTUNITY TO SEE, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT 
IN ACTION.  AND THEIR ABILITY TO CONTAIN A FIRE TO JUST THE BUILDING 
THAT IS PRIMARILY STARTED WITH IS AMAZING.  THIS WAS ANOTHER 
EXAMPLE OF THAT.  ONE THING WE DO THAT I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE 
DON'T SEE OR REALIZE IS, WE ARE INCREDIBLE AT PUTTING OUT FIRES.  THE 
CITY IS ALSO GOOD AT THEN HELPING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED BY 
THE FIRE.  AND BY 8:00 SUNDAY MORNING, WE HAD SET UP A SHELTER, THE 
FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS WORKING WITH, WE HAD RED CROSS THERE.  
MAURA, FROM THE MANAGER'S OFFICE WAS THERE AND WE WERE ABLE TO 
HELP THE RESIDENTS, THE BUILDING AT 213 HARVARD AT EIGHT UNITS.  19 
ADULTS, TWO OF WHICH WERE AWAY.  SO 15.  -- SO 17.  AND THREE YOUNG 
PEOPLE IN THERE.  AT THIS POINT WORKING WITH MAURA AND RED CROSS, 
WE BELIEVE MOST ARE ALL SET.  THERE ARE A FAMILY OF TWO WE ARE 
WORKING ON IN THE BUILDING.  IT WAS REALLY IMPRESSED TO SEE 
EVERYBODY WORK MULTIPLE SERVICE CENTER AND THE HOUSING NEED 
FROM THE CITY.  QUICKLY GOT FIRE FUND APPLICATIONS COMPLETED TO 
HELP THE PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE FIRE.  

THERE WERE TWO UNITS IN THE BUILDING BESIDE IT.  217 THAT SUFFERED 
WATER DAMAGE.  WE ARE WORKING WITH THE RESIDENTS OF THOSE 
BUILDINGS.  THEY ARE TWO TWO-FAMILY ADULTS WITH HAVING DOGS AND 
CATS AND TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM.  THEY ARE BEING TEMPORARILY 
PLACED AND LOOKING AT SHORT-TERM OPTIONS.  AND I WANT TO THANK 
THE INSPECTIONAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT, BECAUSE THE BUILDING WAS IN 
ROUGH SHAPE.  AND QUICKLY, ON SUNDAY MORNING, WE WERE ABLE TO 
GET THEM TO COME DOWN AND DETERMINE IF THE BUILDING NEEDS TO BE 
TAKEN DOWN AND WE STARTED THAT PROCESS TODAY.  JUST WANTED TO 
THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON SUNDAY.  AND SAW THE 
MAYOR DOWN THERE AS WELL.   

I THINK AS ALWAYS, WHEN IT COMES TO HELPS RESIDENTS IN A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION, JUST A REALLY GOOD JOB BY OUR EMPLOYEES.  WITH THAT, I 
WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE PERSON WHO USUALLY STARTS OFF, 
COMMISSIONER BARD.   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  THANK YOU.  SO, I WILL START OFF TALKING 
ABOUT THE EVENTS IN BOSTON YESTERDAY.  AS YOU KNOW, PEACEFUL 
PROTEST IN BOSTON TURNED VIOLENT AND RIOTIST CAUSING BOSTON PD TO 
CALL FOR AID.  WE RESPONDED TO THAT CALL OF AID BY SENDING 26 
CAMBRIDGE POLICE OFFICERS INTO BOSTON.  CAMBRIDGE OFFICERS WERE 
USED TO SECURE VANDALIZED, BUT EMPTY RETAIL LOCATIONS AND RETURN 
TO THE CITY AT 4:00 A.M. NO CPD OFFICER REPORTED HAVING TO USE FORCE.  
RELATED TO THAT PROCESS, ABOUT 3:00 A.M. WE RESPONDED TO AN ALARM 
AT BEST BUY.  WE FOUND INDIVIDUALS REMOVING ITEMS FROM THE STORE.  
AND THE INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT TO A VEHICLE, FULLY AND 
ALLUDE CAPTURE.  AND WE ARE WORKING ON THAT INVESTIGATION.

INVESTIGATION.  WE HOPE THE PROTEST TONIGHT WILL RETURN TO 
PEACEFUL, BUT WE ARE REPAIRED FOR UNREST.  

BECAUSE OF THE UNREST GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AND BECAUSE OF THE 
INCIDENT WITH THE KILLING OF MR. FLOYD, WE HAVE BEEN GETTING 
REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR USE OF FORCE POLICIES.  
PARTICULARLY, IF WE PERMIT THE USE OF CHOKE-HOLDS AND I WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THE BODY KNOWS, CHOKE-HOLDS AND ANY TYPE OF 
CONTROL HOLDS ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED.  AND OUR POLICIES ARE 
AVAILABLE ON OUR HOME PAGE.  CAMBRIDGE POLICE AND ON THE RIGHT 
SIDE OF THE PAGE, YOU CAN SEE A LINK THAT SAYS "POLICIES."  ALL 400 
SERIES IS THE USE OF FORCE POLICIES.  I WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY 
KNEW WE EXPLICITLY BAN CHOKE-HOLDS.   

WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A DWINDLING SUPPLY OF MASKS TO GIVE AWAY.  
ONCE AGAIN, VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE HAS BEEN VERY GOOD IN THE CITY.  
AND WE HAVE BEEN GETTING MORE CALLS FOR LACK OF SOCIAL DISTANCING 
THAN WE HAVE RECEIVED FOR PEOPLE NOT WEARING MASKS.  NOT SAYING IT 
IS NOT HAPPENING, BUT WE ARE GETTING MORE CALLS FOR SOCIAL 
DISTANCING ISSUES.  THE MANAGER TOUCHED ON MEMORIAL DRIVE AND 
THE SECOND WEEK.  I WILL SKIP PASS THAT, BUT WILL SAY IT WAS 
UNEVENTFUL AND MOST INDIVIDUALS WERE COMPLIANT.  THE WAR 
MEMORIAL CONTINUES TO OPERATE AS BEST WE CAN EXPECT IT TO.  

THE SHELTER IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY OPERATION RUNNING AT THE WAR 
MEMORIAL COMPLEX.  PRIVATE SECURITY IS STILL PRESENT ON THE 
FULL-TIME BASIS.  AND THERE'S ONLY BEEN A FEW MINOR INCIDENTS.  WE 
CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN AN INCREASED PRESENCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.  
AND WE CONTINUE TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO DEALING 
WITH OUR HOMELESS POPULATIONS AND ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
SEEING INCREASE CONCERN ABOUT IN BOTH HARVARD AND CENTRAL 
SQUARE.  THAT COMPLETES ME UPDATE.   

>> CITY MANAGER:  THANK YOU.  BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO JOE TO GIVE A 
BRIEF UPDATE ON SHARED STREETS HE HAD IN THE PRESENTATION ON 
THURSDAY, I WOULD WANT TO UPDATE THE COUNCIL.  AS I SAID ON SUNDAY, 
WE TOOK SOME FIRE FUND APPLICATIONS FROM THE TENANTS IN THE 
BUILDINGS AND ELLEN JUST TEXTED TO SAY, WE HAVE ALREADY PUT THE 
PAYMENT REQUEST IN FOR 12 OF THE TENANTS AND THEY WILL GET A CHECK 
THIS WEEK.  THE CITY TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  JOE, 
I TURN IT OVER TO YOU.  

>> JOE:  THANK YOU.  OBVIOUSLY, I PRESENTED ON THIS LAST THURSDAY, SO I 
WON'T GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL.  IT SEEMS LIKE THERE COULD BE A FEW 
MORE PEOPLE WATCHING TONIGHT.  AND THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED TIME, 
BUT TO GIVE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT I PRESENTED LAST WEEK AND 
REEMPHASIZE A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT THE CITY MANAGER HAD 
MENTIONED.   

I WILL START WITH A VERY QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE PLAN FOR WHAT WE 
ARE PROPOSING TO DO IN THE SHORT-TERM, AND THEN A COUPLE OF

THOUGHTS ON THE THINGS THAT WILL COME LATER.  SO, OUR INITIAL 
IMPLEMENTATION OF SHARED STREETS, WILL COVER THREE STREETS.  THEY 
WILL PROVIDE A NETWORK COVERING DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE CITY.  
AND THEN WE'LL BUILD ON THAT IN THE FUTURE.  THE THREE STREETS WE 
LOOK AT ARE GARDEN STREET, WITH SOME EXTENSIONS.  GARDEN STREET, 
ALMOST THE ENTIRE LENGTH FROM CONCORD AVENUE OUT TO WHERE IT 
BECOMES FIELD STREET.  AND CONTINUING ALONG FIELD STREET AND BAY 
STATE ROAD TO NEW STREET.  AND CONTINUE ALONG WHAT IS USUALLY 
REFERRED TO AS LITTLE CONCORD AVENUE, CONNECTING TO THE 
CAMBRIDGE COMMON.  AND THE SECOND STREET IS HARVARD STREET FOR 
THE ENTIRE LENGTH FROM QUINCY STREET TO PORT LAND STREET.  AND THE 
THIRD STREET IS MAGAZINE STREET, PRETTY MUCH FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH 
FROM GREEN STREET DOWN TO MEMORIAL DRIVE.   

AND AGAIN, THESE ARE SELECTED TO PROVIDE SAFE ROUTES FOR PEOPLE 
WITH WALKING AND CYCLING IN TERMS OF TRAVELLING ON THE STREET AS A 
CYCLIST AND A PEDESTRIAN WHO IS LOOKING TO CREATE PHYSICAL DISTANCE 
AND PROVIDING SPACE TO WALK INTO THE STREET AS NECESSARY IN ORDER 
TO HAVE MORE SPACE TO WALK IN.  TO BE CLEAR, THE STREETS -- TWO 
THINGS I WANT TO BE CLEAR.  THE STREETS WON'T BE CLOSED.  THEY WILL BE 
AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL ACCESS, WHETHER THAT IS FOR RESIDENTS OR 
BUSINESSES.  WE HAVE CONCERNS FROM SOME OF THE LOCAL BUSINESSES 
ABOUT ACCESS TO THEIR FACILITIES AND THOSE WILL BE MAINTAINED AND 
WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THOSE BUSINESSES TO DO THINGS LIKE 
ADJUST LOCATIONS OF SIGNS OR ADD ADDITIONAL SIGNAGE INDICATING 
THAT BUSINESSES ARE OPEN.  THIS IS SOMETIMES DONE WITH 
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.  

WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT CLOSING THE STREETS TO THAT TYPE OF ACCESS.  
EMERGENCY VEHICLES, TRASH COLLECTION, RECYCLING.  ALL OF THE 
NECESSARY USES OF THE STREET WILL BE ALLOWED AND THE INTENT IS TO 
ALLOW MORE SPACE TO OPERATE AND DISCOURAGE CARS THAT MAY TRAVEL 
THE ENTIRE LENGTH FROM DOING SO AND SUGGEST TO THEM THEY CAN 
FIND ALTERNATE ROUTES.  ONE THING I DIDN'T MENTION LAST WEEK, WE 
ARE INTENDING TO HAVE DETOUR ROUTE SIGNS AT EACH LOCATION WHERE 
THERE IS LOCAL ACCESS-ONLY SIGNS.  IT WILL TELL PEOPLE, FOR EXAMPLE, ON 
HARVARD STREET, USE BROADWAY INSTEAD.  THOSE THINGS.  WE'RE NOT 
ONLY TELLING PEOPLE DON'T USE THE STREET, BUT WE ARE DIRECTING THEM 
TO ANOTHER POTENTIAL ROUTE.  AND WE ARE HOPEFUL BETWEEN THE 
INCONVENIENCE OF GOING AROUND THE DIFFERENT SIGNS AND BARRICADES 
AND THE INDICATION TO GO ELSEWHERE, THAT WILL DISCOURAGE PEOPLE 
TO USE THEM.  THEY ARE NOT CLOSED AND PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS AS 
NECESSARY TO MAKE SURE THE LOCAL RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AND 
OTHER USES ARE ACCOMMODATED. 

THOSE ARE THE THREE STREETS WE START WITH.  THE INTENT AS 
MENTIONED, LAST THURSDAY, TO GET THEM IN PLACE THE WEEK OF JUNE 
15TH.  TWO WEEKS FROM NOW.  THAT DOES PROVIDE SOME OPPORTUNITY.  
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT, NOT A LONG ONE, BUT SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR

INPUT.  TWEAKS AND MODIFICATIONS IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT OF SIGNS 
AND OTHER CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE WITHOUT FUNDAMENTALLY 
CHANGING THE PLAN.  TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF LOCAL RESIDENTS 
AND BUSINESSES AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT MAY COME UP.  THERE IS NOW A 
WEBSITE THAT PEOPLE CAN GO TO, WHICH HAS MORE INFORMATION AND 
SOME ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED 
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.  

AND IT HAS A FEEDBACK FORM AS WELL AS LINK TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND 
THE PHONE NUMBER.  AS OF TOMORROW, WE'LL BE ANSWERING LIVE WITH 
STAFF TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO US.  AND WE'LL LOOK FOR OTHER MEANS 
TO PROVIDE FOR OR TO GATHER FEEDBACK.  SO, WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY 
TO WORK WITH ANY LOCAL ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS ASSOCIATION, ANY 
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THAT WOULD LIKE INFORMATION SENT OUT OR 
FORWARD ALONG THE WEBSITE.  SO, WE CAN GET THAT FEEDBACK.  WE ARE 
OBVIOUSLY SOMEWHAT CONSTRAINED AT THIS MOMENT IN TERMS OF THE 
OUTREACH WE CAN DO AND TYPICALLY DO, BUT WE WANT TO GET THE 
WORD OUT IN ADVANCE OF THESE CHANGES GOING INTO AFFECT.  AND 
BASED ON THE EMAILS I HAVE RECEIVED, THERE IS INCREASING COMMUNITY 
AWARENESS OUT THERE.  THAT'S BEEN HELPFUL, EVEN IF SOME OF THE 
QUESTIONS HAVE TURNED OUT TO NOT BE AS CONCERNING.  WE ARE HAPPY 
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND CLARIFY WHAT WE'RE THINKING AND DOING.  

QUICKLY, WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NEXT, AS I MENTIONED LAST WEEK, WE 
LOOK FOR FEEDBACK ON LOCATIONS THAT THE COMMUNITY THINKS MAKES 
SENSE FOR ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS LIKE THIS.  WE ARE LOOKING AT 
EXPANDING SIDEWALK SPACE IN KEY LOCATIONS AS NECESSARY.  FOR 
PHYSICAL DISTANCING REASON.  AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE CONTINUE TO 
WORK WITH THE LOCAL BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS, LOCAL BUSINESSES TO 
START TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR NEEDS AND WE HAD MULTIPLE MEETINGS, 
INCLUDING ONE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO 
TO HELP RESTAURANTS AS THEY REOPEN.  PARTICULARLY, SINCE THEY ARE 
ONLY ALLOWED TO DO OUTDOOR DINING.  AND THE GOVERNOR RELEASE 
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND GUIDANCE FROM THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES IN 
TERMS OF HOW THAT CAN HAPPEN.  WE ARE MEETING REGULARLY TO TALK 
IT THROUGH AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE THAT WORK FOR THOSE 
LOCAL BUSINESSES.  WE WANT TO PROVIDE THEM WITH AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY 
AS WE CAN FOLLOWING ALL THE LOCAL AND STATE REGULATIONS TO ALLOW 
THEM TO REOPEN AND BEGIN TO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN-PERSON AGAIN. 

WE ARE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL 
BUSINESSES AND AGAIN, TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE WITH THEIR 
COMMUTES, WHETHER BY BUS OR STARTING TO LOOK AT WAYS TO PROVIDE 
BETTER -- ADDITIONAL BUS LANES OR BUS FACILITIES AS WELL AS 
POTENTIALLY ADDITIONAL BICYCLE LANES.  THAT'S JUST A QUICK SUMMARY 
OF WHERE WE'RE AT.  AND SOME ISSUES I WANT TO CLARIFY.  THANK YOU.  

>> CITY MANAGER:  THANK YOU.  NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA PETERSON.  AND I 
CAN TELL YOU THAT HOW WE WERE GOING TO BRING OUR EMPLOYEES BACK 
TO WORK, HOW WE ARE GOING TO OPEN THE BUILDINGS, HOW WE'RE

GOING TO MEET THE GUIDELINES THAT REALLY GAVE THEM THE PROTECTION 
THEY NEEDED, HOW WE WERE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE PROVIDE SERVICES 
TO THE RESIDENTS IN DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT THE 
OLD-FASHIONED WAY BY HAVING THEM COME INTO THE BUILDING.  IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT HAS TAKEN A LOT OF TIME AND WORK AND LISA IS THE 
POINT PERSON.  AND I CAN'T THANK HER AND HER TEAM ENOUGH.  I HAVE 
PROBABLY SPENT, GOING OVER DOCUMENTS, THEY DID ALL THE WORK TO 
PUT IN PLACE, 15-20 HOURS IN THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF.  I CAN'T IMAGINE 
ALL THE WORK THEY HAVE PUT IN TO GET THE DOCUMENTS TO ME.  AND WE 
HAVE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY.  WE STILL DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.  
THERE ARE ITEMS WE ARE DISCUSSING AND WE MEET ABOUT TWO HOURS 
EVERY DAY, INCLUDING SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.  SO WE CAN GET THIS DONE 
IN THE RIGHT WAY AND MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES ARE AWARE AND NO 
SURPRISES.  WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS.  TODAY WAS THE FIRST 
OPENING BACK OF THOSE THREE BUILDINGS AND I WILL REPEAT AS I HAVE 
SAID, OUR BUILDINGS WERE CLOSED, BUT OUR EMPLOYEES IN A LOT OF THE 
BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN COMING IN REGULARLY.  WE HAVE BEEN CAREFUL 
ABOUT THE SIX-FOOT RULE AND MADE SURE WE ARE NOT OVER THE 25%.  

IN TERMS OF BEING IN THIS BUILDING, ESPECIALLY, I CAN'T THANK ALL THE 
EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN COMING IN REGULARLY FOR THE LAST 9-10 
WEEKS.  AGAIN, OUR STAFF AND THE TEAM AND THE CITY IS INCREDIBLE.  I 
WANT TO THANK THE EMPLOYEES WHO CAME BACK TODAY AND IS BACK IN 
THIS BUILDING AND WORKING OUTSIDE, ESPECIALLY THE PUBLIC SAFETY.  
AND THE PUBLIC WORKS.  I WILL TURN IT OVER TO LISA, AND IT IS NOT 
FINALIZED, BUT WE GET THERE.  LISA, THANK AND YOU I'M TURNING IT OVER 
TO YOU.  

>> LISA:  GOOD EVENING.  I WANT TO CONFIRM YOU CAN HEAR ME?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  YES.  

>> LISA:  GREAT.  FIRST, I WANT TO ADD MY THANKS TO OUR EMPLOYEES 
WHO DURING A TIME OF SIGNIFICANT ANXIETY AND ISOLATION, HAVE 
WORKED IN THE FIELD AND HAVE WORKED VIRTUALLY TO DELIVER OUR 
SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITIES.  AND TO THE STAFF WHO HAVE REALLY 
CONTINUALLY WORK TO DELIVER SERVICES IN NEW AND EFFECTIVE WAYS.  I 
ALSO WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WHO HAVE WORKED 
WITH ME ON THIS.  THE RETURN TO WORK SITE, EXPANDING CITY SERVICES 
COMMITTEE, WE CALL OURSELVES AND IN PARTICULAR JENNIFER 
MATTHEWS, WHO HAS BEEN SUPPORTING ALL OF THE EFFORTS.  I ALSO 
WANT TO THANK SHEILA -- WHO HAS LED A TEAM ON WORKPLACE POLICIES 
AND OTHERS WHO WORK WITH OTHERS IN DPW THROUGHOUT THE CITY 
AND THE PHYSICAL SPACES AND ENHANCE SAFETY AND HYGIENE POLICIES. 

ALSO, ON THE COMMITTEE, WHO I REALLY WANT TO THANK ARE ELLEN, JOE, 
DAVID, LEE, AND WE ALSO AS THE MANAGER SAID, WORKED VERY CLOSELY 
WITH THE MANAGER, BUT WITH NANCY, OUR CITY SOLICITOR AND WITH 
CLAUDE JACOB.  IT ALL HAS BEEN VERY WELL-INFORMED.  OUR PROCESS ALSO 
INCLUDED DISCUSSION, REVIEW OF BEST PRACTICES AND GUIDANCE 
DOCUMENTS.  AND INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US FROM ALL OF

THE DEPARTMENT HEADS.  WE HAD DONE A SURVEY AND REALLY SOLICITED A 
LOT OF INFORMATION.   

THE GOALS OF THE WORK, SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY RESUME CITY SERVICES 
AT CITY BUILDINGS AND WORK SITES IN A LIMITED CAPACITY WHILE 
MAINTAINING AND STRENGTHENING REMOTE SERVICES.  IMPLEMENT THE 
COMMONWEALTH'S MANDATORY WORKPLACE SAFETY STANDARDS AND 
SECTOR-SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS FOR OFFICES, WHICH WERE ISSUED BY THE 
COMMONWEALTH ON MAY 18TH.  AND THEN ENSURE THAT ALL PHYSICAL 
SPACE AND OPERATIONAL DECISIONS ARE INFORMED BY PUBLIC HEALTH 
DATA AND GUIDANCE.  AND OF COURSE, AND MAKE SURE WE SUPPORT THE 
CITY EMPLOYEES.  

THE CITY IS SLOWLY INCREMENTALLY AND SAFELY ASKING OUR EMPLOYEES 
TO RETURN TO CITY OFFICES SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CITY 
SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC.  AS THE MANAGER HAS SAID, STARTING TODAY, 
JUNE 1, ADDITIONAL CITY EMPLOYEES HAVE RETURNED TO CITY HALL, THE 
LOMBARDI BUILDING AND CITY HALL ANNEX AT BROADWAY AND HAVE 
JOINED THE MANY STAFF WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD AND ON SITE 
THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC.  

AS THE STATE AND CITY OPENS TO MORE SERVICES, WE DO THIS WITH THE 
SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND EMPLOYEE'S HEALTH BEING PARAMOUNT.  PLANS 
AND PROTOCOLS ARE APPROVED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.  
THE FOUNDATION OF PLANNING FOR EMPLOYEES RETURNING IS BASED ON 
THE MASSACHUSETTS SAFETY STANDARDS FOR OFFICES THAT WERE 
RELEASED BY THE GOVERNOR ON MAY 18.  AND THERE ARE FOUR STANDARDS 
AND WE HAVE MET THEM.  I WANT TO REVIEW THEM BRIEFLY AND THEN WE 
CAN TALK ABOUT THEM IN MORE DETAIL, IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS. 

THE FOUR STANDARDS.  FIRST IS SOCIAL DISTANCING.  ALL PERSONS, 
EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS NEED TO REMAIN SIX FEET APART.  
ESTABLISHES PROTOCOLS TO ENSURE EMPLOYEES CAN PRACTICE SOCIAL 
DISTANCING.  AND PROVIDE SIGNAGE FOR SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCING.  AND 
REQUIRING FACE COVERINGS OR MASK FOR ALL EMPLOYEES.  AND THE 
SECOND STANDARD IS WITH REGARD TO HYGIENE PROTOCOLS.  PROVIDING 
HAND-WASHING CAPABILITIES IN THE WORKPLACE, ENSURING FREQUENT 
HANDWASHING BY EMPLOYEES AND ADEQUATE SUPPLIES.  PROVIDE 
REGULAR SANITATION OF HIGH-TOUCH AREAS, SUCH AS WORKSTATIONS, 
RESTROOMS, ET CETERA.  AND THE THIRD STANDARD HAS TO DO WITH 
STAFFING AND OPERATIONS.  PROVIDE TRAINING FOR EMPLOYEES 
REGARDING THE SOCIAL DISTANCING AND HYGIENE PROTOCOLS.  WE PUT 
TOGETHER A DETAIL TRAINING GUIDE AND VIDEOS THAT HAVE BEEN 
PRODUCED.  

AND EMPLOYEES WHO ARE DISPLAYING COVID-19-LIKE SYSTEMS DO NOT 
REPORT TO WORK.  IMPORTANT TO HAVE POLICIES ON THAT AND ESTABLISH 
A PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES GETTING ILL FROM COVID-19 AT WORK AND A 
RETURN TO WORK PLAN.  AND THE FOURTH STANDARD STATES -- THIS IS 
CLEANING AND DISINFECTING.  ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN CLEANING 
PROTOCOLS SPECIFIC TO OUR OFFICES WHEN AN ACTIVE EMPLOYEE IS

DIAGNOSED WITH COVID-19, CLEANING AND DISINFECTING MUST BE 
PERFORMED.  AND THE DISINFECTION OF ALL COMMON SURFACES MUST 
TAKE PLACE TO SAID WORKPLACE.  AND THAT IS A LOT OF WORK THAT I JUST 
MENTIONED THAT IS INVOLVED IN THAT AND HAS REQUIRED A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT OF EFFORT.  AGAIN, IF THERE ARE ANY DETAILS YOU WANT, WE CAN 
TALK MORE.  

I WILL SWITCH NEXT TO DESCRIBING THE EMPLOYEE AND PERSONNEL 
POLICIES AND PROTOCOLS THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED.  AND I'LL DO THEM IN 
ORDER.  THE FIRST IS A SELF-SCREENING CHECKLIST.  EACH EMPLOYEE, EVERY 
DAY, NEEDS TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS FOR THEMSELVES.  AND IF THEY 
ANSWER YES TO ANY QUESTION, ANY OF THE THREE QUESTIONS, WE ARE 
REQUIRE THE EMPLOYEE NOT REPORT TO WORK AND NOTIFY THE 
SUPERVISOR.  QUESTION ONE:  HAVE YOU HAD FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS.  FEVER?  
MEASURE TEMPERATURE ABOVE 100.3.  COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH IN 
48 HOURS.  CLOSE CONTACT WITH AN INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSED WITH 
COVID-19 OR EXHIBITING FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS IN THE LAST 48 HOURS.  OR 
HAVE HAD UNPROTECTED DIRECT CONTACT WITH SECRETIONS OR 
EXCRETIONS OF A PERSON WITH CONFIRMED COVID-19.  AND ARE YOU 
CURRENTLY UNDER ANY INSTRUCTION OR REQUESTS TO SELF-ISOLATE OR 
QUARANTINE BY YOUR DOCTOR OR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL.  IF ANY 
OF THE QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED YES, THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD STAY 
HOME AND WE ARE PUBLICIZING THAT INFORMATION REGULARLY. 

AND THE SECOND THING I WANT TO MENTION THAT THE CITY ESTABLISHED 
PROTOCOLS FOR EMPLOYEES WITH COVID-19 SYMPTOMS, POSITIVE TEST 
RESULTS, AND/OR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE.  NONPUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL 
SINCE PUBLIC SAFETY HAS A DIFFERENT PROTOCOL.  THIS POLICY DESCRIBES 
STEPS FOR SYSTEMATIC EMPLOYEES FOR -- SYMPTOMATIC, I'M SORRY, FOR 
SICK EMPLOYEES WHO TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 AND FOR FELLOW 
EMPLOYEES WHO MAY HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE 
EMPLOYEES.  THIS INVOLVES PROTOCOLS FOR CONTACT TRACING, WHICH 
THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH UNDERTAKES FOR THE CITY.  AND THE 
CITY HAS ALSO ISSUED A CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TEMPORARY POLICY ON 
COVID-19-RELATED EMPLOYEE ABSENCES.   

THIS RECOGNIZES AND INCORPORATES THE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL 
FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE ACT.  THIS APPLIES TO ALL 
EMPLOYEES, WHO ARE UNABLE TO WORK OR UNABLE TO TELEWORK.  THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF BENEFIT IN THE 
FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCES.  ONE:  AN EMPLOYEE IS SUBJECT TO A 
FEDERAL, STATE, OR LOCAL QUARANTINE OR ISOLATION ORDER OR HAS BEEN 
ADVISED BY A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER TO SELF-QUARANTINE RELATED TO 
COVID-19.  AND THE EMPLOYEE IS EXPERIENCING COVID-19 SYMPTOMS AND 
SEEKS A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS.  AND THE EMPLOYEE IS CARING FOR AN 
INDIVIDUAL WHO IS UNDER AN ISOLATION ORDER UNDER COVID-19 OR IS 
ADVISED TO SELF-QUARANTINE.  AND THE EMPLOYEE IS CARING FOR HIS/HER 
CHILD, WHOSE SCHOOL OR PLACE OF CARE IS CLOSED OR CHILDCARE 
PROVIDER IS UNAVAILABLE DUE TO COVID-19 CONCERNS.  OR IS

EXPERIENCING ANY OTHER SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR CONDITION AS SPECIFIED 
BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN 
SPECIFIED YET.   

AGAIN, THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.  THE CITY'S POLICY, WHICH WE HAVE 
ADOPTED, BUT IS MORE GENEROUS THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE LAW.  
FOR THE FIRST TWO WEEKS, THE CITY PROVIDES FULL PAY AND OTHER 
CIRCUMSTANCES, COVERED UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE, THE 
CHILDCARE DURING SCHOOL OR CHILDCARE CLOSURES, THE CITY'S POLICY 
PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL TEN WEEKS OF PAY AT 2/3 OF EMPLOYEE REGULAR 
PAY.  SO, AGAIN, THIS IS FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE UNABLE TO COME TO 
WORK OR ARE UNABLE TO WORK REMOTELY.  AND I WILL SAY THAT FOR 
PEOPLE THAT ARE UNABLE TO DO THEIR WORK REMOTELY BECAUSE THEIR 
WORK -- THEY NEED TO BE PHYSICALLY IN THE OFFICE TO DO THEIR WORK, 
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THESE FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO 
HAVE TASKS TO THE EXTENT WE CAN SO THEY CAN WORK REMOTELY. 

FOR EXAMPLE, IF SOMEONE IS A RECEPTIONIST AND NOT ABLE TO DO THAT 
FROM HOME, PERHAPS WE CAN FIND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS THAT 
DO SO THEY CAN WORK AND GET THEIR FULL PAY.  FINALLY, IN TERMS OF 
POLICIES THAT THE CITY HAS DEVELOPED THAT I'M REALLY PROUD TO SAY 
AND WAS RELEASED TODAY IS OUR REMOTE WORK POLICY.  SO, UNDER THIS 
POLICY, EMPLOYEES CAN REQUEST TO WORK REMOTELY FOR ONE OR MORE 
OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS.   

SO, SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS ACT.  THEY HAVE 
AN ISOLATION OR QUARANTINE ORDER.  THEY ARE ADVISED TO 
SELF-QUARANTINE.  AND AN EMPLOYEE IS UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO THE 
NEED TO CARE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS UNDER QUARANTINE OR 
ISOLATION.  AND AN EMPLOYEE IS UNABLE TO WORK DUE TO THE CARE FOR 
THEIR CHILD WHOSE SCHOOL OR CHILD CARE PROVIDER IS CLOSED OR 
UNAVAILABLE FOR REASONS RELATED TO COVID-19.  AND AN EMPLOYEE 
MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR INCREASE RISK OF SEVERE ILLNESS FROM COVID-19 
AS DEFINED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL OR DETERMINED BY 
THEIR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER.  SO, THIS INCLUDES, PEOPLE OVER THE AGE -- 
PEOPLE AGE 65 OR OLDER.  THOSE WITH CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE.  THOSE 
WHO ARE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED AND OTHER ILLNESSES DEFINED BY THE 
CDC.  

AGAIN, THE CATEGORY, THE EMPLOYEE IS EXPERIENCING A SIMILAR 
CONDITION AS SPECIFIED BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES.  SO, IN THOSE CATEGORIES, EMPLOYEES CAN REQUEST TO WORK 
REMOTELY.  AND THEN ALSO BECAUSE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND BUILDING 
CAPACITY ISSUES, SINCE THE CAPACITY OF THE BUILDINGS CAN GENERALLY 
ONLY OPERATE AT 25%, DEPARTMENT HEADS MAY ASK STAFF TO PERFORM 
WORK REMOTELY OR TO ADJUST THEIR SCHEDULES.  THIS POLICY IS IN EFFECT 
UNTIL JULY 31, OR UNTIL AMENDED AS WE DO NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN 
DELIVERING SERVICES AND ADJUSTING TO THE PANDEMIC.  AS THE CAPACITY 
ALLOWED BY THE COMMONWEALTH AND OUR BUILDINGS INCREASES, WE 
MAY BE ADJUSTING THIS REMOTE WORK POLICY.

IN TERMS OF SCHEDULE.  I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT SCHEDULE.  JUNE 1, WE 
HAD THE EXPANDED STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES AT THE THREE 
BUILDINGS.  WE ARE TENTATIVELY LOOKING AT JUNE 15 FOR EMPLOYEES 
RETURNING TO ADDITIONAL OFFICES AT BUILDINGS, INCLUDING 51 -- AND 
THE CITY SPACE AT 5 WESTERN AVENUE.  AND WE ARE ALSO LOOKING BY 
JUNE 15TH, OR FOR CERTAIN SERVICE AREAS, IT COULD BE SOONER, OF 
OPENING UP TO IN-PERSON APPOINTMENTS.  OUR INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT IS WORKING ON AN ONLINE SCHEDULING 
SOLUTION, WHICH WILL ALSO BE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE.  ALTHOUGH, I THINK 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PHONE CALL AND 
SET UP AN APPOINTMENT.  

AND FINALLY, I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO TALK ABOUT OUR LIBRARIES.  AND 
WHEN WE MIGHT EXPECT SOME EXPANDED SERVICES FROM THE LIBRARIES.  
SO, WITH REGARD TO THE LIBRARY, IT IS CAREFULLY PREPARING FOR A 
PHASED REOPENING.  AND REOPENING INCLUDES SEVERAL DIFFERENT 
ASPECTS.  ONE:  THE PROCESSING OF A BACK-LOG OF PRE-PANDEMIC 
RETURNS AND NEW BOOK DELIVERIES.  TWO:  DEPLOYING SOCIAL 
DISTANCING AND SAFETY MEASURES, SUCH AS QUARANTINING RETURNED 
LIBRARY MATERIALS FOR 72 HOURS, WHICH IS BEST PRACTICE.  AND THIRD:  
THE TRAINING STAFF AND NEW SAFETY AND CIRCULATION PROCEDURES.  
AND FOURTH:  WE'LL PILOT A CONTACT LIST HOLDS PICKUP PROCESS TO 
BEGIN MID-JUNE, IF POSSIBLE.  WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE.  

AND THE SAFETY OF THE STAFF AND THE PATRONS IS PARAMOUNT, OF 
COURSE.  AND THE LIBRARY HAD A TOWN HALL FOR STAFF ON FRIDAY TO 
SHARE THE PLANS AND HAS A MEETING SCHEDULED WITH THE PUBLIC 
LIBRARY UNION THIS WEEK.  IT IS HAPPENING ON JUNE 3.  THIS CHANGE OF 
WORK CONDITIONS DOES HAVE TO BE BARGAINED WITH THE UNION.   

THE LIBRARY WILL ALSO CONTINUE FREE BOOK DELIVERIES AND TECHNOLOGY 
LENDING TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS WORKING WITH COLLABORATORS FOR 
DISTRIBUTION TO OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.  LIKE FOOD FOR FREE AND THE 
COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTER.  AND THE STAFF IS ALSO COLLABORATING 
WITH THE CENTERS FOR FAMILIES ON A PAJAMA STORY TIME FOR FAMILIES.  
AND THE LIBRARY STAFF ARE ALSO PLANNING A ROBUST SUMMER READING 
PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS THAT WILL INCLUDE A HOST OF 
READING, ACTIVITY CHALLENGES, AND VIRTUAL PERFORMERS, AND 
EXPERIENCES.  AND THIS WILL BE STARTING IN LATE JUNE. 

AND SO, WITH THAT, I WANT TO SAY I'M ALSO JOINED ON THE PHONE BY 
SHEILA AND BY OWEN, WHO CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.  

>> CITY MANAGER:  THANK YOU.  THAT WAS A LONG PRESENTATION, BUT THE 
WORK TO GET THIS RIGHT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE.  AND I KNOW THE COUNCIL 
HAS INTEREST AND I'M SURE RESIDENTS DO ON HOW WE'LL COME UP TO 
SPEED.  CLAUDE, WHO IS THE CLEAN-UP HITTER CAN FIGURE OUT HOW LONG 
HE'LL BE KNOWN -- YOU HAD EXTRA LONG PRESENTATIONS.  CLAUDE, TAKE IT 
AWAY.   

>> CLAUDE:  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

OUR WEEKLY PUBLIC HEALTH COVID UPDATE.  GIVEN THE TRAGIC NEWS OF 
THIS PAST WEEK AND THE SENSELESS DEATH INVOLVING MR. GEORGE FLOYD 
IN MINNESOTA, JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE 
ONGOING COVID STORM AS WELL AS THE GRAVITATIONAL PULL OF 
STRUCTURAL RACISM ARE ADDING ANOTHER DIMENSION OF EMOTIONAL 
DURESS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PANDEMIC.  FOR TONIGHT, THIS WILL BE A 
QUICK UPDATE.  I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AS WE ADJUST TO COVID 
FATIGUE, ISOLATION FATIGUE, QUARANTINE FATIGUE, WE ARE 
COMPOUNDED BY AN ONGOING PLIGHT OF BLACK EXPERIENCE IN AMERICA.  
WHICH IS A DAILY REALITY.  

I WANT TO BRING YOU UP TO SPEED WHERE WE ARE IN THE LAST WEEK.  IT 
FEEL THE LIKE GROUND HOG DAY SINCE WE JUST HAD THIS UPDATE A FEW 
DAYS AGO.  AND SO, AS OF THIS AFTERNOON, WE ARE NOW REACHED A 
DIFFERENT MILESTONE.  WE HAVE 1,101 TOTAL CASES REPORTED TO OUR 
DEPARTMENT.  THOSE ARE CONFIRMED POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS.  RECOGNIZE 
THE 3/4 CASES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO THE LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES.  AND 
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS A MOVING TARGET.  WE DO RECOGNIZE IT IS IN FLUX.  
AN UNDERCOUNT, BUT THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE REPORTED TO OUR 
DEPARTMENT.   

I WILL POINT OUT, A QUARTER OF THE CASES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO FACILITIES.  
TO DATE, WE HAVE 91 REPORTED FATALITIES, 3/4 ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES.  23% OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED 
THE COVID VIRUS HAVE RECOVERED.  THAT'S NEARLY ONE IN FOUR.  AND 
JUST KNOW, THAT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE.   

AND REGARDING THE DATA, JUST KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN SHARING FOR THE 
LAST FEW WEEKS THE HOT SPOTS AROUND THE CITY.  YOU HAVE HEARD 
ABOUT EAST CAMBRIDGE.  YOU HEARD ABOUT THE EFFORTS IN THE PORT.  
AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN A MINUTE.  AND RECOGNIZING THAT 
CAMBRIDGE PORT AND NORTH CAMBRIDGE ARE THE OTHER TWO HOT SPOTS.  
WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO A BETTER JOB TO PROVIDE THE HEAT MAPs 
AND STILL WORKING WITH THE STATE-LEVEL PARTNERS TO COMPLETE THAT 
PICTURE.   

AND SINCE APRIL, REGARDING TESTING, AS I HAVE SHARED, WE ADMINISTER 
OVER 4,000 TESTS IN NURSING HOMES, HOMELESS SHELTERS, SENIOR 
BUILDINGS AND HOT SPOTS.  THE MOBILE TESTING OUTREACH CONDUCTED 
BY PRO-EMS AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAVE AUGMENTED THE TESTED 
PROVIDED BY THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE AND THE EAST CAMBRIDGE 
HEALTH CENTER.  WE ARE SECOND TO NONE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO 
IN STRONG PARTNERSHIP, THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE FRIENDS AT THE 
BROAD INSTITUTE AND IN SUPPORT WITH PRO-EMS AND WITH THE FIRE 
DEPARTMENT.  BETWEEN THE TESTING KITS AND THE CAPACITY TO PROCESS 
THE LAB SPECIMEN AT THE BROAD, IT IS EASIER FOR US TO PUSH THE 
ENVELOPE OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.  

THE SENIOR BUILDINGS THEMSELVES.  A REMINDER, WE TESTED BETWEEN 
MAY 20TH AND THE 26TH.  OVER THAT SEVEN-DAY PERIOD, THIS WAS A 
VOLUNTARY ACTIVITY.  WE REACHED OVER A THOUSAND SENIOR RESIDENTS.

TESTED 776 INDIVIDUALS AND HAD A 29% REFUSAL RATE.  THIS IS 
VOLUNTARY.  THE PORT NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH WE WRAPPED UP THIS 
SATURDAY, THANK YOU COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THAT.  
WE HAD SIX TESTING DATES.  IT CONCLUDED THIS SATURDAY.  THERE WERE 
212 INDIVIDUALS TESTED AT THE SITE.  AND I HAVE TO SAY, OUR 
PRELIMINARY TESTING RESULTS ACROSS THE BOARD SHOW A VERY LOW 
POSITIVITY RATE AND WE ARE WAITING FOR THE FINAL TALLIES TO COME.  IN 
THE WORK WE HAVE DONE, IN THE SENIOR BUILDINGS AND WHAT WE SEE, 
THE PRELIMINARY FEEDBACK FROM THE PORT TESTING, SHOWING LOW 
POSITIVITY RATE.   

PLANS ARE STARTED TO PROVIDE TESTING IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE.  BASED ON 
WHAT WE SEE IN THE AREA, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE DATES AS EARLY AS 
NEXT WEEK.  SO, AS EARLY AS JUNE 9TH.  AND LOOK AT THE SAME MODEL AS 
WE USED IN THE PORT.  TUESDAY, THURSDAY, AND SATURDAY.  THE SAME 
MODEL WE USED IN THE PORT NEIGHBORHOOD AND JUST KNOW WE HAVE 
ALREADY SECURED THE TESTING KITS.  WE HAVE THE TEAM AT THE READY.  
AND LOOKING FORWARD TO PROVIDING THAT SUPPORT NEXT WEEK. 

COUPLE OF THINGS WITH TESTING.  THE STATE IS NOW RELEASING SOME 
DATA TO COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES.  SHOWING THE NUMBER OF COVID 
CASES AND THE PERSONS TESTED.  SO, LITERALLY THEY HAVE ABOUT A 
FIVE-MONTH BASE OF DATA.  IF YOU LOOK AT OUR POSITIVITY RATE HERE IN 
CAMBRIDGE, WE LOOK AT 9.6% AND THAT'S ACCOUNTING FOR 9,500 FOLKS 
WHO HAVE BEEN TESTED.  IF YOU COMPARE SOMERVILLE, ARLINGTON AND 
BOSTON.  AND SOMERVILLE IS 12.7% POSITIVITY RATE.  ARLINGTON 8.9%.  
AND BOSTON IS AT 23.4%.  AND JUST KNOW, A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING 
HERE IN CAMBRIDGE IN THE CITY, IT IS LOOKING FAVORABLE.  JUST KNOW, IT 
IS TIED TO THE TESTING RATES AND OUR POSITIVE -- THE PERCENTAGE OF 
THOSE WHO ARE TESTED.  

TO WRAP UP, I WANT TO MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS TIED TO THE 
SHELTER.  REGARDING THE WAR MEMORIAL -- THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY 
SHELTER, AS OF LAST FRIDAY NIGHT, WE HAVE OFFICIALLY DECOMMISSIONED 
THE QUARANTINE AREA.  WHICH IS THE LOWER LEVEL GARAGE WE USED 
OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEVEN WEEKS.  KEEP IN MIND, THE COMPLEMENT 
OF THE QUARANTINE AREA HAS BEEN THAT THE STATE CONTINUES TO 
PROVIDE US SUPPORT WITH THE REGIONAL ISOLATION AND RECOVERY 
CENTERS.  FOR THOSE COVID-POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN TESTED 
AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE PENDING THEIR RESULTS, THEY HAVE BEEN 
TRANSPORTED TO THE DESIGNATED HOTELS.  THE LION SHARE GO TO 
EVERETT.  THE EVERETT -- HOTEL IN EVERETT AND A NUMBER OF FOLKS 
TRANSPORTED TO A HOTEL IN LEXINGTON.  I CAN'T UNDERSCORE ENOUGH, 
SINCE WE HAVE ACTIVATED THE TEMPORARY EMERGENCY SHELTER FOR 
PHASE ONE, A QUARANTINE AREA, AND WE ACTIVATED THE FIELDHOUSE, THE 
OVERFLOW SPACE, THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE PARTNERS AT BAY COVE 
AND THAT OCCURRED ON APRIL 18, I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THE 
SUCCESS OF THE COLLABORATION WITH THE BAY COVE HUMAN SERVICES, 
THE SUPPORT FOR HEALTHCARE FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAM.  WE HAVE

INCREASED ACCESS TO TESTING.  WE KNOW THAT ADMINISTRATIVELY IT WAS 
A HURDLE TO HAVE THE PRE-SCREENING PROGRAM.  THE CONCERNS THAT 
FOLKS HAD IS THAT WE'D HAVE A SPREAD OF THE COVID VIRUS IN THE 
FIELDHOUSE.  KNOCK ON WOOD, I JUST SAY, SO FAR SO GOOD.  WE HAVE 
MITIGATED THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS AND THANKS TO THE SERVICE 
PROVIDERS, THE DAILY SYMPTOM CHECKS, DAILY CLINICS THAT ARE STAFFED 
AND FACILITATED BY THE STRONG TEAM AT THE HEALTHCARE FOR THE 
HOMELESS PROGRAM OUT OF CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE. 

IT IS NOT A PERFECT SETTING, IT IS A GREAT RESOURCE FOR US TO SUPPORT 
THOSE MOST VULNERABLE AMONGST US.  LASTLY, AS YOU HEARD FROM THE 
DEPUTY CITY MANAGER, WE CONTINUE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE 
CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE REGARDING ONGOING GUIDANCE AND UPDATES 
FROM STATE-LEVEL AUTHORITIES THAT ARE SHARED WITH LOCAL BOARDS OF 
HEALTH.  WE PARTICIPATE IN A MYRIAD OF CITY-LEVEL AND STATEWIDE 
ADVISORIES, CONSTRUCTION ADVISORY, SMALL BUSINESS ADVISORY.  WE 
HAVE THE LARGEST CITIES IN THE COMMONWEALTH TO TALK ABOUT THE 
VIRUS.  AT THIS STAGE, WE ARE ASSESSING THE DEPARTMENTAL STAFFING 
CAPACITY AND NEEDS, REVISITING THE WORKFLOW, AND LOOKING AT OUR 
REMOTE CAPABILITIES TO MAINTAIN OUR AVAILABILITY TO CONTINUE TO 
SERVE THE PUBLIC, DESPITE SOME OF THE ONGOING LOGISTICAL 
CHALLENGES.  

I'LL END BY SAYING, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT.  
THIS CONTINUES TO BE A DISTANCE RACE FOR US AND THE MEMBERS OF THE 
STAFF.  I WANT TO THANK THE CITY MANAGER AND HIS TEAM AND OUR 
PARTNERS IN THE CITY FOR THEIR SUPPORT.  AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, 
WE ARE HERE TO SERVE.  AND I'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS. 

>> CITY MANAGER:  BEFORE WE TAKE QUESTIONS.  I WANT TO THANK 
CLAUDE AND THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT.  WE HAVE TESTED HOT AREAS, THE 
MOST VULNERABLE AND THE LAST TEST RESULTS FROM THE PORT AND FROM 
THE CAMBRIDGE HOUSING AUTHORITY, I THINK TRULY REFLECT THE FACT 
THAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY HAS SENT THE MESSAGE.  THE 
MESSAGE IS BEING RECEIVED BY EMPLOYEES.  DECISIONS WE HAVE MADE 
OVER THE LAST 11 OR 12 WEEKS HAD FULL INTENTION OF MAKING THE 
PROTECTION OF THE RESIDENTS FROM COVID-19 THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY 
IN MAKING DECISIONS.  I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE AND I THINK 
THE RESULTS ARE SHOWING THAT.  AND CLAUDE AND HIS DEPARTMENT 
HAVE BEEN PHENOMENAL.  I WANT TO THANK HIM AGAIN AND WE OPEN IT 
UP FOR QUESTIONS.  AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND 
THE MAYOR FOR REALLY PUSHING FOR CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL 
AS THE COUNCIL HAS.  THE APPROACH WE HAVE TAKEN BY GOING INTO HOT 
SPOTS AND ADDING TESTING WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  THE PROGRAMS 
WERE FUNDED BY THE CITY AND MONEY WELL SPENT.  THANK EVERYBODY.  
AND WE ARE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  THANK YOU.  WE'LL START WITH COUNCILLOR TOOMEY 
AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.  AND THEN COLLEAGUES ON ZOOM.   

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY:  THANK YOU.  I WANT TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID ON

WEDNESDAY TO THE TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY 
OUTREACH ON THE STREET CLOSURES.  WE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF EMAILS 
FROM INDIVIDUALS ASKING ABOUT THIS.  I WANT TO KNOW WHEN THAT 
OUTREACH IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE.  IT HAS TO BE DIRECTLY TO THOSE 
RESIDENTS.  AND TO THE STREETS OFF GARDEN AND OTHERS WILL BE 
IMPACTED.  A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SENT IN THEIR CONCERNS 
ON THE STREET CLOSURES AND GETTING NOTIFICATION.  IT SHOULD BE AS 
AGGRESSIVE AS POSSIBLE SO EVERYBODY IN THE IMPACTED AREAS KNOW IT IS 
COMING.  THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE THAT PEOPLE GET INFORMATION.  IT 
IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CITY REALLY STEPS UP ON THAT ISSUE.   

AND ALSO ON THE STREET CLEANING, I GET A LOT OF COMMENTS.  PEOPLE 
CONFUSED ABOUT NOT HAVING -- HAVING CARS BEING TOWED.  PEOPLE 
DON'T GET THE INFORMATION AND DON'T WATCH THESE MEETINGS OR 
HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS.  MOST INFORMATION WE CAN GET OUT TO 
EVERYBODY AS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE CHURCHES, NEIGHBORHOOD 
ORGANIZATIONS, IT IMPERATIVE.  IT HAS TO TAKE PLACE, ESPECIALLY WITH 
THE SHARED STREETS ISSUE.  IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR EVERYBODY.  IF PEOPLE 
ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS -- THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS ON THOSE TWO 
ISSUES.  STREET CLEANING AND THE COMMUNICATION ON THE SHARED 
STREETS. 

>> CITY MANAGER:  I WILL BE HAPPY TO HAVE JOE GIVE US AN UPDATE.  I 
HAVE A MEETING WITH RESIDENTS ON WEDNESDAY TO ADDRESS CONCERNS.  
WE'LL BE OUT THERE AND MEETING WITH PEOPLE.  JOE MADE IT A PRIORITY.  
STREET CLEANING IS AN INTERESTING ONE.  AND I KNOW OWEN IS ON THE 
PHONE.  WE HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO TELL -- WE WERE THINKING ABOUT 
TOWING ON JUNE ONE.  FIRST, WE NEED TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT.  
THE LAST DISCUSSION, WE'LL TAKE ANOTHER MONTH, GET THE 
INFORMATION OUT, AND MAKE PEOPLE AWARE.  THE LAST THING WE WANT 
TO DO IS GIVE SOMEONE AN EXTRA TICKET AND A TOW.  WE THINK COME 
JULY 1, WE HAVE TO DO THAT.  WE'LL SPEND NOW DOING AS MUCH 
INFORMATION TO LET PEOPLE REALIZE THAT COME JULY 1, WE'LL DO THAT.  
AND I DON'T KNOW IF JOE WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING ON TO SHARED 
STREETS.  WE'LL MAKE THE TOWING ONE A PRIORITY IN TERMS OF MAKING 
SURE PEOPLE ARE AWARE.  JOE?   

>> JOE:  WE ARE RAMPING UP TO LET RESIDENTS KNOW DIRECTLY AND ALSO 
BY SIGNS ON THE STREET.  REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU LIVE THERE OR 
JUST TRAVELLING BY, THERE WILL BE ADVANCE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS.  
AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK.   

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  DON'T SIT DOWN.  I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.  
THANK YOU.  YOUR PRESENTATION, THANK YOU.  DO YOU HAVE IT IN 
WRITING.  AND NUMBER TWO, CAN YOU GIVE US IN WRITING THE OUTREACH 
PLAN.  THE REASON WHY I ASK, THIS IS VERY -- THIS IS IN SUPPORT AND IN 
UNISON WITH MY COLLEAGUE, COUNCILLOR TOOMEY, WHEN YOU SAY YOU 
WILL DO AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH.  THE START DATE IS THE 15TH.  THAT'S 14 
DAYS.  WE ARE STILL ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO STAY IN AS MUCH AS 
POSSIBLE SO THEY CAN'T COME TO A MEETING IN A FACILITY.  LIKE

COUNCILLOR TOOMEY SAYS, DOESN'T HAVE -- MONEY IS GETTING TIGHT.  
SOME THINGS HAVE TO GO AND CABLE TV MAY BE ONE OF THEM.  INTERNET 
COULD BE ONE.  IF YOU LIVE WHERE I LIVE, YOUR INTERNET STINKS ANYWAY.   

YOU MAY NOT GET THE WORD.  I'M JUST REALLY INTERESTED AND I'D RATHER 
IT IN WRITING.  I WANT TO SEE THE OUTREACH PLAN.  I WANT TO SEE HOW 
YOU'RE GOING TO REACH OUT TO PEOPLE AND EXPLAIN AS YOU TALK TO A 
FOURTH GRADER, WHAT DOES SHARED STREETS LOOK LIKE.  WHEN PEOPLE 
CALL ME, I HAVE A HARD TIME EXPLAINING TO THEM AND THE VERY LONG 
PRESENTATION, PEOPLE START TO GLOSS OVER.  I SAID IN A HALF SECOND OR 
HALF MINUTE, EXPLAIN TO ME SHARED STREET WHAT, IS THE HIGH POINT?  
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?  SHARE IT WITH WHO?  HOW?   

>> JOE:  IF I WAS GOING TO SUMMARIZE IT, I WOULD SAY, THEY ARE STREETS 
WHERE A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES ARE ALLOWED, SAFE SPACE FOR CYCLING, 
PEOPLE WALKING TO PHYSICALLY DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM EACH OTHER.  
AND MOVE OUT TO THE STREET WHEN NEEDED.  AND NECESSARY CAR-BASED 
OR VEHICULAR ACTIVITIES ARE ALLOWED.  LIKE DELIVERIES, ACCESS TO 
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES.  AND ACCESS FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES AND 
TRASH PICKUP.  ET CETERA.  SO, THEY ARE SHARED BETWEEN BICYCLISTS, 
PEDESTRIAN, AND MOTOR VEHICLES.  

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  YOU SAID, THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE 
DETOURS.  HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DETOUR OFF HARVARD TO BROADWAY, 
IT IS BEYOND ME.  WHY DO I HAVE TO SHARE THE STREET, WHY DETOUR.  
SOMETHING I'M MISSING IN THE SHARED STREET.  AND HOW DOES THAT 
IMPACT PARKING?  IN OTHER WORDS, USE HARVARD STREET AS THE 
EXAMPLE.  PARKING ON BOTH SIDES.  PEDESTRIANS CAN GO DOWN THE 
MIDDLE OF STREET AS WELL AS THE BIKE CAN GO DOWN THE STREET AS WELL 
AS A CAR CAN GO SIMULTANEOUSLY.  OR YOU ARE SAYING WE DON'T WANT 
CARS, JUST PEOPLE AND BIKES.  

>> JOE:  WE WANT AS FEW CARS AS WE CAN, BUT STILL MAINTAIN LOCAL 
ACCESS.  SO, THE CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS CAN FEEL COMFORTABLE.  WE 
WANT CARS AND CYCLIST TO TRAVEL AT A LOW SPEED.  10 MILES PER HOUR.  
AND WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH FROM SOMEWHERE IN 
THE PORT TO HARVARD SQUARE, FOR EXAMPLE, TO USE BROADWAY OR 
MASS AVENUE.  RATHER THAN USING HARVARD STREET.  SO, THE MOST OF 
HARVARD STREET TRAFFIC, VEHICULAR TRAFFIC, IS JUST PEOPLE ACCESSING 
THE LOCAL BLOCKS.  

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  OKAY.  THAT WILL GIVE ME A BETTER IDEA.  I'D 
LIKE THAT, SORT OF BULLET POINT, RESERVING HARVARD STREET FOR BIKES 
AND PEOPLE, WE DISCOURAGE VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.  I WANT YOU TO HAVE A 
MEETING AT NEWTOWNE COURT TO EXPLAIN THAT CONCEPT.  I WANT YOU 
TO FIND A WAY TO TALK TO PARENTS ABOUT THAT CONCEPT.  PEOPLE THAT 
ATTEND THE CHURCHES IN THE AREA THAT WON'T KNOW THIS AND THEY 
DON'T GET STICKER SHOCK.  AND I THINK STARTING ON 6/15 IS AMBITIOUS.  IF 
YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO DO QUALIFIED AND AUTHENTIC OUTREACH FOR 
ALL STREETS, I THINK IT MAY BE INADEQUATE.  SHARED STREETS, I ASSURE 
YOU, IT IS NOT AT THE TOP OF THE TO-DO LIST AT SOME NEIGHBORHOODS.  IF

YOU WANT TO BE FAIR TO PEOPLE AND I HOPE IT IS ABOUT BEING FAIR TO 
PEOPLE, I WILL ASSUME THAT EVERYBODY THAT IS WALKING AND BIKING 
DOWN ANY OF THE STREETS MAY NOT BE -- MAY NOT BE NATIVES, THEY 
WANT TO GET TO WHERE THEY ARE GOING AND UNOBSTRUCTED BY CARS.  IT 
IS WONDERFUL FOR THEM.  I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT EVERYBODY.  WE WANT 
TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS IMPACTS OUR CITIZEN.  I SAY WE CAN DO THE 
RIGHT THING THE WRONG WAY.  TO DEBRIEF. 

YOU CAN SEND IT TO ME TOMORROW OR TO THE COUNCIL.  WHAT IS YOUR 
OUTREACH PLAN.  TO THE AFFECTED STREETS.  I HEARD FROM ONE BUSINESS, 
I THINK THE ENTIRE COUNCIL HEARD, WAS HOW IS THIS GOING TO IMPACT 
THE BRICK-AND-MORTAR BUSINESSES AND I CAN'T STATE THAT ENOUGH.  
THE SMALL BUSINESS ASSOCIATIONS AND SOME OF THE BRICK-AND-MORTAR 
BUSINESSES ARE RINGING THEIR HANDS, RINGING THEIR HANDS BECAUSE IF 
THEY OPEN, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW.  IF THEY DO OPEN, THEY DON'T KNOW 
HOW LONG.  AND THEY FEEL -- SOME OF THEM, I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ALL, BUT 
FOR SOME, THEY SAY, NOW YOU ADD JUST ONE MORE THING FOR US TO 
NEGOTIATE WITHOUT ASKING US AND TELLING US HOW TO SUPPORT US.  
THIS IS WHAT I DO KNOW.  EVERY TIME WE HAVE DONE CONSTRUCTION IN A 
PARTICULAR SQUARE, WE HAVE SAID WE'LL SUPPORT THE LOCAL BUSINESSES, 
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT IS A SIGN.  IT IS SOME SIGNAGE.  THAT IS NOT 
SUPPORTING LOCAL BUSINESS.  THAT IS NOT.  AND LET'S BE FAIR TO PEOPLE 
THAT PAY TAXES AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T PAY TAXES THAT WE 
WANT TO GIVE SERVICES TO.  

TO MS. PETERSON, THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.  AGAIN, THAT IS A 
LOT OF INFORMATION.  THANK YOU.  THAT'S A LOT OF INFORMATION AND 
GOOD INFORMATION.  I COULDN'T TAKE THAT ALL IN.  THERE'S NO WAY I CAN 
TAKE THIS ALL IN.  AND I'M HOPING YOU WOULD OFFER TO THE COUNCIL 
THAT ENTIRE LITANY OF WHAT YOU DID, HOW YOU ARE DOING IT, WHO IS 
DOING IT, TO THE COUNCIL.  IF SOMEONE ASKS US, AS PEOPLE OFTEN WILL, 
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THEM COHERENTLY.  AND WE TALK ABOUT THE 
NEW NORMAL.  THE NEW NORMAL IS THAT PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO FLOCK 
TO CITY HALL LIKE THEY USED TO.  WE WANT TO BE APPRISED TO WHO IS 
HERE, WHEN THEY ARE HERE, HOW THEY ARE HERE, SO WE CAN ENCOURAGE 
OR DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM COMING TO CITY HALL TO TRY TO GET THEIR 
SERVICES ONLINE, KNOWING THERE IS ONE POPULATION THAT ONLINE IS 
THEIR FRIEND.  THEY DO EVERYTHING THAT WAY AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE 
MORE TACTILE AND HAVE TO LOOK AT AND YOU PUSH MY MONEY UNDER 
THE HOLE.  SOMEHOW, WE HAVE TO BE NIMBLE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO 
DEAL WITH PEOPLE WHERE THEY WERE AS WELL AS DEALING WITH THEM 
WHERE WE WANT THEM TO BE.  

AND THEN LASTLY, THANK YOU MR. JACOB FOR OPENING UP A SITE IN THE 
PORT.  SOMEHOW I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT WAS GOING TO OPEN AND 
CLOSE.  AND SO, IF IT IS CLOSED NOW, THE QUESTION MIGHT BE TWO-PART.  
ONE:  WHEN WILL YOU OPEN IT AGAIN AND THE REASON WHY I ASK YOU TO 
OPEN AGAIN BECAUSE I GOT THREE PHONE CALLS OF PEOPLE HEARING A 
LITTLE ABOUT IT, BUT NOT KNOWING.  I HEARD YOU SAY, I THINK 210 PEOPLE

CAME THROUGH.  DID YOU CONTROL FOR ARE THEY RESIDENTS OR JUST HEAR 
ABOUT IT.  I KNOW YOU WERE REACHING OUT TO ANOTHER POPULATION.  
HAPPY TO HEAR THE LOW POSITIVITY RATE, LOVE TO SEE THAT BROKEN 
DOWN BY RACE TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE.  RACE AND GENDER.  THAT IS 
IMPORTANT.  AND I WANT TO KNOW WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE PORT.  
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST GETTING THE WORD AND NOW IT IS GONE.   

AND SO, I'M HOPING THAT IF IT IS ONE DAY PER WEEK, YOU DO IT TUESDAY 
AND THURSDAY AND SATURDAY.  FROM NOON TO 8:00.  YOU CIRCLE 
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS, IF YOU CAN DO TUESDAY IN THE PORT.  
THURSDAY IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE.  AND ANOTHER HOT SPOT.  PEOPLE CAN 
GET ACCUSTOM TO THE AVAILABILITY AND THE REGULARITY THAT WE HAVE 
IN EAST CAMBRIDGE, WHICH I THINK SEVEN DAYS PER WEEK.  OR FIVE DAYS.  
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  THAT'S PRETTY MUCH MY QUESTIONS.  AND I HAVE 
SAID THIS BEFORE.  I HEARD COUNCILLOR NOLAN ASK AND I DON'T KNOW IF 
WE CAN DO IT.  SO MUCH INFORMATION IS JUST HARD.  IT IS NOT IN 
WRITING.  IT IS HARD TO ABSORB.  BULLET POINTS ARE GREAT.  THANK YOU 
TO THE COMMISSIONER FOR HIS HARD WORK.  HE IS HOLDING IT DOWN AND 
I APPRECIATE THAT.  IT IS A LOT OF INFORMATION AND PARTICULARLY TO THE 
PORT.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER INTERFAITH CALL.  SOME THAT 
INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL, PARTICULARLY IF IT IS IN WRITING 
ABOUT THE PORT TESTING.  WHERE THE NEW TESTING WILL BE AND WHEN 
CITY HALL WILL BE OPEN AND HOW.  I YIELD THE FLOOR.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  CLAUDE, YOU WANT TO RESPOND?   

>> CLAUDE:  SURE.  THANK YOU COUNCILLOR SIMMONS FOR THE QUESTION.  
AND IN SHORT, I WOULD SAY WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS PUT 
OUT ANY BRUSH FIRES OR TRY TO ADDRESS THE HOT SPOTS.  WE DON'T HAVE 
ANY IMMEDIATE PLANS TODAY.  AS THE NEED ARISES, WE STAND AT THE 
READY.  KEEP IN MIND, THE AVAILABILITY OF TESTING KITS, WEAR AND TEAR 
ON THE STAFF, THE FOCUS IS TO BE IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE NEXT WEEK.  I 
DON'T WANT TO OVERCOMMIT THE RESOURCES.  WE TESTED 212 FOLKS, THIS 
WAS OPEN CITY-WIDE WHILE WE WERE ANCHORED IN THE PORT 
NEIGHBORHOOD.  THAT'S THE INTENT.  THIS IS TO AUGMENT WHAT WE HAVE 
IN EAST CAMBRIDGE, NOT JUST FOR EAST CAMBRIDGE, BUT WE HAVE A TENT 
THERE AVAILABLE FOR ALL RESIDENTS.  WE'LL KEEP AN EYE.  I WILL PULL 
TOGETHER THE SUMMARY DATA AND SHARE WHAT WE CAN WITHOUT 
DISCLOSING THE IDENTITY OF THOSE FOLKS.  

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  WE DON'T WANT ANYONE'S PRIVATE 
INFORMATION.  THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.  IF YOU CAN BRING IT BACK, 
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO KNOW -- THERE ARE TWO GROUPS I MEET WITH.  AT 
LEAST IF WE CAN BE UPDATED EVERY TIME THE SITE CHANGES, IT WOULD BE 
HELPFUL AND THE LAST QUESTION IS ABOUT PPE.  THE QUESTION WAS, WHY 
IS IT SO HARD FOR US TO GET THE AMOUNT OF TESTING WE ACTUAL -- TEST 
UNITS THAT WE NEED?   

>> IN TERMS OF TESTING.  I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE 
TO GENERATE, NOT ONLY THROUGH THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE THAT 
HAS SET UP THREE TESTING TENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES, BUT

WE HAVE OUR BATCH THAT COMES FROM THE BROAD INSTITUTE.  AND 
THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT.  THANKS TO THE CITY MANAGER FOR HIS 
SUPPORT.  WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO MORE THAN MOST COMMUNITIES 
BECAUSE OF THAT SUPPLY MADE AVAILABLE BY OUR PARTNERS AT THE 
BROAD INSTITUTE.   

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  OKAY.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  WE'LL MOVE ON?   

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  JUST ONE MORE.  I WANT TO KNOW WHEN THE 
METERS GOING BACK LIVE?   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  METERS?  CITY MANAGER?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE HAVE A FEW DISCUSSIONS.  DO WE HAVE AN OFFICIAL 
DATE.  

>> I DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL DATE YET.  IT IS NOT FAR OFF.  A COUPLE OF 
WEEKS, AT MOST.  BUT STILL FIGURING OUT THE EXACT DETAILS AND I THINK 
THE PLAN WOULD BE TO PHASE THAT IN BEFORE ENFORCEMENT SO THERE'S 
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO LEARN ABOUT THAT.  AND GET THE WORD 
OUT.  MANY OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE STARTING TO ENFORCE METERS.  WE 
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST ONE TO GET BACK INTO THE BUSINESS.   

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  THANK YOU.  I YIELD.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR CARLONE?  YOU ARE NEXT.   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  THANK YOU.  I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS?   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  I DIDN'T SAY HOW MANY QUESTIONS IN THE 
BEGINNING.  TO BE FAIR AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS DID ASK QUITE A FEW 
QUESTIONS.  I WILL MAKE IT EQUAL.  YOU ARE WELCOME TO ASK MORE.   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  OKAY.  I HAVE A-Z...  I WANTED TO THANK JOE 
ANYTHING NEW AND DIFFERENT RAISES CONCERNS.  AND IT APPEARS THE 
DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO DO ALL IT CAN.  JOE, YOU CHOSE THE STREETS, I 
ASSUME, FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.  YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THEM ON 
THURSDAY.  ONE IS THERE IS AN ALTERNATE ROUTE NEARBY WHERE TRAFFIC 
CAN BE DIRECTED.  I ASSUME ANOTHER ONE IS RELATIVELY LITTLE BUSINESS 
SINCE MOST OF THE STREETS FRONTAGE IS RESIDENTIAL.  THAT'S NOT SAYING 
THAT THERE IS NOT BUSINESS, BUT YOU WILL FOCUS ON THE FEW THAT NEED 
GUIDANCE AND HELP.  IS THAT CORRECT?   

>> THAT IS PART OF THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.  AND BOTH IN TERMS 
OF LOCATIONS WITH MORE LIMITED BUSINESSES, THERE ARE SOME AS I SAID, 
WE WANT TO BE AS HELPFUL AS WE CAN.  BUT BY NOT PICKING THE MAJOR 
CORRIDORS, LIKE A MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE OR CAMBRIDGE STREET, WHICH 
HAVE A NUMBER OF THESE.   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  THANK YOU.  AND MY OTHER QUESTION IS TO 
MR. JACOBS.  CLAUDE, I'M CONSTANTLY CONFUSED BY STATISTICS AND I 
KNOW STATISTICS ARE CONFUSING AND THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
GROUND RULE THE ARE IN MANY CASES.  THE REASON I SAY THAT.  I SAW AN

ARTICLE AND MAYBE YOU SAW IT THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE COUNTRY OF 
BELGIUM HAD THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF INCIDENTS OF COVID PER 
THOUSAND AT 85.  ITALY AND SPAIN ARE 15.  AND THE UNITED STATES WAS 
25.  AND I REALIZED, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THAT IS BASED ON.  MY 
QUESTION TO YOU IS...  WE HAVE 91 COVID DEATHS.  AND I REALIZE A GREAT 
MAJORITY LIVE IN ELDER CARE.  AND WE HAD AT LEAST RECORDED A 
THOUSAND CASES OF COVID-19.  ARE THOSE NUMBERS HIGH?  MEDIUM?  
LOW?  FOR AN URBAN AREA AS DENSE AS CAMBRIDGE AND THAT'S 
COMPARING TO OTHER LOCATIONS?   

>> CLAUDE:  THANK YOU.  THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF COMPARING APPLES AND 
ORANGES.  WHAT WE USE ARE RATES.  RATES PER 10,000 OR RATES PER 
100,000.  SO THE COMPARISON I USED EARLIER LOOKING AT THE POSITIVITY 
RATES COMPARING US TO BOSTON TO SOMERVILLE AND ARLINGTON.  THAT 
IS COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES.  WE CAN GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT WE 
SEE IN THE BOSTON METRO AREA.  BUT KNOW, THAT WAS REPORTING OUT IN 
TERMS OF THE POSITIVITY RATE, SO OUR 9.6% COMPARED TO ARLINGTON AT 
8.9, COMPARED TO SOMERVILLE AT 12.7, AND BOSTON AT 23.4%.  SO, THAT IS 
ALL I CAN SHARE.  IF THAT MAKES SENSE.   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  IT DOES.  THE 91 DEATHS.  HOW DOES THAT RATE 
COMPARED TO DEATHS IN OTHER CITIES?  SIMILAR?   

>> PARTICIPANT:  AGAIN, THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE.  WE CAN TELL 
YOU WHAT WE HAVE ATTRIBUTED AS COVID-RELATED FATALITIES.  WE HAVE 
THAT COUNT.  91 FATALITIES.  I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE FATALITIES FOR THE 
OTHERS.  BASED ON THE POSITIVE RATE, THE PERCENTAGE OF FOLKS WHO 
TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19, IT IS REPORTED CASES VERSUS FATALITIES.  I 
CAN COME BACK AND LOOK AT THE FATALITIES.  COMPARING ONE 
COMMUNITY TO THE NEXT.  

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  THANK YOU.  I WASN'T CHALLENGING WHAT YOU 
ALWAYS PRESENTED.  YOU UNDERSTAND STATISTICS BECAUSE YOU DEAL 
WITH IT.  YOU DEAL WITH IT ALL THE TIME.  I WILL YIELD AT THIS POINT.  
THANK YOU.  I MIGHT COME BACK LATER.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  THANK YOU.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  TO THE CITY MANAGER AND TO HIS 
TEAM, I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.  MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR LISA 
PETERSON.  THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE DOCUMENTS TODAY ON A 
RETURN TO WORK POLICY AND THE NEW POLICIES AROUND WORKPLACE 
ACCOUNTABILITY.  I KNOW THAT WE PREVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAVE A WORK 
FROM HOME POLICY.  I CAN RECOGNIZE IT WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
WORK TO PUT TOGETHER.  AND I HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION AFTER READING 
THE DOCUMENTS AROUND THE SCENARIO THAT YOU DESCRIBED FOR 
EMPLOYEES THAT MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA.  AND CANNOT WORK FROM 
HOME.  

YOU HAVE FIVE CRITERIA, ONE IS IF YOU ARE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED, NO 
CHILDCARE FOR KIDS AT HOME.  AND THE FFCRA YOU MENTIONED, ONLY 
GOES UP TO 2/3 OF AN EMPLOYEE'S SALARY.  AND THE FEDERAL LIMIT IS

CAPPED AT $200 A DAY.  AND I THINK I WAS READING THE CITY OF 
CAMBRIDGE IS GOING TO PAY THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE $200 AND 2/3 
OF THE SALARY.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY 
AND I WANT TO ASK WHY THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE DOESN'T PAY UP TO 100% 
OF THE PERSON'S SALARY OVER THE NEXT 12 WEEKS, KNOWING THAT WE 
HAVE A LOT OF EMPLOYEES THAT ARE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED OR HAVE 
CHILDREN AT HOME AND WILL THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER.  SO, THROUGH 
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, THEY DON'T HAVE A JOB THEY CAN DO FROM 
HOME, WHY AREN'T WE NOT PAYING THE 100% AND RATHER THE 2/3.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  LISA?   

>> LISA:  THANK YOU.  WE ARE PAYING THE FULL 2/3.  THAT WAS THE 
DECISION.  AND WE ARE PAYING 100% FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ABLE TO 
TELEWORK.  AND IF PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO WORK TELEWORK.  I GUESS I'D SAY, 
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO USE THEIR ACCRUED BALANCES TO MAKE UP THE 
DIFFERENCE OF THE 2/3 OR AND I THINK WE ARE VERY COMMITTED, IF WE 
CAN FIND SOME ALTERNATIVE WORK TO MAKE UP FOR THAT ADDITIONAL 
THIRD, WE'D LIKE TO PAY THEM FOR 100%.  THERE'S JUST A DIFFERENTIATION 
BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT, IN TERMS OF BENEFITS AND IN TERMS OF PEOPLE 
THAT ARE ABLE TO WORK REMOTELY AND THOSE WHO CAN'T.  I DON'T KNOW 
IF THE MANAGER WANTS TO ADD ANYTHING.  

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THIS AND OUR GOAL IS 
TO MAKE IT WORK FOR ALL.  I CAN APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND IT IS A 
DIFFICULT DECISION.  THERE'S A CONCERN THAT RIGHTFULLY, IT IS A 
DIFFICULT DECISION.  IT WILL BE ABOUT POTENTIALLY 25 WEEK S OF PAY 
THROUGH NOBODY'S FAULT TO NOT HAVE REPORTED.  TO BALANCE THAT 
OUT IN TERM THE OF WHAT PERCENTAGE WE SHOULD PAY, IT IS A TRICKY 
ONE.  WE WANT TO BE LOYAL.  BUT WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE RIGHT 
BALANCE.  I HEAR AND YOU I THINK WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY 
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN USE OUR EMPLOYEES IN A 
WAY, EVEN IF THEY ARE AT HOME.  THAT WE CAN HELP PAY FOR THE SALARY.  
TRY TO HAVE A BALANCE, THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN, IT IS A LARGE 
AMOUNT OF TIME TO BE OUT, THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT FULL 
SALARY.  IT IS A DISCUSSION WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  I WOULD CHALLENGE US TO RETHINK 
THAT.  I THINK WE ARE IN VERY UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AND THROUGH AS 
YOU SAID, NO FAULT OF EMPLOYEE'S OWN, THEY ARE HOME WITHOUT AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FROM HOME.  MANY OF US CAN.  I CAN WORK 
FROM HOME.  THE ENTIRE COUNCIL CAN WORK FROM HOME.  COUNCIL 
AIDES CAN WORK FROM HOME.  WE HAVE EMPLOYEES THAT THEIR BILLS 
DIDN'T GO AWAY.  1/3 OF THE BILLS DIDN'T GO AWAY BECAUSE OF THE 
COVID CRISIS.  SO, I UNDERSTAND THE TRICKY BALANCE BETWEEN TAXPAYER 
DOLLARS AND PEOPLE NOT REPORTING TO WORK; HOWEVER, WE HAVE A 
RESPONSIBLE TO OUR EMPLOYEES DURING THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME, AND IF 
SOMEONE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME MAKING SURE OUR RESOURCES, WE'RE 
GETTING RESOURCES LIKE FOOD AND OTHER BENEFITS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
LOST JOBS OR LOST WAGES, FOR THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO BE ADDING TO

THAT LIST IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SWALLOW.   

AND IT IS WHY I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AT THE COUNCIL MEETINGS TO CHALLENGE US AND MAKE SURE WE 
ARE PUTTING AT THIS TIME A THOUGHTFUL RETURN-TO-WORK PROGRAM 
THAT COMPENSATES OUR EMPLOYEES AND ENSURES THAT PEOPLE DON'T 
HAVE TO START VISITING FOOD PANTRIES.  THAT'S REAL.  I'M ASKING YOU 
AND I'M ASKING THE DEPUTY CITY MANAGER AND HER TEAM TO REALLY 
THINK ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO BE AS A CITY AND HOW WE'RE GOING 
TO BE A LEADER.  AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE A MODEL FOR OTHER 
COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN CAMBRIDGE.  WE SHOULD BE A 
LEADER.   

MY NEXT QUESTION AND RELATED TO THAT, I THINK, I GET MANY QUESTIONS 
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE COUNCILLOR SIMMONS AND HER STATEMENTS ARE 
GETTING QUESTIONS FROM EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.  
LIKE I SAID, THAT WAS A LOT OF DOCUMENTATION.  A LOT OF WORDS.  
PEOPLE HAVE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.  I GOT ONE TODAY, IF I TAKE THIS 12 
WEEKS, HOW DOES IT AFFECT MY PENSION.  THEY ARE SPECIFIC HR 
QUESTIONS.  WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE, BECAUSE OF THE 
COVID CRISIS, WE CAN PULL TOGETHER ALL EMPLOYEES ON A ZOOM TOWN 
HALL, FOR EXAMPLE.  PEOPLE CAN SUBMIT QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY COULD 
ASK QUESTIONS DURING -- HOW TO REACH OUT TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF 
THE EMPLOYEES IN THIS TYPE OF WAY, KNOWING THAT AS WAS SAID, THE 
FINAL PLAN IS NOT FINALIZED AND WE CAN USE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
ASK QUESTIONS AND GATHER INFORMATION. 

>> LISA:  I THINK THAT IS A REALLY GREAT IDEA FOR US TO HAVE, EVEN IF IT IS 
SOME SORT OF VIRTUAL MEETINGS, THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO TALK WITH 
EMPLOYEES AND TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN AND TALK ABOUT THE POLICIES.  I 
MIGHT HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR SMALLER MEETINGS TO BE ABLE TO TALK 
ABOUT DIFFERENT EMPLOYEE GROUPS.  I THINK THAT WOULD BE 
IMPORTANT.  I WOULD SAY THAT IT HAS BEEN A WHIRLWIND FOR 
EVERYBODY.  I REALIZE THAT EVEN WITH THE REMOTE WORK POLICY JUST 
BEING RELEASED TODAY, AS MUCH AS WE TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH 
PEOPLE, WE ARE STILL DEVELOPING THE POLICIES AS WELL.   

I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO REALLY BE COMMUNICATING AND 
TALKING TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND WE'LL BE DOING THAT.  I DO HAVE THE 
PRESENTATION AND WE HAVE THE DOCUMENTS IN WRITING.  WE ARE 
WORKING ON PUTTING ON THE WEBSITE SO THINGS WILL BE MORE 
ACCESSIBLE.  AND AS WE ROLL THEM OUT, WE WILL WANT TO HAVE SOME 
VIRTUAL MEETINGS TO BE ABLE TO AND FAQS, FREQUENTLY ASKED 
QUESTIONS, FOR PEOPLE TO GET INFORMATION.  

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE HAVE JOE BARR WHO OVERSEES THE QUESTIONS TO 
DATE.  AND DAVID DOES THE ANNEX AND CITY HALL.  WE ASSIGNED A POINT 
PERSON IN THE BUILDINGS WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE OF TRYING TO GET AS 
MANY QUESTIONS ANSWERED.  I KNOW TODAY ALONE, BETWEEN JOE AND 
DAVID, THERE WERE QUESTIONS WE WERE ABLE TO ANSWER.  HAVING THAT 
PERSON AVAILABLE, THAT WILL HELP.  THE MORE INFORMATION WE CAN GET

OUT, THE MORE INFORMATION WE MAKE AVAILABLE TO THE EMPLOYEES, WE 
SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS.  THEY ARE LONG DOCUMENTS.  TRICKY 
DOCUMENTS.  A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THE DOCUMENTS.  AND WE'LL DO THE 
BEST WE CAN TO ADDRESS ALL CONCERNS.  AND ANSWER ALL THE 
QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE WANT EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS 
PLAYS IN TERMS OF HOW IT AFFECTS THEIR WORK CONDITIONS.  I AGREE, 
WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO THE BEST WE CAN WITH THIS.  AND WE'LL STAY ON 
TOP OF IT.   

I THINK JOE AND DAVID DID A REALLY NICE JOB ON DAY ONE OF ADDRESSING 
QUESTIONS.  AS EVERY BUILDING COMES BACK, THERE WILL BE A POINT 
PERSON WHOSE ROLE IS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.  

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  TO SPEAK TO DEPUTY CITY 
MANAGER'S POINT, HAVING A LARGE ONE BIG ZOOM MEETING AND SMALLER 
DEPARTMENT MEETINGS WOULD BE GOOD.  I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE 
QUESTIONS THEY DON'T KNOW TO ASK.  HAVING THAT BIG EMPLOYEE 
MEETING AND IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY TALK TO THE EMPLOYEES 
AND EXPRESS GRATITUDE TO THEM FOR WORKING THROUGH THIS PROCESS.  
AND TALKING ABOUT MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING 
ON.  MY NEXT QUESTION IS AROUND OUTDOOR DINING.  

I KNOW JOE MENTIONED THIS IN HIS PRESENTATION.  I DO KNOW THAT IS 
COMING ONLINE MONDAY.  A WEEK FROM TODAY.  AND I DON'T THINK THAT 
RESTAURANTS HAVE ANY GUIDANCE SO FAR.  AND WHAT I WONDER IS HOW 
SOON DO WE SEE PLANS TO EXPAND OUTDOOR DINING WITH EVERYTHING 
THAT NEEDS TO GO ALONG WITH THAT.  LICENSING, PERMITTING, SIDEWALK 
PERMITS AND GUIDANCE.  IS THAT COMING SO RESTAURANTS CAN OPEN IN 
AN OUTDOOR FASHION ON MONDAY?  ON THE DAY THEY ARE ALLOWED TO 
DO IT?  OR CAN ANYONE PROVIDE ANY INSIGHT OF WHEN THAT MAY 
HAPPEN?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE MET FRIDAY, SATURDAY, AND I DON'T KNOW IF 
SUNDAY.  WITH THE LICENSE COMMISSIONER AND OTHERS.  THERE'S A LOT 
OF CONCERNS.  IT IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.  AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO 
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT WE NEED TO DO TO HELP 
ASSIST.  THERE ARE AREAS WITH DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND PERMITS AND 
LICENSING THAT ARE IN PLAY.  WE ARE STILL GOING OVER ALL OF THEM.  AND 
LIKE I SAID, WE MET TODAY FOR TWO HOURS ON THAT MATTER.  WE 
HAVEN'T SENT OUT FORMAL THINGS.  MATT IS WORKING AND WORKING 
WITH THE CITY SOLICITOR ON ITEMS.  MORE TO COME.  I DON'T KNOW HOW 
MUCH MATT HAS BEEN ABLE TO UPDATE THE COMMUNITY.  OR DAVID YOU 
WILL UPDATE?  A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE MEETINGS.   

>> WE RECEIVED FURTHER INFORMATION WITH REGARD TO GUIDELINES 
FROM THE GOVERNOR.  AND HOW THE ABC PROCESS IS GOING TO WORK.  
WE HAVE BEEN MEETING.  AND MATT WAS PUTTING TOGETHER A 
COMMUNICATION FOR REVIEW.  AND THEN WE REALIZED, WE HAVE MORE 
GUIDANCE FROM THE STATE AND THAT CHANGED SOME OF OUR THOUGHT 
PROCESS ABOUT WHAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND WHEN.  
WE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO COMMUNICATE AND TO

PROVIDE GUIDANCE.  THE GUIDANCE IS FORTHCOMING IN SOME WAYS RIGHT 
NOW.  WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE PROVIDE INFORMATION, IT IS 
CURRENT.  IT IS ACCURATE.  AND THAT IT IS CLEAR.  SO, WE HAVE BEEN 
MEETING ON THIS AND WE'LL DO THIS.  WE JUST GOT SOME INFORMATION 
THIS AFTERNOON THAT WILL INFORM US GOING FORWARD.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  I KNOW WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS AND I KNOW THERE'S AN ARTICLE IN THE "CAMBRIDGE 
CHRONICLE" MAKING SURE WE ARE READY.  IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT 
HAPPEN THIS WEEK, AND PEOPLE CAN KEEP THE COUNCIL UP-TO-DATE SO WE 
CAN INFORM PEOPLE, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.  WE'D LOVE TO BE READY 
TO GO ON DAY ONE.  AND I THINK WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO TO GET THE 
WORD OUT AND COMMUNICATE AND MAKE IT HAPPEN, IT WOULD BE 
APPRECIATED.  I WILL YIELD THE FLOOR.  THANK YOU.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  THANK YOU.  I WILL START WITH A QUESTION 
FOR COMMISSIONER BARD.  GOT A FEW EMAILS AND EVERYTHING THAT IS 
HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ABOUT 
-- AS YOU MENTIONED, CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT POLICY AND 
PEOPLE OUT PUT A LIST OF THINGS THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING.  ONE 
QUESTION THAT CAME UP, IT IS AROUND TEAR GAS.  AND IS THAT A POLICY?  I 
HAVE BEEN HERE 50 YEARS AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN ANY INSTANCE 
WHERE THAT HAS BEEN USED.  BUT IS THERE A POLICY AROUND IT?  DO WE 
HAVE IT?  WHAT IS THE POLICY, IF ANY?   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  OKAY.  SO, NO, WE DON'T HAVE TEAR GAS.  WE DO 
HAVE WHAT IS CALLED (UNKNOWN SPRAY).  IT IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS 
PEPPER SPRAY.  EACH OFFICER CARRIES AN INDIVIDUAL CANISTER.  IT IS ON 
THEIR WAIST.  WE HAVE LARGER CONTAINER OF THE THAT SPRAY.  THEY 
HAVEN'T BEEN DEPLOYED IN MORE THAN 25 YEARS.  NO, WE DON'T HAVE 
TEAR GAS, WHICH IS A MAN-MADE CHEMICAL OPPOSED TO THE PEPPER 
SPRAY WHICH IS DERIVED FROM THE NATURALLY OCCURRING MATERIALS.  
PEPPERS.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  THANK YOU.  I THINK THERE IS SO MUCH WE 
ARE SEEING WHAT IS GOING ON, THERE IS SO MUCH CONCERN.  AND WE DO 
A LOT THAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND CITIES DON'T DO.  I THINK AS MUCH 
AS WE CAN GET INFORMATION OUT TO PEOPLE TO MAYBE EASE THEIR 
CONCERNS OR THEIR FEARS, THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT.  

I WILL ASK ONE MORE QUESTION.  WE JUST HAD OUR UPDATE ON THURSDAY.  
AND I NOTICED, MR. MANAGER, IN THE LIST OF CITY BUILDINGS THAT ARE 
REOPENING AND I DIDN'T SEE THE MULTISERVICE CENTER ON THE LIST.  
MAYBE IT WAS AN OVERSIGHT.  I WOULD ASK, WHEN IS THAT REOPENING 
AND TO POINT OUT, I KNOW WE ARE REOPENING FIRST WITH 
APPOINTMENTS, BUT FOR A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO UTILIZE THE 
MULTISERVICE CENTER, THAT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM.  AND SO, 
WHAT HAVE WE THOUGHT AROUND REOPENING THAT SERVICE?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  THAT RIGHT NOW IS TENTATIVE FOR THE 15TH.  THAT 
WOULD BE TWO WEEKS WHEN WE START THE NEXT ROUND OF BUILDINGS.

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  AND MAYBE TALK ABOUT -- IF YOU CAN MAKE 
WITH ELLEN AND THINK ABOUT IS MAKING APPOINTMENTS REALLY 
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE DOABLE FOR THE CLIENTELE THAT GO 
THERE.  AND WE MAY HAVE TO HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PLAN.  IF YOU 
COULD SPEND TIME ON THAT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. 

>> CITY MANAGER:  HOW THAT BUILDING'S OPERATIONS WILL WORK, WE 
STARTED THE DISCUSSION.  THAT IS TRICKY AND WE AGREE.  PART OF THE 
DISCUSSION PROCESS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON IT IS ON THE 15TH 
RATHER THAN RIGHT AWAY.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  THANK YOU.  I YIELD.   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  THANK YOU.  I WILL SAY, I STOPPED BY CITY HALL 
AND THRILLED TO SEE THE BEGINNING OF SIGNS OF OPENING, INCLUDING 
MANY OF THE NEW PROTOCOLS IN PLACE.  AND VERY CLEAR MARKERS OF 
THE NEW NORMAL.  WHICH INCLUDES BARRIERS SO PEOPLE CAN FEEL -- 
EMPLOYEES CAN BE FEEL SAFE.  I APPRECIATE THE WORK.  AS THE CITY 
MANAGER SAID, I'M SURE -- I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN BE MORE THAN 24/7.  
YOU ARE ALREADY WORKING THAT AND I APPRECIATE IT.  AND I KNOW THE 
MAYOR IS PROBABLY SLEEPING AT THE CITY HALL. 

I WANT TO FALL UP ON A COUPLE OF THE UPDATES MENTIONED RELATED TO 
THE STREETS ISSUE THAT COUNCILLOR TOOMEY AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
TALKED ABOUT.  AND I WONDER IF WE SHOULD CONSIDER CALLING IT "SLOW 
STREETS" INSTEAD OF "SHARED STREETS."  IT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING AND 
WHAT OTHER CITIES ARE DOING.  THAT TITLE MAY LEAD TO CONFUSION.  I 
WOULD THROW THAT OUT THERE AS SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER TO 
ENSURE EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE ARE REALLY DOING IS 
SHARING THE STREET, BUT ALSO THE KEY ELEMENT IS TO BE SLOWING IT 
DOWN AND ENSURING IT IS SAFE FOR PEOPLE. 

AND I'M EXCITED WE ARE ANNOUNCING THIS.  IT WAS MAN WEEKS AFTER 
THE COUNCIL HAD VOTED TO TRY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.  IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT COULD CONTINUE IN THE NEW NORMAL, I THINK IT WILL 
BE VERY GOOD.  I STILL WONDER ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION AND 
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS TALKED ABOUT THE 
FOLKS WHO WERE NOT HEARD, INCLUDING A CLEAR CALL TO ENSURE 
RESIDENTS HAVE THEIR QUESTIONS ANSWERED.  WE HAVE QUESTIONS 
ABOUT CAN I PARK MY CAR.  CAN I GO THERE.  CAN I GET VISITORS AND 
DELIVERIES.  I'M HOPEFUL WE CAN MAKE IT CLEAR.   

I HEARD IT IMMEDIATELY FROM ONE OF MY FAVORITE LOCAL BUSINESSES, 
SAL'S, BONNY'S GARDEN -- YES, PEOPLE CAN ACCESS HIS BUSINESS.  HE WILL 
STILL GET DELIVERIES.  SINCE THERE ARE VERY FEW BUSINESSES ON THE 
STREETS, IF WE HAVEN'T, CAN WE CALL EVERY SINGLE COMMERCIAL ENTITY 
THAT IS ON THE STREETS.  I KNOW THE ONES AT THE END OF THE GARDEN TO 
BAY STREET AND THERE'S ONLY THREE OR FOUR.  ON HARVARD STREET, 
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ACTUAL BUSINESS ENTITIES.  BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL 
WHO WILL BE VERY IMPACTED BY THIS.  INCLUDING IZZY AND ON MAGAZINE 
STREET.  WE MUST KNOW THESE PEOPLE.  CAN WE MAKE SURE THEY GET A

CALL, IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE CAN LOOK AT THAT.  I HAVE A MEETING AT THE 
LOCATION AT 8:00 WEDNESDAY MORNING.  AND ASK IF THERE ARE OTHER 
PEOPLE AROUND THAT MAY JOIN.  WE ARE REACHING OUT AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO REACH OUT AND I'LL TALK ABOUT JOE HOW WE CAN REACH 
OUT TO SOME OF THE LOCATIONS.  

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  IT MAY BE OLD-FASHIONED.  AS I SAID EARLIER, THE 
EXPECTATIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE THIS WAS PUT ON 
THE TABLE TO ALERT THEM THAT IT MAY HAPPEN.  AS WE EXTEND THIS, 
WHICH HOPEFULLY WE'LL DO, WE'LL FOLLOW THE COUNCIL ORDER, WHICH 
INCLUDES AN EXPLICIT CALL TO INCLUDE THE COMMUNITY BEFORE COMING 
OUT WITH A PUBLIC DOCUMENT.  I REALIZE IT IS TRICKY, BUT I REALIZE THAT 
IS HOW WE'LL UNDERSTAND AND GET THE COMMUNITY TO UNDERSTAND 
WHY WE'RE DOING IT.  PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND.  THIS IS FOR SAFETY 
AND ALSO SOMETHING OTHER CITIES HAVE FOUND BUSINESSES ALONG THE 
WAY AND RESIDENTS BENEFIT FROM IT.  THEY APPRECIATE IT.  IT CERTAINLY 
DOESN'T NECESSARILY HURT BUSINESSES AND IT CAN HELP THEM.  I THINK 
THAT MESSAGING, NOT HAVING BEEN OUT THERE TO WAKE UP TO A 
CONCERN THAT YOUR LIVELIHOOD WILL BE HURT, JUST SET US BACK.  AND I 
APPRECIATE YOU ARE HAVING THE MEETING TOMORROW, THAT MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN ABLE TO NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN IF WE HAD THOUGHT IN ADVANCE.  
AND MADE A PHONE CALL LAST WEEK.  ON WEDNESDAY.  SO THE CONCERNS 
COULD ALLAY WITHOUT HAVING TO SCRAMBLE AROUND -- A PART OF THE 
COMMUNITY BEING HURT.  AND OUR EXPECTATION AND HOPE THIS IS 
SPREAD TO OTHERS.  AND WE'LL LEARN FROM THIS AND MAKE SURE IN THE 
FUTURE WE DO IT IN A DIDN'T WAY.  

>> CITY MANAGER:  THEY ARE TRICKY QUESTIONS IN THE SENSE THAT I HAVE 
TO MAKE A DECISION AND SOMETIMES WHEN I GO TO THE COMMUNITY 
FIRST, IT FEELS LIKE THEY SHOULD HEAR ABOUT IT FIRST.  OTHER TIMES WE 
GO TO THE COUNCIL FIRST -- IT IS MY DECISION HERE.  I WANTED TO LET THE 
COUNCIL KNOW.  I THOUGHT WE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WE'LL FOLLOW UP 
WITH A COMMUNITY PROCESS.  TO TRY TO GET THAT RIGHT BALANCE IT IS A 
TRICKY ONE.  NOT EASY.  AND WE'LL LEARN FROM THIS AND MOVING 
FORWARD, WE'LL TRY TO GO MORE TO THE COMMUNITY FIRST.  WE HAVE 
HEARD IT TO BE HONEST, IT IS BOTH WAYS.  AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIGURE 
OUT. 

MOVING FORWARD WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS, WE WANT TO 
MAKE THE COUNCIL AWARE OF SOMETHING BEFORE WE GO OUT TO THE 
COMMUNITY.  BUT WE STILL SAID WE'LL SPEND TIME, BUT I THINK MOVING 
FORWARD, WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS, WE'LL GO TO THE 
COMMUNITY FIRST.  AND REPORT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.  IF THAT IS WHAT 
THE COUNCIL PREFERS.  I HAVE NO OBJECTION.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS?   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  YOU CAN DO IT AT THE SAME TIME.  YOU CAN SAY, 
WE ARE CONSIDERING THIS AND WE'LL TALK TO THE PEOPLE INVOLVED.  AND

WE BOTH KNOW.  ANOTHER QUESTION IS, OTHER TOWNS HAVE OPENED UP 
TENNIS COURTS.  AND LAST TIME I CHECKED, WE HAD A GRAPHIC ABOUT 
HOW EVERYTHING OTHER THAN THE GOLF COURSE, IN TERMS OF 
RECREATIONAL FACILITY IS CLOSED, WHAT IS THE PLAN AND DO YOU HAVE A 
SENSE OF WHAT TENNIS COURTS AND PLAYGROUNDS AND OUTDOOR SPACES 
WILL OPEN?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH THE CITY STAFF, TENNIS 
COURT IS THE NEXT ITEM ON THE LIST PROBABLY.  I THINK WE HAVE CHOSE 
TO GO SLOW.  I THINK IT IS THE RIGHT CHOICE.  I THINK THE NUMBERS ARE 
SHOWING THAT.  WE ARE IN DISCUSSION ON TENNIS COURTS AS WE SPEAK.   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  AND THEN, ONE QUESTION ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH 
DATA.  DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE DEATH RATE COMPARED TO THE 
FIVE-YEAR HISTORICAL AVERAGE.  WE GET UPDATES ON THE NUMBER OF 
CASES AND NUMBER OF DEATHS.  THE REASON BELGIUM RATE IS HIGHER 
THAN ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY PARTICULARLY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
RATE FOR THE POPULATION IS BECAUSE THEY COUNT ALL DEATHS AS LIKELY 
COVID DEATHS AS COVID DEATHS.  COMPARE TO THE FIVE-YEAR HISTORICAL 
AVERAGE, IT COULD BE UP AND IT COULD BE HEART ATTACKS OR 
CARDIOVASCULAR DEATHS OR PNEUMONIA.  AND IN FACT, THEY ARE MOST 
CERTAINLY COVID DEATHS.  DO WE LOOK AT THAT AND IF NOT, HOW 
DIFFICULT IS THAT TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE IS A TRUE UNDERLYING DEATH 
RATE THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE REPORTED AND LINKED DIRECTLY TO 
COVID-19.   

>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.  IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO THAT AT 
THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL.  WE CAN CONFER WITH THE STATE-LEVEL PARTNERS 
TO LOOK AT THE CORRELATION.  I WOULD SAY, RECOGNIZE WHERE WE ARE.  
THAT'S ONE CHALLENGE WE HAD HISTORICALLY GETTING REALTIME DATA 
BACK FROM OUR STATE-LEVEL PARTNERS.  WE CAN TAKE IT BACK TO THE 
STAFF.  THAT MAY BE A STRETCH.  IT IS EASIER TO DO THAT AT THE 
STATE-LEVEL.  IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE US LOOK INTO IT, WE CAN LOOK 
AT THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE AND SEE IF THERE IS ANY POSSIBLE LINK HERE IN 
THE CITY.  COVID.  IF THAT IS THE QUESTION.   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  YES.  FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE.  IT 
IMPORTANT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE TRUE UNDERLYING CAUSES.  AND I 
RECOGNIZE IF IT IS AT THE STATE-LEVEL, IT MAY BE ON THEM TO CONSIDER.  
IT IS ENSURING THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE TRUE SPREAD AND DEPTH OF 
THIS COVID-19 CRISIS THAT WE FACE.  THANK YOU.  THE VICE MAYOR ASKED 
ME QUESTION ABOUT MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE RESTAURANTS OPEN ON 
MONDAY.  I'M DONE.  THANK YOU.   

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER:  THANK YOU.  MY FIRST QUESTION HAS 
TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE COMMISSIONER'S REPORT AND THE ROLE OF THE 
CAMBRIDGE POLICE AND THE BOSTON PROTEST LAST NIGHT.  MANY 
RESIDENTS, LARGE IN-PERSON GATHERINGS, I WENT TO ONE TO PROTEST 
GEORGE FLOYD, I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO, BUT THE RACISM IS A THREAT.  
AND CAMBRIDGE POLICE WERE AT THE GATHERING, WITH THE BOSTON 
POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND WHEN I WAS THERE LAST NIGHT, AND

THOUSANDS OF PEACEFUL PROTESTORS.  ONE OF THE YOUNGEST AND MOST 
DIVERSE PROTESTS.  IT WAS ASTOUNDING TO SEE.  AND I DID SEE THE POLICE 
OFFICERS ESCALATE THE SITUATION A NUMBER OF TIMES.  I'M GLAD TO HEAR 
THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE OFFICERS JOINED THEM.  ONLY SECURING THE 
EMPTY STORES.  FOR PEOPLE PEACEFULLY PROTESTING AND CONFRONTED BY 
POLICE AND TACTICAL GEAR, CAMBRIDGE POLICE ARE CALLED UP TO JOIN 
THOSE RESIDENTS.  YOU CAN EXPLAIN MORE HOW THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE 
MUTUAL AGREEMENT WORK AND WHAT OFFICERS CAN BE CALLED UP TO DO 
IN GENERAL.  FOR INSTANCE, WHAT OTHER EVENTS HAVE CAMBRIDGE 
OFFICERS BEEN CALLED UP FOR, BESIDES LAST NIGHT PROTEST.   

AND THEY ARE CALLED UP FOR MUTUAL AID AGREEMENT, WHO DIRECTS 
THEM.  STILL ONLY THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT OR CAN THEY BE 
GIVEN ORDERS BY BOSTON POLICE DEPARTMENT.  AND SPECIFIC TO LAST 
NIGHT, YOU SAY CAMBRIDGE POLICE SECURE THE VANDALIZED STORE, CAN 
YOU GIVE MORE DETAIL ON WHAT THAT MEANS AND HOW LONG OUR 
OFFICERS WERE IN BOSTON LAST NIGHT.   

>> YOU ASKED NINE QUESTIONS AND I WILL TRY TO ANSWER THEM ALL.  
HOW LONG WERE WE THERE?  WE DISPATCHED AROUND 11:30 AND 
RETURNED TO THE CITY AROUND 4:00 A.M. AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO 
SECURE VANDALIZED LOCATIONS.  THE CRIMINAL ACTS HAD ALREADY 
OCCURRED.  SOME MINOR ATTEMPTS OR MAJOR ATTEMPTS OF LOOTING 
HAD OCCURRED.  THEY WERE NOT IN-PROGRESS AND THE OFFICERS WERE 
THERE TO ENSURE NOBODY ELSE ENTERED.  AND NOBODY ATTEMPTED TO 
ENTER DURING THE TIME WE WERE THERE. 

AND YES IT IS CORRECT THAT WE WERE NOT A PART OF THE INITIAL PROTEST 
OR THE SECURITY FUNCTION.  WE RESPONDED TO MUTUAL AID IS PART OF 
THE STATE LAW.  AND LAST TIME, PRIOR TO LAST NIGHT THAT WE 
RESPONDED TO A MUTUAL AID REQUEST, IS WHEN THE MERRIMACK VALLEY 
HAD THE SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS.  I THINK THAT WAS THE LAST TIME.  THAT IS 
NOT TRUE.  OUR K-9 DOGS WERE REQUESTED TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT 
DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY.  I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE ANYMORE 
QUESTION S.  

>> COUNCILLOR:  ANOTHER SPECIFIC ONE.  THE CITY PROVIDE PROTEST LAST 
YEAR AND THE GENERAL QUESTION IS, WHAT CAN CAMBRIDGE POLICE 
OFFICERS BE CALLED UP TO DO?  AND WHO IS DIRECTING THEM?  ONCE THEY 
ARE CALLED UP.   

>> COMMISSIONER:  TO ENFORCE AND PROTECT THE PEACE IS WHAT THE 
OFFICERS CAN BE REQUIRED TO DO AND PROVIDE GENERAL ASSISTANCE.  
LAST NIGHT, FOR INSTANCE, OF THE 26 CAMBRIDGE POLICE OFFICERS WHO 
RESPONDED, I SENT A DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT, TWO LIEUTENANTS, AND A 
SERGEANT, AND THE REMAINDER OF POLICE OFFICERS.  THEY ARE 
RESPONDING TO A SITUATION IN ANOTHER JURISDICTION, THEY NEVER 
RESPOND WITHOUT CAMBRIDGE POLICE SUPERVISION.  AND ONCE THERE, 
THEY ARE STILL UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE 
SUPERVISORS AND MUST FOLLOW OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS.

>> COUNCILLOR:  THANK YOU.  THAT IS HELPFUL.  AND THE OTHER QUESTION 
I HAVE IS ON A DIFFERENT TOPIC.  PART OF THE POPULATION IN CAMBRIDGE, 
DEPENDS ON UNIVERSITIES -- DEPENDING ON WHETHER CLASS IS IN SESSION, 
FOR JOBS, AND LIVELIHOOD.  NOT JUST FACULTY, BUT JANITORS AND DINING 
HALL WORKERS.  THE QUESTION OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FALL.  THAT 
IS ON MANY FOLKS MINDS.  IT IS UP IN THE AIR TO A LARGE DEGREE.  WHAT 
THE CITY IS GOING TO DO OR THE DECISION IS IN THE UNIVERSITY'S HANDS.  
WHAT TYPE OF GUIDANCE THEY GET FROM THE CITY.  SO, MY QUESTION IS, 
WHAT DISCUSSIONS HAVE YOU BEEN HAVING, DISCUSSIONS WITH OFFICIALS 
AT LESLEY, HARVARD, MIT, AND WHAT TYPE OF GUIDELINE RESTRICTIONS CAN 
WE EXPECT AS DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN SEPTEMBER.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING -- IT IS SO EARLY TO 
TELL.  I THINK SOME UNIVERSITIES HAVE MADE THE DECISIONS.  I KNOW I'M 
IN REGULAR CONTACT WITH SARAH AND TOM LUCY, I HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANY 
NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR OPENING PLANS.  CITY MANAGER?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE TALK TO SARAH AND TOM REGULARLY.  WE HAVE NO 
SPECIFICS IN TERMS OF THE PLAN.  I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET TO THEM THIS WEEK 
FOR AN UPDATE.  IF THERE ARE ANY -- WE'LL BE HAPPY TO CHECK THAT OUT 
AND GET BACK TO YOU.   

>> COUNCILLOR:  THAT WOULD BE GREAT.  A LOT DEPENDS ON WHETHER 
THEY WILL BE IN SESSION.  AND A LOT OF RESIDENTS HERE FOR UNIVERSITY 
DON'T HAVE CARS AND WILL NEED THEM.  WE HAVE TO REACT TO THAT AS A 
CITY.  I APPRECIATE AN UPDATE.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE 
WHO ASKED THE CITY IS INVOLVED IN THE DECISION-MAKING.  I DID RESPOND 
TO MIT'S ANNOUNCEMENT THERE ARE EIGHT OR NINE WORKING GROUPS -- 
AND I ASKED...  WE ARE NOT BEING CONSULTED.  WE CAN ATTEMPT TO DO 
SO WITHOUT TOWING.  WE TALKED ABOUT AND WE WERE TOLD, WE HAVE 
TO DO IT.  MAYBE WE CAN EXPAND IT A LITTLE AND SEE IF WE CAN GET AWAY 
WITH NOT TOWING.  

THE QUESTION I HAVE ABOUT THE PARKS AND THE RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.  
I'M GETTING CONCERNS FROM FOLKS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO LIKE TO 
PLAY BASKETBALL AND UNDERSTAND IT IS PROBABLY NOT SAFE TO REOPEN 
THE COURTS PER SE, WE ARE HEADING INTO SUMMER, WE DON'T REALLY 
HAVE GOOD RECREATIONAL OPTIONS FOR FOLKS.  WHAT IS OUR THINKING 
AROUND THAT AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE 
RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. 

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE ARE WORKING WITH ELLEN TO HAVE THE 
DISCUSSIONS.  RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NO INTENTION TO OPEN UP 
BASKETBALL COURTS RIGHT NOW.  WE LOOK AT IT REGULARLY.  I TALK TO THE 
DIRECTOR ON OPPORTUNITIES.  WE HAVE TAKEN ALL PERMITS OF ALL FIELDS 
OUT OF PLAY UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE 30.  WE WORK WITH THE HEALTH 
OFFICIALS, NOT JUST ON THE CITY SIDE, BUT WHAT WE HEAR FROM FULL 
CITIES TAKE FULL PARKS OUT UNTIL SEPTEMBER.  WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE

RIGHT BALANCE.  ONE THING, WE HAVE TRIED TO REALLY HAVE AS MUCH 
PRECAUTION AS POSSIBLE.  THEY ARE ONGOING DISCUSSES.  TENNIS COURTS, 
BASEBALL COURTS, TOT LOTS, WE WORK CLOSE WITH CLAUDE AND THE 
RECREATIONAL DEPARTMENT.  WHAT WE'LL DO ABOUT SUMMER ACTIVITIES.  
ELLEN HAS IDEAS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.  A LOT ARE VIRTUAL.  

GOOD QUESTIONS.  CONSTANT DISCUSSION.  BUT AT THIS POINT, THERE IS 
NOTHING THAT HAS CHANGED.  OTHER THAN THE FACT, WE HAVE CONTINUE 
TO SAY EVERYTHING IS SHUT DOWN FOR NOW UNTIL JUNE 30.   

>> COUNCILLOR:  I ALSO APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS ABOUT MUTUAL AID.  I 
HAD SIMILAR QUESTIONS.  AND THE REPORTS I GET IS THAT THE BOSTON 
POLICE DID ACT IN A WAY THAT GENERATED A LOT OF THE VIOLENCE, 
UNFORTUNATELY.  AND FOR OUR POLICE TO BE CALLED IN TO HELP OUT.  IT 
DOES FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE THAT WE ARE PUT IN THAT POSITION.  
THEY ARE MISHANDLING THE SITUATION AND OUR OFFICERS HAVE TO BE 
CALLED IN AND BE PUT IN DANGER AND PUT INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY 
MAY GET INVOLVED IN ALTERCATIONS. 

I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT THE POLICIES AND HAVE 
AGREEMENTS WITH THE CITIES, IN TERMS OF WHEN WE AGREE TO PROVIDE 
MUTUAL AID AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS SO WE 
CAN BE ASSURED THE OFFICERS ARE NOT NEEDLESSLY BEING PUT INTO 
DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.  

ON THE TEAR GAS, I'M GLAD TO HEAR WE DON'T HAVE THAT.  IN THE USE OF 
FORCE POLICY, I DIDN'T SEE EXPLICIT PROHIBITION ON THAT.  THAT WOULD 
BE GOOD TO QUANTIFY THAT.  WE HEARD SNIPPETS ABOUT REOPENING, BUT 
I HAVEN'T SEEN A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT LAYS OUT HOW WE'LL 
REOPEN THE CITY.  THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS THAT ARE OPEN-ENDED.  I'M 
WONDERING HOW DO WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE HAVE MORE CLARITY 
ON WHAT IS THE PLAN.  WHAT IS GOING TO OPEN WHEN.  AND I AGREE, 
TODAY IT LOOKS GOOD AND MAYBE WE'RE GETTING TO A POINT WHERE WE 
CAN START TO REOPEN SOME ACTIVITIES WITH APPROPRIATE CONSTRAINTS.  
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A CLEAR SENSE OF THE PLAN.   

>> CITY MANAGER:  I THINK THE POLICE COMMISSIONER WANTS TO 
RESPOND.  

>> COMMISSIONER:  THE USE OF CHOKE-HOLDS WERE NOT EXPRESSLY 
PROHIBITIVE.  IT IS CODIFIED.  ON PAGE 10.  IT SAYS, OFFICERS WILL NOT 
EMPLOY CHOKE-HOLDS, THEY WILL NOT USE ANY TYPE OF MANUAL HOLDS 
THAT ARE INTENDED OR DESIGN TO INFLICT PAIN OR INJURY.  THIS DOESN'T 
INCLUDE ANY TYPES OF MANUAL HOLDS THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO GAIN 
CONTROL, LIKE WRIST-LOCKS AND ARM-BARS.  IT DOES EXPRESSLY PROHIBIT, 
IN WRITING, THROUGH THE POLICY, THE USE OF CHOKE-HOLD.   

>> COUNCILLOR:  MAYBE I MISSPOKE OR YOU MISUNDERSTOOD MY 
QUESTION.  I WAS REFERRING TO TEAR GAS NOT BEING EXPLICITLY BANNED.  
IN MY CURSORY REVIEW.  

>> COMMISSIONER:  THE POLICY SAYS THE ONLY AUTHORIZED WEAPONS ARE

A PR 24 AND BATON AND OC SPRAY.  ONLY AUTHORIZES THOSE TWO.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  NEXT QUESTION IS ABOUT REOPENING. 

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN.  WE 
WORK WITH OTHER MANAGERS AND MAYORS TO TRY TO SEE WHAT WORKS 
THE BEST POLICY.  WE WORK WITH HEALTH EXPERTS.  ON WHEN WE WILL 
OPEN.  WE FELT WE NEED TO GET BACK INTO THE BUILDINGS.  WE PICKED 
THREE WE FELT WILL PROVIDE THE MOST ESSENTIAL SERVICES.  THAT'S WHY 
WE PICKED JUNE 1.  FOLLOWING THE GOVERNOR'S GUIDELINES.  WE HAVE 
WATCHED THE SIX-FOOT RULE AND MONITORED THE 25%.  ON JUNE 15, WE 
ARE OPENING UP TWO OTHER BUILDINGS.  AND THINKING ABOUT 
APPOINTMENTS WHEN WE OPEN UP TO THE PUBLIC.  THAT IS UP FOR 
DISCUSSION.  I THINK ALL OF THEM ARE SUBJECT TO WHAT HAPPENS IN 
TERMS OF THE SPIKE HAPPENING, DO THINGS GO UP.  WHAT IS THE 
GOVERNOR'S PLAN.  25 TO 50.  HOW DO WE PROTECT RESIDENTS AND THE 
EMPLOYEES.   

THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.  WE MEET EVERY DAY FOR TWO OURS THIS TO 
TRY TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR EMPLOYEES, AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE 
RESIDENTS GET THE BEST SERVICES WE HAVE.  AND I MEET WITH MANAGERS 
AND MAYORS FROM OTHER CITIES AND TOWNS ON THIS REGULARLY.  AND 
WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CITY, BUT WHAT IS BEST 
FOR EMPLOYEES.  THERE'S NO PLAYBOOK THAT SAYS WHEN WE SHOULD 
OPEN, THIS IS WHY, WE ARE GOING ONE BY ONE, TAKING THE FIELD.  WE 
KNOW WITH THE TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT, RESIDENTIAL STICKERS IS A 
PRIORITY.  DO WE OPEN UP TO RESIDENTS EARLIER.  WE HAD OUTSIDE BOXES 
SET FOR TAX BILLS AND WATER BILLS.  THAT'S A GREAT SUCCESS.  SHOULD WE 
OPEN THE TREASURY UP, CITY CLERK HAS THOUGHTS.  INSPECTIONAL 
SERVICES AT THE OTHER BUILDING.  BUILDING PERMITS ARE COMING BACK.  

WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES AND TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
LOOK AT ALL THE NUMBERS ON WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDER COVID.  AND 
DETERMINE WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS.  WE HAVE NOT WRITTEN THE 
PLAYBOOK.  WE ARE TRYING TO TALK TO SEE WHAT THE PLAYBOOK SHOULD 
BE.  I THINK BASED ON THE CONDITIONS, WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE BUT TO 
SAY, WE'LL CONTINUE TO MEET AND ALL OF THE PLAYBOOKS COULD CHANGE 
DRAMATICALLY.  THE GOVERNOR COULD SAY, GO TO 25-50.  OR MAYBE NOT.  
IF THE SPIKE GOES UP.  MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE AT 25.  WE ARE WORKING 
WITH THE STATE.  THERE IS NO SIMPLE FORMULA.  I CAN TELL YOU, WE'RE 
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO COME UP WITH THE BEST FORMULA FOR 
OUR EMPLOYEES AND RESIDENTS.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR?   

>> COUNCILLOR:  THANK YOU.  NEXT QUESTION IS AROUND MEMORIAL 
DRIVE.  YOU MENTION THE PILOT PROGRAM WAS SUCCESSFUL.  I ASSUME WE 
WILL NOW GO TO REGULARLY CLOSING ON SUNDAYS.  BUT WHEN WILL WE 
LOOK AT IF WE CAN DO MORE THAN THAT.  

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE ARE IN DISCUSSION WITH CLAUDE AND WITH DCR 
ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT STEPS MAY BE.  WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FINAL.

HOPEFULLY, SOON WE COULD MAKE FURTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR?   

>> COUNCILLOR:  THANK YOU.  I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DATA.  I 
WON'T ASK THEM ALL RIGHT NOW.  NOR DO I NECESSARILY NEED ANSWERS 
RIGHT NOW.  THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO US.  AND I 
HAVE BEEN TRACKING IT CAREFULLY, DOING MY OWN ANALYSIS.  IT WOULD 
BE HELPFUL TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION.  FOR EXAMPLE, HOW MANY 
TESTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED.  AND I KNOW THAT CLAUDE HAS BEEN 
TELLING US THAT ON MONDAY NIGHTS, WHY CAN'T WE HAVE REGULAR 
REPORTS THAT NOT ONLY TELL US HOW MANY POSITIVE TESTS RESULTS, BUT 
HOW MANY TESTS OVERALL.  AND I THINK COUNCILLOR SIMMONS ASKED 
THIS, TO GET MORE GRANDULAR DATA ON TESTING THAT WAS DONE IN THE 
PORT OR TO HAVE MORE GRANDULAR DATA ON THE DIFFERENT HOT SPOTS 
AS WE WERE DETECTING THEM.   

ALSO, IN THE NURSING HOMES, IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME FROM THE DATA, 
THAT WE ARE GOING BACK TO TEST PEOPLE AGAIN.  OR IT IS A ONE-TIME 
THING.  THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE CLARITY.   

>> PARTICIPANT:  I WILL DO THIS IN REVERSE.  THANK YOU FOR THE 
QUESTIONS.  I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THE THREE ROUNDS OF TESTING THAT 
WE DID IN THE NURSING HOMES.  WE COMPLETED THAT BETWEEN APRIL 9 
AND MAY 5.  AND THAT WAS NOT REQUIRED, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN 
TOWARD HAVE AN EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM.  AND OUR PILOT PROJECT HAS 
SINCE BEEN REPLICATED ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH AND THERE'S 
ALREADY A REPORT GENERATED SHOWING WHERE THE LONG-TERM CARE 
FACILITIES, RESIDENTS AND THE STAFF HAVE BEEN TESTED.  WE MET THE 
STANDARD FOR HAVING THE FACILITIES AND HAVING CONDUCTED THOSE 
TESTS.  THAT BEING SAID, WE DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS AT THIS MOMENT TO 
GO BACK INTO THE NURSING HOMES, RECOGNIZING FULLY WELL THE REASON 
WE WENT IN APRIL TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE 
POTENTIAL POSITIVE RATES WERE IN THOSE FACILITIES.  

AND IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF TESTS PERFORM, THE STATE DOES 
GENERATE SOME REPORTS.  THAT IS WHAT I WAS REPORTING OUT JUST 
NOW.  WE CAN SEND YOU THE CITATION.  I THINK YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION 
IS ABOUT THE PARTICULAR TEST THAT WE ADMINISTER, WHETHER IT IS 
THROUGH THE MOBILE OUTREACH, AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH THE 
SENIOR BUILDINGS AS WELL AS THE EAST CAMBRIDGE TESTING TENT, 
ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE, WE CAN TRY 
OUR BEST AND REPORT OUT.  THAT IS PROBABLY AS BEST AS WE CAN DO, 
ALTHOUGH, MAYBE THERE ARE PROVIDERS PROVIDING COVID TEST IN THE 
CITY.  I THINK THAT'S YOUR META QUESTION.  WE CAN TAKE IT BACK TO THE 
STAFF.  BUT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ABOUT NURSING HOMES, WE HAVE 
COMPLETED THE THREE ROUNDS.  AND WE ARE STILL CONTINUING WITH OUR 
HOT SPOTS.  THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO NORTH CAMBRIDGE NEXT WEEK, 
BASED ON THE DATA. 

>> COUNCILLOR:  MY FINAL QUESTION IS AROUND RECOVERIES.  IT IS HARD

TO FOLLOW, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE RECOVERY DATA IS LAGGING QUITE 
BEHIND.  AND I NOTICED, THERE IS PRESUMED RECOVERY AFTER 42 DAYS.  
WHICH SEEMS TO GIVE US A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON.  
IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK TO THAT.  SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THE 
RECOVERY AS VERY INCOMPLETE OR DO WE TAKE THAT TO BE THE ACTUAL 
RECOVERIES.  IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW RECOVERY IS DEFINED.   

>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.  AND YOU ARE SPOT-ON.  THERE'S A LAG 
TIME IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND THE PERCENTAGE AND THE 
NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT HAVE RECOVERED FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH 
THE VIRUS.  SO, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE SHOWING 231 CASES OUT OF THE 
THOUSAND CASES THAT HAVE MET THAT MARK AS BEING THOSE IN 
RECOVERY.  OR WHO HAVE RECOVERED.  THOSE ARE ABOUT A QUARTER OF 
THE POOL DEMONSTRATING THAT.  IT IS A LAG TIME.  I BETTER PICTURE 
WOULD BE IN TWO OR THREE WEEKS, GIVEN WE HAVE JUST GONE THROUGH 
THE MAJOR WAVE OF TESTING.  WE HAD THIS BLITZ WITH THE SENIOR 
BUILDINGS, HAD THIS IN THE PORT, SO TO YOUR POINT, THERE'S A LAG.  JUST 
KNOW, WE EXPECT THAT PERCENTAGE TO GROW.  IF YOU GO BACK A MONTH 
AGO OR TWO MONTHS AGO, IT WAS A SMALLER PERCENTAGE.  YOU ARE 
SPOT-ON AND I EXPECT IT TO INCREASE.  IN THE COMING WEEKS.   

>> COUNCILLOR:  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN HAS A FOLLOW-UP 
QUESTION.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  HI.  THANK YOU.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE 
IT RIGHT.  A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT MUTUAL AID AND GLAD 
TO HEAR THAT IF THE OFFICERS DO HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY, 
THEY ARE SUPERVISED BY CAMBRIDGE PERSONNEL OR CAMBRIDGE 
ADMINISTRATORS.  WE HAD ISSUES WITH SOME OFFICERS THAT COME TO 
CAMBRIDGE TO DO DETAILS AND THINGS THAT DON'T EXACTLY FOLLOW OUR 
RULES.  IT IS GOOD TO KNOW WE SEND OUR SUPERVISORS THERE.  MY 
QUESTION IS, I WANT CLARIFY BECAUSE COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN SAID WE 
SHOULD LOOK AT THE MUTUAL AID POLICY.  IS IT A POLICY OR IS IT A STAY 
LAW.  WHEN I HEAR POLICY, I THINK, CAMBRIDGE POLICE DEPARTMENT 
POLICY, THAT IS SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT OR CHANGE.  BUT IF IT IS A 
STATE LAW, WE HAVE TO BARK UP A DIFFERENT TREE.  POLICY OR A STATE 
LAW WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO WHETHER WE WANT TO OR NOT?   

>> I MIGHT HAVE GLOSSED OVER IT TOO FAST.  MUTUAL AID IS A STATE LAW.  
MGL CHAPTER 40.  NOT A POLICY.  WE DO HAVE THINGS LIKE WHAT YOU 
MENTIONED.  MEMORANDUMS OF AGREEMENT WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS 
THAT GOVERN OUR THEY COME INTO THE CITY AND WORK TRAFFIC DETAILS.  
MUTUAL AID IS STATE LAW.  IT GRANTS US THE AUTHORITY TO GO AND KEEP 
THE PEACE.  WHEN I SAY KEEP THE PEACE, ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE 
COMMONWEALTH WHERE MUTUAL AID IS CALLED FOR.  THERE ARE 
STIPULATIONS WHERE JURISDICTION HAS TO ASK FOR IT.  YOU CAN'T ASSUME 
MUTUAL AID.  IT IS A STATE LAW.  NOT A POLICY THAT WE ENTER INTO.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  ANYTHING WE WANT TO DO, IT WILL HAPPEN

AT THE STATE LEVEL?   

>> ABSOLUTELY.  STATE LAW.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  I HEAR NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.  COUNCILLOR 
TOOMEY?   

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY:  JUST A COMMENT ON THIS MUTUAL AID.  THANK 
GOD WE HAVE IT.  AND ALSO THE POLICE AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENTS.  AND 
WE HAVE SEEN -- WE HAD A TERRIBLE FIRE IN EAST CAMBRIDGE AND 
NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES ASSIST THE CAMBRIDGE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THE 
SAME IN THE PAST.  CAMBRIDGE NEEDED OUTSIDE HELP FROM OTHER 
DEPARTMENTS.  MUTUAL AID IS TO HELP ONE ANOTHER AND TO PROTECT 
AND SAFEGUARD THE CITIZENS.  I THANK GOD WE HAVE THAT.  OTHER 
COMMUNITIES WILL RESPOND TO CAMBRIDGE IF WE ARE IN A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION AND NEED ASSISTANCE.  I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT ON 
THAT.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  ANYONE ELSE?   

>> COUNCILLOR:  IF I CAN ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION.  I DO UNDERSTAND 
THAT MUTUAL AID IS A STATE LAW.  THE QUESTION IS, DO WE HAVE ANY 
STIPULATIONS AROUND WHAT KIND OF AID AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND 
POLICE ACTIONS.  I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FIRE RIGHT NOW.  DO WE HAVE 
ANY STIPULATIONS ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF AID WE'RE WILLING TO PROVIDE.  
ANY CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE COULD SAY WE CAN'T PROVIDE AID OR 
WE DON'T WANT TO.  JUST BECAUSE IT IS STATE LAW IT DOESN'T MEAN WE 
HAVE TO DO WHATEVER BOSTON ASKS US TO DO.   

>> SO, AS AN EXAMPLE OF YESTERDAY, THE INITIAL REQUEST FOR AID CAME 
IN AT 9:00.  AT 9:00 I HAD SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO PROTECT CAMBRIDGE 
AND NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO ANOTHER AGENCY.  BASED 
ON THE MANPOWER I HAD AVAILABLE AFTER 11:00, I WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE 
MUTUAL AID.  YES, THE JURISDICTION ALWAYS HAS THE LEEWAY TO BE ABLE 
TO SEE IF THEY CAN PROVIDE MUTUAL AID.  WE HAPPEN TO BE FORTUNATE 
HERE TO BE A FULL-SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  WE HAVE THE TRADITIONAL AND 
NONTRADITIONAL METHODS.  WE HAVE OUR OWN SPECIAL RESPONSE 
TEAMS.  WE HAVE OUR OWN ORDINANCE DISPOSAL UNITS.  OTHER AGENCIES 
AND DEPARTMENTS DON'T HAVE THAT LUXURY.  WHEN THEY NEED IT, THEY 
HAVE TO BORROW THINGS LIKE A BOMB-SNIFFING DOG OR A ROADBLOCK 
FROM US TO GRAB A SUSPECTED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
HAVE THOSE CAPABILITIES.  AND THEN, IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, 
YOU TRADITIONALLY THINK OF MUTUAL AID WITH A BUNCH OF SMALLER 
DEPARTMENTS HELPING OUT OR LARGER DEPARTMENT HELPING OUT A 
SMALLER DEPARTMENT.  THERE ARE RARE OCCASIONS WHEN A LARGE 
DEPARTMENT, LIKE BOSTON OR STATE POLICE HAVE TO CALL FOR MUTUAL 
AID.   

>> COUNCILLOR:  THANK YOU.   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  I HAVE ONE FOLLOW-UP ON THE MUTUAL AID.  IT 
WAS NOTED THAT IF OUR OFFICERS GO INTO BOSTON, WE FOLLOW OUR

POLICY.  WHAT ABOUT IF WE CALL IN OFFICERS INTO CAMBRIDGE.  DO THEY 
HAVE TO FOLLOW OUR OWN POLICIES BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE AWARE 
OF THEM.  AND THIS MAY BE A LARGER QUESTION, IT IS NOT REALLY DIRECTLY 
RELATED TO COVID.  GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT 
AND THE REPORTS WE ARE HEARING ABOUT PEACEFUL PROTESTORS BEING 
UNFORTUNATE LY EGGED AND THE POST 9:00 PROBLEMS COMING FROM 
POLICE OFFICER ACTION, I'M CONCERNED, IF IT HAPPENED IN CAMBRIDGE, 
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO TELL ANYONE THAT COMES INTO OUR CITY THEY 
HAVE TO FOLLOW DIFFERENT RULES.  OR OUR OWN RULES. 

>> COMMISSIONER:  FIRST, IF SOMEONE CAME INTO CAMBRIDGE, I WILL BE 
THANKFUL FOR THE HELP THEY CAME TO PROVIDE THAT WE NEEDED 
COMING TO OUR ASSISTANCE.  SECOND, THEY WOULD BE UNDER THEIR 
DEPARTMENT'S RULES AND REGULATIONS.  BUT ALL OF THAT IS UNDER THE 
UMBRELLA OF STATE LAW AND WE VALUE TO FOLLOW STATE LAW AND 
ADHERE TO IT.  TO DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT HEADS AND VARYING DEGREES 
AND RULES AND REGULATION, ANY OFFICER IS UNDER THEIR JURISDICTION 
RULES AND REGULATIONS.

FUNCTIONS AND HOW WE ARE USING IT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS A

>> COMMISSIONER:  AS THE MAYOR READ OFF IN HER INTRODUCTION, IT IS 
FOCUSSED ON REDUCING POVERTY AND INCARCERATION.  THEY DO IT 
THROUGH INTERVENING WITH AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS.  NOT JUST AT-RISK 
YOUTH, BUT AT-RISK INDIVIDUALS BY PROVIDING OUTREACH AND 
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES.  THEY PERFORM FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS VIOLENCE 
INTERRUPTERS AND THEY USE THE TERMINOLOGY OUTREACH WORKERS.  
THEY INTERCEDE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL, HELP WITH CONFLICT RESOLUTION.  
WE HAVE BEEN DOING WELL WITH YOUTH VIOLENCE IN THE CITY.  TYPICALLY, 
WE AVERAGE 13 SHOOTING VICTIMS PER YEAR.  TWO YEARS AGO, WE HAD 
FIVE SHOOTING VICTIMS.  LAST YEAR THERE WAS ONE SHOOTING VICTIM.  
AND WE WANT TO SEE THE POSITIVE GAINS STAY IN THE PLACE.  ONE OF THE 
PROBLEMS WE HAD, WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DEDICATED OUTREACH WORKER 
JUST FOR CAMBRIDGE.  WHEN CONFLICT ARISES BETWEEN CAMBRIDGE 
YOUTH AND YOUTH FROM ANOTHER CITY, THE OUTREACH WORKER 
ASSIGNED TO OTHER CITY WILL ALSO TRY TO INTERVENE IN CAMBRIDGE.  
HOWEVER, THAT PROVIDES TRUST ISSUES WHEN THE INDIVIDUAL IS SEEN AS 
TRYING TO HELP INDIVIDUALS FROM SOMERVILLE.  IF THEY HAVE BEEF WITH 
AN INDIVIDUAL FROM CAMBRIDGE, WELL THE TRUST ISSUES ARE THERE.  
BETTER IF WE HAVE OUR OWN DEDICATED OUTREACH WORKER.   

THEY WILL BE STATIONED OUT OF THE HEADQUARTERS IN CHELSEA.  BUT ALL 
WORK DONE HERE IN CAMBRIDGE WITH OUR AT-RISK POPULATION.   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  THANK YOU FOR THAT.  ARE WE NOT DOING 
THIS WORK INTERNALLY TO THE DEPARTMENT?  WHAT IS THE ORGANIZATION 
PROVIDING THAT AND WE CANNOT DO OURSELVES. 

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  WE ARE DOING THAT WORK THROUGH THE 
DEPARTMENT, THROUGH THE FAMILY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE UNIT.  THE FOCUS 
DETERRENT UNIT.  THEY INTERVENE WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST 
LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN VIOLENCE OR BE THE VICTIM OF VIOLENCE.  ONCE 
AGAIN, IT IS ABOUT -- THE OFFICERS AND THE YOUTH RESOURCE OFFICERS 
AND THE FAMILY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE OFFICERS HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF 
CREDIBILITY WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY.  AND WITH THE AT-RISK 
INDIVIDUALS.  THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT POLICE OFFICERS, IT MAKES IT 
SOMEWHAT EASIER FOR SOME OF THAT POPULATION TO DEAL WITH THE 
INDIVIDUAL AND AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED, THAT POSITIVE 
INTERVENTION, NO MATTER WHERE IT COMES FROM IS SOMETHING THAT 
WE INVITE INTO THE CITY.  WE HAVE WORKED WITH ROCA, BUT TO WORK 
WITH THEM ON A FORMALIZED BASIS WITH THE CAMBRIDGE RESOURCE IS 
OPTIMUM.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  WE HAVE VICE MAYOR.  ARE YOU ALL SET WITH YOUR 
QUESTIONS?  VICE MAYOR?   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  AND THANK YOU TO THE CITY 
MANAGER FOR PLACING THIS ON THE AGENDA.  I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
GO TO ROCA IN CHELSEA AND MEET WITH JASON AND THE TEAM.  AND SEE 
THEIR GOOD WORK HAPPENING RIGHT THERE IN PERSON.  THERE IS WORK 
BEING DONE WITH ROCA IN THE PAST.  BUT AS THE COMMISSIONER SAID, 
THERE WAS SOME TRUST ISSUES GIVEN THE OUTREACH WORKER WAS SPLIT

HIS TIME BETWEEN SOMERVILLE AND CAMBRIDGE.  THIS WAS AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO HAVE A DEDICATED 
OUTREACH WORKER TO DO THAT WORK AND TO KEEP OUR RESIDENTS FROM 
EXPERIENCING RECIDIVISM.   

ROCA HAS A HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS.  97% OF THOSE ENROLLED IN 20192024 
MONTHS WITH NO NEW INCARCERATIONS.  THEY DO COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL 
HEALTH THERAPY.  THEY DO WITH ROCA INDIVIDUALS -- INDIVIDUALS THAT 
ARE WORKING WITH ROCA.  IT IS AN AMAZING WAY TO SHIFT WORK TO A 
NONPROFIT THAT IS DOING GOOD WORK IN THE COMMUNITY.  I HAVE A 
QUESTION FOR THE COMMISSIONER. 

WHAT IS THE TIMELINE, I KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A 
WHILE.  WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR HAVING AN OUTREACH WORKER IN 
PLACE AND IT SAYS THE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, 
MENTAL HEALTH AND OCCUPANCY SERVICES.  CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT 
THOSE SERVICES LOOK LIKE FOR US.   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  WHAT THAT MEANS IS, AS YOU SAID, ROCA TAKES 
THE AT-RISK INDIVIDUAL AND HELPS THEM TO BE A CONTRIBUTING MEMBER 
OF SOCIETY.  THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT, DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL.  SO 
SOMETIMES THAT MEANS HELPING GETTING AN -- THEY HAVE ALL THE 
RESOURCES AT ROCA.  GETTING STABLE HOUSING.  SOMETIMES IT MEANS -- 
ALMOST ALWAYS MEANS STABLE EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING.  AND TAKE 
THEM FROM BEING -- I DON'T WANT TO SAY BEING A MENACE, TRANSFORM 
THEM FROM ONE LIFE AND HAVE THEM BE CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS TO 
SOCIETY.  

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THE TIMELINE FOR AN OUTREACH WORKER?   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING, IF THE COUNCIL WERE 
TO APPROVE THE FUNDS TONIGHT, WE CAN ENTER INTO THE CONTRACT 
WITH ROCA AS SOON AS WE GET IT TO THE LAW DEPARTMENT AND THEY CAN 
EXECUTE IT FOR US.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  AND MY LAST QUESTION.  OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S NO 
IN-PERSON ACTIVITIES RIGHT NOW DURING TO COVID.  MAYBE THAT 
CHANGES IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.  WE ARE NOT DOING 
IN-PERSON, HOW DO THEY DO THE AGGRESSIVE OUTREACH WITH RESIDENTS.  

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE NOT DOING 
IN-PERSON.  SOME WORK IS IMPORTANCE THAT IT TRANSCENDS THAT.  I 
THINK THEY ARE STILL DOING SOME FACE-TO-FACE WHEN IT IS SERIOUS 
ENOUGH AND WHEN THEY NEED TO.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  I THINK IT IS AN INCREDIBLE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR US.  AND I'M GLAD THE CITY IS MOVING FORWARD WITH 
PARTNERING WITH ROCA AND MAKING THIS AN OUTREACH WORKER 
AVAILABLE FOR OUR AT-RISK RESIDENTS.  I HAVE SEEN THE WORK THEY HAVE 
DONE IN CHELSEA.  AND THE TEAM I MET ON MY FIELD TRIP AND I LOOK 
FORWARD TO THIS PARTNERSHIP. 

>> CITY MANAGER:  I WANT TO THANK THE VICE MAYOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP

IN THIS AREA.  I WAS HAPPY TO WORK TO GET THIS UP.  I THINK IT IS A GREAT 
ASSET TO THE CITY AND TO THE DEPARTMENT.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER?   

>> COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER:  I HAVE A PROCEDURAL QUESTION 
ABOUT THIS.  IT IS A LITTLE WONKY.  IF I DON'T STATE IT CORRECTLY, LET ME 
KNOW AND I WILL RESTATE.  THIS FUNDING IS AIMED AT REDUCING GANG 
VIOLENCE AND INTERACTION WITH THE POLICE.  AND THINGS IN 
MINNEAPOLIS, LED PEOPLE TO ASK -- FUND A SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAM, AND 
NOT EXPECT THE POLICE TO DO THE WORK OF A MENTAL HEALTH WORKER.  I 
WANT TO ASK IF THE CITY HAS LOOKED AT COORDINATING THIS PROGRAM 
AND OTHERS LIKE IT, AIMED AT REDUCING VIOLENCE AND RECIDIVISM WITH 
OTHER DEPARTMENTS.  AND IF NOT, WHY THE PROGRAM IS BEING FUNDED 
THROUGH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT?   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  ONE OF THE REASON, THE PRIMARY REASON IS TO 
REDUCE RECIDIVISM.  THEY ARE ALREADY IN CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL 
JUSTICES AND THEY ARE AT A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK.  MEANING, OFTENTIMES, 
THEY ARE LIKELY TO SHOOT OR BE SHOT.  IT IS ABOUT A COMPLETE MOVE 
AWAY FROM THAT LIFE.  PRIMARILY BECAUSE THAT'S THE VESSEL WHICH IT 
HAS ALWAYS OPERATED.  NOT SAYING WHAT YOU JUSTICE SAID COULDN'T 
HAPPEN SOMEWHERE, WE WORK WITH THE INDIVIDUALS TRADITIONALLY.  
AND TO PASS THEM OFF -- YOU CAN LOOK AT IT IN A MANNER THAT IS REALLY 
NOT COMING THROUGH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.  

ROCA IS AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY.  JUST ANOTHER TOOL THAT THE CITY HAS 
IN ITS TOOL BAG.   

>> COUNCILLOR:  I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.  (COUNCILLOR 
SOBRINHO-WHEELER SPEAKING).  HOW THE POLICE DEPARTMENT MANAGES 
THIS.  AND INTERACTS WITH ROCA.  AND IF YOU THINK IT IS LESS EFFECTIVE 
FOR SOME REASON IF IT WERE THE HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT THAT 
WERE MANAGING THIS.  MAYBE ROCA HAS ACCESS TO THE POLICE DATABASE 
OR SOMETHING SPECIFIC THERE.  IT IS A TRADITION AND A LEGACY PROGRAM 
OF THIS IS WHAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS ALWAYS DONE.   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE 
HIGH DEGREE OF HARM OR PERPETUATED A HIGH DEGREE OF HARM.  THAT 
MEANS THEY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SERIOUS VIOLENCE AND WE CONNECT 
THEM TO A FOCUS DETERRENCE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE RUN.  ROCA 
PERFORMS THE SAME FUNCTION, JUST NOT WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 
CAPABILITY.   

WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE AGENCY TO HAND OFF INDIVIDUALS 
EFFECTIVELY.  AND AS THE VICE MAYOR MENTIONED, INDIVIDUALS IN THAT 
DEDICATED PROGRAM, THEY HAVE A HIGH DEGREE OF SUCCESS WITH THEM.  
SO, EFFECTIVELY TAKES THAT INDIVIDUAL AND IF ALL GOES WELL, AT 97% OF 
THE TIME IT DOES, THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOW REMOVED ENTIRELY FROM THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.  I DON'T GET -- I DO GET THE OVERARCHING IDEA 
OF THE QUESTION.  I DON'T KNOW IF I TRULY APPRECIATE IT.  I THINK I

UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEMS HAVE WORKED IN THE PAST.  WHERE THEY 
ARE HEADING AND WHAT TYPE OF QUESTIONS WE SHOULD BE ASKING AND 
PUSHING.  AND I APPRECIATE THAT.  IT IS HELPFUL.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BEFORE WE MOVE TO 
ROLL CALL?   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  CAN I ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION OF THE POLICE 
COMMISSIONER.  CLIENTS ARE REFERRED TO ROCA THROUGH THE COURT 
SYSTEM.  CORRECT?   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  MOST OFTEN, YES.  WE ALSO DO BRING 
INDIVIDUALS THROUGH ROCA.  WE HAVE SO MANY DIVERSIONARY 
PROGRAMS IN CAMBRIDGE.  WE GO DIRECTLY TO ROCA FROM TIME TO TIME.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  AND THANK YOU.  THAT'S WHY I IMAGINE THIS 
FUNDING WILL GO THROUGH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE IT -- 

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE CONTACT.  
THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE EITHER HAD A HIGH PROPENSITY TO COMMIT 
VIOLENT ACTS OR TO BE A VICTIM OF A VIOLENT ACT.  YOU MAY NOT 
NECESSARILY INITIALLY WANT SOMEONE NOT TRAINED IN VIOLENCE OR NOT 
ABLE TO INTERVENE IN A MATTER WITH THE FORCE OF LAW AT THEIR 
DISPOSAL.  INITIALLY.  HISTORICALLY COME THROUGH THE COURT THE WITH 
THE DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.  SOCIAL SERVICES, WE 
PARTNER WITH THEM SO MUCH THAT LINE IS BLURRED ANYWAY.

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  THANK YOU.  I DID A BACK OF THE ENVELOPE 
CALCULATION ON THIS AMOUNT.  WE COULD HAVE HOUSED HUNDREDS OF 
PEOPLE IN HOTEL ROOMS IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME FOR THE SAME AMOUNT 
OF MONEY.  I'M CURIOUS WHY WE DECIDED TO GO THIS ROUTE.  FROM THE 
VERY BEGINNING, I ASKED ON A COST ESTIMATE ON WHAT THE SHELTER 
WOULD COST US.  WE HAVEN'T BEEN GIVEN THE NUMBERS UNTIL NOW. 

AND I UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATIONS IN HUMANITARIAN AND WE ARE 
TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE, BUT THE UNDERGROUND EXPERIENCE THAT I'M 
AWARE OF FROM TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AT THE MOMENT 
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE SHELTER IS THAT IT IS NOT GREAT.  WHEN THE 
STATE MADE HOTELS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO TESTED POSITIVE, I 
THOUGHT THAT WOULD CREATE A TEMPLATE, IF THE STATE CAN DO THAT 
FOR PEOPLE THAT TEST POSITIVE, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT FOR 
ANYONE WHO NEEDS SHELTER.   

REPEATEDLY TOLD NO AND NO SUCH PROGRAM HAS MATERIALIZED.  I'M A 
LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DECIDED TO REALLY DOUBLE-DOWN ON 
THIS ROUTE.  AND SPENDING A LOT MORE MONEY FOR WHAT ULTIMATELY 
SEEMS LIKE A LESS THAN IDEAL OUTCOME COMPARED TO GIVING PEOPLE 
SAFE PLACE TO SHELTER IN A HOTEL ROOM WHICH YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH 
FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OR SIMILAR AMOUNT OF PAYMENT.   

>> CITY MANAGER:  I GUESS I CAN JUMP IN FIRST.  I THINK AS WE STATED 
NUMEROUS TIMES, WE GOT AHEAD OF EVERYBODY AND FELT WE NEEDED TO 
PROTECT THIS POPULATION.  WE PUT A COMMITTEE TOGETHER TO DECIDE 
HOW WE CAN BEST DO THAT.  THIS WAS THE SITE THAT WAS SELECTED.  WE 
PUT EVERYTHING IN PLACE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN THIS IS MAYBE LESS THAN 
WE THOUGHT, TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE WE NEVER USED THE FLOOR.  FROM 
OUR POINT OF VIEW, THE HEALTH EXPERTS AND THE PEOPLE THAT MANAGE 
THE SITE, ALL WE HEAR IS PRIMARILY POSITIVE THINGS.  THERE ARE 
CONCERNS ABOUT ANY OTHER TYPE OF CLOSED SITUATION, AND THEY 
THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST SCENARIO TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WE 
PROVIDE. 

I THINK THERE HAS BEEN MONEY INCREDIBLY WELL SPENT.  I'M PROUD OF 
THIS PROGRAM.  I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE.  WHEN IT COMES TO 
THIS POPULATION, I THINK WE HAVE EXCEEDED ANY CITY IN TERMS WHAT WE 
HAVE SPENT, WHAT WE TRIED TO DO.  AND I DON'T KNOW IF COMMISSIONER 
BARD OR CLAUDE WANT TO ADD ANYTHING.   

>> COMMISSIONER BARD:  THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD ON, I'M A 
LIFE-LONG CIVIL SERVANT.  I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THINGS AS THEY ARE AND 
DEAL WITH THE RESOURCES I HAVE IN FRONT OF ME.  I GET SOME OF US CAN 
TALK ABOUT THE NORMATIVE AND WHAT OUGHT TO BE AND IDEAL.  YOU 
LOOK IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PARAMETERS WE HAD TO OPERATE IN.  WE 
HAD TO FIND SUITABLE ACCOMMODATION IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  WE 
TRIED EVERYTHING.  WE ASKED EVERY HOTEL IN THE CITY.  WE DIDN'T HAVE 
EIGHT MONTHS OR A YEAR TO COME TO AGREEMENT.  WE HAD A SHORT 
WINDOW OF TIME.  WE HAD TO DECLUTTER THE EXISTING SHELTER TO STOP 
THE VIRUS FROM SPREADING RAPIDLY.  WE KNOW DENSITY IS ITS FRIEND.  WE

HAVE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO OPERATE.  

WHAT WE HAD AVAILABLE TO US, IT WAS THE WAR MEMORIAL.  IT WAS THE 
BEST OPTION OUT OF EVERYTHING WE HAD AVAILABLE.  I ACTED ON THAT.  
CITY MANAGER, THE RESOURCES OF THE CITY AND THE ENTIRE REGION, 
PUBLIC HEALTH TO PUBLIC WORKS TO HUMAN SERVICES.  EVERYBODY IS IN 
THIS PLACE, ALL THE MOMENTUM IS BUILT UP.  WE ASK YOU TAKE THAT 
MOMENTUM AND HALT AND GET A RESOURCE THAT IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE.  
I WANT TO PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WE HAD TO OPERATE IN.  
THAT'S THE COMMENT. 

>> CLAUDE:  WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A PUBLIC HEALTH GLOBAL PANDEMIC.  
TO THE RESOURCES, TO OUR DECISION, I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT 
WE HAVE AS AN ASSET AT THE WAR MEMORIAL CENTER.  A REMINDER, YOU 
HAVE THREE PODS WE PULLED TOGETHER OVER THE COURSE OF A 
TWO-WEEK PERIOD.  YOU CAN IMAGINE FROM THE TIME WE HAD THE 
QUARANTINE AREA BUILT, ISOLATION UNIT ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND THE 
OVERFLOW SPACE.  RECOGNIZING THE COMPLEMENT OF WHAT WE HAVE 
THERE WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS.  WE HAVE THE CAMBRIDGE HEALTHCARE 
FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAM, BAY COVE, THE SUPPORT THEY PROVIDE.  
SECURITY CONTRACT AND THE MEALS.  THE NINE YARDS.  IT IS NOT THE TAJ 
MAHAL, BUT YOU CAN'T ARGUE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER TIME.  THE 
POINT IS TO MITIGATE THE SPREAD.  AND I CAN TELL YOU, WHAT YOU ARE 
NOT SEEING OR HEARING, GIVING WHAT WE HAVE DONE, SYMPTOM CHECKS, 
PRE-SCREENING, AND DAILY CLINICS, YOU DON'T SEE POSITIVE CASES COME 
OUT OF THE FIELDHOUSE.  I DON'T WANT TO JINX US, BUT I WANT TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE WE WORK HARD TO MAKE SHOWER ON BEHALF OF THE 
BROADER COMMUNITY THAT WE MITIGATE THE SPREAD.  NOT JUST IN THE 
AREA HOMELESS SHELTERS, BUT AT THAT SITE.  WE HAVE DONE WELL.  
THANKS IN LARGE PART TO THE PARTNERS.  I WOULD SAY, THERE'S A PRICE 
TAG, BUT APPLES TO APPLES, FOLKS HAVE BEEN WONDERING HOW THIS IS 
EVEN AFFORDABLE.  AND JUST KNOW, THE HOTEL MODELS, REGIONAL 
ISOLATION CENTERS, THEY HAVE A STAFFING COMPLEMENT.  NOT JUST THE 
BUILDING.  THEY HAVE SECURITY.  MEALS.  THEY HAVE SERVICE PROVIDERS.  
AND WE HAVE A MICROCOSM OF THAT REFLECTED AT THE WAR MEMORIAL 
CENTER.  I APPLAUD THE CITY FOR HELPING TO PULL THAT OFF.  IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN OVER NIGHT.  BUT WE MADE IT HAPPEN AND WE'RE STILL THERE.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLORS, SPECIFIC QUESTIONS?   

>> COUNCILLOR:  I THOUGHT YOU WERE OPENING IT UP.  

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  THERE IS A RAISED-HAND FEATURE ON ZOOM.  NOW I 
GET THEM.  COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?  ANY FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS 
BEFORE I MOVE ON TO YOUR OTHER COLLEAGUES?   

(SILENCE) 

HELLO.  WE GO TO COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER.

RESIDENTS TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE.  IT HAS WANT HAPPENED.  AND SOME 
HOTELS -- THERE ARE PROVIDERS THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO HOUSE 
HOMELESS RESIDENTS.  I TOURED A SITE WITH STAFF THE CITY, NONPROFIT 
SHELTER PROVIDERS.  I HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM MANY WHEN THE CITY IS 
GOING TO PROVIDE ROOMS FOR HOMELESS RESIDENTS.  IT PAINS ME VOTE 
AGAINST THIS.  WHEN WE FIRST AUTHORIZED IT, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A 
FIRST STEP TO PROVIDE ROOMS.  I NEVER ASKED THE CITY MANAGER OR 
ANYONE TO HALT THE WAR MEMORIAL SITE.  AND I HOPE IT WAS 
SOMETHING TO BUILD ON.  AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE INFORMATION 
ABOUT IT.  OTHER CITIES CAN DO THIS.  HOUSE HOMELESS RESIDENTS AND 
CAMBRIDGE IS NOT.  WHY NOT?  WHAT ARE THE SPECIFICS?  WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN STEPS IN THAT DIRECTION.  AS THE CITY COUNCILLOR, I'M NOT SURE 
HOW TO GET THE MESSAGE THROUGH.  WE SHOULD DO MORE, PROVIDE 
ROOMS FOR HOMELESS RESIDENTS TO BETTER SOCIALLY DISTANCE.  I 
APPRECIATE ALL OF THE WORK, I REALLY DO.  AND I WILL BE VOTING NO 
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS NOT GOING FAR ENOUGH.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN AND THEN VICE MAYOR.  AND 
BACK TO COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  THANK YOU.  THIS IS APPROPRIATION IS FOR -- 
TO PAY FOR THINGS WE HAVE DONE.  UNTIL NEAR THE END OF THIS MONTH.  
THIS IS NOT ADDITIONAL MONEY?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  CORRECT.  IT IS FRONTED BY DEPARTMENT BUDGETS AND 
NOW COME UP FOR APPROPRIATION, IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE $500,000 
FROM HARVARD AND MIT.  IT IS ALL PAID FOR, EXCEPT FOR MONTH OF JUNE, 
FOR FOOD AND CLEANING.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  APPROPRIATION TO PAY OUR BILLS?   

>> CITY MANAGER:  YOU CAN SAY THAT, YES.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  I THINK WE CAN ALL DO A 
BACK-OF-THE-ENVELOPE BUDGET AND COME UP WITH NUMBERS.  I THINK 
THE HOTELS WOULDN'T GIVE US ROOMS FOR FREE.  IF YOU DO A MODEST 
$200 NIGHT FOR A HUNDRED PEOPLE.  WE'D HIT THAT $2 MILLION MARK 
QUICKLY.  YOU HAVE TO STAFF WITH SOCIAL WORKERS, SECURITY.  I DON'T 
THINK PEOPLE FULLY KNOW WHAT HAS GONE INTO THE OTHER PROGRAMS.  
AND I WANT TO THANK COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER FOR SETTING UP 
TOURS FOR THE CITY WITH THE ENGLISH SCHOOL.  I CHECKED WITH FOLKS 
FROM HEALTHCARE FOR THE HOMELESS AND SOME OF THE SHELTERS TO 
LOOK AT THE SPACE.  THAT SPACE WOULD BE -- THERE IS A FEELING IT COULD 
BE GOOD FOR A CERTAIN SUBSET, BUT NOT NECESSARILY THE POPULATION 
THAT I THINK WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.  THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT 
PART OF THE SHELTER SYSTEM, BUT STILL OUT THE STREET.  AND THERE ARE 
CONCERNS FROM THE PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THAT SPACE.  

SO, I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF IMPASSION CALLS TODAY ON PUBLIC 
COMMENT.  I APPRECIATE THAT.  I HAVE SAID, I CAN CALL A MEETING ABOUT 
HOMELESSNESS AND GET THREE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.  IF I CALL A MEETING 
ABOUT BAMBOO, I WILL HAVE 500.  AND I'M GLAD TO SEE PEOPLE ARE

REALLY TAKING AN INTEREST IN SUPPORTING THIS POPULATION.   

I ALSO THINK IT IS NOT FAIR TO IMPLY THE CITY IS DOING NOTHING OR THE 
CITY DOESN'T CARE OR THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT AN ISSUES WITH 
PROVIDING HOTEL ROOM THAT SOMEHOW WE ARE BEING NEGLIGENT.  AND I 
THINK WHOEVER IS SORT OF STOKING THAT FIRE, NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE 
MORE GENUINE WITH THEM.  PEOPLE ARE WORKING REALLY HARD.  IT IS NOT 
PERFECT.  WE HEARD ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THE CONDITIONS ARE AT THE 
WAR MEMORIAL.  I HAVE BEEN THERE FOUR TIMES.  I HAVE GONE THERE TO 
CHECK.  I HAVE GONE THERE TO SEE WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE.  IT IS THE 
SHELTER.  IT IS NOT GREAT.  NOBODY IS SAYING IT IS GREAT.   

I THINK SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE SAYING THINGS THAT THEY DON'T 
NECESSARILY HAVE ALL THE FACTS ABOUT.  I WISH WE COULD HAVE A MORE 
HONEST DISCUSSION RATHER THAN ONE THROWING ROCKS.  

I WILL SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS.  AT THE END OF 
THE DAY, THIS HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE.  IT HAS NOT BEEN EVERYTHING, BUT 
IT SERVED ITS PURPOSE.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  WE GO TO VICE MAYOR.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.  
FIRST ONE IS TO THE CITY MANAGER.  WE TALK ABOUT THE HEALTHCARE FOR 
THE HOMELESS AND OTHER SERVICES BEING ON-SITE.  BUT IT OCCURS TO ME 
IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE HOUSING LIAISON ON SITE TO WORK 
WITH RESIDENTS TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING.  HOW ARE WE UTILIZING 
MAURA IN THIS MOMENT AND THE OTHER RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE 
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MULTISERVICE CENTER TO DO THAT DEEP 
RESOURCE WORK IN FINDING PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THE SHELTER 
RESIDENTS AT THE WAR MEMORIAL.   

>> CITY MANAGER:  GREAT QUESTION.  WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH 
MAURA, SHE IS NOT ON THE LINE TONIGHT.  I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET HER TO 
GET SOME OF THE SPECIFICS.  THAT REALLY IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL.  HOW TO 
FIND PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD ALSO 
LOWER THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED THIS.  AS WE LOOK FOR OTHER 
POTENTIAL SITES IN THE LONG RUN, IT WOULD LESSEN THE POPULATION.  I 
DON'T HAVE ALL THE SPECIFICS ON THAT, BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT AND WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH TO ADDRESS THAT 
QUESTION.  I'LL BE HAPPY TO GET YOU MORE INFORMATION.  THAT IS THE 
SCENARIO THAT YOU WANT TO GO FOR.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  I THINK A REPORT FROM MAURA ON 
WHERE SHE IS AND WHAT RESOURCES SHE NEEDS TO EXECUTE ANY SORT OF 
PERMANENT HOUSING PLAN FOR THE RESIDENTS OF THE WAR MEMORIAL.  
WE CAN ARGUE ABOUT HOTEL ROOMS OR DORM ROOMS, AT THE END OF 
THE DAY, THE UNHOUSED RESIDENTS DESERVE A HOME.  THANK YOU FOR 
PROVIDING THAT REPORT.  I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A FURTHER 
CONVERSATION TO HOW TO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO MAURA.  

THE SECOND QUESTION IS, IT FEELS LIKE WE HAVE BEEN HOME FOR AN

ENDLESS AMOUNT OF TIME.  AUGUST IS AROUND THE CORNER AND IF WE 
THINK ABOUT OPENING THE SCHOOLS IN THE FALL AND PROVIDING ENOUGH 
TIME IN BETWEEN HAVING A HOMELESS SHELTER AND HAVING A GROUP OF 
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, HOW ARE WE LOOKING FORWARD?  THINKING 
ABOUT POST AUGUST AND WHAT WE MIGHT NEED FOR RESIDENTS WHO 
MAY STILL NEED TO BE IN A DECLUTTERED SHELTER SCENARIO?  THERE PLANS 
AND MEETINGS HAPPENING.  I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING ONCE 
CRLS OPENS.  

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE HAVE BEEN MEETING.  WHEN THE SITE WAS FIRST 
OPENED, THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION THAT IF SCHOOL DIDN'T COME BACK 
EARLY, AND I FELT IT WAS NOT, TO BE HONEST, BASED ON THE MEETINGS 
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.  COME SEPTEMBER, WE MAY BE IN A 
SITUATION THAT WE COULD CLOSE THE SHELTER AND EVERYTHING WOULD 
BE OKAY.   

CLEARLY ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS AGO, I WOULD SAY WE REALIZED 
THAT AS WE COMMIT TO GET THIS FACILITY READY FOR SCHOOL FOR 
SEPTEMBER, WE MAY NEED AN ALTERNATIVE SITE.  WE ARE ACTIVE IN THAT 
DISCUSSION TO SEE IF AND WHEN WE'LL BE CLOSING THE SITE SO IT CAN GO 
BACK TO THE SCHOOL SITE.  WHAT MIGHT BE THE BEST-CASE SCENARIOS.  WE 
ARE IN EARLY DISCUSSION WITH A LOT OF THE SCENARIOS.  COMMISSIONER 
BARD IS ONE OF THE LEADS.  AT THIS POINT, I CAN'T GIVE YOU SPECIFICS, 
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT WE ARE LOOKING ALL OVER TO SEE WHAT IS 
THE NEXT BEST SOLUTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.  AND WE'LL 
HAVE SOMETHING, I TALKED TO THE SCHOOL REGULARLY, ABOUT OUR PLAN 
IN TERMS OF WHEN WE WOULD BE LEAVING AND WHAT WE DO TO MAKE 
SURE THE SCHOOL IS IN THE CONDITION IT SHOULD BE.  IT IS A GREAT 
QUESTION.  I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION YET.  I'M SURE WE'LL COME UP WITH 
ONE.   

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  THANK YOU.  AGAIN, I THINK AS YOU HAVE 
NOTICED, IT IS AN IMPASSION ISSUE.  IN THE LOOP AS YOU CAN KEEP US AS 
YOU MOVE FORWARD ON A SOLUTION THAT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN WHAT 
IS HAPPENING AT THE WAR MEMORIAL, I THINK KEEPING US IN THE LOOP 
AND COMMUNICATING ABOUT WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE AND GETTING THAT 
FEEDBACK FROM US WILL HELP US MOVE FORWARD IN A POSITIVE WAY.  
THANK YOU.   

>> CITY MANAGER:  I AGREE.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR NOLAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR 
ZONDERVAN.  

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  THIS WAS A VERY TOUGH DECISION AS THE VICE 
MAYOR SAID.  SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT.  THE ENTIRE COUNCIL IS CONCERNED.  I BELIEVE AND UNDERSTAND 
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT THIS WAS A CASE OF 
BUILDING A PLANE WHILE FLYING IT.  WE DIDN'T KNOW IF WE'D NEED A 
HOSPITAL, WHICH IS WHAT WE SET UP REALLY.  AND WE HAD A SEPARATE 
QUARANTINE SECTION AND A SHELTER.  COULD WE HAVE DONE IT ANOTHER

PLACE?  MAYBE.  REMEMBER, THIS WAS ALREADY A CERTIFIED SHELTER.  THE 
ONLY ONE THAT WAS PUBLICLY-OWNED AND READY TO AT LEAST BE 
TRANSFORMED.   

AND ON THE OTHER HAND, AS WE LOOK AT THE COST, WHAT WE ARE BEING 
ASK TO APPROVE, WHICH I WILL SUPPORT, SHOWS US THE COST FOR 2.675 
MILLION DOLLARS.  AND AS COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN NOTED, THAT MAY ADD 
UP OVER TIME.  HOWEVER, ON A PER NIGHT BASIS, IT MAY WELL BE THAT 
WITH THE SOCIAL WORKER, IF WE HIRED A FULL-TIME ONE, IT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN LESS.  HOWEVER, WE ARE NOW IN A POSITION WHERE IT IS THE 
BEGINNING OF JUNE, WE HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD AND PLAN FOR THE 
FUTURE.  I REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS HELPED, THIS 
PROVIDED SOMETHING.  WAS IT PERFECT?  NO.  WE WORKED REALLY HARD.  
HOWEVER, HOW IS IT WE CAN BE ASSURED WE'LL BE DEBRIEF AND THE 
QUESTION TO ASK NOW IS...  IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN, IS THIS THE BEST WAY 
TO APPROACH IT.  THAT'S HOW WE LEARN, THAT'S HOW WE MANAGE, AND 
THAT'S HOW WE END UP WITH A BETTER SOLUTION THE NEXT TIME.  

IF THE DEBRIEF IS...  YES, THIS IS THE BEST.  WE PUT IT TOGETHER AND 
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW, WE'D DO THE SAME THING, THEN WE CAN 
BE ASSURED OF THAT.  IF THE ANSWER IS -- YOU KNOW, HAD WE KNOWN 
WHAT THE STATE WOULD DO, WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WERE, WE MAY NOT 
HAVE DONE THIS.  WE MAY WELL HAVE CONTRACTED WITH AN ENTIRE 
HOTEL.  MAYBE AN ENTIRE HOTEL THAT WAS ALREADY EMPTY SINCE HOTEL 
BOOKS WENT DOWN 90% OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.  MAYBE 
RENTED THE ENTIRE HOTEL, 80 OR 100 ROOMS AND HIRE A SOCIAL WORKER 
AND SAVE MONEY.  I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.  I DO KNOW PEOPLE WITH 
EXPERTISE AND EXPERTISE I DON'T HAVE IN WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS 
POPULATION, WHO BY THE WAY, IS ALSO AT GREAT RISK.  WE NEED TO 
PROVIDE BE SOCIAL SERVICES AND IT HAS BEEN SAID, AND MANY OF THE 
MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND THE SUBSTANCE USE CHALLENGES THAT 
THE POPULATION DEALS WITH, IT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE PROVIDED IN 
A REGULAR HOTEL. 

I DO HOPE AND MAYBE MY QUESTION IS, WILL THERE BE AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO DEBRIEF TO ENSURE THAT THE CITY LEARNS FROM THIS AS WE MOVE 
FORWARD AND DO THE BEST WE CAN TO SEE HOW IT IS THAT THE FUTURE OF 
THE SITE WILL UNFOLD AS WE TURN BACK TO THE NEW NORMAL FOR 
SCHOOLS.  SO, WE CAN ALL BE ASSURED THAT WE LEARN WHATEVER 
LESSONS TO BE LEARNED.   

>> CITY MANAGER:  WE STILL ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WE SPEAK.  I 
THINK CLAUDE'S ANNOUNCEMENT OF WHAT OUR GOAL WAS AND WHERE 
WE ARE RIGHT NOW WITH THE POPULATION THAT IS IN THERE, THERE CAN'T 
BE MORE MONEY SPENT BETTER THAN WHAT WE SPENT THE MONEY ON.  WE 
HIT A HOME RUN IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SAID WE WANTED TO DO.  AND I 
THINK WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT.  THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW 
YOU WOULD MANAGE, HOW YOU WOULD OPERATE IF THERE WERE 
INDIVIDUAL ROOMS.  WE HAVE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THAT.  AND 
THE OPENNESS OF THE WAR MEMORIAL AND THE WAY IT IS SET UP HAS BEEN

STRONGLY PRESENTED AS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO.  AND I THINK IT IS 
SOMETHING WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NOW ON WHAT IS THE BEST NEXT 
STEP.  THIS HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT MONEY.  THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE FELT 
WAS THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES WE WANT TO PROVIDE TO 
KEEP THE HOMELESS POPULATION AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.  I THINK WE HAVE 
ACCOMPLISHED THAT.  WE SHOULD ALL BE PROWLED OF WHAT WE 
ACCOMPLISHED.  -- PROUD OF WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED.  IF YOU TAKE THE 
MISSION AND THE RESULTS, I WOULD SAY IT IS 100% OF WHAT WE COULD 
HAVE ASKED FOR.  WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS GOING FURTHER.  WE 
ARE OPEN TO SEE HOW WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER.  COMMISSIONER BARD, 
ELLEN, MYSELF, CLAUDE, WE HAVE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY ON THIS.  
ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEKS AS WE DETERMINE WHERE 
TO GO FROM HERE.  

I THINK FOR WHAT THIS MONEY HAS COST THE CITY AND FOR WHAT IT HAS 
ACCOMPLISHED, IT IS WELL-SPENT MONEY AND SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD 
TO MOVE FORWARD.   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I SUPPORT IT.  I SAID, WE 
DID A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.  WE CAN'T 
DEBRIEF BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE.  NO MATTER, THERE ARE LESSONS 
TO BE LEARN AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THERE IS A REPORT AT SOME POINT SO 
WE CAN LAY OUT THE VARIOUS OPTIONS.  I THINK EVERYBODY THAT WORKED 
ON THIS, IT CLEARLY HIT SOME REAL URGENCY IN THE COMMUNITY TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BEST OPTIONS ARE.   

>> CITY MANAGER:  THANK YOU.   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  THANK YOU.  I UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION 
THAT WE WERE RESPONDING TO.  I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE WHO JUST 
SPOKE, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT DOING FORWARD, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO 
DO.  BOTH THINGS CAN BE TRUE.  WE CAN SAY WE DID THE BEST WE COULD 
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT'S FINE.  IT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO 
KEEP DOING THAT GOING FORWARD.  I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS 
RESISTANCE TO GIVING PEOPLE THE DIGNITY AND COMFORT OF THE 
INDIVIDUAL ROOMS.  AND IN FACT, THAT'S WHAT THE STATE DOES WHEN 
SOMEONE TESTS POSITIVE.  THAT'S THE SAME EXACT POPULATION, WE BRING 
IT UP, WE SAY IT IS A CHALLENGING POPULATION AND ALL THE ISSUES ABOUT 
WHY THEY CAN'T BE IN INDIVIDUAL HOTEL ROOMS.  IF THEY TEST POSITIVE 
FOR COVID-19, THEY ARE IN THE HOTEL ROOM. 

I DON'T GET IT.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE INSIST THAT THIS IS THE ONLY 
WAY FORWARD.  I UNDERSTAND THE PAST IS THE PAST.  GOING FORWARD, 
WE SHOULD REALLY THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO 
SERVICE THIS POPULATION.  WE HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE STREETS.  EVEN 
RIGHT NOW.  UNDER THESE VERY DIRE CIRCUMSTANCES.  AND WE ARE NOT 
ADDRESSING THEIR NEEDS THROUGH THE SHELTER OR BE IT ANY OTHER WAY.  
AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS.  AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS 
PUSHBACK AND THIS RESISTANCE TO DOING THAT.  I HAVE TO KEEP HEARING 
FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING THROUGH IT AND EXPERIENCING THIS 
REALITY UNTIL WE GET TO A POINT WHERE WE DECIDE TO DO SOMETHING

ABOUT IT.   

AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO SAY THIS WAS A GREAT SOLUTION, IT DOESN'T 
ADDRESS A LARGE POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS 
THROUGH THE WORST PANDEMIC IN A HUNDRED YEARS AND WE DON'T 
HAVE ANSWERS FOR THEM.  AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY SHARE MY THOUGHTS.  AND 
THEN JUST WANTING TO MOVE THE -- I WILL GO TO COUNCILLOR TOOMEY 
AND THEN MAKE FINAL COMMENTS.  COUNCILLOR TOOMEY?   

>> COUNCILLOR TOOMEY:  THANK YOU.  I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST WHO 
VOTE AGAINST THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY, WE WORK DILIGENTLY 
TO SECURE PASSAGE OF THAT AND SECURE PASSAGE OF CHANGING THE 
DEFINITION OF ROOMING HOUSES SO SOME OF THE BIG PROPERTIES WE CAN 
ACQUIRE TO HOUSE THE INDIVIDUALS IN THERE.  AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
OVERLAY WILL HELP ACHIEVE THAT.  I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE VICE MAYOR 
ALLUDED TO.  COMING UP WITH PERMANENT SOLUTIONS TO HELP THE 
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.  WE HAVE THE POWER TO DO THAT.  AND 
HOPEFULLY, WORKING TOGETHER, WE'LL DO THAT.  THOSE ARE TWO 
AVENUES I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT ARE IN OUR HANDS TO PROVIDE TO 
HOUSE THE INDIVIDUALS.  I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT DISCUSSION.   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  THANK YOU.  I WASN'T GOING TO BRING UP THE 
HOUSING OVERLAY, BUT AS AN INTRODUCTION, THERE ARE MANY WAYS FOR 
US TO BUILD HOUSING.  INCLUDING LAND TRUST AND OTHER THINGS.  AND 
ANYBODY WANTS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING.  EVERYBODY.  THE QUESTION IS 
THE METHOD.  GETTING BACK TO THE POINT OF DISCUSSION, I FEEL THE 
EXPERTS LEAD THE WAY.  AND SURE WE SHOULD EVALUATE WHAT IS TRIED 
THE FIRST TIME, BUT GIVEN THE TIME TABLE, THE EMERGENCY, I FEEL 
TOTALLY COMFORTABLE WITH THIS EFFORT.  IT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED 
AND IT IS ONGOING. 

WE MAY NOT DO THAT THE NEXT ROUND, BUT GIVEN ALL THE INPUTS AND 
THE PANDEMIC THAT ALMOST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, I FEEL TOTALLY 
COMFORTABLE WITH THIS EFFORT AND WILL BE VOTING YES, OBVIOUSLY.  I 
WILL VOTE YES ON THE REQUEST FOR FUNDING.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  THANK YOU.  I THINK YOU TOOK THE WORDS OUT OF 
MY MOUTH.  THE PANDEMIC IS NOT OVER.  VERY LIKELY THAT WE'LL LIVE 
WITH THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME.  I THINK WE HAVE ALL -- AS THE VICE 
MAYOR SAID, WE WONDER ABOUT THE LONG-TERM QUESTIONS AND THEY 
ARE IMPORTANT.  WE NEED A SOLUTION FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.  IF 
THERE ARE HOTELS, I IMAGINE, IF IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, IF WE CAN 
DO IT, WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ON THAT.  AND SO, I THINK I 
WILL SUPPORT THESE APPROPRIATIONS.  I THINK BEING SELF-REFLECTIVE, 
EVALUATIVE, WE'LL HAVE DO THAT FOR EVERY AREA.  INCLUDING THIS ONE.  
AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO THAT.  THIS IS NOT AN END TO THIS 
DISCUSSION AND WHAT HAPPENS.  IT IS A BEGINNING.  WE HAVE MANY 
MONTHS AHEAD OF US.  I RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVE FORWARD TO A 
ROLL CALL VOTE.  FOUR ROLL CALL VOTE THE INVOLVED WITH THE

ANCESTRY IN MY FAMILY.  AND WHAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING TODAY WITH 
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN MINNEAPOLIS AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  THANK YOU.  I LOVE THIS.  IT IS GREAT.  I SAW THE 
VIDEO.  AND ASSUMED COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN WAS BEHIND IT AND 
ENJOYED THE PARTICIPATION.  I'M CURIOUS IF WE KNOW IF THERE ARE 
CAMBRIDGE STUDENTS, AT THE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF BOSTON, I 
DON'T THINK THE GERMAN SCHOOL, NOT LOCATED IN CAMBRIDGE, BUT 
MAYBE HAVE ONE OR TWO PEOPLE, AND THE FRIEND SCHOOL -- IT ENDS IN 
EIGHTH GRADE.  IF WE CELEBRATE JUST SENIORS, IT MAY BE GOOD TO 
AMEND THIS.  IF WE DON'T JUST CELEBRATE SENIORS, IT MAY BE 
APPROPRIATE TO ADD THE OTHER SCHOOLS THAT ADD IN EIGHTH GRADE.

MY COLLEAGUES AND CO-SPONSORS WANT TO ADD ANYTHING BEFORE I GO 
TO COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN WHO HAS HIS HAND UP.  OKAY.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS ORDER.  
A QUICK NOTE.  I HAVE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MANAGER 
AND OTHERS, MORE SPECIFICALLY AROUND UNHOUSED POPULATIONS AND 
ESPECIALLY NOW RESTAURANTS ARE GOING TO BE REOPENING, THEY WON'T 
BE AT FULL CAPACITY.  AND PLACES, I THINK LIKE STARBUCKS IN HARVARD 
SQUARE, THAT WAS ACCOMMODATING HOMELESS FOLKS TO COME OUT OF 
THE HEAT, THEY WON'T HAVE THE SPACE TO ALLOW THAT.  I WANT TO LET 
YOU KNOW, IN ADDITION, WE ARE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS.  AND WE 
HAD THE VICE MAYOR, THE MAYOR, MYSELF, AND COMMISSIONER BARD, 
ELLEN, WE ALL TOOK A TOUR OF A DAY PROGRAM IN DC WHEN WE WERE 
DONE THERE IN EARLY MARCH.   

AND MICHAEL FROM THE CENTRAL SQUARE BID WAS GOING DOWN TO 
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND WAS GOING TO TOUR IT.  AND THEN ALL THIS STUFF 
HAPPENED.  JUST THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND I WANT TO 
UPDATE FOLKS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY 
AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND MAYBE SOMETHING PERMANENT.  I'M HAPPY 
TO VOTE FOR THIS.

COLLEAGUE AND HE REMINDED ME OF A CONVERSATION WE HAD AT THE 
LAST COUNCIL.  WE DO THIS WHERE WE OPEN BUILDINGS UP TO 
ACCOMMODATE THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.  I KNOW WE 
HAD A PROGRAM WHERE THE CITY BOUGHT FANS AND THEY WOULD HAND 
THEM OUT, THEY ARE WONDERFUL AND INEXPENSIVE, BUT THEY JUST MOVE 
AROUND HOT AIR.  ONE THING WE ASKED AND TALK ABOUT AGAIN, AND 
MAYBE WE CAN DO IT UNDER A SEPARATE COVER, NOT TO AMEND THIS, NOT 
EVERYBODY CAN GET OUT OR WANT TO GO OUT OR JUST GOING OUT COULD 
BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THEM.   

IF THAT IS THE CASE, I THINK WE SHOULD AT LEAST LOOK AT THE IDEA OF AIR 
CONDITIONERS FOR SOME OF THE MORE DELICATE SENIORS, IN PARTICULAR.  
I WILL LEAVE THE ORDER AS IT STANDS, BUT I MAY BRING IN ANOTHER ORDER 
JUST TO ASK FOR US TO LOOK TO THAT FOR THOSE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE 
THE MOBILITY THAT ALLOW THEM TO GET OUT.  BUT ALSO DON'T HAVE AIR 
CONDITIONING.  THANK YOU.  I YIELD THE FLOOR.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  ABSOLUTELY.  I HAD SOME PRELIMINARY 
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AFTER A FEW RESIDENTS DID REACH OUT.  WE 
CAN'T AFFORD THESE AIR CONDITIONERS, SOME ARE QUITE EXPENSIVE.  I 
THINK I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON FIGURING OUT IF WE CAN GET AIR 
CONDITIONERS TO THE MOST VULNERABLE.  FOR THOSE WHO CAN'T GET 
OUT.  ON THE ORDER, MOVE TO ADOPT.  COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  THANK YOU.  I WANTED TO ADD MY VOICE IN 
SUPPORT OF WHAT MY COLLEAGUE SAID.  AND I REMEMBER WATCHING A 
MEETING OF THE CITY COUNCIL YEARS AGO DISCUSSING THIS VERY ISSUE OF 
PROVIDING AIR CONDITIONING TO SOME OF OUR PUBLIC HOUSING 
RESIDENTS.  THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE.  WE KNOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE 
GETTING WORSE, THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM.  I HOPE WE 
CAN LOOK AT IT AND COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE PEOPLE 
WITH THE COMFORT AND SAFETY.  HEAT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS 
WHETHER-RELATED EVENT.  SO I FULLY SUPPORT TRYING TO FIND A 
SOLUTION TO THIS.  THANK YOU.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  ROLL CALL?  COUNCILLOR CARLONE?   

>> COUNCILLOR CARLONE:  JUST QUICKLY, A LOT OF OLD BUILDINGS IN 
CAMBRIDGE DON'T HAVE THE ELECTRICAL CAPACITY.  WHEN WE OWNED A 
HOUSE I WAS SURPRISED WE HAD TO REWIRE THE OUTLETS THAT WERE 
GOING TO HAVE AN AIR CONDITIONER.  SO, WHEN COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
MOVES FORWARD ON THAT PROPOSAL, YOU MIGHT EVEN INCLUDE 
NECESSARY ELECTRICAL UPGRADES.  BECAUSE THAT IS THE FIRST RESPONSE 
WE'RE GOING TO GET.  IT IS A BIGGER ISSUE, BUT TOTALLY NEEDED.  I AGREE 
WITH THE NEED.  THANK YOU.

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  THANK YOU.  THE SHORT VERSION DOESN'T QUITE 
COVER IT.  AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE COUNCIL.  DUE TO THE 
GLITCH, THERE ARE TWO LINKS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED.  THEY WERE 
URGING THIS TYPE OF ACTION.  AND ALSO A STUDY DONE OF THE IMPACT OF 
TRANSMISSION THROUGH PLASTIC.  LET ME LET PEOPLE KNOW, WHAT IT IS 
ABOUT, URGING THE GOVERNOR TO ALLOW REUSABLE BAGS TO BE USED IN 
SHOPPING.  BACK IN MARCH, I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF TAKING SWIFT AND 
CERTAIN ACTION TO STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE.  
ESPECIALLY TO PROTECT FRONTLINE WORKERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN 
GROCERY STORE.  AND THEY ARE VERY VULNERABLE.  THERE ARE UNKNOWNS 
SINCE WE HAVE GAINED INSIGHT.  MASKS WERE NOT REQUIRED UNTIL APRIL 
AND IT TOOK WEEKS FOR THE CDC TO RECOMMEND THEM INSIDE.  ONE 
IMMEDIATE STEP IS TO BAN REUSABLE BAGS.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE NOW 
STUDIES THAT PROVE REUSABLE BAGS ARE AT LEAST AS SAFE AS PLASTIC AND 
LIKELY MORE SAFE.  AS A RESULT OF THIS NEW RESEARCH, THE SCIENTIFIC 
COMMUNITY MADE IT CLEAR THAT CONTRACT TRANSMISSION RISK IS 
ALMOST NONEXISTENT FROM THE TYPE OF REUSABLE BAG.  AND WHILE THE 
CDC DIDN'T RULE IT OUT, IT STATES CLEARLY ON THE WEBSITE, TOUCHING 
SERVICES OR OBJECTS NOT THE MAIN WAY THE VIRUS CAN SPREAD, IF IT 
SPREADS AT ALL.  IF IT COULD, WHAT IS INTERESTING, WHAT WE NOW KNOW 
IS THAT COVID LAST LONGER ON PLASTIC AND STAINLESS STEEL.  WHICH IS UP 
TO SEVEN DAYS COMPARED TO TWO DAYS ON CLOTH.  WHICH IS WHAT MOST 
REUSABLE BAGS ARE AND A FEW HOURS ON PAPER.  AS A RESULT OF THIS 
RESEARCH, THE RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS, LET ME JUST SAY A FEW.  
CONSERVATION LAW FOUNDATION, TOXIC ACTION CENTER, ET CETERA.  THEY 
ARE ASKING THE GOVERNOR ALLOW THE USE OF REUSABLE BAGS. 

IT TURNED OUT THAT ONE OF THE PROPONENTS OF TRYING TO GET TOWNS 
TO STOP HAVING A BAN ON PLASTIC BAGS WAS THE ACTUAL PLASTIC 
PRODUCERS.  NO SURPRISE.  THE PRODUCTION OF PLASTIC IS VERY 
POLLUTING, BUT BURNING THEM RELEASES DANGEROUS POLLUTANTS INTO 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. That the City Manager be 
and hereby is requested to 
report back to the City Council

at least one accessible public 
building, with proper safety 
measures for social distancing 
and good hygiene, can be open 
during the summer for 
residents to cool down.

THE MASS COMMUNITIES.  AND THAT AFFECTS RESPIRATORY HEALTH AND 
PUTS RESIDENTS AT GREAT RISK FOR ILLNESSES.  AND INCINERATORS, WHICH 
IS WHERE THE PLASTIC GOES, THEY ARE LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED 
COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CHALLENGE THE SITE 
OR OPERATION OF THE FACILITIES.  SIX OF SEVEN INCINERATORS ARE 
LOCATED IN COMMUNITIES DESIGNATED AS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE 
COMMUNITIES. 

THE PLASTIC INDUSTRY HAS JUMPED ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROPHET AND 
SPREAD MISINFORMATION CLAIMS PLASTIC IS THE ONLY SAFE MATERIAL TO 
USE.  AND THEY ARE ATTEMPTING TO SWAY PEOPLE AWAY FROM RETURNING 
TO USING REUSABLE BAGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  THE COMPANIES 
ARE VERY SKILLED AT UTILIZING THIS INFORMATION TO SELL PRODUCTS.  AND 
THEY HAVE BEEN BACKED INTO A CORNER AS MANY CITIES, INCLUDING 
CAMBRIDGE, BEGAN TO BAN SINGLE-USE PLASTICS.  SO, I HOPE THAT WHAT 
WE CAN DO IS ENCOURAGE THE GOVERNOR AND JOIN THIS RANGE OF VERY 
IMPORTANT ORGANIZATIONS ASKING TO REPEAL THE ORDER.  WHAT HE CAN 
DO AND BEING PROPOSE, ANYONE THAT BRINGS A REUSABLE BAG, SHOULD 
HAVE TO BAG THEIR GROCERIES OR ITEMS THEMSELVES. 

THAT ENSURES THERE'S NO TRANSMISSION POSSIBILITY WHATSOEVER.  
BECAUSE TO CONTINUE TO BANNING REUSABLE BAGS, IT IS UNNECESSARILY 
CONTRIBUTING TO THE SIMULTANEOUSLY HEALTH CRISIS, PLUS CLIMATE 
CHANGE WHICH IS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC.  THAT'S THE BACKGROUND 
TO THE WHEREAS.  AND IT IS IMPERATIVE WE DON'T LET FEAR-BASED 
INFORMATION CHANGE THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN IN THE REDUCTION OF 
PLASTIC.  TWO ORDERS I URGE THE GOVERNOR TO END THE BAN AND ALLOW 
MUNICIPALITIES TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN RESTRICTIONS.  AND WE SEND THIS 
TO THE STATE DELEGATION.  I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES JOIN ME AND ABLE TO 
GET BACK TO A SAFER USE, BOTH FOR HEALTH REASONS AS WELL AS RELATED 
TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS.

IS...  THE CITY MANAGER BE AND HEREBY IS REQUESTED TO WORK WITH 
CLAUDE JACOB, CHIEF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OF THE CAMBRIDGE PUBLIC 
DEPARTMENT, TO EXPAND TESTING TO THOSE IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE, FILED 
BY MYSELF, COUNCILLOR SIMMONS, COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN, COUNCILLOR 
ZONDERVAN.  AND I WILL BRIEF JUST SAY AS CLAUDE SAID, THIS AREA IS A 
HOT SPOT.  I HAD MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM OVER THE LAST FEW 
WEEKS ABOUT PARTICULARLY BRINGING SOME TESTING SITES TO THIS AREA 
AS I RECEIVED A NUMBER OF CALLS FROM RESIDENTS, FOR MANY REASONS, 
COULDN'T COME TO EAST CAMBRIDGE.  SO, GLAD TO SEE THIS IS MOVING 
FORWARD.  AND THANK YOU TO ALL MY COLLEAGUES WHO SPONSORED THIS.  
COUNCILLOR SIMMONS?  YOU PULLED IT?   

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  THANK YOU.  I PULLED IT WITH THE HOPE TO 
MAKE A SMALL AMENDMENT.  GIVEN WHAT CLAUDE JACOB SAID THIS 
MORNING -- WHATEVER TIME OF DAY IT WAS.  IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER AGO.  
HOW SUCCESSFUL IT WAS IN THE PORT -- THE NUMBER OF TEST THEY WERE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE.  I KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE WE CAN'T HAVE 
TEST AS READY AS WE'D LIKE TO.  WITH THAT SAID, AS PEOPLE FOUND OUT 
ABOUT IT, PEOPLE WANTED TO DO IT AND THEN STOPPED.  SOME PEOPLE 
DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. 

I HOPE WE CAN ENCOURAGE THROUGH THIS ORDER, NOT ONLY TO DO WHAT 
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO DO, BUT GO BACK TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
AND CONTINUE.  WHEN THEY DO COME BACK, MAKE IT CLEAR IT IS 
SHORT-TERM.  AND DO A LITTLE STRONGER OUTREACH THAN THEY DID.  I 
APPLAUD WHAT THEY DID, BUT I HOPE THAT IN NORTH CAMBRIDGE, THEY 
WILL DO A BIGGER PUSH TO LET PEOPLE KNOW.  A NUMBER OF THE 
RESIDENTS DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THEY WERE UNABLE TO GO.  I HOPE YOU 
WILL ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT.  AND CONSIDER GOING BACK TO THE PORT 
NEIGHBORHOOD.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  WE'LL ADD THAT.  LET'S SEE.  CAN WE ADD THAT...  I'M 
LOOKING AT IT.  I'M SORRY.  CITY MANAGER BE AND HEREBY IS REQUESTED 
TO WORK WITH CLAUDE JACOB...  AND WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE IT ADD?   

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  CONSIDER OR RECONSIDER.  RECONSIDER GOING 
BACK TO THE PORT NEIGHBORHOOD.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  HOW ABOUT THIS.  AND RECONSIDER FURTHER 
TESTING --  

>> COUNCILLOR SIMMONS:  IN THE PORT NEIGHBORHOOD.  THAT'S FINE.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  I'M FINE WITH THAT.  ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY 
COLLEAGUES BEFORE WE MOVE ON THE AMENDMENT?  ROLL CALL.  
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN?  YOU HAVE A QUESTION?   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  NO QUESTION.  I WANTED TO ADD MY 
SUPPORT TO MY COLLEAGUE'S SUGGESTION.  AND THE AMENDMENT IS 
REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE TESTING AVAILABLE.  I THINK IT MAKES 
SENSE TO SPREAD IT OVER TIME A LITTLE BIT.  I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.  I WANT TO APPLAUD THE YOUNG 
INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS OF THE CITY.  THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECT OF THE CITY.  THE CITY COUNCIL NOW.  AND NOW 
THE COUNCIL APPROVES THIS, THIS WILL GO TO THE MBTA FOR THEIR 
APPROVAL.  I THINK IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING 
INVOLVED AND SEEING HOW THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS.  I'M SURE A LOT 
HAVE TUNED IN NOW TO SEE HOW THE CITY COUNCIL PERFORMS.  AND DO 
OUR DUE DILIGENCE IN SERVING THE RESIDENTS.  

THIS IS A SIMPLE NAME CHANGE.  JUST REVERSE.  BUT IT WILL BE "AT 
CHURCHILL."  ONE INDIVIDUAL IS SERVING AS A FELLOW ON THE STATEWIDE 
CAMPAIGN.  I THINK IT IS TREMENDOUS TO SEE THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE 
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS, ESPECIALLY IN THESE VERY 
DIFFICULT DAYS WE ARE FACING.  AND IT SHOWS THERE ARE STILL YOUNG 
PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE INVOLVED AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

THAT EXPLANATION.  I COMMEND THE STUDENTS FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT 
AS WELL.  I DIDN'T KNOW THE STORY BEHIND IT.  I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND 
THAT A LITTLE BETTER AND HAVE A SENSE OF WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM 
AND WHY WE WERE BEING ASKED TO CHANGE THE NAME.  AND I'M NOT 
SUPPORTIVE OF THE NAME CHANGE, BUT I FULLY APPRECIATE AND NOT THE

TONIGHT.  I DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THE POLICY ORDER.  AND I DO 
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ME TO JOIN IN 
SPONSORING.  I HESITATED TO JOIN THE ORDER AS A SPONSOR.  IN FACT, I 
HAVE BROUGHT IN A SUBSTITUTE RESULT IN ONE OF THE THREE RESOLVES, I 
DO THIS IN PART BECAUSE I CANNOT AND WILL NOT SUPPORT THE ORDER 
THE WAY THE LAST RESOLVE IS WRITTEN.   

I RESERVE THAT IN PART BECAUSE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH 
ONE OF THE GROUPS.  AND FOUND IT NOT TO BE AN ADEQUATE OR A 
PLEASANT INTERCHANGE.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH MS. WILLIAMS ABOUT THIS 
PARTICULAR GROUP AND SHE HAS HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES.  I'M NOT 
ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT THIS PARTICULAR GROUP IS OF THE CALIBER THAT 
WE WANT TO LEND OUR NAME AND SUPPORT TO.  AND SO, BECAUSE WHEN 
WE DO THIS, WHEN WE GIVE OUT -- WHEN WE PRESENT A POLICY 
RESOLUTION, SUCH AS THIS, IT LENDS THE CITY'S CREDIBILITY.   

AND I'M NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN ABOUT THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS 
ORGANIZATION.  AND I OFFER ED A CHANGE THAT READS AS FOLLOW AND I 
HOPE YOU HAVE IT.  THE CITY CLERK BE AND HEREBY REQUESTED TO 
FORWARD A SUITABLY AND GROSS COPY OF THE RESOLUTION TO MS.

TEAM OF VOLUNTEERS, SHE HAS LABORED FOR DECADES ON SPONSORING, 
PULLING TOGETHER, CAMBRIDGE CARNIVAL.  UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE

CAMBRIDGE CARNIVAL INTERNATIONAL AND HAS DONE THIS FOR A LONG 
TIME. 

AND SHE -- MR. CLERK?  THERE'S SOME OTHERS FOR THE MAYORS AND FOR 
COUNCILLOR TOOMEY.  THANK YOU.  SHE HAS DONE THIS AND TO LOOK TO 
PUT HER ON THE SAME LEVEL AS SOMEONE WHO I PERSONALLY THINK WE 
SHOULD MAYBE NOT DO.  I'M TRYING TO BE NICE HERE.  I ASK ME 
COLLEAGUES TO STAND WITH ME, TO RAISE ONE CAMBRIDGE'S OWN, WHO 
HAS SPONSORED CARNIVAL ON LEADING IT PRETTY MUCH BY HERSELF IN A

AGAINST THEM LIGHTLY.  I WOULDN'T HAVE RAISED THIS IF I DIDN'T HAVE 
SOME CONCERN.  AND CLEARLY, I TRIED TO DISCUSS THIS OFF LINE.  A DEAF 
EAR WAS TURNED TOWARDS ME.  AND SO, FOR ME, WHEN ONE PERSON SAYS 
I DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT IS NOT MY EXPERIENCE, IT IS NOT 
TRUE.  I THINK IT IS DISCOURTEOUS TO THE COLLEAGUE AND TO THE BODY.  
AND AGAIN, THIS MS. WILLIAMS IS TRIED, TESTED AND FOUND TRUE.  AND I 
THINK IT IS SUFFICIENT AND WORTHY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS WOMAN OF 
COLOR, WHO HAS LABORED LONG IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN THIS 
CONTEXT, I'M NOT TRYING TO REWRITE THE ENTIRE ORDER, I RESPECTFULLY 
ASK THAT SHE BE ALLOWED TO STAND ON THIS PARTICULAR POLICY ORDER, 
BECAUSE OF THE WORK SHE DOES -- IT DOES TWO THINGS.  

WE ACKNOWLEDGE OUR COMMUNITY, OUR CARIBBEAN COMMUNITY, AND 
WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE AND WANT TO LIFT UP, IF YOU WILL, A WOMAN, A 
WOMAN OF COLOR, A CAMBRIDGE RESIDENT, A BUSINESS OWNER, THAT HAS

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  YES.  

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  YES.  

>> MOTION PASSES.  NINE IN FAVOR.  I HAVE ONE LATE POLICY ORDER 
SUBMITTED BY MAYOR SIDDIQUI, VICE MAYOR MALLON, COUNCILLOR 
SIMMONS AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN.  THE CITY COUNCIL GO ON RECORD IN 
SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AS CONDEMNING POLICE BRUTALITY, RACIAL 
PROFILING AND THE EXCUSE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE AND ALL MARGINALIZED 
INDIVIDUALS WITH HISTORICALLY SUFFERED FROM AN UNJUST CRIMINAL 
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND BE IT FURTHER THE CITY CLERK BE AND HEREBY 
REQUESTED TO FORWARD A COPY TO THE CAMBRIDGE -- FEDERAL 
DELEGATION ON BEHALF OF THE CITY COUNCIL.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  WE WANT TO STAND WITH OUR CONGRESSMAN 
PRESLEY AND OUR COLLEAGUES ON THIS RESOLUTION.  WITH EVERYTHING 
THAT IS HAPPENING.  SO, WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY.  ANYTHING TO ADD?  
VICE MAYOR AND THEN COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN.  

>> VICE MAYOR MALLON:  I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS 
FORWARD.  I CERTAINLY HAD A LOT OF CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST WEEK 
ABOUT THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD AND THE ROLE THAT THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT HAD TAKEN IN HIS DEATH IN MINNEAPOLIS.  AND OUR 
COMMUNITY IS MOURNING MR. FLOYD'S DEATH VERY ACUTELY.  HE IS THE 
LATEST IN A LONG LINE OF BLACK LIVES TAKEN BY THE POLICE AND INSTANCES 
OF DEPRAVED INDIFFERENCE.  THIS RESOLUTION BY CONGRESSWOMAN 
PRESLEY AND HER COLLEAGUES SIGNALS A SHIFT IN HOW THEY ARE EXPECTED 
TO TREAT THE RESIDENTS THE POLICE ARE HIRED TO PROTECT AND SERVE.  
AND TO CREATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.  WHEN WE HAVE 
POLICE DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE UNBIASED POLICE FORCES, OVERSIGHT 
AND ACCOUNTABILITY, WE'LL HAVE SAFER COMMUNITY.  THANK YOU FOR 
BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THE CO-SPONSORS WHO SIGNED ON.  I THINK 
IT IS VERY FITTING WE HAVE THE FOUR FEMALE COUNCILLOR SUPPORT THE 
FOUR FEMALE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE HOUSE ON THIS RESOLUTION.  I 
THINK CAN I SPEAK FOR ALL OF THE CO-SPONSORS THAT WE WELCOME THE 
ENTIRE COUNCIL TO STRENGTHEN THE SUPPORT FOR THE RESOLUTION AND 
WHAT STANDS FOR.   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  THANK YOU.  I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  WE CAN'T HEAR YOU.   

>> COUNCILLOR NOLAN:  SORRY.  YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW.  SORRY.  THIS IS 
SUCH A TROUBLING TIME.  I WANT TO THANK YOU AND VICE MAYOR MALLON 
AND COUNCILLOR SIMMONS.  IT IS SO CLEAR, EVEN FROM WHAT WE SAW 
ACROSS THE RIVER, THIS IS NOT JUST MINNEAPOLIS, BUT LAST NIGHT IN 
BOSTON, THERE IS A CLEAR SENSE THERE WAS A PEACEFUL OF PROTESTS 
WITH THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.  AND SOME UNFORTUNATE 
INCIDENTS OF POLICE ESCALATING UNNECESSARILY.  WE HAVE TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND OWN IT.  AND WE HAVE TO SUPPORT EVERY 
SINGLE MEASURE WE POSSIBLY CAN TO BRING ACCOUNTABILITY FROM 
POLICE OFFICERS, WHO WE NEED TO PROTECT US AND WHO ARE TOO OFTEN

ACTING OUTSIDE OF THE BOUNDS OF WHAT WE KNOW IS JUST.  IN 
PARTICULAR, IT IS BLACK LIVES. 

THE ONES THAT ARE MENTIONED AND THE HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS 
OVER JUST THE LAST FEW YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THIS 
SYSTEM OF RACIST APPLICATION OF POLICIES.  AND I HAVE TO SAY, WITH THE 
PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT HE IS DECLARING MARTIAL LAW, THE CITY OF 
CAMBRIDGE, THE COUNTRY IS LOST, NOT TO GET DRAMATIC.  IT IS SCARY 
HOW QUICKLY THIS ESCALATED.  IT IS ONE MEASURE, BUT REPRESENTATIVES 
ARE REALLY TAKING ACTION IN A WAY THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE THE 
COUNTRY KNOWS THEY ARE ON NOTICE AND WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOING TO FOLLOW THROUGH.  IT HAS BEEN WAY TOO 
LONG.  AGAIN, I'M VERY GLAD TO BE A SPONSOR.  I ENCOURAGE -- WE NEED 
TO ACT AND DO MORE THAN JUST SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION.   

>> MAYOR SIDDIQUI:  COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN AND THEN COUNCILLOR 
MCGOVERN.   

>> COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:  THANK YOU.  AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING 
THIS FORWARD.  I WOULD CERTAINLY BE HONORED TO BE ADDED AS A 
CO-SPONSOR.  I THINK IT IS VERY GOOD THAT WE ARE PUTTING FORWARD 
THIS RESOLUTION.  WE HAVE TO DO A LOT MORE THAN JUST THIS.  AND I 
HAVE BEEN PERSONALLY RACIALLY PROFILED.  LUCKILY, I HAVE NEVER HAD 
ANY BAD INTERACTION WITH THE CAMBRIDGE POLICE.  AND I'M VERY 
GRATEFUL FOR THAT.  BUT I HAVE BEEN TREATED VERY ROUGHLY ON OTHER 
OCCASIONS.  UNDOUBTABLY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF MY SKIN BY POLICE 
OFFICERS IN BOSTON AND ELSEWHERE. 

SO, THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME.  MY SON HAS BEEN RACIALLY 
PROFILED SEVERAL TIMES.  AND WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND THE PRETTY 
WORDS AND REALLY DIG DEEP INTO WHAT WE EXPECT OF OUR POLICE FORCE 
AND WHAT THEIR PURPOSE IS.  AND WHY WE ARE SPENDING MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS ON BEING OVER POLICED.   

AND WE HAVE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS COMING UP, STARTING AS SOON AS 
TOMORROW.  WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT 
WE WANT IN OUR COMMUNITY.  AND WHAT WE WANT POLICING TO LOOK 
LIKE IN THE 21ST CENTURY.  CLEARLY, IT CAN'T CONTINUE THE WAY IT HAS.  
AND NOTHING WE ARE DOING SO FAR AND EVEN IN THIS RESOLUTION WILL 
CHANGE THAT.  I HOPE THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL DIG DEEPER AND REALLY 
THINK ABOUT HOW WE TRANSFORM THE WAY WE RUN OUR SOCIETY.  I 
THINK WE SAW A GLIMPSE OF THAT WITH THE ROCA ALLOCATION EARLIER 
TONIGHT.  WE NEED TO START THINKING IN THAT DIRECTION.  HOW TO 
REALLOCATE OUR RESOURCES SO WE DO LESS POLICING, LESS VIOLENCE, AND 
MORE PREVENTION AND MORE SUPPORTING PEOPLE.  AND MORE CREATING 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE.  I THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THIS 
RESOLUTION.  I FULLY SUPPORT IT.  AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN DO MUCH 
MORE TO MAKE THINGS BETTER.  THANK YOU.   

>> COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN:  THANK YOU FOR THIS POLICY ORDER.  I TOO 
WOULD BE HONORED TO BE A CO-SPONSOR.  AND I WAS GOING TO MENTION

AND COUNCILLOR NOLAN MENTIONED IT, SOME OF THE NEWS THAT CAME IN 
DURING THE COURSE OF THE MEETING, COMING FROM THE OCCUPANT OF 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY FRIGHTENING.  AND WE ARE AT A PIVOTAL 
POINT.  AND I FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY PRIVILEGE IS NOT ONLY A 
WHITE PERSON, BUT AS A CISGENDER MALE AND I HAVE THE TRIFECTA OF 
PRIVILEGE.  THE WORK HAS TO START WITH US, EVEN IN PLACES LIKE 
CAMBRIDGE. 

THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD.  THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO.  I 
THINK WE ARE COMMITTED TO IT.  I WANT TO THANK THE POLICE 
COMMISSIONER FOR HIS STATEMENT THAT CAME OUT TODAY.  I SAW IT 
ONLINE TODAY IN THE CHRONICLE.  TOO OFTEN POLICE CHIEFS WILL CLOSE 
RANKS AND DON'T CALL THINGS OUT.  WE HAVE A COMMISSIONER THAT IS 
NOT AFRAID TO CALL THINGS OUT.  WE HAVE A LOT TO DO AND I THANK YOU 
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THANK THE DELEGATION FOR BRINGING 
IT FORWARD ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL.

USING A LARGE POLAROID CAMERA AND MAKING PORTRAITS.  IN FACT, WE 
HAVE A GOOD NUMBER OF PORTRAITS IN OUR FAMILY.  MY WIFE WORKED 
FOR POLAROID AND WORKED WITH ELSA.  ELSA IS ONE OF THE MOST 
INTERESTING PEOPLE I HAVE MET IN CAMBRIDGE.  AND WAS UNIQUE IN 
EVERY WAY.  AND IN FACT, A VERY RESPECTED DOCUMENTARY WAS MADE OF 
HER AND HER LIFE.  IT WAS PRESENTED AT THE BRATTLE THEATER ABOUT
