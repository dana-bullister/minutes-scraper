To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $52,890.00 from Free Cash to the General Fund 
Human Service Programs Other Ordinary Maintenance account for the support of the continued 
operation of the Y2Y Youth Shelter for the next few weeks. 
 
The City, through the Department of Human Service Programs, has agreed to fund the operations 
of the Y2Y Youth Shelter from March 23, 2020 to April 15, 2020. The Shelter was no longer 
able to utilize students to staff daily operations. The City has committed to support the Shelter to 
hire professional staff and cover additional expenses for continued operations. The Y2Y Shelter 
will provide temporary nighttime emergency shelter to 19 eligible Y2Y program participants. 
They will deliver program activities in accordance with Federal, State and Local guidance on 
preventing the spread of the COVID-19 viral infection. 
 
We are continuing discussions with Y2Y about their ability to remain open.

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am hereby recommending the reappointment of Christopher Bator to the Cambridge Redevelopment 
Authority (CRA) for a term of 5 years.  Mr. Bator was first appointed to the CRA in 2012.  Mr. Bator 
grew up in Cambridge and has raised his three children here. 
 
Mr. Bator has demonstrated a consistent focus on utilizing the resources of the CRA to promote the 
public benefit of local development and strategic community investments, particularly beyond the 
boundary of Kendall Square.  As the Board Treasurer, Mr. Bator has been highly attentive to the 
CRA's fiduciary position to ensure that it has the resources to implement projects and programs for 
all of Cambridge.  He has led the effort to transform the investment approach to preserve and 
enhance the CRA's financial assets, and has helped establish protocols for tracking budget expenses.  
At the same time, he has encouraged the CRA's thoughtful investment in community capital needs 
through the Forward Fund, the purchase of 93-99 Bishop Allen Drive, and other strategic 
partnerships with Cambridge nonprofits. 
 
This request to reappointment Mr. Bator is supported by CRA Executive Director Thomas Evans and 
Board Chair Kathleen Born. 
 
Therefore, in accordance with Chapter 121B of the Massachusetts General Laws, I am submitting Mr. 
Bator's name for City Council confirmation as a member of the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.  I 
am further requesting that this recommendation be forwarded to the Neighborhood and Long Term 
Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebrations Committee or other suitable committee for a public 
hearing as outlined in City Council Rule Number 32C.

Re: Purchasing Sensory Bags for Police Vehicles  

Ref.:  Awaiting Report #20-3, dated January 27, 2020  
 
 
The purpose of this response is to address Awaiting Report #20-3, dated January 27, 2020, whereby  
the City Manager was requested to confer with the Police Department on determining the feasibility  
of purchasing sensory bags for police vehicles as a pilot program and report back to the City Council. 
 
We have taken the following measures in response to this order. 
 
The Police Department has ordered fifty (50) sensory “On The Go Bags” containing items that can assist 
officers during interactions with individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The bag contains 
items such as Hearing Safe Noise Protectors and squeezers. These will assist officers in building trusting 
relationships and reduce confusion and fear. The kits will primarily stay with the patrol car; however, 
officers may choose to leave an “On The Go Bag” with the child or adult if they deem it necessary. 
 
Cambridge Police officers currently receive training on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) during Crisis 
Intervention Training (CIT), and in 2019 Autism awareness was included as a component of Annual In-
service Training. The Department is constantly engaging training to enhance our understanding of ASD  
and how specifically the sensory kits can assist them, as we recognize that proper training is paramount 
to a successful interaction.  
 
The Department will deploy the kits to all marked units (approximately 40 vehicles) as soon as they 
arrive and will incorporate the sensory kits into future training.  
 
We continue to remain committed to best practices and strategies to achieve positive engagements and 
public trust between the Department and the community. 
 
I hope you find this response satisfactory, and if there are any additional questions, information needed, 
or concerns regarding this matter, please let me know. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Dr. Branville, G. Bard, Jr. 
Police Commissioner

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible

Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.  

      
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

This office is in receipt of a copy of an application from:                                                                          

 
                                                                                         
 
 
            The City Council has directed that all curb cut petitions be submitted to the appropriate Neighborhood 
Associations for the locality where the curb cut would be made, so that the association may have an opportunity for 
review, prior to action by the City Council.   

 
Please indicate by return mail your approval or disapproval of the petition within twenty-one days from the date 
of this letter.  If the response is "disapproval" please state reasons.  Be sure to sign the form and include a daytime phone 
number.  I have enclosed a self-addressed stamped envelope to facilitate your reply. 

As soon as this office has received both the completed application and your neighborhood association response, I 

will place the petition on the agenda for the next City Council meeting.  If I do not receive a response from your 
neighborhood organization by twenty-one days from the date of this letter, I will place the petition on the agenda for the 
next City Council meeting. 

If your neighborhood association cannot complete its review by twenty-one days from today, you may extend the 

 
reply time another seven days by requesting an extension by letter to me with a copy to the petitioner.  However, I urge 
you to make every effort to complete your review as soon as possible.  

Thank you for your cooperation.

Increased Quarantine Capacity Needed for Homeless Population: Cambridge Data Attached
COVID-paper_0325_1127am.pdf

Dear City Leaders: 
 
I hope you and your families are faring well. I want to bring a new public health report to your attention and urge you to 
follow its guidance in advancing COVID policy impacting people who are unhoused and living in shelters.  
 
Estimated Emergency and Observational/Quarantine Capacity Need for the US Homeless PopulationRelated to COVID‐19 
Exposure by County; Projected Hospitalizations,Intensive Care Units and Mortality  One of the co‐authors is a local 
expert: Thomas Byrne at BU School of Social Work. See full report attached. 
 
The report makes clear recommendations, some of which are already under consideration here. Importantly, the table 
at the end of the document uses CoC data to calculate the need for emergency quarantine units and the cost to obtain 
them and sustain services therein. Here is the local and regional snapshot: 

 

 

 

 

In Massachusetts, we need 3,847 new units of temporary housing to safely support people who are living 
unsheltered as well as those living in shelters during the COVID crisis. The costs for supplying this capacity and 
supporting the quarantine would be $109,063,400. 

In Boston, Cambridge and Somerville, we need 1,592 quarantine units at a cost of $48,545,800 for space and 
quarantine services.  

In Somerville, there are about 14 people who are unhoused; 85 in shelters. The quarantine unit need is 
calculated at 57 at a cost of $1,709,500 (for unit capacity & services). 

In Cambridge, with about 81 people who are unhoused and 326 in shelters, the quarantine unit need is 
calculated at 244 at a cost of $7,326,600 (for unit capacity & services).  

That's a small fraction of the vacant dormitory and hotel space in our community at this moment. Available CPA and 
other resources at the state and local level should be used immediately to meet this need. Additional ESG and other 
monies will be coming from the federal governement.  
 
The basic needs of our most vulnerable community members must be addressed first ‐‐ safe, warm quarantine space 
with easy access to running water, soap, bathrooms, showers, and qualified care. Without these measures, the ripple 
effect of infection among service providers across many systems (from frontline nonprofit workers to municipal 
employees to law enforcement officers) could be devastating. It is clear that the collaboration of the private and 
higher education sectors in our community is critical at this moment. The Cambridge nonprofit organizations 
providing congregate living, overnight  shelter, and day shelter options do not have a way to access additional space 
without intervention.  
 
Thank you for your compassionate service. Please let me know if I can offer assistance.

Estimated Emergency and Observational/Quarantine Capacity Need for the U.S. Homeless 
 Population Related to COVID-19 Exposure by County; Projected Hospitalizations,  
Intensive Care Units, and Mortality 
Dennis Culhane, Dan Treglia, Ken Steif, Randall Kuhn, & Thomas Byrne 

The rapid progression of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic 
has raised concerns about the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the homeless 
population. According to official reports, 575,000 people in the United States meet the U.S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definition of homelessness – living in a homeless shelter or a 
place not fit for human habitation.1 On any given night New York City and Los Angeles County, two areas 
heavily impacted by COVID-19, are estimated to have 70,000 and 58,000 homeless individuals, 
respectively.  

In recent days, both the State of California and the City of Los Angeles have made substantial funding 
allocations to support rapid emergency shelter for unsheltered individuals, outreach for early detection, 
and quarantine space. Policing reforms have also been put in place to ensure that homeless individuals 
are able to shelter in place should the need arise. The federal government is in the process of 
considering additional funding allocations aimed at protecting homeless populations from COVID-19. 
This report aims to establish the potential mortality and hospitalization costs of inaction along with 
estimating the funding needs associated with a comprehensive plan of action.  

Potential impacts of COVID-19 on the homeless population 

We estimate the potential impact of COVID-19 on the homeless population and the homeless and 
healthcare systems caring for them.  We model our estimates on a variety of severity and fatality 
scenarios informed by the unique health burdens facing the homeless population, applied to the age 
distribution of the homeless population. Concern has been raised around the potential for widespread 
transmission of COVID-19 within the homeless population due to inadequate access to hygiene and 
sanitation and the difficulty of early detection among a population isolated from health care. Yet, given 
limited understanding around the exact parameters of the virus’ transmission, it is difficult to explicitly 
model the potential transmission, and so we simply model a range of infection rate scenarios.  

Less widely known—but considerably more important—is the extraordinarily high susceptibility to 
symptomatic infection, hospitalization, and fatality among the homeless population due not only to 
their advanced age, but also the accelerated physical decline and mental weathering that frequently 
results from repeat exposure to harsh elements. For decades, the single adult homeless population has 
been dominated by members of the late baby boom cohort (e.g., those born between 1955-1965, 
approximately), and the age distribution of homeless populations has shifted upwards as this birth 
cohort phenomenon has persisted into older ages.2,3  A recent study of aging trends among homeless 
populations in New York City, Los Angeles County, and Boston observed that the modal age of homeless 
clients in all cities was between 50 and 55 years. Studies of COVID-19 severity and case fatality suggest 
that older populations face risk orders of magnitude higher than those facing younger populations.4,5  

Concerns over chronological age are magnified by concerns over accelerated physical decline  among 
homeless populations.6 Homeless individuals are admitted to the hospital with medical-surgical 
conditions 10-15 years earlier than comparable, housed individuals,7  and with age-related impairments

typical of housed individuals 20 years older.8 Early studies of COVID-19 risk factors point to 
comorbidities relating to hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, chronic respiratory disease, and 
cancer.9 In Los Angeles and other communities on the West Coast, concerns about physical susceptibility 
are further heightened by high rates of unshelteredness, which are thought to carry both a generalized 
risk of accelerated age-related decline and specific exposures to poor hygiene and respiratory distress.10 
Existing studies of homeless populations have observed obstructive pulmonary disease prevalence 
between 20 and 30%,8,11 compared to 10% for the general adult population. 12 

This study serves two distinct purposes.  First, we model potential scenarios of COVID-19 severity, 
hospitalization and fatality among homeless populations.  Second, we estimate additional homeless 
system capacity – through private units as quickly feasible and scalable and otherwise through current 
infrastructure that incorporates tenets of social distance and safety - required to manage the acute 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the existing homeless population.   We perform this exercise for all 
unsheltered persons and homeless individuals in emergency shelter or transitional housing, which are 
generally congregate in nature (no private rooms or partitions) and highly dense.  We have excluded 
families with children, who tend to be sheltered in private rooms or apartments.  This exercise outlines 
the additional homeless system capacity required for a sufficient response to safely care for the existing 
homeless population; it is not intended to prescribe specific solutions, which should incorporate local 
conditions and guidance from the CDC and other public health experts. 

Modeling Health Impacts of COVID-19 on the Homeless Population 

Data and Methods 

Because detailed national age distribution data are not available, we drew on aggregate age 
distributions for the adult homeless population (age 25+) from the Homeless Management Information 
Systems (HMIS) of New York City (NYC) for 2017 and Los Angeles County (LAC) for 2018, two 
municipalities with robust social service data infrastructures for which we could readily access data.  
(Previous research by this team has found that the age structure of adult homelessness is fairly robust 
across states).2,3,13 

The most granular geography at which official homelessness estimates are available is the Continuum of 
Care (CoC), which is the geographic unit at which federal homeless assistance grants are awarded and 
local homeless services are coordinated.  These geographies do not map uniformly onto county 
boundaries, and we thus interpolate county estimates of these outcomes from CoC-level data mirroring 
a process described by Almquist and colleagues.14 

We built estimates of the distribution of hospitalization, critical care and fatality for five-year age groups 
by modifying the estimates included in the widely publicized Imperial College report published March 
16, 2020.4  We used nonlinear regression techniques to approximate rates for five-year age groups 
instead of ten-year groups. To estimate potential impacts on the homeless population, we built on the 
intuition of existing studies that older homeless populations bear health risks comparable to those of 
individuals 15 to 20 years older.7,8 To be conservative, we focused primarily on a 15-year accelerated 
aging shift while also reporting 10-year and 20-year shift models. A future scientific report will explore a 
wider range of assumptions. 

Figure 1 compares the risk curves for homeless populations to the general population using a model that 
assumes infected homeless individuals would be twice as likely to be hospitalized, two to four times as 
likely to require critical care, and two to three times as likely to die.

Table 1 shows the projected number of hospitalizations and critical care and fatality episodes 
anticipated among the homeless population of the United States.  These projections are imposed on the 
estimated 493,000 single adults experiencing homelessness on a given night (unsheltered PIT counts 
adjusted *1.4, see later section on unit estimation method), which creates a conservative estimate of 
COVID-19’s impact on the homeless population given that the total number of people experiencing 
homelessness over the course of a year is likely 3-4 times that. Our estimates assume that 40% of the 
homeless population will be infected at any given time at the peak of the crisis, and that the U.S. 
homeless population would have the same age distribution as NYC and LAC grounded in work from a 
prior study of aging homelessness. 

Findings 

•  We estimate that 21,295 people experiencing homelessness, or 4.3% of the U.S. homeless 
population, could require hospitalization at the peak infection rate of 40%, with a potential 
range from 2.4% to 10.3% hospitalizations. 

•  Critical care needs could range from 0.6% to 4.2%, with the midpoint scenario seeing 7,145 in 

critical care nationally. 

•  Finally, we estimate a wide range--0.3% to 1.9%-- of potential fatality rates, with the central 
estimate of 0.7% implying 3,454 homeless deaths. We believe that the true likely fatality 
outcome would be on the higher end of this range given the challenge of actually getting

Estimating Additional Capacity 

Data and Methods 

We use data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2019 Annual 
Homelessness Assessment Report (AHAR) to create assessments of additional capacity required to 
manage the acute effects of the COVID-19 crisis on the homeless population.  The following assumptions 
were used to develop bed estimates: 

•  Adult shelters operate at high density.  To reduce density sufficient to enable social distancing 
by allotting at least 100 square feet per bed, we assume a 50% bed reduction in existing 
facilities, which would require an offsetting increase in beds or private units. 

•  The 2019 AHAR unsheltered count reflects persons observed during the PIT count, which is an 
estimated 40% undercount due to unobserved persons, based on Glynn and colleagues15. 

•  New units are estimated to cost $25,000 per year, or $68.50 per night based on current national 

shelter expenditures16, although accommodations may be made in other facilities. 

•  We estimate a peak infection rate of 40% and keep that constant for our estimates and maintain 

that rate – which we know will vary over time -- for our analyses. 

•  Finally, for those who are infected or under observation we estimate an additional $7,500 per 

unit for more private accommodations, including rooms in hotels and motels.  

Findings 

Our estimates suggest the need for an additional 400,000 units to manage the COVID-19 pandemic for 
the current, estimated homeless population.  This includes: 

•  Approximately 200,000 single adults were sheltered on a given night in January, 2019 (199,531; 
US HUD, 2019).  To reduce density by 50% while maintaining current capacity would require the 
addition of 100,000 units. 

•  211,293 adults and persons in families were enumerated as unsheltered in 2019.  Assuming a 
40% undercount, approximately 300,000 beds are needed to provide accommodations to all 
unsheltered persons. 

•  Of the projected 500,000 total beds needed (300,000 for unsheltered, 200,000 for sheltered), at 
a 40% infection rate at a given time, 200,000 of these beds should be suitable for observation of 
symptomatic persons or persons under quarantine.    

•  At a cost of approximately $25,000 per unit per year, we estimate the annual cost of meeting 

this need at $10 billion.   

•  Assuming a premium of $7,500 per unit per year for more private accommodations for persons 
who are infected or under observation, including placement in hotels and motels, this would 
require an additional $1.5 billion for those 200,000 beds.   

•  The total estimated cost to meet the additional need is approximately $11.5 billion annually.   

Map 2 shows the need for these additional capacity by U.S. county.  This map reflects the geographical 
heterogeneity in unsheltered and single adult homelessness across the country, with need concentrated 
in a handful of areas and municipalities.  Ten percent of all counties will need only one, single unit or 
bed to accommodate the additional need, and half will need fewer than 10 additional spaces.  The 
counties in the top 1% of need will each require a minimum of 2,100 additional spaces, with Los Angeles 
County facing far and away the greatest need at 65,000 new units.

Options for emergency accommodation and coordination of care 

Given the high transmission rate of COVID-19, concerns have been expressed about the potential risk of 
congregate shelters, or shelters without private sleeping and bathing facilities. On March 22, the Centers 
for Disease Control issued Interim Guidance for responding to COVID-19 among people experiencing 
unsheltered homelessness along with guidelines for homeless shelters and other service providers. 

Decisions about the appropriate mix of rapid housing options must be made by individual jurisdictions 
based on local population needs, capacity for emergency accommodations, including vacant hotels and 
motels, and local government resources, but it is helpful to consider the basic principles of such an 
effort:  

1)  Emergency accommodations with private sleeping and bath space should be the preferred option 

for all clients and would be especially beneficial for individuals with known risk factors for COVID-19 
complications.  

2)  Individuals in urgent need of protection – including the elderly, those with severe risk factors for 
COVID-19 complications, and those already presenting with respiratory symptoms – must be 
accommodated with considerable haste

3)  Individuals with known or suspected coronavirus infections must be accommodated in private 

sleeping and bathing quarters, and such spaces should be made available well in excess of the likely 
number of infected individuals 

This means that most jurisdictions will need to use all potential emergency accommodation options to 
protect homeless populations from disease risk. We review the specific options individually before 
suggesting some technologies that would assist in the broader effort. 

Managing Encampments and Unsheltered Homelessness 

The recently posted CDC guidance discourages the clearance of encampments that frequently occurs 
under normal conditions and can lead to temporary or permanent disruptions that could lead to more 
harm than benefit. It recommends basic prevention measures for encampments: 

1)  encampments members should be encouraged to sleep with 12x12 feet of space per 

individual tent 

day, and 

2)   public restrooms with water taps, soap and sanitizer should be made available 24 hours per 

3)  portable toilets and handwashing facilities should be made available for encampments with 

encampments with 10 or more people. 

The report does not recommend strategies for encampments where these prevention measures cannot 
be implemented. Nor does it make specific prevention recommendations for individuals living outside of 
large encampments. We note that in Los Angeles, the city with by far the largest unsheltered 
population, only 24% of unsheltered homeless individuals actually live in encampments of any size, with 
a much smaller share living in large encampments. A recent study also found that individuals with longer 
exposure to homelessness, and thus potential greater health risks, were actually more likely to live in a 
sidewalk or alley and less likely to live in an encampment.17 In other words, in many cities, the vast 
majority of unsheltered homeless individuals, and an even greater share of the most vulnerable, are 
alone, unprotected, difficult to reach, highly dependent on services that may be unsustainable through 
the crisis, and unlikely to receive sanitation access.  

Those living in encampments or even in individual unsheltered spaces who have the ability and the 
desire to shelter in place should be encouraged to do so, because this will reduce demand for other 
emergency accommodations. But concerns about the ability to detect disease, maintain sanitation and 
meet basic needs – particularly if outreach capacity were to diminish – means that the bar for sheltering 
in place would ideally be set high. Building on the CDC guidelines, the following conditions should ideally 
be met for any encampment sheltering in place  

•  Ability to maintain social distance among encampment residents and from others outside the 

•  Ability to maintain adequate handwashing and sanitation for a long duration of delayed service 
•  Ability to assess and report suspected infections, meaning either regular access to outreach 

workers or to mobile phones with reliable service and electrical power  

•  Ability to maintain adequate food, water and medicine supplies through local stores or service 

encampment 

providers 

Encampments or individuals failing to meet these criteria may face severe risk of infection and indirect 
consequences in the event of a more severe emergency.

Congregate shelters: Congregate shelters are the predominant form of emergency accommodation 
within homelessness assistance systems.  Bed densities are often high, and can include bunk beds in 
many cases.  Per the CDC guidelines18 and FEMA recommendations, 100-110 square feet of space should 
be allocated per bed, aligned in head-to-toe formation.  For many facilities, this will require a reduction 
in bed capacity in a given location, and the establishment of additional offsetting bed capacity 
elsewhere to sustain current supply.  Consideration should be given to the provision of adequate 
hygiene and toilet facilities, and frequent, routine cleaning.    

Private accommodations: The ideal scenario would involve private accommodations for all clients. 
Private accommodations would dramatically reduce the likely transmission of disease relative to 
congregate shelters. The problem lies with the supply and the speed at which options can be mobilized. 
In the initial stages of the pandemic, some municipalities have sought to use campers and a variety of 
temporary disaster shelters that could be placed in empty areas. This approach is both slow and costly, 
and also potentially depends on people moving to isolated areas with open space. More recently, a 
number of cities have begun to scale up the use of hotels. Hotels have the advantage of already existing. 
Under usual conditions, hotel rooms would be not available. But in the current crisis, the use of hotels 
for emergency accommodation offers the added benefit of generating revenue for empty hotels and the 
often low-wage workers who operate hotels. Cities such as San Francisco, San Diego and Philadelphia 
have already mobilized hotel space for isolate of confirmed or suspected cases. In San Francisco, a group 
of city Supervisors have mobilized a more ambitious plan to enroll hotels accounting for 8,500 rooms 
into a proposed program, with buy-in from both owners and worker’s unions. This approach may offer a 
more scalable alternative to constructing shelters.  

Finally, we note that a sizable share of unsheltered individuals live in vehicles, some already parked in 
safe parking sites and others scattered throughout cities. Additional safe parking facilities should be 
opened, and individuals living in vehicles should be encouraged to move to these locations for safety 
and security.  

Emergency coordination of care: Regardless of the exact mix of emergency accommodations, the 
COVID-19 response would be greatly enhanced by the mobilization of better information and 
communication technology, evidence, and disease transmission models. In particular, we recommend 
the rapid adoption of SMS/mobile alert systems that would allow a broad spectrum of emergency 
outreach activities with relatively simple technologies. Prior research shows that nearly 95% of persons 
experiencing homelessness own cell phones and the vast majority make use of text messaging,19 thus 
highlighting the feasibility of this approach in terms of reach.  We also note some specific advantages of 
this approach, all of which would serve both to enhance the reach of existing methods while also 
reducing burdens on outreach worker and freeing up their time to support high-need cases: 

1)  An alert system could remind people of new emergency opportunities as they come onstream, and 

allow people to link to location-based maps of the nearest facilities.  

2)  Alert systems could update both the sheltered and unsheltered of any sudden changes in rules or 

procedure, for instance if lockdown restrictions are tightened, eased or reimplemented.  
3)  For those who remain unsheltered, surveys pushed out over an alert system would serve as a 

valuable real-time tool for early detection tool, for monitoring social distancing patterns, and for 
delivering hygiene, cleanups and medical care to those who request it.  

4)  For those moving into emergency accommodations, whether shelters or private rooms, the alert 
system could disseminate surveys to monitor social distancing, personal security and threat 
perception among those who have received shelter.

5)  Over time, needs assessments could be adapted to assess whether unsheltered and sheltered 
clients have lost access to essential treatments and medicines, in order to avoid indirect 
consequences of the pandemic.  

Conclusion 

The COVID-19 pandemic is creating a severe and emergent health crisis for the homeless population 
across the United States, a crisis that our shelter and health systems are simply not adequately prepared 
to meet. The current virus, when scaffolded on top of the already present crisis of aged homelessness, 
as well as a myriad of other factors impacting this population, is likely to wreak havoc on this already 
highly vulnerable group. 

For the 500,000 single adults who experience homelessness on a given night, the current crisis is likely 
to cause upwards of 21,000 hospitalizations and 3,400 deaths.  Given an annual shelter turnover rate of 
at least 3 – meaning that over the course of a year at least three times the PIT-estimate will experience 
homelessness and the confined and harsh conditions that come with it, the infection, critical care, and 
fatality rates presented here are almost certainly lower bound estimates.  Compounding this, we model 
these rates and solutions for current (2019) levels of homelessness.  While economists are only 
beginning to quantify the short-and long-term economic impacts of this pandemic, we are almost 
certain to see a recession resulting from the infection itself, resultant social distancing, and general 
market uncertainty.  Predictions vary widely, but the current record unemployment claims will be 
followed by additional housing instability and homelessness that will further stretch an already taxed 
homelessness assistance system. 

There are limitations to this study that should be noted.  We apply homogenous rates of infections, 
hospitalizations, critical cases, and mortality across the country, though they will certainly vary by region 
and county in ways that we were not able to model.  Second, we model those rates based on a single 
Point-in-Time estimate of homelessness though, as noted above, households enter and exit 
homelessness over the course of a year.  Third, this study is notably limited in its scope.  It is intended to 
model potential infection rates and the capacity required to provide every homeless person safe 
accommodation.  It is not meant to prescribe the specifics of those facilities, and policymakers and 
practitioners are advised to take their cues from research more specifically devoted to that cause, with a 
particular emphasis on the aforementioned CDC guidelines and the public health community more 
generally. 

There are obvious and immediate steps that we can take to mitigate this situation.  By creating 
adequate and humane accommodations for people living unsheltered, leveraging existing private units 
like hotels while creating new ones as feasible, and reconfiguring existing facilities to accommodate 
social distancing and isolate symptomatic individuals, lives can be saved.  Federal, state and local 
governments will need to collaborate around the funding, staffing and siting of facilities.  But the 
urgency is clear, as is the moral imperative to act.

City Council; City Clerk
remote participation

I would like to thank everyone involved for how much better the March 23 City Council meeting went than the March 16 
one. Leaving Zoom on for the entire meeting meant that, when my internet went down, participating by phone allowed 
me to follow the meeting as it was happening. Please make that your standard. It really does make it much easier for the 
public to see and hear what you're doing while you're doing it, which is an important consideration under the Open 
Meeting Law. Not everyone has cable, not everyone has a good computer, and not everyone has reliable internet access, 
but lots and lots of us have phones that tend to keep working. Please use all of the means at your disposal to let us 
follow along.

It has been heartening to see the many ways this city has responded well to all of the disruption caused by the 
pandemic. While there is always more that can be done, what has been done deserves a round of wild applause. Keep 
up the good work, remember to be good to yourself and those you love, and wash your hands.

WHEREAS: 

On April 26, 2020, Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church on 146 Hampshire Street in 
Cambridge will be celebrating its 130th anniversary with a special service; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church was founded in 1890 when a small group of 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

believers came together and established what was then known as the Mt. Olive Baptist 
Church, and several years later, after a location change that placed the facility closer to 
Massachusetts Avenue, the name of the church was changed accordingly; and 
 
Since the church’s humble beginnings, Cambridge has grown, changed, and evolved 
alongside the country as a whole, with the city and the country undergoing a 
transformation from an agrarian-based economy to an industrial-based economy, the 
rise of the Information Age, the weathering of one Great Depression and two World 
Wars, the Civil Rights Movement, and the dawn of Globalism all transpiring – yet the 
mission of Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church has remained a constant, and the 
church itself has provided spiritual guidance and nourishment to generations of 
Cambridge residents; and 
 
Throughout the turbulence, the many civic upheavals, the ever-changing social mores, 
and the tugging and tearing of the country’s social fabric at various points throughout 
the past 130 years, Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church has helped generation after 
generation of Cambridge residents find strength, comfort, and spiritual fortitude in 
their faith and in their community, and it shall doubtlessly continue on in this mission 
for countless generations to come; and 
 
In addition to its role as a place of worship, Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church – 
which is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches, USA – also sees its role as one 
of providing stability and building community in Cambridge, as evidenced by the 
Project Manna outreach to the displaced and the less fortunate among us, which is led 
by Executive Director Rev. Brenda Ann Brown and which offers critical nutritional 
assistance to enhance the quality of life, and as evidenced by the monthly Epic 
Program, a food pantry that feeds an average of 100 families per month; and

Even as Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church celebrates this milestone anniversary, it

That the City Council go on record wishing Massachusetts Avenue Baptist Church a 
Happy 130th Anniversary; and be it further

ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health crisis with far-reaching effects on 
Cambridge residents. A State of Emergency has been declared at the city, state, and 
national level, and the City must take unprecedented action to address this crisis; and 
 
Local businesses and workers are facing immediate and serious economic hardship, 
with many workers laid off, and many more residents with reduced or eliminated 
income. The recent Massachusetts Stay-at-Home Advisory will only exacerbate these 
hardships, while expenses continue to pile up for members of our community; and 
 
The City of Cambridge, residents, and homeowners have a vested interest in 
preventing an increase in homelessness and protecting our community during an 
emergency by providing temporary financial relief while protecting vulnerable 
homeowners; now therefore be it 
 
That the City of Cambridge requests that all landlords and property managers forego 
rent increases for all properties for a period of sixty (60) days; and be it further 
 
That the City of Cambridge requests that all landlords and property managers forego 
evictions of tenants with demonstrated, substantial loss of income due to the COVID-
19 crisis for a period of sixty (60) days; and be it further 
 
That the City of Cambridge requests that all landlords and property managers allow 
tenants with demonstrated, substantial loss of income due to the COVID-19 crisis a 
120-day grace period from the enacting of this order to become current with rent; and 
be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to work with all relevant city 
departments to reach out to landlords to encourage compliance with this order.

The City of Cambridge has declared a Health Emergency due to the COVID-19 
pandemic; and 
 
On March 23, Governor Charlie Baker issued a “stay-at-home” advisory, in an effort to 
increase social distancing and reduce the spread of COVID-19; and 
 
Playgrounds, basketball courts, ball fields, and fitness areas have been closed to ensure 
social distancing; and 
 
It is imperative that Cambridge residents are able to safely go outside while keeping a 
distance of 6+ feet from others; and 
 
The length of time that residents will be asked to distance themselves from others is 
unknown at this time; and 
 
New York City has already implemented street closures to decrease density and reduce 
crowding in the city’s parks; and 
 
The “stay-at-home” advisory has drastically reduced car traffic in Cambridge, now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager is requested to confer with the Director of Traffic, Parking, and 
Transportation on streets in each neighborhood that could be closed to all non-essential 
traffic for the duration of the Health Emergency and report back to the council as soon 
as possible; and further be it 
 
That the City Manager will ensure that all neighborhood groups are invited to give 
suggestions and input into any recommendations for how to best select streets for 
closure.

WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

The Governor has issued a Stay at Home order for the Commonwealth; and 
 
The order urges residents not to leave the home except to do essential jobs, shop for 
groceries, buy medicine, or take a walk; and 
 
It is impossible to maintain proper distance from other individuals when talking a walk 
or going for a run on narrow Cambridge sidewalks, creating an unsafe situation for 
anyone who leaves the home; and 
 
Closing Memorial Drive to vehicular traffic would create a space for residents to go for 
a walk or get some exercise while maintaining recommended social distancing 
practices; and 
 
Traffic volumes are down significantly in the City of Cambridge during the Stay at 
Home order; and 
 
As the temperature gets warmer, the demand for safe outdoor space will only continue 
to increase; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with DCR to explore 
closing Memorial Drive for the duration of the Stay at Home order to give people in 
Cambridge a safe space to exercise and be outside without violating social distancing 
practices; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on 
this matter as soon as possible.

ORDERED: 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, residents have been encouraged to socially 
distance and many are working from their homes; and 
 
Approximately half of all low-income households in Cambridge do not have access to 
broadband, making working from home and staying connected to friends and loved 
ones more difficult; and 
 
Students at Cambridge Public Schools and university students whose campuses have 
closed are now required to conduct much of their education online; and 
 
The City has closed its public libraries and school buildings, two common internet 
access points for low-income residents; and 
 
The Cambridge Housing Authority has closed off its common spaces, and with them, 
access to the internet-connected computers many low-income residents and high-risk 
elderly residents have; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager explore what short-term solutions may be taken to expand 
essential internet access to Cambridge residents who lack it during the pandemic until 
such time that a municipal broadband network can be implemented

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
 
WHEREAS: 

On March 27, as the COVID-19 pandemic spread across Massachusetts and the 
country, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt ordered that the reservation of the 
Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe would be disestablished and its land taken out of federal 
trust; and 
 
This order was delivered despite ongoing and unresolved litigation over the status of 
the Tribe’s land in federal court, defying the independent jurisdiction of the judiciary; 
and 
 
This is the first order to disestablish a reservation since the federal government’s 
colonialist policies of termination and forced assimilation were left behind in the 
1960s; and 
 
The Cambridge City Council acknowledges that it governs a municipality on land 
stolen from the indigenous peoples of Massachusetts, and therefore has a very basic 
responsibility to defend and expand the rights and autonomy of Native Americans in 
whichever ways it can; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record stating its opposition to the Interior Secretary’s 
disestablishment of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe’s reservation, and its solidarity 
with the members of the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe; and be it further 
 
That the City Council urges Governor Baker and its legislative delegations to the state 
legislature and US Congress to oppose this order by any means at their disposal, 
including legal challenges, pursuing options to recognize the Mashpee Wampanoag 
Tribe at the state level, and passing new legislation to create a legal framework and 
funding mechanisms for Massachusetts’ Native American tribes to continue to hold 
their land in autonomy; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of 
this resolution to the Cambridge Legislative Delegation and the State Legislative 
Delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.

WHEREAS: 
 

 
RESOLVED: 

 
ORDERED: 

On March 23, 2020, Governor Charlie Baker ordered the closure of all non-essential 
businesses across Massachusetts for two weeks, forcing many vulnerable small 
businesses to close their doors, and resulting in lost revenue for them; and 
 
It is estimated that 15,000 stores could permanently close across the country in 2020, a 
number significantly higher than the 9,548 stores that permanently closed in 2019, 
highlighting just how devastating this lost revenue will be for businesses, particularly 
for small businesses that have less savings than larger businesses; and 
 
Small business owners often invest their personal savings into their businesses, 
indicating possibly severe consequences for small business owners, as they generate 
less revenue, and may not have extensive personal savings; and 
 
Nevertheless, insurance companies have largely denied business interruption policy 
claims, preventing business owners from accessing much-needed and much-deserved 
financial relief; and 
 
State Senator James Eldridge recently filed SD.2888: An Act Concerning Business 
Interruption Insurance; and 
 
This legislation would require insurance companies to pay business interruption 
policyholders that have experienced an interruption to their business as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, if they have 150 or fewer employees; and 
 
The bill would apply to hotels, restaurants, arts organizations, and other businesses that 
have been hit hard by this public health crisis, and emphasizes uplifting small 
businesses during these challenging times; and 
 
Supporting SD.2888 would align with the City Council goal of “[ensuring] that 
Cambridge remains an Innovation Hub that integrates businesses of all sizes into a 
thriving ecosystem”; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record in support of SD.2888: An Act Concerning 
Business Interruption Insurance; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of 
this resolution to the Cambridge legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council.

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN

COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 
 

WHEREAS:  The COVID-19 pandemic and necessary containment protocols implemented to flatten 

the curve and keep people safe have resulted in a reduction or elimination of income 
for many Cambridge residents; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The necessary closure of businesses, institutions, construction sites, and more has 
created financial hardship for many individuals and families; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  The necessary closure of schools has required parents to either stay home or spend 

money on childcare; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  These containment protocols could continue well past the next few weeks and nobody 

truly knows when it will be safe to lift them; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  Massachusetts housing courts have suspended most eviction proceedings until at least 

April 22; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  On March 16 alone, there were 19,884 new unemployment claims filed with the state; 

and 
 
Italy and California have suspended mortgage payments due to the crisis; and 
 

 
WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS:  A suspension on rent payments, mortgage payments, evictions, and foreclosures would 
provide housing security and great relief for residents while allowing social distancing 
and other containment protocols to remain in place without such a harsh economic 
impact; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council go on record calling for the Federal Government and/or the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to issue an immediate moratorium on rent payments, 
mortgage payments, evictions, and foreclosures until the end of the COVID-19 
pandemic; and be it further 
 
That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of 
this resolution to the entirety of Cambridge’s legislative delegation.
