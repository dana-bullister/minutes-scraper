City of Cambridge 

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City of Cambridge took numerous aggressive measures at the outset of the covid-
19 outbreak that were designed to curb the spread of the virus, including but not 
limited to mandating the cessation of the hundreds of construction projects that had 
already been underway across the city; and 
 
As the City begins to look ahead to a time when the local economy can begin to re-
open, it would be wise to establish guidelines that would allow for the safe resumption 
of construction activity, and these guidelines would need to balance incorporating the 
City’s new safety measures with a streamlining of the City’s inspection process to 
ensure that construction projects can find a viable path forward in a very changed 
environment; and 
 
Any guidelines established by the City must make the safety of the construction 
workers paramount, with the understanding that moving forward under the new safety 
guidelines will likely increase the length of any given project by as much as 30 percent 
– yet having a scaled-back, phased-in approach will allow for a continuation of both 
the work necessary to complete these construction projects and of the City’s current 
social-distancing measures; and 
 
Any steps taken to allow for the resumption of construction in Cambridge must require 
that all contractors strictly adhere to the rules outlined by the City’s April 2, 2020 
Construction Guidelines; and 
 

Packet Pg. 32

WHEREAS: 

Among the further recommendations that the City should consider for allowing the 
resumption of construction are the following:  
 

•  Utilizing emails, video chats, and “as-builts” to enable swift responses from 

the Inspectional Services Department.  

2.1

 

 

 

 

 

•  Allowing inspections to be conducted via video conference calls and other 

electronic measures whenever possible. 

•  Allowing greater latitude for coordinating final inspections (and for 

determining what constitutes a “final inspection”) being jointly conducted by 
all relevant City Departments, to enable swift turnaround on construction 
projects.       

• 

If the CDD has already submitted substantial conformance documents to the 
Inspectional Services Department, further re-inspection by the CDD should be 
waived in favor of allowing this department to grant final approval via email 
with photos, with turnaround time of no more than 5 business days. 

•  The City should allow all paused projects to submit their covid-19 safety plans 
to the City now for review, to decrease the anticipated backlog; a lack of 
formal response from the City within 3 days should be considered an approval 
from the City – with the City reserving the right to request further review of 
any safety plans and the ability to revoke a project’s approval if additional 
safety measures mandated by the City are not immediately enacted.  

•  The City, which has previously granted permission for construction of 1-3 
Family Homes to continue during the covid-19 response, has not allowed 
construction of Town Homes to continue – this oversight should be amended 
and construction on Town Homes should be allowed at this time; and 

 
On a case-by-case basis, the City should allow projects past the “rough inspection” 
stage to resume construction immediately while following the guidelines outlined 
above, which would allow the kind of phased-in resumption of construction activities 
that would still allow for the social distancing the City continues to require; and 
 
In those construction projections that are essentially a “fit-out” (such as smaller 
operations that are 3,000 square feet or less), the City should allow the resumption of 
activities as the work on these projects is typically light, crew sizes should be limited 
to no more than 10 workers, and operations that are less than 1,000 square feet should 
be required to limit the crew size to no more than 5 people; and 
 
In those larger construction projects (such as on the larger hotels in Harvard Square), 
construction operations should be allowed to continue in accordance with the 
guidelines established by the City on April 2, 2020 with the City providing some 
additional guidelines beyond those issued on April 2, 2020 for occupant safety when 
projects include construction in occupied residential or business spaces; and 
 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 

Packet Pg. 33

2.1

By taking the recommendations listed above under consideration, the City can begin to 
formulate an actionable plan that will allow construction projects to safely and 
responsibly resume operations, streamlining the City’s process of moving construction 
projects forward, and providing a critical portion of the local economy a roadmap of 
how to move forward as the City continues to respond to the challenges posed by 
covid-19; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to review the recommendations 
listed above with the appropriate City personnel with a view toward establishing clear 
guidelines that will allow for the re-opening of construction projects across the City, 
and to report back to the City Council on this matter as soon as possible. 
 
That this order be forwarded to the Cambridge Construction Advisory Group.

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Cambridge’s Climate Vulnerability Assessment has established that many Cambridge 
residents are vulnerable to (and are already experiencing) extreme heat and flooding 
impacts from climate change, underscoring the need to rapidly reduce our emissions to 
avoid even worse impacts in the future; and 
 
Scientific evidence has established that natural gas combustion, procurement, and 
transportation produce significant greenhouse gas emissions that worsen the climate 
crisis; and 
 
Cambridge first declared a climate emergency in 2009 and has a goal of reaching zero 
emissions no later than 2050; and 
 
In order to reach these goals, new buildings will have to use electric heating and 
cooling equipment (chiefly ground and air source heat pumps) that is powered by 
electricity generated from renewable sources such as wind and solar; and 
 
All-electric buildings are cheaper to build than those that use natural gas for heating, 
and the price of natural gas is expected to significantly increase in the future; and 
 
Retrofitting buildings that are designed to rely on natural gas infrastructure is a costly 
proposition that will take decades to complete, and it makes no sense to add more such 
buildings now, only to have to retrofit them later; and 
 
Cambridge’s aging natural gas infrastructure represents a severe and omnipresent 
danger to all residents, and expanding this infrastructure to meet additional demand 
from new buildings would further increase and prolong these risks and keep the City 
locked in to using natural gas in the future; now therefore be it 
 
That the attached proposed amendments to the municipal code be referred to the 
Ordinance Committee for a hearing and consideration; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the City Solicitor, 
Community Development, Public Works, Inspectional Services and any other related 
departments to review the proposed amendments and report back to the Council no 
later than the end of October.

Cycling Safety Ordinance 

Chapter 12.22  
 
Section 12.22.010 
 
This Chapter may be cited as the "Cycling Safety Ordinance" of the City of Cambridge.  
 
Section 12.22.020 
 
This Chapter seeks to eliminate fatalities and injuries on City streets in accordance with the 
City's Vision Zero goals through safety improvements and the construction of a connected 
network of permanent separated bicycle lanes across the City. 
 
Section 12.22.030 
 
A. “Adequate Directionality” shall mean (1) a two-way street with a separated bicycle lane or 
lanes that allow bicycle travel in both directions, or (2) a one-way street with a separated bicycle 
lane or lanes that allow bicycle travel either in the direction of the flow of vehicular traffic or in 
both directions. 
 
B. “Bicycle Lane Miles” shall mean the combined distance of Separated Bicycle Facilities. A 
two-way facility or one-way facilities in both directions on a one-mile street segment shall count 
for two Bicycle Lane Miles. A one-way facility on a one-mile one-way street segment shall count 
for one Bicycle Lane Mile. If a gap in a Separated Bicycle Facility of any distance occurs for any 
reason other than those specified in the definition of the particular Separated Bicycle Facility, 
the distance of the gap shall not be counted toward Bicycle Lane Miles. 
 
C. “Cambridge Bicycle Plan” shall mean the plan adopted by the City of Cambridge in October 
2015 to create a framework for developing a network of complete streets, and which is entitled 
“Cambridge Bicycle Plan: Toward a Bikeable Future.” 
 
D. “Connectivity” shall mean the provision of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane system that 
reflects desired routes between all major origins and destinations in the City. 
 
E. “Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan” shall mean the City’s Department of 
Public Works’ five-year work plan of May 1, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time. 
 
F. “Improvements” shall mean the construction of new City-owned streets, or the reconstruction 
of an existing City-owned street, including but not limited to full depth reconstruction, expansion, 
and/or alteration of a roadway or intersection. Improvements shall not include routine 
maintenance, repairs, restriping of the road surface, or emergency repairs to the surface of a 
roadway (collectively “Maintenance”), provided that existing bicycle lanes will be restored to 
existing conditions or better. 
 
G. “Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by a permanent vertical barrier that shall remain in place year-round, including but not 
limited to granite or concrete barriers and raised curbs, provided, however, that the bicycle lane 
need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic by a permanent vertical barrier for short 
stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible loading, 
intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle lanes may be 
temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so long as they are 
restored to existing conditions or better.

H. “Public Transportation” shall mean bus and shuttle stops for the Massachusetts Bay 
Transportation Authority (MBTA), Charles River TMA, the Medical Academic and Scientific 
Community Organization (MASCO), and colleges and university bus and shuttle stops that exist 
prior to May 1, 2020. If the City Manager determines it is appropriate to add a particular bus or 
shuttle provider to the definition of Public Transportation, any such bus or shuttle provider may 
be added to this definition upon the approval of the City Council. 
  
I. “Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane” shall mean a bicycle lane separated from motor vehicle 
traffic by flexible delineator posts, or a similar separator, that shall remain in place year-round, 
provided, however, that the bicycle lane need not be separated from motor vehicle traffic for 
short stretches to accommodate crosswalks, curb cuts, accessible parking and accessible 
loading, intersections, and Public Transportation, and provided further, that existing bicycle 
lanes may be temporarily removed during construction of Improvements or Maintenance, so 
long as they are restored to existing conditions or better. 
 
J. “Separated Bicycle Facilities” shall mean either a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane or a 
Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lane. 
 
K. “Separated Network” shall mean the proposed set of bicycle facilities identified in the 
Cambridge Bicycle Plan (Figure 5.14), or any plan superseding it, provided, however, that any 
such plan shall maintain Connectivity. 
 
Section 12.22.040 
 
A. Whenever Improvements are made to a City-owned street under the Five-Year Sidewalk and 
Street Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall cause such Improvements to comply with 
the Cambridge Bicycle Plan, or any plan superseding it; provided, that if Improvements are 
made to a segment of the Separated Network, a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane with 
Adequate Directionality shall be installed along that segment. 
 
B. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above is not required where the City 
Manager can demonstrate through a written alternatives analysis, to be made public, why it is 
impractical to comply with the provisions of Subsection A above, and where there will be a loss 
of Connectivity if the provisions of Subsection A are not complied with, how Connectivity could 
be otherwise advanced, if possible. Full compliance with the provisions of Subsection A above 
will be considered impracticable only in those rare circumstances where the City Manager 
determines that the characteristics of the physical features or usage of a street, or financial 
constraints of full compliance prevent the incorporation of a Permanent Separated Bicycle Lane 
with Adequate Directionality. 
 
C. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall complete the installation of 22.6 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of Separated Bicycle Facilities; provided, however, that all such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities shall be installed on streets in either the Separated Network or be installed along: 
      

Requirements 

(a)  Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street, or  
(b)  Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 

from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound.  

      
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle 
Lanes, the requirements of this Subsection C shall be satisfied so long as the construction of

such Separated Bicycle Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this 
Subsection C. The City Manager shall have the discretion to extend the deadline set out in this 
Subsection C by no more than one year if the City Manager deems it infeasible to meet the 
deadline, provided, however that the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a report 
detailing why the extension was necessary by no later than May 1, 2025. 
      
D. By no later than May 1, 2022, the City Manager shall complete the installation of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along Massachusetts Avenue between 
Memorial Drive and Alewife Brook Parkway excepting: 
      

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue/Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;  
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and   
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street.  

 
If any of the Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along Massachusetts Avenue other than (a), 
(b), (c) and (d) are proposed to be Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes, the requirements of 
this Subsection D shall be satisfied so long as the construction of such Separated Bicycle 
Facilities has commenced prior to the deadline established by this Subsection D, provided, 
however, that if Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes are to be installed along Massachusetts 
Avenue from Sydney Street to Inman Street, the requirements of this Subsection D shall be 
satisfied so long as the design of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has commenced 
prior to January 1, 2023 and the construction of such Permanent Separated Bicycle Lanes has 
commenced prior to December 31, 2025. 
      
E. By no later than May 1, 2021, the City Manager shall submit to the City Council a block-by-
block analysis determining the impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on: 
 

(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street;  
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street; 
(c) Massachusetts Avenue between Waterhouse Street and Roseland Street; and  
(d) Massachusetts Avenue between Beech Street and Dudley Street. 
 

If, after a review of the analysis, the City Manager determines that Quick-Build Separated 
Bicycle Lanes, whether of Adequate Directionality or not, should be installed on any analyzed 
block, the City Manager shall cause their installation by May 1, 2023. Some impacts to motor 
vehicle traffic flow and some parking/loading loss shall not result in a determination that Quick-
Build Separated Bicycle Lanes cannot be installed. Any such installation shall not count toward 
the 22.6 Bicycle Lane Miles requirement set forth in Subsection C, provided, however, that the 
installation of at least 1.25 Bicycle Lane Miles of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes along 
segments (a) and (b) shall result in a one-year extension of the deadline set out in Subsection 
C.      
      
On any blocks where the City Manager chooses not to install a Quick-Build Separated Bicycle 
Lane of Adequate Directionality along 

 
(a) Massachusetts Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street; 
(b) Massachusetts Avenue / Peabody Street northbound from Church Street to Garden 
Street;

within one year of the City Manager’s submission to the City Council of an analysis of the 
impacts of installing Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes on blocks (a) through (d) above, the 
City Manager shall obtain the approval of the City Council of a timeline by when Separated 
Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed on those blocks. If the City 
Manager fails to receive City Council approval of such a timeline for any of those blocks, the 
City Manager shall cause the installation of Quick-Build Separated Bicycle Lanes with Adequate 
Directionality on such blocks within three years of the submission of the impacts analysis. 
      
F. Any Separated Bicycle Facilities installed along segment (a) of Subsection E, Massachusetts 
Avenue between Plympton Street and Dunster Street, must also be separated from Public 
Transportation for the full stretch of that segment. 
 
G. By no later than May 1, 2026, the City Manager shall cause the completion of continuous 
Separated Bicycle Facilities with Adequate Directionality along: 
 

(a) Broadway from Quincy Street to Hampshire Street,       
(b) Cambridge Street from Oak Street to Second Street,      
(c) Hampshire Street from Amory Street to Broadway, and  
(d) Garden Street from Huron Avenue to Berkeley Street, eastbound, and Garden Street 
from Mason Street to Huron Avenue, westbound, 

 
provided, however, that the connection from the intersection of Garden Street and Concord 
Avenue to the segment of Concord Avenue contiguous to Follen Street shall be improved to 
meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities.       
 
By no later than May 1, 2025, if Separated Bicycle Facilities of Adequate Directionality are yet to 
be completed along the street segments designated in this Subsection G, the City Manager 
shall submit a report to the City Council detailing how the outstanding Separated Bicycle 
Facilities of Adequate Directionality shall be installed within the next year. 
 
H. Starting on May 1, 2020, the City Manager shall cause the installation of at least 2.5 Bicycle 
Lane Miles of the Separated Bicycle Facilities designated in Subsections C, D, E, F, and G 
every year. If the City Manager causes the installation of more than 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles of 
such Separated Bicycle Facilities in a given year, the City Manager can apply the surplus 
Bicycle Lane Miles toward meeting the requirements of this Subsection H for later years. If the 
City Manager fails to install 2.5 Bicycle Lane Miles in a particular year and no surplus from a 
prior year is available to meet the requirements of this Subsection H for that year, then the City 
Manager may install the deficient Bicycle Lane Miles in the following year; provided, however, 
that this shall not relieve the City Manager of the duty to meet all other deadlines set out in 
Subsections C, D, E, F, and G.  
 
I. By no later than May 31, 2021, the City Manager shall submit a report to the City Council 
detailing progress towards meeting the requirements set forth in Subsections C, D, E, F, G, and 
H. Such report shall include details on the Separated Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming 
twelve months. Thereafter, a report shall be given to the City Council no later than 12 months 
from the date of the preceding report. All such reports shall include details on the Separated 
Bicycle Facilities planned for the coming twelve months. Installation of Separated Bicycle 
Facilities including the total of Bicycle Lane Miles installed under Subsections C, D, E, F, G and

To the Honorable, the City Council: 
 
I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 18-108, regarding a report on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee Elections, which ordered: 
 
“That a petition be submitted to the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 
accompanied by a bill for a special law related to the City of Cambridge to be filed with a copy 
of this order, be, and hereby is, approved under Clause One (1) of Section Eight (8) of Article 
Two (2), as amended, of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, to the end that legislation be adopted precisely as follows, except for clerical or 
editorial changes of form only: PETITION FOR A SPECIAL LAW ENTITLED, AN ACT 
AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER EARLY VOTING IN 
MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS”; and further ordered:  
 
“That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this attached petition to the 
Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.” 
 
In response to the above two referenced Council Orders, the City Clerk forwarded the petition 
and accompanying bill for a special law to the Massachusetts legislative delegation on behalf of 
the City Council.  However, the Council Order further ordered: 
 
“That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on offering 
early voting in City Council and School Committee elections.” 
 
In response to the third order, requesting that I report back on offering early voting in 
Cambridge, I have conferred with the City Solicitor following her review of the petition and 
accompanying bill, and I recommend substituting the attached revised petition and 
accompanying bill to the Legislature.  I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Agenda Item Number 13 
IN CITY COUNCIL 

On October 29, 2018 the Cambridge City Council adopted Policy Order # 1 (the

Commonwealth of Massachusetts, accompanied by a special law related to the City of 
Cambridge to be filed with a copy of the Order, such home rule petition for a special 
law e entitled: ‘AN ACT AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF CAMBRIDGE TO OFFER 
EARLY VOTING IN MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS;” and 
 
The Order further requested that the City Clerk forward a copy of the home rule 
petition to the Massachusetts Legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City 
Council; and 
 
The home rule petition together with the  required signature page was forward to the 
Massachusetts Legislative delegation by the City Clerk on October 30, 2018; and 
 
 
The Order also requested that the City Manager report back to the City Council on 
offering early voting in City Council and School Committee elections; and  
 
The City Manager requested that  the City Solicitor review the language in the home 
rule petition, and following her review the City Solicitor has suggested amendments; 
now therefore be it 
 
That the City Council move to amend by substituting the attached language for the 
language that was previously adopted in the home rule petition by the City Council on 
October 29, 2018; and be it further

April 30, 2020 
 
 
To: Cambridge City Clerk 
clerk@cambridgema.gov  
 
RE: Response to Cambridge City Council Order to Resume Construction 
 
Dear Cambridge City Council: 
 
On behalf of our employees, partners and clients involved in Consigli Construction projects in Cambridge, I am writing 
supporting the order to resume construction. We feel that this is the appropriate stance to take based on the following 
key points: 

•  Critical nature of housing projects to the residents of Cambridge  
•  Critical nature of life science projects and their effect on the global community 
•  Economic impact in Cambridge of creating jobs and getting the labor force back to work 
•  Effective safety measures are in place to create a safe environment for workers onsite  

 
The City of Cambridge took numerous measures at the onset of this pandemic to curb the spread of the virus and 
protect its resident including the cessation of construction projects that were underway across the city. The leadership 
and position taken has successfully flattened the curve. However, it does not mitigate the adverse effect that it has had 
on our construction business, our employees and the cities/towns that we live and work in.  
 
It is no secret that Cambridge is a hub of innovative companies, pioneering in fields of life sciences, pharmaceuticals, and 
information technology, so it is only proper that the city is also a leader for the re-opening of construction projects, 
safely and in a controlled manner, during such unprecedented times. We have worked with the City of Cambridge to 
develop  “back to work” plans for construction projects with the priority of worker health and safety. It is our goal that 
work begin as quickly and safely as possible in the coming weeks. Across the state, numerous essential sites are safely 
using these protocols that have been created and agreed upon between labor organizations, CMs and owners.  
 
Our people are our most important asset, so their safety is paramount to our success as an organization. We propose 
working with the City on a phased re-opening plan that centers around the following: 

•  City of Cambridge Construction Guidelines dated 4/20/20 
•  CDC Recommendations on Social Distancing and Interaction 
•  Third Party Expert Advice (Drs, Public Health Officials, etc.) 
•  Use of technology when available to streamline inspections and other activities (video conferencing, virtual 

meetings, automated systems, etc.) 

•  COVID-19 Site Specific Safety Plans – reviewed, approved, and monitored by the city 

 
As an organization we look forward to assisting the City in executing the reopening of construction sites in any manner 
needed and continuing to build upon our strong relationship with the City of Cambridge through unprecedented times. 
 
 
Sincerely,  
Anthony Consigli 
CEO 
Consigli Construction Co., Inc.

Thursday, April 30, 2020 4:26 PM
Clerk
City Council
Letter to City Council for Council Meeting of April 27, 2020
SoofaTalk.JPG

Subject: Communications on Coping with CoVid During the Pandemic 

Dear City Councilors: 
 
At a press conference last week, Mayor Martin Walsh of Boston urged residents to stay the course and 
continue social distancing. ?We?re probably in for another four, five, six weeks of what we?re going through 
today," he said.  
 
As critical as this is, we also need to be thinking and planning ahead. As Michael Osterholm, a professor at the 
University of Minnesota and a public health scientist and a biosecurity and infectious disease expert, put it in 
an interview on MSNBC (Morning Joe) the same morning, "we are only in the second inning of a nine inning 
game....This is a war, not a battle."  
 
In the early innings the pandemic has exposed weaknesses in our systems for testing and of caring for the 
elderly, the unhoused, the ill, and other vulnerable populations. As Cambridge focuses our efforts on meeting 
the urgent needs in these areas, the pandemic has also exposed the inadequacy of our local systems for 
disseminating essential public information.  These also need urgent attention in the effort to contain the virus. 
 
For the foreseeable future, until a vaccine, effective treatment, or widespread immunity are developed, every 
citizen, every resident, every breathing human being has a part to play in containing the virus. In order to do 
this they will need good, current information that will change over time as normal activities resume in stages, 
the number of infections declines or rises, and treatments improve. Without it, confusion and conflicts over 
best and safe practices will be likely. 
 
While it would be very helpful to residents if all residents had universal broadband access, there are ways we 
can make better use of existing infrastructure to keep the public informed. Here are a couple of suggestions 
for doing this. 
 
First, the City could set up electronic information boards at public libraries, City Hall and other public buildings, 
and shopping areas. One model for this is the SoofaTalk.com stands in Somerville (see attached picture) 
another would be the MBTA bus tracking screens in the Senior Center and City Hall. These could display 
updates and advisories from the City and State as well as public service announcements from the Centers for 
Disease Control and other authoritative sources. 
 
Second, the City could buy public health ads in the Cambridge Chronicle and Cambridge Day. This would have 
the added benefit of supporting another vital information resource, local journalism. It would be money well 
spent.

3.24.a

Dear City of Cambridge Clerk:  
 
We are grateful for Cambridge’s strong leadership during this challenging time and we appreciate the 
City’s efforts to protect the community.  
 
The temporary ban on construction was a necessary measure at the beginning of the crisis. It has 
allowed us to protect the safety of the construction team and has given us time to prepare our 
construction site, such that we can reopen in a safe manner.  
 
Over the last few weeks, we have invested a lot of time and effort in developing comprehensive 
workplans to reopen our construction site and operate it safely. Our plans include strict guidelines 
related to hygiene practices, personal protective equipment, social distancing, and more.  
 
We support Councilor Simmons’ order to resume construction activities with stringent safety protocols 
and would like to submit our plans to the City’s Inspectional Services Department. We believe that the 
City will see and appreciate the thoughtfulness of our preparation when they review our proposal. In 
short, we are ready to continue our construction efforts safely and responsibly.  
 
The innovation that happens on a daily basis in our Cambridge-based lab is critical to continue 
developing the next wave of therapies against cancer, which impacts more than 2 million patients 
worldwide. In order for us to develop these transformational cancer therapies, we need additional 
space to support our drug discovery & development efforts, so that we can bring  these medicines to 
patients as soon as possible.  
 
We urge you to support Councilor Simmons’ order and allow construction to resume in Cambridge.  
Thank you.  
 
Best regards,  
 
 
 
Adrian Gottschalk,  
President and CEO, Foghorn Therapeutics

Dear Honorable Mayor, Vice Mayor and City Councilors, 
 
I am writing to offer support for the proposed order requesting the City Manager to establish guidelines for 
the resumption of construction that was charter written at last week’s meeting.  
 
We are extremely grateful for the numerous measures enacted by City leadership to keep those who reside 
and work in Cambridge safe. This respite has been important to give the industry time to think through how 
site work can resume safely and smartly. 
 
While the majority of offices have shut down, many of Alexandria’s lab buildings have remained active 
allowing critical research by our tenants, including COVID-19 work. Access to these essential laboratories 
have helped shape our understanding and preparations of what needs to be done to properly operate in the 
current climate.  
 
With appropriate COVID-19 safety guidelines and protocols in place, we support the resumption of 
construction projects in Cambridge. There are numerous construction projects underway that will provide 
much needed laboratory space to Cambridge’s world-class life science industry. Multi-disciplinary teams 
(contractors, owners, subcontractors, tenants, etc.) are working together to share best practices to create 
safety protocols that prioritize the personal health and wellbeing of workers, tenant and the public.  
 
With the implementation of proper precautions, we can continue to build spaces that house the innovators 
that tackle our greatest challenges. Please support Councilor Simmons’ order and begin the preparations to 
allow construction to resume in Cambridge.

Cambridge libraries

Dear Mayor and City Council members,

I am writing in support of Policy Order POR 2020 #95, to explore safe ways of making library books/resources available 
to Cambridge students.

With the extended school shutdown, Cambridge students need more access to non-digital resources. My own kids, 8 
and 10, finished their stash of library books weeks ago. They are spending more and more time on screens, and I can’t 
even tell them to “go read a book!” 

I hope Cambridge can find a safe way to allow students access to the wealth of books and resources inside our shuttered 
libraries. This is especially important for our less privileged student population. Could we order online, have volunteers 
bundle books and have pickup windows? 

Thank you for investigating this possibility, and all your hard work during this difficult time.

Best,
Tien-Yi Lee
Cambridge resident, parent of 2 kids at MLK School

Mask mandate, YES!  Order 10, NO!

My husband and i are in contact daily with medical professionals on the front lines in Boston hospitals.  This area of MA 
is one of the worst hotspots in the country for covid-19. And in spite of what we’d all like, this pandemic is not going 
away anytime soon.   We have no cures, not vaccine, but simple preventative measures do help:   masks, washing hands, 
and physical distancing.  PLEASE, understand that wearing masks and social distancing are easy measures for us to take 
in Cambridge, preventing further illness and death.   If anything, we are implementing these measures late…   Please 
keep the mask mandate in place. This is not the time to back off public health measures helping  protect our community!

Please include our comments in the “official record.”

Thanks, Henry and Gretchen Kronenberg, Pleasant St

I want to express my support for the current mask mandate.  I oppose policy order 10 or any other attempts to weaken

Support for current order of mandatory masks

I am in total support of the current order in its entirety requiring face coverings AND the fine imposed on those who do 
not comply. A minor inconvenience to protect all citizens is a small price to pay to save lives. Wake up! To undo a 
safety measure that, in my opinion, should have been instituted weeks ago is foolish and irresponsible.

Subject: Save the mask mandate!

Dear Cambridge City Council,

Please include the following in the "official record":

We write to express support for the current mandate and opposition to policy order 10. Please maintain the emergency 
ordinance to require masks when people leave their houses. Prior to the mandate, we were disappointed in the number 
of walkers, cyclists, and runners who are not using masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Brookline, Everett, 
Somerville, Watertown, Waltham, and other cities are requiring face masks in public spaces, including outdoors. I don’t 
like wearing a mask; it’s uncomfortable and steams up my glasses, but this is a pandemic and wearing a mask is a tiny 
sacrifice I’m willing to make to help reduce the spread. To those who are fighting this ordinance: If you don’t care about 
your neighbors and those more vulnerable than you, consider our stressed doctors, nurses, and all the essential workers 
who have shouldered the weight of this crisis. Wearing a mask is a small ask!

Thank you for your consideration, and be safe,

re: Policy Order #102 - Don't Weaken Public Health Mask Mandate

* Regarding the Policy Order: "That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to review the order and align it with 
guidelines promulgated by the CDC, WHO, Dr. Fauci, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to make clear face 
coverings are required in public settings only when physical distancing is not possible."

I am writing to urge you to protect the health and safety of my family by not weakening the city's mask mandate.

I have seen a MASSIVE improvement in the wearing of masks these last few days. Joggers and even bikers are wearing 
them! The mandate is definitely working and my wife and children and I feel much safer when we have to go outside.

Clearly, people take laws and mandates seriously. And serious laws, fairly enforced, have consequences. Otherwise, they 
are nothing more than advisories. And as we have seen, a significant percentage of people in our city do not heed 
advisories when it comes to protecting the health of others by wearing masks.

One observation about the idea that perhaps we don’t need a mask if there is no one around us. If I see someone 
without a mask at a distance, and we are approaching each other, then there is no way I having of knowing if that 
person has a mask, or plans to put it on, or will get it on their face in time. So, to be safe, I have to assume that they pose 
a threat and act accordingly. So it’s just as stressful and crazy as if they have no mask at all!

And I have seen more than a few people struggling to get their mask on as I approach, maybe getting it halfway on, 
maybe just giving up on the darn thing, maybe trying to pull their shirt up over their nose (not easy!) And I've seen 
people surprised when they turn a corner and there I am -- no time at all to throw their mask on! It's a fail all around.

In closing, please put health before convenience, common sense before vacillation. Keep the mask mandate strong as it 
is.

Thank you for your attention, and please include my comments in the official record.

Policy Order 10

I am a 75 year old person with underlying health issues. The existing Policy Order 10 is likely to save 
my life by preventing the spread of the coronavirus to me from people in the street or in my 
apartment building hallways and laundry rooms who appear to be healthy but in fact are spreading 
this contagion which would be a death sentence for me.

New research indicates that infected people without any symptoms are even more contagious than 
people who are symptomatic. The virus is most virulent before the patient realizes it.
wearing masks all the time when in areas where people like me walk is absolutely necessary. No 
exceptions.

 
:
 

 

i

While most people who ride bikes, jog, walk, and shop who don't wear masks do this because they 
are unaware of the danger they are causing and need more and better education, sadly some people 
just don't care about infecting others and feel they are invulnerable. While fining people should be 
used sparingly, it is absolutely necessary because the coronavirus is extremely contagious so that even 
a relatively small number of mandate violators can cause immense harm.

It is also true that as soon as mandates are not absolute, people are tempted to cheat.
pictures of beaches in Florida and California where strong restrictions with some exceptions are in 
effect and are contemptuously ignored because of how people interpret exceptions.

Please, Keep the mandate absolute and keep the fines! Do you really want your vote to result 
in the death of vulnerable residents of Cambridge?  

Do you realize that your vote to ease the mandate will endanger the minority communities of 
Cambridge the most because they're getting sick and dying disproportionately?

Keep the mask mandate and defeat Policy Order 10

I strongly urge you to keep the mandate that everyone has to wear a mask in public. There is no rational argument 
against the mandate--it will literally save lives. Wearing a mask hurts no one, there are masks available for everyone.
No one has the right to spread a contagious, serious possibly fatal disease to other people.

Mask Mandate

I am in support of the current mask mandate. Please do not weaken it. I am against 
Policy Order 10 because the current mask mandate has increased the number of mask 
wearers. I am 66 with underlying conditions so I am a vulnerable person. The few times 
I have been out with both mask and gloves (for shopping or the pharmacy), I have had 
to dodge walkers, runners and cyclists not wearing masks. I do everything I can to 
protect myself and others, but some people do not bother with masks and do not offer 6 
foot distancing. The mandate now in place has remarkably increased mask usage. Also, 
the residential mask restriction in building of 2 units or more (mine has 51) has been a 
Godsend as I was the only person wearing a mask in my laundry room and other 
common areas and I had to ask a young woman to give me 6 foot clearance to get by as 
well. Since the mandate, I have now seen my residential neighbors wearing masks. 
Please leave the mandate alone. It is helping to slow the spread thereby keeping people 
safer.

Please do not tweak the current mandate.

Thank you.

Please save the mask mandate

To Cambridge City Government Leaders

As the weather gets better, and I notice more people going out, distancing becomes a bit more challenging.  People are 
definitely trying to distance responsibly, but masks add an extra margin of safety.  i found last weekend that runners 
especially can be the least conscious of distancing.  I am sure no one is being deliberately inconsiderate, but as a former 
funner, I understand one can get pleasantly lost in the experience.  The mask helps.  

In short, please see the mask mandate for the near term!

Mandatory Masks

Dear Cambridge  City Manager and  Cambridge City Councilors,

Thank you for putting into place the Mandatory Masks with a  fine.  It has made a 
big  difference already even with the grace period. It would be good to have  signs 
in place  and that masks are available from the police dept on 6th street.

There are so many shield/mask possibilities using things that we have at home and 
without sewing. We need to figure out the  kinks and problems. The mandatory 
masks are a  health necessity .

I sympathize with people who have difficulty with the masks ( breathing without 
fogging glasses, as I do) but  having it around your chin  at all times when outside 
and feeling a responsibility to pull it up  when you are  within 6 ft of another 
person is not unreasonable but a necessity to deal with the spread of covid19  and 
it will be for a long time. 

The bikers and runners without masks expelling their breath while whizzing by  are 
a health hazard and a fine is a natural consequence and will hopefully deter the 
behavior. 

Keep Well. Keep Safe.
Thank you

Mask mandate

Please enter this letter into the record for Monday’s meeting.  Thank you.

I am horrified that anyone would oppose this vital and reasonable mandate.
Many of us have voluntarily worn face masks for weeks to protect others.
Many others have carelessly refused to wear masks to protect the rest of us.
This pandemic has shown us the cruel limits of individualism.
Leave the mandate as it is. Concerned voters will remember when your re-election comes around.

Subject: Save the Mask Mandate!

Thank you for your support for mandating masks in public places as a way to help slow the spread of Covid-19.  

As you heard, the City Manager ordered a mask mandate that went into effect this past Wednesday. Despite this order being in effect 
for less than a week, three City Councillors have filed a policy order for next Monday's City Council meeting to weaken this 
mandate by eliminating the fine and only requiring masks in certain instances.

If you would like to see the Manager's mask mandate to remain in effect as is, please email your support for the current mandate and 
opposition to policy order 10, to the following three email 
addresses: citymanager@cambridgema.gov, citycouncil@cambridgema.gov and cityclerk@cambtidgema.gov and ask for your 
comments to be included in the "official record".

You can also sign up to speak (virtually) at Monday's meeting by filling out the PUBLIC COMMENT SIGNUP sheet
Make sure you say that you wish to speak regarding policy order 10.

Thank you for your support. Be safe. Mask up!

Important: Keep mask mandate!

I am writing to support the mask mandate that went into effect this Wednesday and to urge that the City not weaken 
this measure with policy order 10. I ask that my comments be entered into the official record.

I walk whenever the weather allows--one of the only safe distractions from self-isolation available to me for many weeks 
now. Even with the mandate, there are walkers, runners, and bicyclists on the roads and paths who are not wearing 
masks. To weaken the mandate will only cause further confusion and threaten the lives of Cambridge residents--
particularly those like me above age 65. We are nowhere near past this pandemic. Lives are in danger. Please don't take 
away this important safety measure. Voters are counting on you to do the right
thing: Keep the mask mandate in place.

KEEP FINE FOR NOT WEARING MASK

To Whom It May Concern: 
I fully support the wearing of some type of mask that covers the nose and mouth. The elimination of 
the fine will be almost as bad as not having the order at all. Prior to the fine some people were not 
wearing masks who could wear them. Not all of these people have a disability, such as asthma or 
COPD, excusing them from wearing the mask. So maybe imposing a fine will encourage at least 
some of those to wear the mask. More people is better than fewer.  It is worth the try. 

We are almost at peak. Not to encourage people somehow to wear face coverings will only extend 
the time when we reach the peak and start the downward curve to get back to work.  I find it hard to 
believe that one cannot find something to cover nose and mouth. A big handkerchief, scarf, a clean 
rag if you cannot purchase one on line or make one yourself. Any covering should help keep our spit 
from spreading to others. 
. 
Please do NOT weaken the mask order. The mask may not be the best but it is certainly better than 
no mask. We have all experienced someone sneezing and spraying spit carrying viruses and
into the air if mouth not covered. Not just sneezing but talking also 
bacteria, eg influenza virus,
sprays some spit - some more than others. Influenza virus is bad enough but Covid-19 is much 
worse. Why take the chance? What is so hard about wearing a mask? 
Sincerely, 
Anne Marie Plasse

I do not support Policy Order 10

As I understand it there are some city councilors who would like to weaken the emergency order that 
was established this past Monday evening.  I would like to not seek the fine eliminated and I can’t 
see situations in which a mask should not be worn as spelled out in the order.  The fine could be 
reduced a bit, but even then it will only be effective if it is actually enforced.

What I don’t understand is how any part of this order might actually be enforced.  Today my husband 
was in Central Square picking up a package that had been delivered by UPS and left at Star 
Variety.  He said the little convenience store had a lot of customers in a small space and almost no 
one, including the store proprietor, either had a mask or was wearing one properly.  Outside the 
store, between the store and the bus stop there was a group of people collected—they were too close 
together and few had masks.  Those who did again were not wearing them correctly.  My husband 
further reported that just around the corner on Mass Ave there was a group of policemen standing 
around chatting (all wearing masks).  It seems like at least one of them should have taken note of 
groups of people collecting together as we have all been warned not to.

So, who is actually going to enforce any order!! 

However, assuming it may be enforced, I want to feel as safe as possible when I’m out in public or in 
an essential business, and would like to have the policy maintained.

RE: Support for current order of mandatory masks

I still support the current order as it stands. Just take a walk by the Gore Street Park and you'll see 5 or 6 young people 
gathered together without any face coverings, soccer ball in hand. Walk down one of our streets, most of which do not 
allow the 3 or 4 people walking together to be six feet apart, and often witness no face coverings. People are just not 
complying and are putting their fellow neighbors at risk. Without the threat of an impending fine, people will continue 
to ignore the rules--like school children who have no reason to obey the 'rules of the classroom' if bad behavior is 
continually ignored and no penalty imposed.

Dear Audrey Cunningham, 

Thank you for emailing the council with your concern about the mask/face covering order. I’d like to make sure the 
record is straight - no one that I am aware of is trying to get rid of the mask mandate. I, along with two other councilors, 
want to align the order with these entities who have issued mask guidance - Dr. Fauci, Governor Baker (who issued an 
order today), the CDC and WHO. Please read below and let me know if you agree. 

We are calling for these amendments and additions to the policy: 

1. Update the language to reflect that of the CDC, WHO, Dr. Faucci, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and 
Governor Baker’s emergency order announced earlier today:

That indoors, masks should be worn at all times in public settings - all COVID-19 essential businesses, mutli-unit 
buildings, etc. (currently, amendment 3 states that when in an essential business, people “must wear a mask or cloth 
face covering unless they can maintain a distance of six feet from all people at all times”). And that outdoors, masks 
should be available and must be worn when distancing is not possible.

2. Another change, not specifically addressed by those public health entities, is to eliminate or reduce the current fine, 
which is an excessive $300, and instead mandate that all law enforcement will carry masks to give to those who do not 
have one on. The Massachusetts ACLU publicly called for this change in the last few days.

3. Finally, that the City Manager provide regular updates to the Council on any fines issued as a result of the Order, 
which should include demographic summaries by race, age, and gender for any fines issued. 

I hope this clarifies my position. Like all my colleagues, I want people to feel safe and to stay healthy. I believe the 
current policy if amended as we are proposing to be aligned with major public health advisories will be less confusing 
and more helpful.

Sincerely, 

Patty Nolan

I am in total support of the current order in its entirety requiring face coverings AND the fine imposed on those who do 
not comply. A minor inconvenience to protect all citizens is a small price to pay to save lives. Wake up! To undo a 
safety measure that, in my opinion, should have been instituted weeks ago is foolish and irresponsible.

Save the Mask Mandate

Keeping the Mask Mandate “as is” makes good sense. The fine in dispute is not the first option, and warnings are the 
first line of defense. However, a fine defines the serious implications of not adhering to the mandate, and everyone 
who doesn’t want to wear a mask will think twice. 

Our national and state guidelines are just that, guidelines, and Cambridge officials should use them to formulate what 
is best for our unique situation. The density of Cambridge is a major factor in determining how to proceed.

Whether it is putting out the trash before the designated time, or not shoveling your sidewalk in the winter, fines are 
the framework for the success of a mandate.  In this case, the impetus of the Mask Mandate fine will surely save lives. 

There have been a disturbing number of people who have not been wearing masks in Cambridge, from grocery workers 
to joggers. Many find a beautiful spring day as support for denying the reality of Covid. Hopefully in the near future the 
Mask Mandate can be eased, but until then we need to send a strong message. I am one among many who are thankful 
that the existing Mask Mandate is in place. Please keep it as is.

Thanks for all that you do, and stay safe.

support for policy order 10 May 4, 2020, include in public record

I am writing to express support for policy order 10 calling for an amendment to the cloth face covering mandate passed 
last Monday.  While I applaud the requirement for masks inside places such as stores and other essential businesses and 
outside when one cannot social distance the requirement for masks even when one is more than 6ft away from anyone 
is problematic for multiple reasons

1.  It is based on fear not facts. Analysis after analysis after analysis shows that the risk factors for transmission of 
COVID-19 are inside, in close proximity and extended time together. Requiring a cloth face covering  when no-one is 
around serves no purpose in preventing transmission.

2.  Wearing a cloth face covering when it is not serving any purpose can actually compromise the ability of the cloth face 
covering to protect others when it is needed. Cloth face coverings lose effectiveness when wet.  Cloth face coverings 
become wet quickly (and this issue will be exacerbated as the humidity and heat rises) so wearing a cloth face covering 
for an extended period of time when one is alone means that when does enter an area where it is needed the face 
covering is less effective than if it was only worn when needed.

3. Social Distancing is much more effective than cloth face coverings. By requiring a face covering at all times a powerful 
carrot to encourage social distancing is removed. If one has the choice to take a walk during an “off time” or on a less 
popular route without a mask that would encourage people to pick those times and routes.  Despite the density of the 
population in Cambridge I routinely find myself on empty streets and even an empty river path by choosing my time and 
route carefully.  This does not even require me to choose especially onerous times. Midmorning and late evening are 
both times when it is very quiet outside.

4. Having a mandate with obvious problems means that enforcement will be very discretionary.  Obviously as a white 
middle class woman I am unlikely to be stopped if I am walking or running on an empty street but I cannot assume that 
people of color will be given the same leniency

5. The fact that the mandate exempts private/not shared property introduces a massive difference in treatment based 
on income and economic class.  A person with enough wealth to own property with a private yard can be outside 
without a mask even if close to crowded sidewalk but those without the same wealth cannot be alone in a shared 
backyard or on a street or in a park without a mask.  I understand why it would be hard to regulate private/not shared 
property but not including the same caveat that many states (including Massachusetts)  and cities have of “when one is 
unable to social distance” introduces regulations that are more onerous on those w/ less wealth.

I urge Cambridge to amend the cloth face covering mandate so that it is based on facts not fears.  The original guidance 
when we had an advisory had an explicit permission for those exercising to remove their face covering to aid in 
breathing when no-one was within 6’. Adding something like that the mandate (except not limiting it to those 
excercising since many people forget that walking is also a form of exercise) would be excellent.

Hello,

Helen Abraham <helen.abraham@verizon.net>
Saturday, May 2, 2020 11:15 AM
City Council; citymanager@cambridgema.org
City Clerk
Please Keep Current City Mandate to Wear Masks!

I am 77 years old with a compromised immune system.
I try to walk every day. Looking at me quickly out on the street you would not necessarily know those things.

Before Wednesday’s mandate to wear a mask when outdoors or in stores at all times, only a very very small minority of 
persons were wearing masks, and most of those persons who had masks, had them just dangling around their necks.
This includes walkers, runners, cyclists, roller skaters, persons of all ages, including children.
Nor were they social distancing. It felt so stressful to go out for a walk.

I myself would rather not wear a mask or be bothered with social distancing.
Please remember, COVID-19 is extremely contagious. 
It has made many seriously ill and so many have died. 
People can have the virus without knowing it, you and me included.
If I have the virus, I can give it to you. If you have the virus, you can give it to me.
If wearing a mask can prevent the spread, or for that matter save just one life, why wouldn’t I be willing to do it?! Why 
aren’t we all!?
It’s not about me standing up for my rights.
It’s about doing my tiny part to help not spread the virus, about keeping you and me safe and well.

I urgently request that you KEEP the mandate for everyone to wear masks outdoors and when shopping, etc. Other than 
possibly making a slightly lower fine (maybe $200 as opposed to $300), please make no changes to the original 
mandate! If someone refuses to wear a mask, not caring about public safety and health, they should have to pay a 
serious penalty. They are contributing to possible illness and death by not doing so.

Just now, this morning I heard on the news that Governor Baker has made a requirement for Massachusetts residents to 
wear masks outdoors and when in public places, etc. at all times.
I hope this stresses how important it is for us all to continue wearing masks to try to keep this virus from spreading, to 
try to stop this deadly virus.

Thank you,

Helen Abraham

Re: save the mask mandate

I am writing to support the Manager's mask mandate remain in effect as is, in opposition to policy 10.

We are a family who live in West Cambridge close to Memorial Drive.

Before the mandate we witnessed a majority of bikers and joggers not wearing masks - and in some instances, not 
appropriately distancing themselves (unapologetic runners not wearing masks bumping into people, and bikers without 
masks biking at a close range by pedestrians).

Since the mandate we've seen more people wearing masks; however, there are still handfuls of people walking/running/biking 
while holding masks, or wearing masks around their necks, or not wearing them at all.

There's enough data to suggest we should be wearing masks in public to prevent further transmission of COVID-19. It's not 
an excessively harsh request given the consequences. I can understand some leniency given certain circumstances, but 
especially for repeat offenders, a monetary punishment seems absolutely reasonable.

Thank you! Please include this in the official record.

Comments on Policy Order 10 on the May 5 Agenda

Please include my comments in the official record

I am writing in support of poilcy order 10 that calls for the Cambridge mask policy to be aligned with the state policy, CDC 
and WHO policies.

Having a mask policy in Cambridge (along with a fine) that is different than the state policy creates unnecessary confusion 
and unfairly targets minorities and less affluent people.

I strongly support a mask policy where social distancing cannot be maintained (as the state policy does), but the current 
policy goes far beyond that. Requiring masks in an outdoor setting when other people are not around does not make any 
sense and will lead to less compliance where it matters as people get tired of the policy.

Finally, the potential for selective enforcement is very worrying, and the fact that affluent people can just choose the pay 
the fine is manifestly unfair.

Please align Cambridge mask policy with state policy.

I am writing to express support for Policy Order 10 and opposition to the current mandate and order from the 
city. I want my comments in the official record.

I agree that having and using masks is essential to public health. However, the current order is not consistent 
with guidance from health organizations or in alignment with the orders from the state. To the best of my 
knowledge, no evidence suggests that wearing masks in all circumstances is beneficial. The use of face covers 
should be limited to cases where distancing is not possible or in confined spaces with circulated air. It makes 
sense to require covered faces indoors - indoor common spaces in residential buildings, grocery stores, 
pharmacies, restaurants, and other areas. It also makes sense to have masks ready for use outdoors when 
distancing is not possible. There does not appear to be any scientific basis for requiring masks outdoors in 
addition to distancing that I have been able to find. The overuse of masks may lead to additional problems. 
Wet masks, due to rain or sweat, are often less effective. Using masks also requires cleaning them and not 
cleaning or improper cleaning can also reduce their effectiveness. By mandating masks all the time, there is a 
higher risk of people wearing less effective masks in places where they would otherwise be beneficial.

However, even if the current order is revised, I feel that the damage has already been done. Rules such as the 
one in Cambridge raise fear when people believe that good, recommended practices inform policy decisions. 
People already have a false impression of what is safe or not. The most recent available research suggests that 
there is little risk of someone being close for a brief period. There are plenty of times when a person may need 
to walk, run, or bike past someone when unable to maintain a 6-foot separation. Wearing masks reduces the 
risks associated with this encounter. There are already discussions on the Internet - check out Twitter or 
NextDoor - with people expressing anger at being passed by a walker, runner, or biker for brief seconds, even 
when both people are wearing masks. As a runner, I'm now worried about going for a run since I'd prefer to 
avoid confrontations in the street.

Of course, masks aren't the only prevention. Covers can reduce breathing the virus onto surfaces. Avoiding 
touching the face and eyes and frequent hand washing is also essential. I hope that people continue to wear 
masks and wash their hands to prevent transmission. But I also hope that city policy is reflective of science and 
reason rather than emotion. In the future, when policies go further than guidance from respected 
organizations in the field of interest, there should be an expectation that the city supports the policies with 
evidence.

Construction Moratorium

Please convey the following to the Cambridge City Council as a communication at its next Meeting.

I have not been on the streets often during the current nightmare, to work on necessary errands, and I have combined the errands to 
minimize impact.

It was strikingly consistent during once weekly errand trips over a period of three weeks to note the open flaunting of the construction 
closure by MIT in its project on Binney Street in Kendall Square on the former U.S. Department of Transportation property. 

MIT very clearly considered itself exempt from requirements for normal responsible behavior. MIT was the only construction activity 
I noted.

Of interest, Harvard has delayed its opening of a project on Western Avenue in Allston for a semester because Harvard obeyed the 
moratorium.

Current Mask Mandate and Policy Order 10

Dear Mayor Siddiqui, City Manager, and City Councilors,

I am writing to support the City Manager's current mask mandate and to oppose Policy Order 10. I 
wish for my comments to be included in the official record.

According to the City of Cambridge’s COVID-19 May 1, 2020 update, a total of 761 Cambridge 
residents have tested positive for COVID-19 and 55 residents have died.

Many residents have become infected and died in Cambridge because City officials and Governor 
Baker did not take timely and effective action to stop the spread of COVID-19. Yes, non-essential 
businesses were closed, and people were told to stay home and maintain social distancing. 
Nevertheless, neither local nor state officials ordered people into quarantine or penalized them for 
defying these orders, as leaders in New Zealand, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and many 
other countries have done, allowing infections and deaths from COVID-19 to remain relatively 
low.

Due to the absence of effective leadership, many Cambridge residents continued congregating in 
parks and in public spaces and businesses owners maintained a business-as-usual attitude; they did 
not require employees or customers to wear masks, limit the number of customers in stores, or 
implement any other safety measures to protect Cambridge residents or their employees.  

After weeks of increasing deaths and infections, the City Manager finally issued on order on April 
27, 2020 to mandate the use of face coverings and proper social distancing in stores and public 
spaces which protects workers and customers and penalizes business owners and residents who do 
not comply with this order.

As elected leaders, you have an ethical and moral responsibility to protect the health and wellbeing 
of all residents and, as such, you must strengthen and enforce the current mandate, severely 
punishing people and business owners who defy your order.

Do not weaken the current mandate by eliminating the fine and allowing business owners and 
residents to decide whether to wear face coverings or keep appropriate distance. Do not give 
anybody the power to spread the disease and make people sick and die.  Oppose Policy Order 10.

The residents of Cambridge must have courageous leaders who act courageously to protect us and 
provide for our wellbeing during this crisis and in all matters.

ben Modifications to Mask Mandate

After reading copy of a message from council member Marc McGovern on NextDoor, I'd like to send a message in 
support of the modifications to the emergency mask mandate put into place last week. There is no need for a mask 
mandate and I would fully support repealing it immediately. 
However, considering the city manager's mandate seems to be caving to pressure from social media and neighboring 
towns, I suspect an outright repeal would not be something the council is bold enough to do. 
Therefore, modifying the mandate to eliminate the fine and to only require masks in certain instances is a crucial step in 
the right direction.

In addition, let me take this opportunity to strongly encourage council to open Cambridge back up for business as soon 
as possible. Do not delay.

Please Do Not Change the Current 4/24 Masks Requirement for all persons outdoors 
and shopping

I have heard that tonight you are considering back tracking on the current
requirement to wear a mask at all times outdoors, food shopping, etc.
I am 77 years old with a chronic illness and a compromised immune system.
I walk for my health, and try to do so every day.
Before the mandate went in last Wednesday, 4/29/20, I pretty much felt
terrorized and terrified by all the people out not wearing masks and not social distancing.
With the 4/24 mandate, we finally had a few days where going out was less stressful.
Please DONOT change it back to the way it was.
Let us remember how contagious and dangerous COVID-19 is.

Subject: Please make Masks a Requirement for all persons outdoors and shopping

Dear City Councilors,

I am a Cambridge resident.
I am also a senior with a compromised immune system.
I try to walk every day.

However taking a walk has become atleast as stressful as going to the market to food shop.
Atleast at the markets most people are finally wearing masks, some sort of face covering over their nose 
and mouth.
However practically no one outside (walking, running, cycling, rollerblading, etc) is wearing a mask/face 
covering of any sort.
If they have a mask/face covering, it is hanging around their necks down their front, not covering their 
face. Everyone who is outdoors needs to wear a mask/face covering.
Although runners are breathing hard, and the droplets they breath go further away than walkers (and 
therefore more dangerous) they are an example of completely disregarding the request of wearing a 
mask/face covering AND Social Distancing. While there are a few exceptions, for the most part, they run

right up behind one as close as can be, with nothing covering their face and make no effort to Social 
Distance.
SOCIAL DISTANCING at all times, especially outdoors, needs to be stressed in addition to wearing a 
mask/face covering.
Without everyone adhering to both of those ground rules/requirements, we will never be free of, we 
will never stop COVID19 in Cambridge and beyond.
If EVERYONE is not doing this we will not make any progress.

I just called the City Council office to state these concerns, and was advised that there is a “support 
order” to make wearing a mask/face covering a requirement.
That you will be voting on tonight.
I also just heard that Somerville has mandated wearing a mask/face covering when outdoors or 
shopping with a large fine for those who fail to do so. I would like to see Cambridge do the same.

I definitely SUPPORT making wearing a mask/face covering (covering mouth and nose) a REQUIREMENT 
when outside or shopping at all times for all persons in Cambridge.
Thank you.

Monday May 4th  - Support Manager's Mandate and Oppose Policy Order 10

Dear Councilors and City Manager:

I write in strong support for the City Manager’s emergency regulation of last Monday, April 27, 
2020 and in staunch  opposition to Policy Order No. 10, sponsored by Councilors Nolan, 
Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan that would dilute and  weaken the current rule regarding 
face coverings in Cambridge. Very importantly it will create confusion among citizens and 
make compliance and enforcement extremely complicated. 

First, the current order is simple and straightforward and detailed. It is easy to follow: put 
some kind of cloth around your face when going  outside or inside common areas of 
residential buildings. ( I was disappointed to see this latter part of the rule amended later 
regarding common areas.)  There is a fining mechanism of up to $300. However, there is a 
gradual approach to fining with plenty of room for lower fines and warnings. Of course, there 
is a simple way to avoid any fine whatsoever: wrap something (scarf, bandana, any kind of 
cloth covering) around face to cover your nose and mouth.  These are the orifices from which 
deadly Covid pellets – large and microscopic- are emitted and travel anywhere from 6 feet to 
12 feet, recent studies have shown. The main purpose of the covering is to protect others from 
ourselves. It is a measure of community responsibility. Maybe you don’t care about yourself 
but can you care about your neighbor, especially those who are vulnerable. This includes 
residents of lower income neighborhood and communities of color and seniors which have 
been disproportionately affected by Covid. 

Second, to change this order to follow CDC guidelines is a serious mistake. Such “guidelines” 
are just that – they are guidelines. They are not law and were not designed specifically for 
dense urban, congested areas such as Cambridge. There is nothing in the guidelines that 
prevents a city from going further and imposing more restrictive measures in order to 
protect the health, safety,  and welfare of its citizens.

Third, merely adopting the CDC guidelines creates confusion and creates an impossible to 
enforce system. To paraphrase a neighboring mayor, His Honor Joe Curtatone of Somerville, 
“We are too densely populated to assume perfect social distancing.” The same is true in 
Cambridge. We are not going to walk around with rulers.  Are police going to carry tape 
measures?

Fourth, with the CDC guidelines, assume this scenario: I am walking down Mass. Ave and I see 
no one in sight, then someone appears, then I have to put on or pull up my face covering; then 
the person passes within six feet; then after the person(s) goes by, I take my mask down or 
pull it off; then I see more people coming, up comes the face covering; then they pass, down 
comes my face covering; then a family with kids come into view, but are they coming within six 
feet? Do I put up my face covering? Do I get out my tape measure? Do I walk into the street to 
give them a wide berth? Better watch out for traffic and bikers! To play it safe, up goes my 
mask until they pass; etc. etc. etc. Isn’t this ridiculous. These are the CDC guidelines and they 
were not designed for Cambridge. Doesn’t it make more sense to have a simple rule that can 
be followed all the time. One that is clear and straightforward. 

Fifth, as far as the Governor’s order is concerned, there is nothing on its face that preempts 
any rule that goes further. The Governor’s EO also goes further than the CDC  guidelines; it has 
lots of specifics in it as to where face coverings must be worn which the  CDC guidelines do not 
include and the Governor’s EO also has a fining component of up to $300 in it. The CDC 
guidelines have no fining component. 

 

Everyone can find something to cover their face with. Yes, more education and free masks are 
in order. It was very safe last week to go out in my neighborhood and walk from Harvard to 
Porter Squares because practically everyone was wearing some type of face covering. Even 
residents in my building were wearing face coverings in our one elevator and in the hallways.

I fervently request that we not take a step backwards. We already have almost 800 cases in 
Cambridge and Massachusetts as a sate has over 4,000 deaths in less than 7 weeks. We in 
Cambridge as one of the more densely populated cities in our state have to step up our game 
and impress upon every resident that this is deadly serious business. Let’s have some 
confidence that our residents, once informed and educated, can and will rise to their civic 
duty. 

Respectfully submitted,

Re: Monday May 4th - Support Manager's Mandate and Oppose Policy Order 10

I wholeheartedly agree with Barbara Anthony.

I'm sorry to see that some of the councilors want to weaken current rules regarding face coverings. Indeed, it makes me 
sorry I gave you my vote.

Please. Until the daily infection and death tally flattens and decreases, we should honor the advice given by the actual 
science experts.

Your time would be better spent addressing the uptick in the violation of speeding laws.

deadly Covid pellets – large and microscopic- are emitted and travel anywhere from 6 feet to 
12 feet, recent studies have shown. The main purpose of the covering is to protect others 
from ourselves. It is a measure of community responsibility. Maybe you don’t care about 
yourself but can you care about your neighbor, especially those who are vulnerable. This

Second, to change this order to follow CDC guidelines is a serious mistake. Such 
“guidelines” are just that – they are guidelines. They are not law and were not designed 
specifically for dense urban, congested areas such as Cambridge. There is nothing in the 
guidelines that prevents a city from going further and imposing more restrictive measures 
in order to protect the health, safety,  and welfare of its citizens.

Third, merely adopting the CDC guidelines creates confusion and creates an impossible to 
enforce system. To paraphrase a neighboring mayor, His Honor Joe Curtatone of Somerville, 
“We are too densely populated to assume perfect social distancing.” The same is true in 
Cambridge. We are not going to walk around with rulers. Are police going to carry tape 
measures?

Fourth, with the CDC guidelines, assume this scenario: I am walking down Mass. Ave and I 
see no one in sight, then someone appears, then I have to put on or pull up my face covering; 
then the person passes within six feet; then after the person(s) goes by, I take my mask down 
or pull it off; then I see more people coming, up comes the face covering; then they pass, 
down comes my face covering; then a family with kids come into view, but are they coming 
within six feet? Do I put up my face covering? Do I get out my tape measure? Do I walk into 
the street to give them a wide berth? Better watch out for traffic and bikers! To play it safe, 
up goes my mask until they pass; etc. etc. etc. Isn’t this ridiculous. These are the CDC 
guidelines and they were not designed for Cambridge. Doesn’t it make more sense to have a 
simple rule that can be followed all the time. One that is clear and straightforward. 

Fifth, as far as the Governor’s order is concerned, there is nothing on its face that preempts 
any rule that goes further. The Governor’s EO also goes further than the CDC  guidelines; it 
has lots of specifics in it as to where face coverings must be worn which the  CDC guidelines 
do not include and the Governor’s EO also has a fining component of up to $300 in it. The 
CDC guidelines have no fining component.

Everyone can find something to cover their face with. Yes, more education and free masks 
are in order. It was very safe last week to go out in my neighborhood and walk from Harvard 
to Porter Squares because practically everyone was wearing some type of face covering. Even 
residents in my building were wearing face coverings in our one elevator and in the hallways.

I fervently request that we not take a step backwards. We already have almost 800 cases in 
Cambridge and Massachusetts as a sate has over 4,000 deaths in less than 7 weeks. We in 
Cambridge as one of the more densely populated cities in our state have to step up our game 
and impress upon every resident that this is deadly serious business. Let’s have some 
confidence that our residents, once informed and educated, can and will rise to their civic 
duty.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The Stay at Home Advisory and continued closure of non-essential businesses has had 
a devastating impact on our local business community; and 
 
In a District Impact Study conducted by the Central Square Business Improvement 
District, 96% of businesses surveyed reported being affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic, and 78% reported a decrease in sales, demonstrating just how desperately 
small businesses need assistance during these difficult times; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  While different programs to provide financial relief to small businesses have been 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

created at each level of government, there is often confusion on how to apply for these 
funds, with 70% of small businesses identifying “information on financial assistance 
over the next 90 days” as a critical need; and 
 
These financial aid programs do not necessarily address knowledge gaps in technical 
areas, which can be a significant barrier as more businesses move their services online; 
and 
 
In response to these issues, Cambridge has modified its Small Business Enhancement 
program to respond and has modified the Business Coaching program that provides 
individual assistance to businesses and pairs them with a coach who fits their specific 
needs to tele-coaching and has expanded it to include COVID-19 specific coaching; 
and 
 
As the closure of non-essential businesses winds down and the small business 
community prepares to return, this is the optimal time to assess the issues that small 
businesses will face in a post-pandemic environment and plan for how to reopen the 
small business economy and plan for recovery; and 
 
Having readily available access to business coaching, technical assistance, hands-on 
support, and related wrap around services would greatly benefit Cambridge’s small 
business community, and would give them the tools they need as they adapt to the 
challenges and ever-changing circumstances that this public health crisis presents; and 
 
Supporting the recovery of Cambridge’s small businesses would align with the 
Envision Cambridge goal of “[ensuring] local businesses of different types, sizes, and 
growth stages are able to start, grow, and remain in Cambridge”; now therefore be it

Division of the Community Development Department to create a plan for how the City 
will support small, local businesses in recovering from the devastating impacts of the 
COVID-19 pandemic, including use of existing city resources and CARES Act funding 
to provide additional support, such as individual coaching to support businesses as they 
are allowed to return to work; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter in a timely 
manner.

Cambridge Public Libraries, which also closed on March 13th, typically serve as an

WHEREAS:

WHEREAS: 

overall increase in time spent inside have resulted in students spending more and more 
time looking at screens, which can cause eye strain and sleeping problems; and 
 
It is imperative that physical library materials be made available to students to ensure 
they have the educational resources they need to succeed in school while minimizing 
additional screen time; and 
 
Low-income students could especially benefit from having physical library materials, 
as they may have more limited access to computers or internet service, limiting their 
access to e-materials, and as stocking an at-home private library may be a financial 
burden; and 
 
Utilizing the online library reservation system with specified material pick-up windows 
would allow our students to access these crucial library resources while preventing any 
additional risk for COVID-19 transmission; and 
 
A gradual phase-in process could be utilized to ensure our students are prioritized in 
receiving library materials, as having expanded access to library materials would 
directly enhance their education, while adult Cambridge residents could be included 
during a later phase; and

who have died from COVID19; now therefore be it 

 
The City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Cambridge Arts

COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

It has come to the attention of the City Council that exactly 50 years ago today, on 
Monday, May 4, 1970, four unarmed students were killed and nine unarmed students 
were wounded at Kent State University in Ohio by members of the Ohio National 
Guard while engaged in a largely peaceful protest of the continuing War in Vietnam, 
the invasion of Cambodia, and the presence of the National Guard on their campus; 
and 
 
The protests were sparked at Kent State and nationwide when President Richard 
Nixon, who had been elected claiming he had “a secret plan to end the Vietnam war,” 
went on national television on the night of April 30, 1970, and announced the 
invasion of Cambodia, which was in reality an expansion of that war; and 
 
Ten days later, on May 15, 1970, two African American young men were killed and 
twelve people were wounded by Mississippi State Police in protests at Jackson State 
University in Mississippi, in a similarly inexcusable armed assault on unarmed 
students and bystanders; and 
 
On this day, May 4, 2020, we remember the two young men and two young women 
who were killed at Kent State, Jeffrey Miller, Allison Krause, Sandy Scheuer, and Bill 
Schroeder, as well as the two young men who were killed at Jackson State, Phillip 
Lafayette Gibbs and James Earl Green, and the 21 students who were wounded across 
both campuses; and 
 
It is important to remember these historic events and use them to teach the importance 
of civil rights, civil liberties, non-violent protest, and proportionate response in the 
hope that, as the guardsmen responsible for the deaths at Kent State themselves wrote, 
“Better ways must be found to deal with such a confrontation”; now therefore be it 
 

 
RESOVLVED:  That the City of Cambridge declares May 4, 2020, “Kent State Martyrs Remembrance 

Day,” and declares May 15, 2020, “Jackson State Martyrs Remembrance Day,” and 
invite all Cambridge residents to learn about and reflect on the tragic events that 
occurred on those days.

WHEREAS: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

 
ORDERED: 

Data shows disparate impacts of COVID-19 on black and Hispanic Americans across 
the country as well as here in Cambridge; and 
 
Timely, accurate, and thorough data is needed to respond to these impacts and mitigate 
them; and 
 
Cambridge’s new COVID-19 data center is much improved and has begun to include 
racial and ethnic information, but demographic data is still very limited overall; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager enhance the data center to include information which the City 
Council deems essential to facilitating our collective response to the COVID-19 crisis, 
including, but not limited to, the following: 

1.  Links to downloadable data in the open data portal for all data shown on the 

2.  Information on deaths by age and by race and ethnicity similar to the state’s 

COVID-19 dashboard 

data reports 

3.  Total number of tests performed in facilities and in the community 
4.  Any other data that is available that can be safely reported without violating 

privacy; and be it further 

 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to release these enhancements and 
report back to the City Council as soon as possible; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager direct additional resources to mitigate the racial disparities 
already apparent in the data, including, but not limited to, increased provision of 
testing to impacted communities, increased outreach to those communities, and any 
other efforts to maximally limit the spread and severity of Covid-19 in these 
communities.

WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 
 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

 
WHEREAS: 

The City Council has been using Zoom for public comment for weeks due to the 
COVID-19 crisis; and 
 
The FBI first warned about “Zoom bombing” more than a month ago; and 
 
Precautions to take to protect against this phenomenon are widely established, but have 
not yet been implemented during the public comment portion of City Council 
meetings; and 
 
It’s not possible to completely prevent against bad actors joining a publicly accessible 
meeting and using the audio channel to cause mischief during the public comment 
period, the damage they cause can be limited by quickly muting the individual; and 
 
There is no need to allow the public to use video or screen-sharing during public 
comment; and 
 
Zoom or a different video conferencing application can be configured so that Council 
and Staff can conduct the non-public comment portion of the meeting with the public 
able to listen and view the proceedings via the video conferencing platform (in addition 
to the cable broadcast) without the public being able to interfere at all during that 
portion of the meeting; now therefore be it 
 

Packet Pg. 165

ORDERED: 

5.8

That the City Manager work with the IT Department to design a system for video 
conferencing and public comment during the City Council and other official meetings 
that allows the administrator of the meeting to prevent, eject, and recover from any bad 
actors attempting to disrupt the meeting. Potential preventive measures to consider 
include: 

1. Everyone entering the meeting is muted and has video and screen sharing disabled 
upon entry. 

2. The administrator individually unmutes the person who is next allowed to speak. 

3. That person's video is not enabled (we can have other criteria such as enabling video 
upon request for someone who is recognized by the admin). 

4. Councillors/officials participating in the meeting are given separate privileges and 
are required to log in to the meeting so that they can mute/unmute themselves and turn 
on/off their own video. 

5. The Zoom meeting is left on for the duration of the meeting so that people can listen 
to the audio and see the video via Zoom in addition to the cable broadcast which is less 
universally accessible. 

6. If Zoom cannot be made to behave this way, a different platform should be used that 
meets these requirements. 

7. The conference URL can be disguised via tinyurl or a similar mechanism to make it 
harder for hackers to identify. 

 
ORDERED: 

8. Several test runs should be conducted with councillors, staff and members of the 
public to ensure seamless operation during actual meetings; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager report back to the City Council on this matter as soon as 
possible.

COUNCILLOR NOLAN 
COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 
COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 
 
WHEREAS: 

Cambridge issued a face covering order that supports the health of Cambridge 
residents in public places who must be able to stay safe while buying groceries 
and other necessities or outside when in close proximity to people such as 
waiting in line, and ensures that fines will only be issued as a last resort, and 
makes it clear that people may use cloth face coverings like fabric masks, 
scarves, or bandanas, and must wear them over one’s nose and mouth; and 
 
Entities including the Center for Disease Control, World Health Organization, Mass. 
Department of Public Health, other states, and other cities in Massachusetts, including 
Salem, Brookline and Everett have mandated masks and face coverings in public 
settings where distancing is not possible and in public indoor settings especially 
commercial establishments and public transportation and without the imposition of 
fees, which differs from the Cambridge order thereby causing some confusion; and 
 
The city has received donations allowing for a commendable and welcome distribution 
of a suitable mask to residents who don't have one and amended the order to clarify 
and improve it; and 
 
Though it is essential for public health at this time that everyone have a mask 
available, there is potential for bias in enforcement, and a fine of $300 is 
excessive given the financial state of so many Cambridge residents; now 
therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and is hereby requested to review the order and align 
it with guidelines promulgated by the CDC, WHO, Dr. Fauci, the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health to make clear face coverings are 
required in public settings only when physical distancing is not possible; and be 
it further 
 
That the City Manager review and amend the order to reduce or eliminate the 
fines per incident; and be it further 
 
That the City Manager provide regular updates to the Council on any fines 
issued as a result of the Order, which should include demographic summaries 
by race, age, and gender for any fines issued; and be it further

COUNCILLOR SIMMONS 
 
WHEREAS: 

Uncertainties remain over how deep into the year cancelations and closures due to the 
covid-19 pandemic will last in Cambridge, and the closures of our public schools, our 
youth centers, and our after-school programming have hit local families with school-
age children particularly hard in recent months; and 
 

 
WHEREAS:  With summer just around the corner, parents of school-age children are understandably 

 
ORDERED: 

seeking clarity as to whether summer camps, youth centers, and youth-centered 
programming will be available this summer, and what contingency plans the City may 
be offering in the event that these camps and programs must be scaled back or altered 
due to the covid-19 pandemic; now therefore be it 
 
That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with the Assistant City 
Manager for Human Services and other relevant City personnel to determine whether 
summer camps and youth-programming will be allowed to proceed this summer, to put 
together contingency plans for Cambridge youth in the event that these programs must 
be scaled back or canceled due to the covid-19 response, and to report back to the City 
Council and the community on this matter in a timely manner.
