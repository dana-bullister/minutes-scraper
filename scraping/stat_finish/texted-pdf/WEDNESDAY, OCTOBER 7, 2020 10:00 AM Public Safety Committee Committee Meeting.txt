Public Safety Committee will conduct a public hearing on the Surveillance Technology Impact 
Reports and annual reports on ShotSpotter, BRIC, and COPLINK, and other outstanding 
surveillance annual reports, time permitting 
 
Councillor Zondervan called the meeting to order. He opened the floor to a presentation from the 
Cambridge Police Department (CPD) on Shotspotter. 
 
Police Commissioner Bard explained that Shotspotter is a gunshot detection system designed to be an 
ever vigilant reporting ear. He stated that across the country residents have become so immune to this 
type of gunshot that incidents go unreported and that criminals count on this indifference and become 
emboldened in such environments. He explained that gunshot detection systems provide a perpetual 
reporting to local law enforcement of these incidents and that he provided a lengthy diagram as to how the 
actual technology works. He explained that: the technology consists of 12 microphones condensed into a 
1.1 square mile area and that CPD has no listening capabilities. The company’s headquarters are in 
California. When gunshots occur, they are picked up by microphones, analyzed by algorithm, and the 
numerical address is sent to the local police department, along with a brief audio clip of the gunshot. 
In response to a question by Councillor Zondervan, the Commissioner stated that after receiving an alert 
from ShotSpotter, ECC emergency communications dispatches patrol units, and they go to the numerical 
address and attempt to locate the source of gunfire or gunshot victims. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about the availability of any data on how often 
police are able to recover evidence of actual gunfire, how often gunshot victims are encountered,  and 
how often shooters were apprehend as a result of ShotSpotter activation, the Commissioner stated that 
they can provide that evidence and that they frequently recover evidence of a shooting after a ShotSpotter 
alert. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked where ShotSpotter is deployed in Cambridge and if shots can be 
detected from anywhere in Cambridge, or only if they're in a certain section of a neighborhood or part of 
the city. The Commissioner replied that prior to the installation of the system, a detailed analysis was 
done as to the areas of where gunshots were most concentrated.  Based on that analysis, the microphones 
were placed in a 1.1 square mile radius area. He said that he has not publicly stated the exact locations of 
the microphones for security reasons.

Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked about the analysis and how many gunshots led to it being deployed in 
this area? The Commissioner responded that the number has remained largely the same and that there has 
been no statistical reason to ask for relocation of the equipment and that he wasn't a member of the 
(Police) department at the time of (ShotSpotter’s) installation. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked about false positives with ShotSpotter in Cambridge. Commissioner  
Bard replied that there are occasions where heavy loading equipment during construction will trigger an 
alert, and certain heavy categories of fireworks also will trigger an alert, but that it's a very small 
percentage of the time that (Shotspotter) generates a false alert. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that while the Commissioner did not want to disclose the exact locations of 
the microphones, it's well known that Shotspotter is installed in the Port neighborhood in Cambridge and 
he asked why we deployed that technology only in that particular neighborhood? Commissioner Bard 
responded that it was based on an analysis of where gunshots were most prevalent in the city. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Zondervan, Commissioner Bard stated that the Port area 
continues to be where the most persistent episodes of gunfire occurred, but that didn’t necessarily mean 
that Shotspotter is not effective because there are times when gunshots would have gone undetected if not 
for the presence of the ShotSpotter technology. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Mallon, Commissioner Bard stated that Shotspotter is not meant 
to be a deterrent but a tool to assist law enforcement in understanding the prevalence of gunfire.  He 
added that he believed that some activists had concerns about ShotSpotter recording conversations.  He 
stated that it is not unreasonable at all to expect that when an incident of gunfire occurs, and that 
Shotspotter begins recording, that it would also pick up hollering and other noises that can also be made 
at the same time that the gunfire occurs. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked about how many shots that ShotSpotter did not detect.  He stated that 
Fall River, Massachusetts stopped using it because it missed about 50% of the shots fired. Commissioner 
Bard stated that he was not aware of any instances in Cambridge when ShotSpotter did not detect 
gunshots that it would have been expected to detect. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that ShotSpotter raises racial equity and privacy concerns. He stated that 
Shotspotter is not a tool to proactively reduce crime, it merely identifies gunshots. In terms of the 
surveillance, he mentioned a case in New Bedford where some of the snippets of conversation that were 
picked up, were ultimately used as part of the conviction.  
 
Commissioner Bard responded that individuals discharging a firearm in a public way is a grave public 
safety concern and as far as he is aware Shotspotter is not capable of listening into homes.  
 
In response to questions from Councillor McGovern, Commissioner Bard stated that Shotspotter allowed 
the Police Department to detect gun shots that might otherwise go undetected.  He stated that some 
ShotSpotter responses lead to the police finding an injured person.  Commissioner Bard stated that 
ShotSpotter identifies the number of shots fired. 
 
Councillor McGovern stated he was interested in receiving data about the threshold number of gun shots 
to then decide to install ShotSpotter in a neighborhood. 
 
Saul Tannenbaum, 16 Cottage Street, expressed concern about Shotspotter.  He stated that the system is a 
failure based on the original promises.

Chair - Councillor Zondervan 
 
 
Commissioner Bard stated that the police department does conduct test firing to ensure that the system 
works and that the neighborhood is notified of these events.  He stated that Cambridge is not immune to 
gun violence.  In 2018, the Council ordered the police department to form a task force because of the 
gunfire. He stated that there are many instances of gunfire that the police department only became aware 
of because of Shotspotter. 
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about deploying Shotspotter citywide, Commissioner 
Bard stated that he did not believe that there would be widespread support for citywide deployment of 
Shotspotter. He stated that he was not opposed to citywide deployment, but he was not sure that there has 
been a need to cover the entire city.  
 
In response to a question from Vice Mayor Mallon about the purpose of the conversation about 
Shotspotter, Councillor Zondervan stated that the committee was examining the need and usefulness of 
the Shotspotter technology.  He stated that the committee could vote to approve the STIR or recommend 
that the Police Department stop using Shotspotter. 
 
Vice Mayor Mallon stated that the committee should specifically ask for the data that it is interested in 
reviewing. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Carlone about facts regarding the efficacy of Shotspotter, 
Councillor Zondervan stated that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 10,000 ShotSpotter alerts translated in to 
roughly 170 arrests, but in San Francisco, Shot spotter alerts translated into only two arrests and it is 
unclear how ShotSpotter has affected Chicago's clearance rate.  
 
Councillor Carlone stated that he understands that Shotspotter can report gunshots that might otherwise 
go unreported. He stated that he is not opposed to deploying the technology citywide. He stated that he 
would like to receive input from the ACLU at some point. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that he would like to have more data about this technology’s 
effectiveness. He recognized the potential privacy concerns raised by this data. He wanted to know how 
specific the location data is for where a gunshot occurred as reported by Shotspotter.   
 
Councillor McGovern stated that he believed that the Commissioner stated that Shotspotter is not meant 
to be a crime deterrent.  It is meant to reduce police response times, to help with investigations and 
rendering aid to injured persons.  He encouraged the committee to specifically ask for data that the 
committee is interested in reviewing.   
 
In response to a request by Councillor Zondervan, James Mulcahy, Legal Advisor to the Police 
Department explained the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC) omega dashboard to the 
committee.  He stated that the BRIC is a crime intelligence platform that allows participating agencies to 
analyze what types of crimes are occurring and where they are occurring.  The police department submits 
certain incident and arrest reports to the platform. The police department does not submit confidential

information, which includes domestic violence, juvenile and sexual assault victim information. He 
explained that the Omega dashboard allows participating agencies to plot where incidents were occurring 
geographically. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan if the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
Agency (ICE) has access to this information Attorney Mulcahy stated he did not know and that access is 
determined by the BRIC. 
 
In response to a question by Councillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler about the agencies comprising the BRIC,  
Commissioner Bard stated that as far as he knew the members consisted of the Metropolitan Boston 
Transit Authority, the city of Boston, other Transportation Agencies, Metro fire, Port Authority, and other 
cities and agencies. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Attorney Mulcahy stated that the department 
will contact the BRIC to find out who is allowed to access the Omega dashboard. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler about the specificity of BRIC data, 
Commissioner Bard stated that certain identifying information is uploaded but some information is 
redacted. 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler expressed concern about federal immigration agencies having access to 
BRIC data. 
 
Councillor Mallon confirmed with Commissioner Bard that the Omega dashboard has a minimal impact 
on privacy. He stated that the dashboard analyzes, and maps incidents reported by participating agencies.  
This allows different jurisdictions to work together to solve crimes. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about analysis performed by the Omega Dashboard, 
Attorney Mulcahy explained that the dashboard allowed users to break-down information by type, 
location and time. 
 
Commissioner Bard and Councillor Zondervan had a discussion about whether the analysis performed by 
users of the dashboard is new information that can be submitted to BRIC through the dashboard.Attorney 
Mulcahy explained that users run queries that at not necessarily reports and that the results of those 
queries are not re-uploaded to the system. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan about surveillance technology acquired by the 
BRIC, Attorney Mulcahy explained that there is a difference between the Omega Dashboard, which is a 
technology used by the Department and the BRIC which is an entity separate from Cambridge.  
Councillor Zondervan stated that he was interested in the type of surveillance data utilized by the police 
department through its participation in the BRIC. 
 
In response to questions from Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler and Vice -Mayor Mallon, Attorney Mulcahy 
and Commissioner Bard explained that the BRIC pulls data directly from the departments records 
management system, limited by certain predetermined rules and protecting confidentiality as explained 
earlier. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Mulcahy stated that the police department does 
not have a gang database.

At the request of Councillor Zondervan, Mr. Mulcahy provided an overview of COPLINK.  He explained 
that COPLINK operated much the same way as BRIC, except that COPLINK is a statewide database.  
Participating agencies submit incident or arrest data, motor vehicle crash data or citation data to 
COPLINK. Similarly, to BRIC, COPLINK has a feature that allows users to parse data by location, type 
and time to find patterns. This data has been helpful when determining when to issue firearm licenses to 
individuals requesting them. 
 
In response to a question from Councillor Zondervan, Commissioner Bard stated that COPLINK is 
provided by a private entity. Mr. Mulcahy stated that COPLINK works with public safety agencies 
nationwide, but Cambridge only accesses data provided by agencies in Massachusetts. The Commissioner 
did not know if the data was available to federal agencies. He further stated that the service is provided 
through a federal agency. 
 
Councillor Zondervan stated that he would like information about COPLINK’s data retention policy. 
 
Councillor Mallon stated that she did have concerns about the links between COPLINK and federal 
immigrations agencies.  She stated that she would like to have a larger conversation about this with the 
ACLU.  Commissioner Bard stated the police department shares the concerns about for the immigrant 
community and would not knowingly put them in jeopardy. Councillor Carlone shared those concerns. 
 
Councillor Zondervan moved to send the following policy order to the city council: 
 
“The City Manager and Police Department are hereby requested to provide data on Shotspotter, BRIC and 
Coplink to the City Council including: Shotspotter (broken down by year): number of gunshots reported 
through ShotSpotter, average response time, resulting arrests, resulting gunshot victims treated, number 
of gunshots reported by people across the city, number of gunshots reported by people in the ShotSpotter 
area, gunshots reported by people but not by ShotSpotter in the ShotSpotter area, data retention policies. 
BRIC: Federal agencies that have access to BRIC information, data retention policies; COPLINK: Federal 
agencies that have access to COPLINK information, data retention policies; and any other information 
that may be deemed helpful and informative to the Council in executing its duties with regard to the 
Surveillance Ordinance.” 
 
Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler moved to amend the proposed policy order to add:  Data on difference 
in response times between shots reported by Shotspotter and shots reported by humans and data on 
location pinpoint accuracy.
