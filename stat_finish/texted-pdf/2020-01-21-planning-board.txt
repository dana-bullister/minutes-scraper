          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Good evening.  This 

is the January 21 meeting of the Cambridge Planning Board.  

This is a note to everyone present.  This meeting is being 

audio and visually recorded.  We're going to start out the 

meeting this evening with an update from Community 

Development. Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Just to 

quickly go through the upcoming schedule, so we have two 

public hearings scheduled for tonight as well as review of 

BZA cases.   

          Next week, January 21, we also have some -- I'm 

sorry, January 28 -- we have a public hearing next week on 

40 Thorndike Street.  It is a special permit, which is 

seeking to amend a previously granted special permit for the 

conversion of the former courthouse building to a mix of

office and residential use. 

          That will be followed by a design update on a 

couple of the buildings at the Cambridge Crossing 

Development.   

          And February 4, the meeting is our annual Town 

Gown reports.  Those I believe should have available soon, 

if they're not already, and there will be presentations by 

Harvard University, by MIT, and by Lesley University, in 

that order. 

          On February 11, we also have some public hearings 

scheduled, and those include a hearing on a zoning petition 

to amend the incentive zoning contribution rate.  That was 

something that was proposed through the City Council 

following the receipt of a report examining the contribution 

rate which goes towards affordable housing program in the 

city.   

          And there's also going to be a public hearing on a 

proposed hotel development at 34 to 36 Hampshire Street.  

And after all that, it's our hope, and I believe as of this 

week we'll know for sure, that there won't be a meeting on 

February 18.  So we'll finally get a break then.   

          I'll note a few other things that are coming up

that might be of interest to the Board.  On January 29, 

there will be a meeting of the Climate Resilience Zoning 

Task Force -- a couple of you are on that Task Force.  We'll 

be discussing some technical information the consultant put 

together, which is really interesting on the subject of 

urban cooling and ways to mitigate urban heat island 

impacts. 

          There's a meeting -- there's a follow-up if needed 

scheduled for February 13 and I think we're going to -- on 

that task force we're going to play it by ear a little bit.  

We scheduled that additional meeting because it's a meaty 

topic, where we think we might need a little bit more time 

to discuss.   

          And then the Ordinance Committee of the Council 

has recently started scheduling a series of hearings for the 

foreseeable future, including on January 30 a continued 

hearing on the Harvard Square Zoning Petition.  The Planning 

Board made a favorable recommendation on that. 

          On February 5, there will be a continued hearing 

on the Alexandria Grand Junction Rezoning Petition -- and 

again, the Planning Board made a favorable recommendation on 

that petition.

          On February 12, the City Council Ordinance 

Committee will have its hearing on the Incentive Zoning 

Contribution Rate Petition, which I mentioned before. 

          And on February 18, they will have a hearing on a 

recent petition, which has to do with the definition of 

term, "family" in the zoning ordinance -- something that was 

proposed as a citizen's zoning petition, and that will also 

be coming to the Planning Board, although we're scheduling 

that a little bit later, because our agenda is quite full. 

          So that is all I have, and happy to turn it over, 

and unless it looks like there are some questions?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I was curious who are the Chairs of 

the Ordinance Committee this term?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  The Chairs of the Ordinance 

Committee are Councillors McGovern and Carlone.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  If the February 11 is the date 

that we're hearing the zoning petition to amend the 

contribution rate and the Council, and the Council is 

hearing it on the twelfth; how will they get our feedback in 

time?

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, the way the zoning petitions 

work, they are hearings by the Planning Board and the 

Ordinance Committee.  They don't necessarily have to be, you 

know, one before the other.  They are both -- the purpose of 

both of the hearings is to provide recommendations.  Those 

go to the full Council for action. 

          So the Council won't be able to take action until 

they receive the Planning Board's recommendation, or until 

21 days after the Planning Board hearing.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Thank you very 

much for the update.  We have no transcripts this evening 

for adoption, so we can move right into our 6:30 public 

hearing on Planning Board Special Permit #357, 966 Cambridge 

Street.  The applicant can go ahead and present the -- thank 

you.   

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  Good evening, Madam Chair.  My 

name is Gerry McDonough, M-c-D-o-n-o-u-g-h.  I live at 13 

Hollis Street in North Cambridge, and my -- I have a legal 

office at 125 Cambridge Park Drive.   

          I'm a lawyer for the Advesa team.  That's why I'm 

here this evening.  I'm here with the CEO, Jessica 

Pelletier.  Jessica, why don't you just start things off?

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  Jessica Pelletier, P-e-l-l-e-

t-i-e-r at 663A East Fifth Street, Boston, Massachusetts. 

Thank you everybody for coming out, too.  I appreciate it.      

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  So we're going to -- we are 

going to do our best to get through this in 20 minutes, I 

promise.  We'll make every effort.  We're going to briefly 

go through Advesa's strength, the team, additionally 

community reach as we file the application, the location, 

the building, the interior, transportation issues, security, 

reducing congestion around the building, and community 

benefits.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  Advesa's strengths.     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So Advesa has a number of 

strengths.  A couple of them are that every member of our 

team has been certified as an Economic Empowerment applicant 

by the Cannabis Control Commission.   

          We have a proven track record working with 

Economic Empowerment populations.  We are recognized leaders 

in both the Massachusetts Avenue marijuana industry and the 

national and international cannabis communities. 

          All of us have some sort of experience in the

marijuana industry as well, and we are one of the very few 

women-led ventures.   

          So just to introduce myself a little bit, I got 

into the industry about nine years ago as a patient.  I've 

turned into an entrepreneur, and I am one of the very few      

female leaders within the cannabis industry.  Tony Verzura, 

our Chief Operating Officer, he has two patents for cannabis 

products and over 80 awards. 

          Shanel Lindsay is an advisor to the Cannabis 

Control Commission.  She wrote the Economic Empowerment 

provision in the law.  She's a sought-after speaker across 

the country, and she's one of the few other women leaders in 

the industry.  She has built her own successful company for 

Ardent, which is a cannabis-related product. 

          Michael Latulippe has a long history of activism.  

I'm sure you guys all know Michael Latulippe.  He sits on 

just about every Board and Advisory Committee to the 

Cannabis Control Commission. 

          Tatiyana Benjamin, our CMO, she's a National 

Account Executive with Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield.  She's 

a health and wellness consultant for low-income women, and 

she's a volunteer from a number of health and wellness 

10

initiatives. 

          Last but not least, we have Isiah Benjamin, who's 

a finance consultant for the last 10 years.  And he also 

volunteers as a financial advisor for low-income families 

through his initiative called, "Young Men with a Plan."   

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  So -- I'll do this, if you want.    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  Mm-hm.     

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  So we've had a number of 

different community outreach activities since we submitted 

our application.  We had a community outreach meeting last 

week, January 15, at the police headquarters.  There were 

about somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 to 50 people who 

were present at that meeting. 

          We had a meeting with the community at the 

Roosevelt Towers, which is across the street from the 

location on October 20.  We met with the Cambridge Police 

Department on October 1.  We've had two hearings in front of 

the School Committee, because there was a motion in front of 

the School Committee to oppose our location on October 15 

and November 19. 

          We had additional meetings with City Councillor 

members -- Councillor Simmons, Councillor Devereaux.  We met

with the Suffolk and Middlesex County Sherriff's office in 

January 8, 2020 and had a meeting with the Chamber of 

Commerce on November 14.   

          We've had a number of meetings also with 

individuals, some of them are here tonight, in opposition to 

us, but we've also met -- we also intend to keep meeting 

with people, and to keep talking to people within the 

community. 

          So the location -- the location is at the corner 

of Windsor Street and Cambridge Street.  It's not East 

Cambridge, it's not Inman Square, it's in between those two 

areas. It's the Harrington-Wellington neighborhood.  Right 

here is the location in the corner.   

          And I think it's important to state at the outset 

that in this neighborhood, when you looked at the voting 

pattern in 2016, and General Election in question for/to 

legalize cannabis, a little over 70 percent, 70 percent and 

a fraction of people in Ward 1 Precinct 3, Ward 3 Precincts 

1, 2 and 2A, the precincts that are all around here in the 

neighborhood, 70 percent voted in favor legalizing cannabis.  

          That's higher than the citywide average, which was 

68.75 percent.  It's a smidgeon, but it does show that the

neighborhood is in line with the rest of the city. 

          I'm going to go through just a couple of slides 

very quickly.  This is the present status of the building.  

It's the Harvard Glass building.  It's been owned for over 

four decades by Judy Small and Sheldon Small, and they're 

the landlords who own the building.   

          They are big supporters of this project, and they 

have contributed to the neighborhood for a long time, and 

really support the neighborhood and are really supporting 

us.   

building. 

          So that's the building itself, the way it looks 

the now with the shutters on it.  That's the back side of 

the building, and that's just the front view of the 

          Here's the view from inside the building.  This is 

the area that will be the sales are, the large area inside.  

In front of it, over here, there's a door to the vestibule 

area.  This is a vision of the vestibule area with the gates 

still shuttered to the front door, and this is the vestibule 

area with the door leading into what will be the sales area. 

          Here are some elevations -- the existing north 

elevation, proposed north elevation, proposed south

elevation and the existing south elevation.  I should say 

that we have distributed a copy of this this evening, and 

it's very important, because we have made some changes in 

response to community input, and in response to the 

Community Development Department staffing memo. 

          I also want to say I would be remiss, if I did not 

thank the Community Development Department for all the hard 

work, they’ve put into this, and all the work they did 

assisting us -- particularly Swaathi Joseph, who has done 

much to help us.   

          And as a resident of Cambridge, somebody who lives 

here and works here, I'm just proud of the professionalism 

of the Community Development Department.  They do a terrific 

job. 

          So more elevations.  But this is a new design for 

the building -- slightly altered from what we had before.  

Before, it was all -- we were just going to paint the whole 

building with a new coat of white paint.   

          But in response to the CDD staffing memo, they 

suggested that we should have some different kind of façade 

on the building, to fit in more with the neighborhood. 

          Now, we tried, and we looked at putting some red

brick façade in the building.  Doesn't really work for us, 

and I don't think it really helps or adds anything to the 

neighborhood. 

          The actual colors, the theme colors for the Advesa 

brand are going to be black and white.  So we think it's 

important to have a black and white facility. 

          And also, this is -- the building itself is sort 

of a remnant of the old days, when manufacturing was a big 

part of this neighborhood.   

          Across the street, you'll see that there are -- 

you know, there's some different kinds of junkyards and auto 

repair places, and a bunch of industrial kinds of properties 

that I don't know how much longer they're going to be there. 

          But the kind of building here with the blocks on 

the building, we're maintaining -- we want to maintain that 

look to that building, the way it has been through its 

historic life.  But, in response to the staffing memo, we 

have added -- we're making the awning in the front larger, 

off to the sidewalk.   

          We're also adding awning at the side.  And we've 

decided to use this kind of black color around the front and 

part of the side of the building to add some different

texture to the façade. 

          The windows, by the way, when we first submitted 

our application, we were under the impression that they had 

to be frosted windows from the Cannabis Commission.   

          But we've since discovered that because we have 

this barrier between the sales area and the vestibule 

waiting area, we don't need to have frosted windows, so 

we're going to have clear, transparent, Low-E -- I believe 

it is -- glass on the windows in the front. 

          We don't need to change the sconcing.  The lights 

are above the awning and we don't see any reason to change 

that at this point in time.  I'll go through some more 

slides here.   

          Here are some pictures of what the interior will 

look like when it's completed.  There's a vestibule area, 

people enter from this door on Cambridge Street.  They come 

into the waiting area.  They will eventually -- if they meet 

their criteria and the -- you know, the 50 state secure ID 

and what not -- they'll enter into the sales area here.  And 

there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight 

different customer service points within here. 

          And that's the interior part.  Here is a -- it is

a stairway that leads up to the second floor, where there 

will just be business activities, meeting room space and 

          Here's another view of it again.  This is entering 

from Cambridge Street, a view -- the vestibule area and the 

sales area back here.  And in the very back is a loading 

what not. 

bay.   

          Now, the loading bay is not more than 30 feet, 

which you need for certain sized property, but because our 

property is less than 10,000 square feet, we don't need to 

be more than 30 feet.  So we have a loading bay.   

          And that is an area that can be locked securely.  

If there are any deliveries of cannabis products, they will 

go in through the loading bay.  The door will close behind 

them.  In accordance with the transportation memo that we 

received, we will have a beeping sound when trucks are 

entering or leaving that locked area.   

          Going here, here's another view of the vestibule 

area, where people will be waiting before they enter the 

sales area.  Another view of the sales area here.  And these 

are just some floor plans.   

          And I just want to draw your attention to this

floor plan, which has a little more detail on it.  We 

envisioned having -- within the vestibule having some 

retractable barriers.  So, as you see in a bank, or as you 

see in Disney World, people will be lining up, and they will 

be snaking through these retractable barriers here while 

they're waiting. 

          People will then enter through this door into the 

sales area, and when a place becomes available, they will 

step up to the counter. And then people will leave the same 

way.   

          There was some question as to whether this door in 

the rear of the building is a second -- is an exit actually 

for customers.  As designed right now, it's an emergency 

exit only.  And we envision that our employees are going to 

get into the sales area by coming this way.   

          There's a locked gate there, that they'll have to 

get through.  And then there's another gate over here to get 

-- a locked gate to get into the sales area.  So there's two 

gates that they have to get through. 

          Over here in the loading area, the loading bay is 

also where we're going to have our bicycles.  We have spots 

for two bicycles to be stored here.  We'll also have air

pumps and tire fixers and all the other kind of things that 

the Transportation and Planning Department asked of us. 

          So a little bit about transportation.  There are 

three bus routes that are nearby the location here.  There's 

a 69 bus that runs between Lechmere and Harvard Square.  And 

that stops actually right in front of the building here on 

Cambridge Street.  There is another bus -- the 85, I believe 

-- runs from Spring Hill to Kendall Square.   

          And what that does is it comes down Western 

Avenue, and then snakes over Webster Avenue, and there's a T 

stop right there where the bus stops.  And then it drives 

down here, and it goes down Windsor Street. 

          And the same thing as with the CT2 bus, which 

comes from Sullivan Square.  It goes from Sullivan Square to 

Ruggles Square.  It goes, takes the same route down Webster 

Ave, down Cambridge Street, down Windsor Street, and on the 

way back they go actually up Columbia Street, and they stop 

at the end of Columbia Street. 

          By the time our store is open, we believe and 

think the Union Square Green Line Extension maybe finished.  

It's supposed to be finished in 2021.  We don't envision our 

store opening before 2021, and that is 0.4 miles away from

where we're located. 

          And we also have a Bluebikes station right here at 

the corner of Webster Street, Columbia Street, and Cambridge 

Street.  And there is a parking lot -- the Windsor lot.  

Whoops, go back this way.  There is a Windsor lot right 

across the street, which has 11 spaces.       

          So we have accepted every suggestion by the 

Transportation Department.  We can go over those from MBTA  

-- you know, passes for employees to Gold Level Bluebikes.  

Everything that they have suggested to us we've been willing 

to accept.  We think they're fair and reasonable suggestions 

by the Transportation Department. 

          We also, for security, we have engaged the 

services of Edward Davis, LLC. Edward Davis is here tonight.  

He can answer questions that people might have, former 

Police Commissioner of City of Boston.   

          He's helping us with all our strategic security 

issues that we have -- making sure our architects have 

planned in security within the building itself, and helping 

us with all kinds of other issue about dealing with any 

kinds of safety issues that may arise. 

          And Ed is here today this evening with John

Sprague, and head be happy to answer any questions anyone 

has.   

          And then we have -- there are multiple security 

requirements, as you know, required by the Cannabis Control 

Commission and required by the law.  And we're meeting all 

those requirements.  And security prevention of product to 

minors is very, very important.   

          The Cannabis Commission has already made a lot of 

requirements about making sure there's packaging that it 

safe and secure and tamper proof.  We're following through 

with all those recommendations.  We will have ID checks -- 

two ID checks for people to get in.  They'll need an ID 

check to get into the first door, and then to get buzzed 

into the sales area. 

          No one under 21 who has, you know, who has a fake 

ID would ever get into our store, it would just be 

impossible.  And I think -- actually, that’s the case for a 

lot of different cannabis operations. 

          Reducing congestion:  So we had a number of 

community meetings.  After the first community meeting, we 

came up with a plan to have different hours.  Original hours 

were going to be 8:00 to 8:00, and we then proposed, well, 

21

let's not open the store until 9:00 until the schools are 

open.  And then let's close from 3:00 to 4:00 p.m. in the 

afternoon. 

          And we came up, and we realized ourselves that we 

were going to have a management problem dealing with that, 

because it's all of a sudden if we close from 3:00 to 4:00 

and it's 2:55 and we've got six or seven people in the 

store, do we kick them out?  Where do they go?  What 

happens?  So we have a management problem with that. 

          And a lot of people in the neighborhood also 

raised an issue, which we believe is a serious issue.  

People would come and they would be waiting in cars maybe.  

Maybe they would be waiting outside the store clogging the 

streets.   

          So we've given up on the idea of having the store 

open from, you know, 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. with the closing 

hours in the afternoon, because -- at the time that kids get 

out of school. 

          So our new proposal is that the hours of operation 

will be no more than 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.  We're not sure 

what the market will be like a year from now, but that is 

the maximum number of hours we would be open.  We still

would not be open during the school opening hours, we would 

open at 9:00 a.m. at the earliest. 

          And the school would not be open during the school 

opening hours.  For the first 30 days of operation, the 

store will only be open to customers on an appointment 

basis. 

          We intend to use -- our way of dealing with 

congestion at that time of the day is to use the latest 

available technology.  Something that's available now is an 

app called Waitwhile which, you know, if you sign up, you 

know, Dining Out or one of those websites to schedule a 

meal, that's the kind of web application we want to use for 

our store.   

          So we would have people sign up for specific times 

to come into the store.  And they would have an appointment, 

and those people would go to the head of the line.  There 

would be no waiting for those people.   

          And we would not schedule people at all during the 

hours from 3:00 to 3:30, when schools are closing.  So 

people would not -- hopefully not be coming anywhere near 

the store. And if they did, it would not be clogging up the 

street in front of the store.

          And Advesa will also use -- work with the city to 

ensure that a school crossing guard is present at the 

intersection of Cambridge and Windsor Streets during school 

opening and closing hours.  There used to be a school 

crossing guard at Windsor and Cambridge Street, but this 

year the school crossing guard has moved down to Willow 

Street.   

          So we're willing to talk to the City Manager if we 

get to the host community agreement part of this application 

process will talk about a way that we can fund either  

through our contribution or some other contribution -- find 

a school crossing guard at that intersection in the morning 

hours even when we're not open and in the afternoon hours as 

well.  We think that's going to be very important. 

          Another plan we came up with is something we call 

the Advesa Advantage Coupon.  Early on, way before we 

submitted our application -- and we never included this as 

part of our application -- we considered doing some kind of 

a discount program for people who took bikes or took the 

MBTA to our location.  And that's illegal.  You can't offer 

discounts.   

          So what we came up with was this idea called, 

24

Advesa Advantage coupons.  So if we have people who are 

coming into our store at that time of the day, or the store 

ever gets too crowded, and there are too many people 

clogging up the sidewalks, we are hoping to negotiate with 

different restaurants in the area, different cafes in the 

area, to have coupons. 

          And we'll give those people a coupon for $5 off 

anything they purchase at the store, that we will then 

redeem to the business at the end of every month.   

          And then they will come back at a very specific 

time and they'll go right to the head of the line.  So they 

will use their coupon $5 off to get coffee at a café or 

something like that. 

          We're also considering doing that for people who 

take bikes or take the MBTA.  If they can show us that 

they're taking a bike to our store, or they're using the 

MBTA and they're not clogging up the traffic, we're thinking 

of providing these Advesa Advantage coupons to those people 

as well.  We think these are the kinds of things that will 

really reduce congestion. 

          We're also going to have -- on our staff will be a 

community engagement director, a person whose responsibility

will be to engage with the community as much as possible.  

It will be somebody who the community will have -- all 

abutters will have this person's e-mail address and phone 

number to be able to reach this person at any time there are 

any kind of problems.   

          And additionally, we'll hold at least quarterly 

community engagement meetings to check in on the community, 

to hear their concerns to see if there are ways that we can 

alleviate those concerns. 

          So that's the way that we are proposing to reduce 

congestion around the area. 

          Now, there's a lot of community benefits.  

Everybody is doing the three tax and what not.  And our 

employment, we've had experience here.  These are people who 

have hired people who are Economic Empowerment employees.   

          It's not as easy as going out and hiring somebody 

you think off the street who has a criminal record because 

they were arrested for possession of marijuana 10 years ago.  

It's not that easy to hire people and train people.   

          And we have a track record of doing that.  Jessica 

and Tony have done that, both in Oakland, California, and in 

Jamaica.  They're working that kind of people.  So they have 

26

experience dealing with people who have these kinds of 

problems and need jobs, and the people we're going to offer 

jobs to.  We expect 15 to 25 jobs, and we hope that there 

will be a lot of people from Cambridge who will be filling 

those jobs.   

          And lastly, we're going to do educational 

programs.  We're going to train other people on business 

requirements and working in the cannabis industry -- provide 

business membership classes with Isiah, who's the expert in 

business.  We're going to utilize Tati, who has experience 

in health and wellness and have her help us with trying to 

get some school programs to teach kids about the dangers of 

youth and cannabis.   

          And we'll also offer regular office hours once a 

month in an open location, with a way to help people get -- 

clean their criminal records if they have these kinds of 

marijuana offenses on their records. 

          So that, ladies and gentlemen, those are 20 

minutes.    

Thank you.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Nice job, Gerry.

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  We'll get questions later or --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I appreciate that.  

Do members of the Board have questions for applicant now, or 

we'll go to public comment first?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Public comment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Hugh?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Passing the sheet over, Madam 

Chair, and I just wanted to note, I'm not sure if anyone's 

covered this.  This meeting is being audio and video 

recorded.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So the process 

for public comment is as usual.  I will call the names of 

folks who have signed up and indicated either that they wish 

to speak or have not indicated either way whether or not 

they wish to speak.  If you're not signed up, you will still 

be offered a chance to speak, and when you are called, 

please come to the mic.  Give and spell your first and last 

name.   

          We do have a full sheet here.  Is the Board 

wanting to stick with our three minutes, or should we be 

looking at cutting that back, given the agenda of this 

28

meeting?       

it.    

          MARY FLYNN:  Yeah, I think we should stick with 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  I'm not 

hearing anyone advocating cut it back.  So you will have 

three minutes.  If you can be more brief than that, we would 

all appreciate it.   

          And it's perfectly fine to say, "I agree with what 

the previous speaker said" or what someone else said, rather 

than reiterate.  So the first person on the list is Key 

Crooks.  So your first person on the list, if you would 

please come forward now. 

          KEY CROOKS:  I'll withhold my comment.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Kay Sheppa, 

then, is next.  [Pause] Okay.  Toni Shelzi?  There we go.        

          THE REPORTER:  Could you spell your name? 

          TONI SHETZI:  Good evening. My last name is 

spelled S-h-e-l-z-i, and said Shelzi.  Thank you for 

allowing me this opportunity to speak.  I own a business in 

Cambridge, in East Cambridge.  Originally, we opened it in 

Inman Square, and now we're in East Cambridge.  So we know

-- I'm familiar with the neighborhoods involved.   

          I am speaking on behalf of the applicant.  The 

business that I own is ABG Commercial Realty, and we are the 

realtors who leased the space.  So my company is owned by a 

woman and run by a woman, and this company is also owned and 

run by a woman.  And it's important -- it's always -- it's 

been very important to me to have women working for us.   

          And the woman who presented the property to this 

applicant was not able to be here tonight, but her name was 

Alyssa King.  And so, I have been a very strong supporter of 

women-owned businesses.   

          My understanding is that the -- our applicant has 

had a great deal of community outreach, has worked hard to 

meet with different people in the East Cambridge community, 

has not always met with success in terms of getting 

meetings, but has really worked quite diligently at trying 

to get those meetings. 

          I don't believe -- I believe that this would be an 

asset to our community, and I believe that they will 

continue to be good neighbors.  And I think that that's 

important that we feel comfortable with the people that are 

running businesses in our community, and that they are 

taking every step possible to be good neighbors.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Next is

Camillo Basto.       

          CAMILLO BASTO:  Hi, everyone, good.  Camillo 

Basto, B-a-s-t-o.  Didn't realize I was right by Toni.  

She's actually my boss.  And I work at ABG Commercial 

Realty.   I know the applicants quite well.  I've been in 

the cannabis industry for about six years. 

          This process started over a year ago.  And there 

has been some opposition.  They have been trying to work 

with that opposition.  Unfortunately, some of the opposition 

just -- you know, if you have your ears closed, you can't 

listen, right?   

          As we've gone through this entire process -- this 

process started a very long time ago, starting with the 

zoning.  A lot of the questions around the zoning were 

specific to how the proximity to the school.  And when that 

decision was made, it was made in a flippant way by City 

Hall.  They took a very long time, took about six to eight 

months.   

          They revisited, and they looked at it in multiple 

different lights, in different ways.  And they decided to go

with a 300-foot buffer zone.   

          This particular location is 100 percent compliant 

with the rules and regulations and zoning in the City of 

Cambridge.  They are not asking for a special variance or 

any type of special allotment for them. 

          In addition to the location itself, they have done 

extensive community outreach.  They really have engaged and 

tried to engage the opposition.  It's not just the people 

that are for it, but they really have tried to try to 

mitigate any issues that people may have with cannabis.   

          The problem is that people just have a problem 

with cannabis.  It's -- you know, it's just the way it is.  

People have a problem with cannabis around the school, but 

you could then have a smoke shop across the school.  You 

could have a liquor store across the school.  You could have 

advertising across the school.  This location is going to 

have absolutely no advertising in our community.        

          In addition to that, my experience with cannabis  

--  I can tell you from a personal basis that you're not 

going to have, or you're not going to find more qualified 

individuals looking to open up a store here.   

          These aren't people that are -- you know,

newcomers or first-timers to the industry.  These are 

individuals that have a depth of knowledge in cannabis on 

how to operate.   

          And we're not going to have issues with diversion 

or other issues in Cambridge if they did come.  And whatever 

issues do come, they're more than willing and happy to 

mitigate and work with the community.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Robert 

Borkowski?  Okay.  Michael Grill?      

          MICHAEL GRILL:  Hi, Michael Grill, G-r-i-l-l.  I'm 

the Chairman of the 432 Columbia Street Condominium Trust, 

which owns 1035 Cambridge Street.  Gerry was nice enough to 

put the aerial up.  Our property is on the quadrant of -- 

besides the Shell station right here, we own this entire 

block, which includes about 150 parking spaces of the 

building. 

          The building has about 35 companies, 350 

employees.  Our biggest concern has nothing to do with 

cannabis.  It has to do with 10.43 and the code, the adverse 

effects of this business on our property -- the nuisance 

that it will cause, the hazard possibly to our occupants, 

the property owners.  This is an office condominium

building.  So we have six different owners.  It's not just 

me, I'm the Chairman of the Trust, but we have other owners 

as well. 

          It's quite clear from reading the Director Bar's 

letter of January 9,2020.  He says parking will be a 

challenge.  Everyone's talking about congestion.  It's just 

amazing to me that no one's -- no one really cares about the 

adverse effects of this business on our business.  The 

possibilities that customers will be parking in our parking 

lot, the 50-car parking lot in front.  

           We currently have people popping in and out of 

our parking lot, and we do not have a gate in front of our 

parking lot.  We're an office building.  The office building 

is open from approximately 8:00 weekdays to 5:00 weekdays.  

People are mostly gone by 6:00.  We don't operate on the 

weekends.  So we're going to have no one taking care of -- 

we don't have security guards wandering around our parking 

lots. 

          Everything I'm hearing from the public meetings, 

from the meetings that I've had with Gerry, as well as Ms. 

Pelletier, Ms. Pelletier -- are you Mrs.?  Thank you, Mrs. 

Pelletier -- that this place is going to be deluged with

customers.  I understand appointment-only, but eventually 

we're going to have a lot of people showing up at this 

property. 

          We're talking about where are people going to be 

if the lines are too great?  The Director Bar's letter of -- 

again, January 9, stated that no lines would be allowed to 

form on the sidewalk.  Well, where are people going to go?  

They're going to go to our parking lot.  They're going to go 

to our grassy areas.  We're right there.  Where else are 

they going to go? 

          So there's a huge adverse effect to our property.  

Do you expect us to hire security guards?  I want to know 

when there's people hanging out in our parking lot, who has 

the right to go onto our parking lot on the weekends, where 

I'm not there, our security -- we don't have security there.  

          When our building superintendent is not there, 

who's going to go onto our property and tell people, "You 

can't be here"?  Who's going to -- if people are hanging out 

on our lawn --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sir, you're over 

time.  Can you please wrap up?       

          MICHAEL GRILL:  I will.  I was here in 2015, when

the 305 Webster Avenue project was approved.  And during 

that project, or during that process, I gave you a letter, 

and I said, "Who's going to take care of our property when 

it's under construction?  Who's going to take care of it 

after construction?" Understand, this is a relatively major 

point, okay?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.  I'm sure 

everyone in the room feels that way, and if we're going to 

hear everyone, you really need to hold on, because --      

          MICHAEL GRILL:  I'd like to know, the city 

departments have failed dramatically, reasonably, and you 

have a letter that just documents it.  We get no cooperation 

from city departments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.       

          MICHAEL GRILL:  Who's going to show up at our 

property and take care of our needs?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Paul 

Fernandez?  Thank you.   

          PAUL FERNANDEZ:  Paul Fernandez, F-e-r-n-a-n-d-e-

s.  I just want to be real quick.  I think what this company 

is doing is -- they're doing a great job.  And I understand 

the law, that they -- that's what passed, they have every

right to do that.   

          The only problem is that I have is the location, 

its proximity to the schools.  There's a church up the 

street, and you have the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, 

you have King Open.  And then there's another school 

somewhere around this area here that used to be called the 

Robert Kennedy School.  So there's a tremendous amount of 

kids in this area.   

          So my only problem is the kids.  Everything else, 

I really don't have much of an issue with, and I think this 

company -- again, I think this company's doing a great job.  

I just wish that was an area where there was a lesser amount 

of kids, that's all.    

DeSola? 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Caroline 

          CAROLINE DESOLA: Good evening Madam Chair and 

members of the Board.  My name is Caroline DeSola.  That's 

D-e -- s like Sam -- o-l-a. I'm a resident in 336 Windsor 

Street, the street in front of the proposed location.  I'm a 

mother of three children, one of whom we recently 

transferred to the brand-new King Open, because we're so 

thrilled.   I know the city has worked very hard to have

that in our neighborhood. 

          I'm also an active member in the Wellington-

Harrington Community.  We put on a very large block party.  

As you know, it's one of the city's most dense populations.   

I know a lot of my neighbors very well.  In fact, we have 

over 350 signatures that are in opposition to this location.  

          A lot of what was talked about, the 70% voters -- 

everybody that I talked to,  I know myself included, we 

firmly believed there would be rules, regulations, and 

proper buffers that would be in place with that kind of law 

to help protect our children and our city's most vulnerable. 

          In addition to King Open, there's the King Open 

Preschools, Little Stars of Ours day care, which is within 

300 feet, Aster Montessori School, Head Start, the facility 

youth center, Miramelinda Montessori School, the Cambridge 

Public Library, Valente Branch; the Gold Star Pool, the 

Vinfen, which is just two doors down, that offers 

comprehensive services for adolescents and adults with 

psychiatric conditions, et cetera and the evidence-based 

programs in recovery just two doors down; the Mass Alliance 

of Portuguese Speakers; Just-A-Start, which is within 300 

feet, that offers education and workforce training for youth

and adults; CitySprouts, Cambridge Education Association, 

Solutions that work and The Children's Clothing Exchange. 

          I think that is just an extreme amount of social 

services and schools in one concentrated area of the city.  

And when the applicant did their traffic study, we believe 

that to be obsolete.  It took place while the King Open 

complex was under construction.   

          And I looked back at when they were doing the King 

Open construction.  And in fact, the architect for that 

noted that the majority of the students there walk to and 

from school.  It's an incredibly busy intersection at the 

corner of Windsor and Cambridge Street.   

          The applicant noted there is a bus stop there.  

That bus takes kids to Cambridge, the high school, other 

locations, and these people coming for their social services 

use that specific stop right in front of this location. 

          So the King Open is what most people are talking 

about.  It's 300 and some change feet away.  I think that's 

pretty darn close.  It's the number of people who are 

walking in and around. 

          I also am hesitant with the applicant --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ma'am, you need to

          CAROLINE DESOLA:  -- okay, based on the Economic 

Empowerment, because they really -- Tony Verzura was 

actually listed as the founder, and they were just denied an 

application in Somerville in September.  I'm not sure if 

you're aware of that.  They found them to be lack of local 

ties the community and the EEA connection.   

          I have other things I'd like to say.   I know I 

have to wrap up.  Thank you very much for this meeting.

Empowerment applicants I believe out of the most people 

during -- you know, belonging to this project.   

          These are the people to do it and carry it out.  

They have experience and, you know, I've seen them to do the 

right by their community and the people around them, and 

that's something to really move forward.   

          So I strongly recommend Advesa, because Cambridge 

needs something within the community.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Joseph 

          JOSEPH FARINA:  Joseph Farina, F-a-r-i-n-a. Let me 

start by saying --       

          THE REPORTER:  Could you give your address, 

Farina?   

please?     

          JOSEPH FARINA:  333 Windsor Street.  Let me start 

by saying that 70 percent of the voters in the neighborhood 

voted to legalize cannabis.  I'm good with that.  I also 

want to mention that we're here tonight to talk about 

community.  Perhaps not everybody in the community voted.  

Perhaps not everyone in the community can vote.   

          But I will say this:  My family, who has been in 

the Wellington-Harrington neighborhood for 100 years, we

oppose this license.  It is going to have a negative impact 

on our community.  Call it what you want, it is a drug.  It 

is a drug.  I've seen the negative impacts that it has had 

from friends of mine in that neighborhood.   

          In Donnelly Field, you still cannot stop people 

from smoking marijuana in Donnelly Field.  How are you going 

to stop it from getting into the hands of our children in 

our school?  How?  Tell me.  You can fluff it and say, "Oh, 

we're going to put bar codes on it, we're going to have 

people sign for it, and we're going to ask people for a 

license." 

          No, they will take it, and they will sell it, and 

they are doing it now.  They are lacing this drug with an 

even more powerful drug.  It's getting into the hands of our 

students.  It's getting into the hands of people in our 

community.  We do not want this drug in our community.  Put 

it somewhere else.  It's going to have a negative impact.  

You're too close to the school.   

          Listen to the needs, the concerns and the 

sensitivities of your community.  That's what we're talking 

about here.  We're not talking about big business.  This is 

a working-class neighborhood.  We live in the shadow -- the

shadow of Kendall Square, billion-dollar corporations.  Do 

we really need this in our neighborhood now too?  We don't 

want it.  We're opposed to it.   

          So I'm asking you, please think about our 

community and our neighborhood.  Think about the negative 

impact that this will have.  I live on Windsor Street.  I do 

not want people walking by my house smoking this drug.  And 

this dispensary is going to be selling not medical marijuana 

-- recreational.  What are we talking about, gummy bears?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  You can't sell gummy bears in 

the state of Massachusetts.     

          JOSEPH FARINA:  Okay, let's say we can't sell 

them.  Okay, fine, I stand corrected.  This drug will make 

it into the hands of those poor students.  We have to stop 

it now.  Now is the time to stop it, to not allow more of 

these dispensaries to open up.  It will have a negative 

impact, and you will hear from me again if anyone is 

victimized by the sale of this marijuana.  It will have a 

          Please think about what you're doing here.  Think 

about what you're doing to my community, to their community.  

negative impact.   

Thank you.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  So are 

there a lot of people in the room who did not sign up to 

speak?  And I'd like a share of hands of who would still 

like to speak.  All right.  Okay.  I'm going to work from 

this side over to this side.  So if I -- I'll have hands 

come up again as needed.  So I apologize for pointing and 

calling people out in that way.  We'll do what we can. 

          So, over here, let's start with you.   

          DAVID MONTAGUE:  So I'm David Montague, M-o-n-t-a-

g-u-e.  I own a business at 1035 Cambridge Street.  I own 

about 4,000 square feet there.  I have between my company 

and my tenant company; we have about 20 people who work 

there.  We -- in order to get here tonight, I had to go out 

a door right on Windsor Street, pretty much one of the 

closest doors to that location.   

          And I had to step over a young man who was 

probably 14- or 15-years old smoking pot in the doorway 

right in our building.  I had -- and he was with two or 

three friends who looked a little older, but he was very 

young, and he's there every night smoking pot.   

          And it's just -- and so, I have a bunch of 

problems with that, but one of them is that our tenant --

the women in our tenant group has about 10 employees.  

They're leaving, because they don't feel comfortable.  So 

they are leaving our building and moving downtown, because 

it's just not a safe environment.   

          I mean, that's one of the main reasons.  My 

employees -- the women in my company cannot leave the 

building through Windsor Street anymore, because these kids 

are out there smoking pot every night.  That problem is 

going to get much, much worse.   

          So I just don't think that, you know, this is a 

good environment.  It's not a good location for it being so 

close to a school.  It's not a good location being so close 

to an alluring housing development -- you know, unit.   

          And from our point of view, you're basically 

driving -- already, we're driving employees out of the 

neighborhood, companies out of the neighborhood.  And so, 

you know, I don't know anything about what these guys do, 

but I do know that already cannabis is having a major 

negative impact on my employees, and especially the women in 

my company.  They do not feel safe leaving through that -- 

through Windsor Street anymore.  And that really is not a 

good thing.

Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          SETH TAYLOR:  Greetings, all.  My name is Seth 

Taylor.  I live at 48 Norfolk Street, on the corner of 

Bishop Allen and Norfolk Street, which is literally one 

block.  I can see the dispensary from my window.   

          The challenge I have with this model -- and I'm an 

entrepreneur, by the way.  My company -- the SmartLabs -- 

leases something like 60,000, 70,000 feet of lab space in 

Cambridge and contributes to the miracle of what Cambridge 

is about.   

          So I live within a block.  I see the parking lot 

daily, from, like, right across the street.  It's full.  And 

the challenge I face between H-Mart, the new, massive condo 

complex being developed down the road, and the one around 

the back end of this building on the other side, which it 

just launched, is that this parking has really become a 

nightmare.  Not just parking, but just traffic.   

          Now, I understand this group got an approval about 

a couple months ago to do the medical dispensary, and 

they're coming back to do a retail dispensary.

          HUGH RUSSELL:  He's talking about the wrong case.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, we're talking 

about the one on Cambridge Street at Windsor.   

          SETH TAYLOR:  Yeah.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Which is not -- it's 

just a retail space. 

          SETH TAYLOR:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  The next case is a 

medical --  

          SETH TAYLOR:  So there are three of them that are 

proposed in and around Central Square, right?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  But this is 

not one of those.   

          SETH TAYLOR:  Okay.  Okay.  So this one, like, all 

of them, and my problem, is the challenge.  It's a parking 

and challenge -- the parking and the traffic.  And the 

problem I see -- none of them open.  So I feel like there's 

an unknown aspect to the parking aspect of this.   

          Like, I look at the report.  And the report 

suggested they come estimate the parking impact, they 

estimate the traffic.  There isn't actual data.   

          So the problem I have without any open facility to

go from, how would anyone estimate the impact of the 

community?  So I think they should go slowly, not approve 

more than -- wait to see the impact on the ones that have 

been approved, and then move forward from there.  To open 

them all up at one time without any data seems risky to me 

and the overall community.   

          The schools -- I'd say the same issue with the 

schools, I have a 7-year-old who goes to school around the 

corner.  There are a lot of these issues to be addressed.  

But I think the question is what are we doing here?  We 

don't know the impact, until we see some data -- something.  

          All the other data I've seen is that huge lines 

occur, massive traffic jams occur, huge numbers of people 

end up in the neighborhood buying pot, and basically that's 

a problem for the geographic areas surrounding these 

dispensaries -- at least until there's many, many more of 

them.  This is the issue, right?  Timing. 

          So anyway, I'm just hoping you can consider the 

timing aspect of all this in addition to the impact on the 

community.  Thanks, guys.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.

t-m-a-n, 8 Codman Circle.  Hello, everybody.  My name is 

Jonathan.  I work for a pharmaceutical company.  I moved out 

here for the job, and I know what Big Pharma is.  I 

understand, you know, the impact that Big Pharma has -- 

especially in Massachusetts.   

          But marijuana is not Big Pharma.  Marijuana is 

actually going to be able to help the community.  And these 

people are people that are from the community, that want to 

give back the community and be able to help out. 

          Now, I've heard the concerns of the people, but I 

understand that these people are willing to really deal with 

those concerns, hear the frustrations and be able to come up 

with solutions, be solution-based.  I believe -- and I do 

think that they're the ones that do it.  And I just want to 

say, "Go guys."   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Further 

comments from this side of the room?  Yeah?     

          MARK ROGERS:  Good evening.  My name is Mark 

Rogers.  I own 1010 Cambridge Street, which is just to the 

left of Redphare, Muqueca Restaurant, you might be familiar 

with, across from the Shell gas station.  I also reside at 

390 Cambridge Street.  I represent a fourth-generation

family that cares and really loves the staff.   

          From a practical standpoint, in a legalese 

standpoint, I suppose this group does fall within their -- 

the 300 yards is met, but practically, you know, what are we 

talking -- another 60 feet or so?   

          From the use itself, you know, I have friends that 

smoke.  I've been around it; I went to college.  I get it.  

It's -- I didn't vote for it.  Contrary to what one of the 

brokers said, it's not about the product, for me it's purely 

the law.   

          I can -- I appreciate the fact that they've met 

the 300-foot setback, and by special permit they're 

entitled, if you folks agree, to move into this location.  

It seems -- and I could be wrong -- that the parking could 

essentially be grandfathered, because it is one retail use 

taking over, moving onto another retail use.  So it's 

conforming, as I understand it. 

          But again, going back to the law in Section 10.43, 

this is going to create a hazard to the community from a 

traffic standpoint.   

          Have you heard in the news -- and it was on all 

the major channels here what was happening at the other

locations that opened up in the state -- it was a mess?  Is 

that really what we want in -- you know, in that area, where 

it's already congested?   

          When I was a little boy, the only time there was 

traffic on Cambridge Street was the Fourth of July, people 

going to Memorial and Storrow Drive.  Now it's every night.  

I respect the fact that this is a minority-owned, woman 

business, but so is my tenant.   

          Fatima Langa, who I'm speaking for, is currently 

in Brazil.  She's run that restaurant since 2008 and done a 

fine job.  The parking lot behind that restaurant is full 90 

percent of the time.  And when there was some more room -- 

there's three zip cars there now that take up those spaces. 

          So there's really not parking in that area.  And 

for those reasons, again, 10.43, Section B I ask you to 

refuse this permit.  Thank you for your time.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Okay. 

Yes?  The last one.   

          ABIGAIL ALLEN:  Abigail Allen, 962 Cambridge 

Street.  We're the building directly right next to them, and 

I own Thazar Hair Studio.  I just have a couple of concerns.  

So the first is obviously I feel that pot was voted legal in

Massachusetts.   

          I did not support that because of our children 

only.  I don't really care what adults do, but I felt that 

it was a bad thing for children.  And I know I'm right, but 

that's done, and what's done is done, and now we move 

forward. 

          So I own the business next door.  My concerns are 

traffic, any kind of -- obviously odors and stuff like that, 

and people there after hours during times when I'm close.  

So apparently, you're going to be closing at 9:00, which 

wouldn't have been a problem. 

          I'm very concerned about lines outside.  I'm 

concerned about the neighborhood being intimidated by this 

kind of thing going on.   

          I actually own another salon next door to a 

dispensary now, in Gardner, Massachusetts, and we have 

17,000 people in our population.  And they have a large 

parking lot in a -- you know, a commercial area, like, with 

all stores and shops and stuff like that.  They have their 

own stand-alone location with parking, and I do not notice a 

problem there.   

          But I will tell you that what we made them do when

they opened was, we made them do appointment-only.  And it's 

quiet.  We don't really have a lot of problems.  But all 

recreational is appointment-only.  So you have to go online 

and book your time.   

          Because I'm going to be honest, there's not a lot 

of parking downtown, and I don't want to give my parking up 

for my customers who have already been there to a bunch of 

people just filing through or standing in long, long, lines, 

which is just foolishness. 

          So if you're going to do this, if that's what's 

going to happen, then I just suggest that you force their 

hand, because they're going to blow smoke you know where all 

day long to tell you what they're going to do for you, but 

they're going to do the -- I just, they're very 

professional, we don't have any problems with the way that 

these are usually run.   

          But I will be honest, they're going to yes you to 

death right now.  So get them to yes you to appointment-

only.  And that's it.  Make the appointments.  That way we 

don't have the traffic flow issue, kids aren't walking by 

going, "What's going on over there, Mummy?"  "Oh, what's 

going on over there is there's a huge line of people who are

trying to buy pot." 

          And I will add that this actually helped the black 

market in our town, because they were overpriced, and their 

pot wasn't that great, and what I've been hearing is the 

people that I know who are kids of friends of mine -- my 

children's friends -- are telling me that they're making 

more money now dealing pot than they ever were, because 

they're able to sell it for less money than these stores. 

          That's the end of what I have to say.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep?   

          ALEX JUNDANIAN:  Hola, Thank you.  So I just 

wanted to say --   

your name and address?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sir, can you state 

          ALEX JUNDANIAN:  Oh, yes, my name is Alex 

Jundanian, J-u-n-d-a-n-i-a-n, 15 Trowbridge Street.  So I 

just wanted to take the time to say I actually myself work 

for a cannabis e-commerce company.  We work in 27 states 

across 1,200 different operators.  Especially in huge 

national markets like Illinois, we've been able to 

effectively beat those lines, so creating in-store kiosks, 

you know, certain thresholds, appointment-only, right?  Ways

we can expedite that and regulate it. 

          And we've done, I think, personally an incredible 

job. 

          I think at the end of the day, people are going to 

continue to go back and forth on this, on this issue 

especially.  But it's about being on the right side of the 

street.  And especially in, let's say the last couple 

months, right?  Sira, for example, they're pretty close to 

plenty of school, travel and districts.   

          And the fact that people haven't been able to 

access their medicine, not because of a -- you know, because 

of it being close to a school, but the fact that the City of 

Cambridge has gone between the -- like, not being able to 

decide whether it's going to be social, or the CCC not being 

able to decide whether it's going to be -- you know, social 

equity.   

          If it's only given to just minorities for 

delivery, is the City of Cambridge really -- I mean, I just 

think it's kind of an inopportune time to devoid -- you 

know, thousands and thousands of people from their medicine 

while they're constructing this issue, because we've spent a 

lot of time waiting.  And a lot of patients have been 

55

waiting for that. 

          But that being said, too, you know, I think yeah.  

There's going to be the issue of -- you know, overflow maybe 

to start.  But that's going to solve itself out.  People are 

going to work together.  The community is going to work 

together to solve this.   

          And that's what's really important.  I think 

saying that, like, "Oh, there's plenty of kids in a park 

that are smoking" you know, not having this dispensary is 

only going to allow the black market to grow in that park. 

          So at the end of the day, it's just about creating 

safe efficacy for patients and for the people of Cambridge.  

And I think we're all on the same side of history.  So let's 

work together and figure it out.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  All 

right.  Moving across here.  Yes, ma'am.

city's great middle schools, grade 6, 7 and 8.   

          And so, I got to see another year of walking to 

school.  Mostly she was alone, that was fine, but what I got 

to see was the parade of families, children starting at age 

3, now at King Open, which is in the same building as the 

Cambridge Street Upper School. 

          So we've got age 3 up to age about 13, 14, in 

those adjacent buildings, and then there's the library. 

          And what I really enjoyed, it was really fun, 

walking together.  Like, truly enough people walking to 

school it felt like I was in a mass of families.  I enjoyed 

it very much.  My daughter says, "Mom, if kids want pot, 

don't worry, it's so easy to get.  You shouldn't even be 

thinking about opposing this."   

          Well, what I oppose is -- so I'm a licensed mental 

health counselor, and I have worked a lot with drugs.  Very 

few of those people had trouble with marijuana.  I'm not 

saying there's something wrong with cannabis, it's our 

future.  I have clients who use it for pain and sleep, and 

they're quite good at monitoring themselves, and so are 

their doctors.   

          So I'm not against cannabis per se, but I am --

the research on its effects is very newly coming.  Until 

very recently, there was one university in the entire United 

States -- the University of Mississippi, I think I'm right 

on that -- that could conduct research on cannabis.  And 

that was during the Obama era.  That was still going on.   

          Some -- I wish I knew how, but it changed.  I'm 

sorry I don't have the law in my head.  But now there's more 

research.  There's Dr. Kevin Hill at McLane Hospital.  If 

you're a pot smoker, he's looking for subjects -- and he 

doesn't know I'm saying this -- I just think he's a smart 

researcher.  There's more research to begin to tell us what 

are the effects? 

          And so, we don't know yet the full effects of the 

different types, the hundreds of different strains being 

sold recreationally and medically.  And we're saying to our 

kids, "opening this shop -- "  

          My GPS confirms to me that it's a two-minute walk 

to King Open and Cambridge Street Upper School, so ages 3 to 

13.   

          And it's like -- to me it's kind of like saying, 

"Hey, kids, we, your parents, we the adults who run your 

community, we put this up here.  And, you know, here it is.  

We did this.  You're the kids.  So we think it's okay.  We 

think this is a great place." Thank you.        

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Yes,

ma'am.   

please?  

          FREHIWOT TESFAYE:  Freh, F-r-e-h-i-w-o-t.  Thank 

you for giving me this opportunity.  I am opposing this 

cannabis location because I live on Windsor Street.  I work 

9:00 to 5:00, I have two young children, ages 12 and 10.   

          And they have decided to walk to the library, 

which is, like, a five minute-walk beginning this summer, 

when the summer, when we get sun, finally.   But I'm 

nervous, and I'm not going to allow them to walk if this 

cannabis is open. 

          And we're talking about recreational marijuana and 

not medical marijuana.  And this has been putting me on bed 

up at night, or since I've heard it, I have been having 

nightmares.  I've never had nightmares in my life.  But now

I'm thinking of my little kids going to the store, or going 

to the library to pick up their books and getting that smell 

and coming back home.  What is the impact on them?  That is 

what is making me nervous.   

          When we purchased that property on Windsor Street, 

we walked through it.  We prayed (sic) on that street every 

day as I was dropping my kids at 3 years old, and 1.5.  And 

I've always looked at the that area, because it's a one-way 

street.  It is very neighborhood friendly.   

          We're not against my people.  I really love you.  

You are wonderful people; you are thinking of us the 

community.  But we are opposing the location.   

          Please find another location, which doesn't impact 

kids from going to their park enjoying the nice 

neighborhood.  The city just built a nice park, a nice 

library, a nice school.  When are we going to use it?   How 

are we going to let our children be grown up to walk by 

themselves?  Are we going to shield them from smelling it, 

from walking by it?   

          How is the traffic going to be impacting us to go 

to work, 9:00 to 5:00 workers?  How are we going to come 

back home to pick them up from after school, right across

the street from our building?  This is very concerning, and 

this is -- this shouldn't be approved.   

          Please consider our children, our community, our 

nice neighborhood.  Think about them and say no to this 

location.  Give them another permission in another location, 

where kids are not going to be impacted.  These children, we 

are decided on behalf of the children of tomorrow.  We're 

going to be leading and sitting on your benches and deciding 

about the future of Cambridge.   

          But right now, Cambridge has a lot of places where 

they can allow them to prosper and serve the community that 

needs recreational marijuana. So we're talking about 

recreational marijuana to emphasize.  Thank you for giving 

me time.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, ma'am. 

          MONICA EKE:  Good evening.  My name is Monica Eke.  

My last name is spelled E-k-e.  I live at 13 Lincoln Street.  

I want to say I'm here today to oppose, not because I'm 

against the business.  Business is business.  But I'm a 

mother of seven.  I have two girls who are in high school.  

So my kids are not small anymore, and they do walk by the 

place where you want to do the business.

          I want to highlight that the gentleman behind us 

stated some -- you know, it's manageable.  Marijuana has 

been here before all of us was born.  It's going to be here 

before -- when we leave.  I have no problem with that.  I 

can't do anything about that.  Our government is in it.  

Mafia was in it; everybody was doing it.  You know what I'm 

saying?   

          Even the Sherriff's Department, I mean security -- 

we have security -- the police is down the street on the 

street, when I have people who come and smoke marijuana that 

haven't got to their place yet.   

          But when they do walk back, they find various 

places to sit down on people's property, and I had to chase 

a group of guys off, because my daughter called me from the 

corner of below to ask me do I know that people are there? 

          Now, they didn't go to your dispensary.  They 

didn't go -- they probably got it off the streets.  It's 

easy to get off the streets, because everybody's hustling, 

you understand?  But I feel that we have to rethink through 

about what we want for the future of our families -- not 

just our children, but families. 

          And Cambridge -- I was not born and raised here, I

was born in Austin, Texas.  And I came here, and I've been 

here for 30 years.  And what brought me here is it kind of 

fit where I was from, Austin, Texas.   

          Not that we didn't have drugs or anything but, you 

know, where there's drugs, where there's recreational, 

people say they use for medication -- there are problems.  

And they don't have to be kids.  There are some adults who 

are reckless.  You know, I have some people who live in my 

building who are reckless. 

          For me personally, I don't like the smell.  I 

don't smoke, I don't drink.  I got a problem with alcohol.  

But, as people I find today, you have to be self-control -- 

and sometimes in this day today, there's not a lot of it.   

          Yes, I don't mind working together.  But what are 

we working towards?  You want to give jobs to people of 

color.  I'm a black woman.  I'm a black woman, I'm a 

businesswoman.  I have a day care.  But I want to give 

something to somebody where they're going to look to the 

future and say, "This is my career, this is what I do."  Not 

what the next person will do out on the street.  Because 

you're no different to me than a hustler.

          DOLORES COLEMAN:  Okay, thank you.  Hi.  My name 

is Dolores Coleman, C-o-l-e-m-a-n, and I live at 7 Lincoln 

Street.  It's right next -- right close to Windsor Street.  

It's close to the school and all the other facilities that 

everybody else talked before me, and the neighborhood is 

dead-set against it; not just our neighborhood, the 

surrounding neighborhoods.   

          I’ve lived in that area, for 75 years in that 

house, I grew up in East Cambridge.  It's a family-oriented 

neighborhood, we all get along.  And there's a lot of young 

children; well, teenagers and what not.   

          And having that there is a bad choice, a bad 

outlet for children.  That it's okay to go in and buy 

something, get high.  They say children don't get affected.

Well, as the parents smoke and the children are there, and 

that does damage to a child.  The child gets that smoke.  

Didn't smoke it, but they'll get it.  It's like, yeah, 

cigarette smoke's bad.  Why isn't that bad? 

          I would appreciate if someone consider the 

children.  And they say they want to control the school 

hours; they're going to be closed.  You can't control the 

school hours.  I see kids go at 8:00,8:30 and sometimes 

9:00.  Some get out at 3:30, some get out at 4:00. And some 

go to after school program, they go to -- there's always 

days they get out late.  And they walk by there. 

          I personally sit there on that bench in front of 

where they're going to go to wait for the bus for the 

seniors to go to the center.  It's a very uncomfortable 

thought that that's going to be a marijuana store.  Of all 

the things that we need, a marijuana store.  Please consider 

the neighbors and the children.  I appreciate it.  Thank you 

very much.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          OLLIE MOULTON:  Hi, I'm Ollie Moulton, M-o-u-l-t-

o-n, 7 Palermo Street.  My main concern is parking and 

congestion.  Our neighborhood is already so short on

parking, I think we have exactly the number of spots on our 

street for parking as houses.  I mean, I worry that if 

somebody else comes in, there will be no parking.  And I'm 

really concerned about where all these folks are going to 

park.   

          I think other people have articulated the lots are 

full, these lots are full.  I don't know if there's been any 

consideration, and I don't -- I apologize, I don't know 

about city law, but I don't know if there's been any 

consideration given to restricting areas to resident parking 

only.  I'm really concerned that we're just going to lose 

our very precious spots.   

          And I'm also concerned about the congestion 

generally.  I have lost count of the number of times I've 

crossed Windsor Street at that location, and almost been hit 

by cars going so fast down Windsor Street.  And so I don't 

know.   

          I just -- my main concern is I don't feel there's 

been enough consideration, and based on everything I've 

heard, there was a lot of good brought forth through the 

presentation, but I just didn't hear enough about how we're 

going to address lines, congestion, parking.

          I have heard good things about appointment-only, 

and would strongly urge the Council to consider that as a 

possible solution, in addition to limiting areas surrounding 

the property for resident-only parking.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  

          SASKIA JAMES:  Hello, my name is Saskia James.  I 

live at 251 Garden Street.  I've been a resident here for 

well over a decade.  I have a 16-year-old that attends 

Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.  I was one of the extreme 

few that worked tirelessly to get this historical measure 

past.  I now work at MRCC, the Massachusetts Recreational 

Consumer Council.  They are a non-profit that fights for 

consumer advocacy and education. 

          And I hate to say it, I really do with you guys, 

but I'm really disappointed but not surprised that not one 

of my neighbors have shown any concern about the lives that 

have actually been impacted by the War on Drugs.   

          Tonight I'm hearing tirelessly concerns about 

parking. And for such a liberal town, I'm so disappointed.  

I am almost in tears right now to know that my daughter will 

look at you guys as a safety net.  You are failing my child 

miserably.  The unrecognition of the damage of lives that

have been caused, and where we are at right now cannot be 

ignored. 

          So before you can pretend to show concern for the 

children's future, you have to show excessive concern for 

the now adults and families, whole communities of black and 

brown people who were devastated by the War on Drugs that 

was sanctioned through our city and aggressive police 

tactics to harm our black and brown neighbors.  People are 

still coming home.   

          The Cannabis Control Commission has released 

numbers, and as of last week, and currently the cannabis 

industry is looking just as Kendall Square.  66.3 percent 

identify as male, 73.8 percent identify as white.  So I have 

a lot of questions for you guys tonight. 

          I want to know what ties do you have to Cambridge.  

And I apologize if these have already been stated over and 

over again.  I'm getting wind that you guys are here now, 

and I'm here now.  I want to know what ties do you have to 

Cambridge?  What is your story?  How did you end up 

qualifying as a social equity applicant?   

          Because just because you're a social equity 

applicant doesn't mean that you are black and brown descent

people.   

          How much of your business do you own?  What's the 

percentage that your partners own?  Is Advesa -- and please 

apologize if I'm mispronouncing your business -- is it a 

local setup, or are you part of a larger chain?  I'm asking 

because we only have so much space and Cambridge is only six 

miles big.  And we need to ensure local people have a chance 

to get a license.   

          And unfortunately the people getting the 

dispensaries up and running right now are the people who 

have the money.  We already know the wealth gap in 

Massachusetts.  Black people have $8 to over $10,000 for 

white wealth.  So when you talk about disparity and 

inequity, this is severe and this is a problem. 

          This industry was built off the backs of black and 

brown people, and it is now for white people -- 

specifically, white and male.  The numbers are in, people. 

          We're also facing in the industry a black face 

through corporations.  They're getting their social equity 

person to be their face, but they have no intention of doing 

anything for the community.  I just attended the Worcester 

Business Journal Conference, the business of cannabis last 

week.  And on the entrepreneurship panel, they stated 

directly, "Our host community agreement is only for five 

years.  Afterwards, we don't have to worry about what the 

69

city wants." 

impact plan --  

insufficient.   

          So please believe how they're presenting 

themselves to you now is how they will be. The positive

          THE REPORTER:  Spell your name, please.         

          TERRY DRUCKER:  D-r-u-c-k-e-r.  And I just wanted 

to point out I guess one major -- well, I guess what I want 

to point out is the state law and the Cambridge ordinance 

requires these types of establishments to be in a business 

zone.  And this particular building is in a business zone.

It sits on one.   

          But if you look around -- I'm sorry the map isn't 

up, but I hope you will go by and look at the site.  Because 

say you're looking at the building.  If you look to the 

left, there are six condominiums.  If you go around the 

corner to the back of the property, there's a several six-

family buildings.   

          Then if you go, again, towards the left, you have 

the school, which is only one block away.  Then you go 

across the street.  You have Roosevelt Towers.  And then if 

you go to the left, just going around the circle, moving to 

the left from Roosevelt Towers, you have Webster, which was 

a -- you know, big commercial area back in the day.  More 

and more there's hundreds of condominiums now there.   

          And along, then you go down Windsor Street -- 

again, it's all residential. 

          So my point is, this is technically a business-

zoned property.  But it's really surrounded by residential, 

where you have a business district, where you have a school, 

you have public housing and so many, you know, triple-

deckers, six-family houses all around it. 

          So  -- and I guess just to agree with people that

have already -- what people have already said, it's going to 

-- and it has it's in your right, and I think you have a 

duty to turn it down, because it will have a detrimental 

effect on -- you could name all of them.  It's going to -- 

there's going to be double parking, transportation.   

          There's going to be a lack of -- you know, it's 

going to make parking worse.  There's people going to be 

loitering around, sitting on doorsteps.  Where are they 

going to go when they can't get in?  So it's -- and as 

people have said, children are going to see this.  It's 

going to raise questions.  I do think it's -- and I think 

that people will do a good job, they'll do the best they 

can.   

          But I really think it's a bad site for this type 

of thing, because it's basically a residential neighborhood.  

And the spirit of the law is that these things not be in 

residential neighborhoods, but they be in business 

districts.  This is not truly a business district when you 

look at everything that's around this. 

          I saw a look of skepticism there.  But if you look 

around, there's all residential all around it.  So thank you 

for listening.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.   

          DAVID DESOLA:  Good evening Madam Chair.  My name 

is David DeSola, spelled, D-e-s-o-l-a, 336 Windsor Street.  

I want to echo some of the concerns of my neighbors.  I'm a 

-- by the way architect.  What I really want to speak most 

about is incongruent use.   

          I think the city has done an exemplary job of 

putting up a library and a school.  Where the new King Open 

building sits, which is going to have a summertime pair of 

swimming pools, a library where we expect that the community 

will have many people engaging from all walks of life is a 

very dense neighborhood.   

          It's a family neighborhood.  I've lived there 

since 1996.  My next-door neighbors have three children.  We 

have a block party every year, which is populated by throngs 

of children.  We play games. 

          The city has done a great job of establishing 

where things should go and where they shouldn't go, and I 

hope that you use your good judgment and understand that 

this use that's being proposed at this location is not a 

congruent use for this neighborhood. 

          So I just wanted to quickly, strongly endorse my 

73

opposition to this application.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Okay?         

          JUDY SMALL:  Hi.  My name is Judy Small, S-m-a-l-

l.  Together with my husband Sheldon, we are the landlords

          THE REPORTER:  Your address?    

          JUDY SMALL:  14 Back Nine Drive in Haverhill.  

Together with my husband Sheldon, we are the landlords of 

966 Cambridge Street.  We successfully operated Harvard 

Glass for over 40 years.  King did not oppose -- King Open 

did not oppose our location, and recently on two separate 

occasions, the school committee also did not oppose our 

location. 

          It seems that all of the opposition is based on 

opinion and not facts.  Last year, we had the opportunity to 

meet with several Economic Empowerment applicants, and we're 

very fortunate to have met Advesa.  We would not take Advesa 

on as a tenant if we did not do our thorough research.   

          Jessica Pelletier and her Advesa team have 

displayed high competence, caring of people, lots of 

business experience and education in the cannabis industry.  

Sheldon and I are hopeful and excited for Advesa to be part

of the 966 Cambridge Street neighborhood, and we know that 

they will be good neighbors.  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Is there anyone that 

I missed?   

          NINA HARRIS:  Hello.  My name is Nina Harris, 24 

Peabody Terrace.  I'm new to Cambridge -- about two years 

there, and I am familiar with the applicants, and I'm in 

full support of their integrity, for the business and for 

their collaboration and cooperation with the community.  So 

I do understand some of the concerns that are being raised, 

and trust that they would handle them responsibly.   

          I think I just want to speak up tonight as a 

parent.  I do have a son, a child who attends Cambridge 

Longfellow, which is not directly in the distance, but 

within the neighborhood.   

          And just to speak as a parent, I'm really 

disappointed in the ways in which the customer and the 

potential clientele of this business has been referred to. 

          I am a parent who does use cannabis responsibly, 

and it's about pain management for me.  I think -- and I do 

think about my child, and I think about my child, who just 

yesterday, because I did not have access to what generally 

75

helps me manage pain, sucking down 3,200 mg of ibuprofen a 

day and imagine what that does to your body to live on 

30,000 mg of ibuprofen in a month and a couple of those tabs 

and have your child see you crippled in pain. 

          I believe in homeopathic medicine.  I do not trust 

the pharmaceutical industry and the long-term damage that it 

has.  But as a parent, it's also important for me to be able 

to have access that’s convenient, and do that in a 

responsible way.   

          So I trust parents to responsibly handle their 

children with the products, as other things are accessible, 

and I trust the city to handle their responsibility in 

keeping criminal legal activities such as smoking in parks 

and public places, and that be their responsibility. 

          So I just really am disappointed in disparagement 

of people who truly and genuinely need access to quality 

cannabis products.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Okay.  

Board members, are there questions for the applicant that we 

need clarified, or should we go to discussion?  Corinne?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  I have questions, but can we 

have a break first?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, good idea.  We 

have been at this a while.  We'll take a quick break and 

come right back and maybe give Board members a chance to ask 

some clarifying questions and further the discussion.     

          [BREAK]    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  If folks could 

take their seats, we're going to come back in discussion 

here.   Since this is our first of three public hearings 

tonight, we want to keep things moving.  All right.  As 

promised, Board members, now have had time to collect any 

thoughts.  Are there additional questions for the applicant 

or, for that matter, for staff, before we -- okay.  Corinne, 

do you want to kick it off?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Some questions for staff, as 

well as questions for the applicant.  So questions for staff 

are, if you can please help me understand how certain 

requirements would have teeth, so to speak.   

          So is it correct that if something is listed as a 

condition in the special permit, that it -- we have a method 

by which we can hold a business accountable to comply with 

something that they said they would do?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Sure.  So the Planning Board's

review has to do with the criteria that are listed in the 

zoning ordinance, mostly related to transportation impacts, 

access and egress and just the operation of the facility, as 

well as the design of the facility.   

          Those are kind of the two key aspects of the 

Board's review, and as with a lot the projects that the 

Board sees, the Board can impose conditions in order to 

ensure that those criteria in the -- that are required to 

grant the special permit are met.  So it's typical, and is  

the case in this application that Traffic and Parking has 

reviewed the application.   

          And they've made a set of recommendations that 

they feel would be appropriate to ensure that the impacts 

would be mitigated.  The Planning Board in granting a 

special permit can incorporate those as conditions, and then 

they become part of the ongoing review process.    

          So they get reviewed before they can -- before a 

building permit can be issued, to make sure that they 

continued to comply, and then when they get a certificate of 

occupancy. 

          I'll note just sort of outside of the purview of 

the Planning Board special permit, there are other elements

of approval that are required for a cannabis retailer, and 

that includes the state licensing process.  So there are 

requirements that need to be complied with, and then those 

are monitored, and there's an annual renewal process 

required for the state licensing. 

          Similarly, there is a local Cambridge cannabis 

permit, which has certain requirements that pertain more to 

the operation of the business and the status of the business 

as a -- whether it's in Economic Empowerment, social equity 

business, those are elements of the Cannabis Business 

Permit, and that's also subject to annual renewal. 

          And finally, there's a host community agreement, 

which under state law has to be negotiated with the city, 

and elements of that are still being worked on within the 

city, but it deals with things like community impacts and 

requiring fees to compensate for things that might be 

impactful to the community.   

          So aside from the zoning, there are several other 

areas where there are requirements and conditions that are 

monitored and enforced on an ongoing basis.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Can you 

tell me more about how the host community agreement, how

folks are held accountable to that?  That would be with the 

City Council?  And at what point would that sort of -- I 

understand the letter of commitment for certain building 

permits.  So is this something that would be negotiated at a 

future City Council meeting?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's something that is within the 

responsibility of the City Manager's office.  And it would 

need to be executed before a -- before the state license 

could be issued, and before the final certificate of 

occupancy.   

          So basically before the business would be able to 

open.  Those terms would all need to be established.  The 

host community agreement would need to be executed.  And 

again, it's all subject to ongoing monitoring by the -- 

mainly by the different departments that are responsible for 

it.   

          So I think just one example is the -- you know, 

the Traffic and Parking and Transportation has recommended 

as part of the routine set of recommendations for all of the 

cannabis retail applicants that there be kind of an 

operations plan established, and that that would be -- the 

details of which would be worked out with Traffic and 

80

Parking and could be monitored and adjusted over time, based 

on what the -- what the actual impacts are over time.   

          So there's basically -- would be a monitoring 

program.  And if, as I think was noted, if there is -- if 

there are issues that are observed with the operation of the 

business, then adjustments could be made to require that -- 

you know, for instance queuing be reduced, or other impacts 

be mitigated through operational means.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So it is correct that if the 

community found that queuing lines outside were too long, 

that they could talk to the City Manager's office and have  

-- and say that it doesn't meet the host community 

agreement, and that there would be some sort of 

accountability for that  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, I don't necessarily want to 

speak for the City Manager's office, and I wouldn't want to 

speak directly for Traffic and Parking, but I know that they 

would -- if there are complaints, then those departments 

would be in a position where they could respond to those 

continues.   

          And if it's -- you know, if it's something that’s 

in contradiction of the conditions of the special permit or 

81

the host community agreement or their business permit, then 

enforcement action could be taken.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And what would 

enforcement actually look like?  I'm just thinking of one of 

the community members, as James brought up the fact that 

certain posts certain host community agreements expire after 

a certain number of years. 

          So I'm just thinking for a community that's 

weighing, you know, how this will impact their community, 

what opportunities do they have to make sure that the 

promises that are made to them are kept?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Well, the special permit conditions 

don't expire, and the -- again, the cannabis permitting 

process is subject to a new renewal, as is the licensing 

process.   

          I think, you know, I'm getting a little bit 

outside of my depth, because I work primarily in zoning.  

But if you think about it as being analogous to, you know, a 

liquor license process, you know, if you know, you have to 

keep getting that annual renewal of a liquor license, if 

somewhere in between in renewals, you're -- you know, found 

to be in violation of something that's -- you know, that's

22

serious, that can put that license at risk.   

          So I think of that as being sort of a similar 

process.  In terms of the -- just the Planning Board's 

purview and the transportation conditions, those would be 

ongoing, and the way that that ordinarily works is that 

there's a -- you know, a plan will be established and it 

will be implemented.   

          And then, again, if there's -- issues are noted, 

or if there's complaints, then the Traffic and Parking could 

revisit and say, well, you know, "this needs to be --”  I 

think the issue of appointment-only came up.  If that's 

something that were laid out in the conditions of the 

special permit, it's something that could be reviewed to 

say, "well, is it --" you know, would it have to be, in 

order to avoid queuing issues, would it have to remain 

appointment-only, or, you know, at what point would it -- 

you know, would it be -- could an assessment be made then?  

It wouldn't have to be appointment-only in order to -- and 

it wouldn't create a queuing issue? 

          I guess I'm just trying to give an example.  It's 

sort of hard to give examples, because I think part of the 

process is to allow for some flexibility for things to be

assessed on an ongoing basis and not have to be -- not have 

to be so detailed in what the requirements are up front that 

it doesn't allow for any flexibility.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Is it possible to have a 

condition of the special permit talk about employment goals?  

Specifically, there were some, you know, very wonderful 

employment goals that were stated.  But is there any way to 

hold an applicant accountable to those?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That would be an issue not in the 

zoning, but in the cannabis business ordinance, or the 

Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance that was adopted by 

the City Council last year.  So that establishes some 

targets having to do with employment and just business 

practices or business operations.   

          And again, that is something that is subject to 

annual renewal.  I can't say off the top of my head what the 

actual requirements are, but there's a list of requirements 

that have to be met in that ordinance.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  And lastly -- I should know 

this, but I don't -- are there any limit on the number of 

recreational facilities in our zoning?  No, okay.  I have 

questions for the applicant.  I don't know if I should wait

until other people --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Go ahead.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  All right.  Questions for the 

applicant, as per the question from the community member, 

his ties do you have to Cambridge?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So although none of our 

members of our team currently live in Cambridge, we've all 

done a great deal of activism within the City of Cambridge 

and we have been very active in the cannabis recreational 

and medical community here, as well as a lot of social 

justice efforts.   

          So when we looked at the Boston Metro area, where 

do we feel that we fit in, and that will accept us and our 

hiring policies?  Which to answer your question too, we're 

held to that standard by the Cannabis Control Commission.  

And we cannot operate unless we abide to those hiring 

standards, of which you saw up there. 

          So yes, none of us live here currently, but we 

have all been very, very active on a political level and a 

social justice level for many years.  And I'm very sure that 

you know a couple members of our team.  So that is our ties 

to Cambridge.

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  And how would you 

answer community members that asked whether you are a chain 

or a local business?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  We are definitely a local 

business.  They are not a chain.  There's no other retail 

whatsoever.  We are all from this area.  We've been here for 

many years.  We've operated our business here for many 

years.  I have a lot of clients through my consulting 

company who are from Cambridge.  So --  

          I think it's also --       

          THE REPORTER:  Could you spell your name and give 

the address, please.   

          SHANEL LINDSAY:  My name is Shanel Lindsay, S-h-a-

n-e-l, L-i-n-d-s-a-y, and I live at 754 South Street in 

Boston -- Roslindale.  I think it's also important to note 

that we are -- it's important to note not only our ties to 

the Cambridge community, but also the equity and economic 

empowerment community.   

          We as a group have extensive experience in pushing 

for and walking the walk of Economic Empowerment.  Our team 

members and our partners and owners include folks whose 

parents have been incarcerated for cannabis crimes, so to

speak.   

          We also have through our own independent 

businesses, without any requirements at all, funded Economic 

Empowerment activities.  So for us, this is more than just a 

business, it is a way to lead by example when it comes to 

not only meeting but exceeding the state's requirements, 

when it comes to Economic Empowerment, but actually, 

continuing using our business to push forward policies that 

lead to an applicable cannabis industry.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you, my next --   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Can I just answer that, and add one 

more -- a couple more things?  Just want to let you know, 

Shanel Lindsay actually wrote the Economic Empowerment 

provision in the cannabis law.  So that's a very important 

component here.  And so, we have people who actually have 

done Economic Empowerment work in Oakland California, and in 

Jamaica.     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  And Massachusetts.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And in Massachusetts, that --    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  For many years.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- have done Economic Empowerment 

work, hiring the kind of people that the Economic

Empowerment provision in the law wants to be hired.  So --    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  And I think even outside the 

cannabis industry, when you look at our team members in 

their commitment to lifting up communities that have been 

harmed and impacted, and the work that we have done there.  

I think that also speaks volumes.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  I'm going through 

this kind of quickly, because I have a lot.  So one of my 

original concerns with the original application was that you 

had left out as abutters that you would consult the folks 

who are at Roosevelt Towers.  So I was glad to see that you 

added them.  Can you please summarize the -- how that was 

received at that community?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So our meeting at Roosevelt 

Towers was very well received.  We actually didn't have 

anybody come in opposition.  There is a lot of women over 

the age of 60 who are very excited that we are moving in 

across the street, because right now they're -- have to go 

to Brookline. 

          And this wasn't emphasized enough, but there is a 

need for recreational marijuana, because a lot of people are 

barred from getting their medical permit, because of a 

88

variety of reasons, from their employment to possible 

felonies there's a lot of issues. 

          So having access to recreational marijuana is not 

a personal recreational product, but it's also a wellness 

product.  So those individuals at Roosevelt Towers were very 

excited that we were going to be there so that they can get 

their CBD balms and they can get their capsules, and they 

can get their sublinguals. 

          And we will not be selling recreational products  

-- candy, anything that's attractive to children.  We sell 

wellness products.  So they're capsules, sublinguals, 

topicals, gels, oral solutions.  We even sold suppositories 

in the past.  So there's a variety of different products.            

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  And also, just to note, the 

response that we got at Roosevelt Towers was more of a plea 

for help --            

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Yep.     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  That people feel that they are 

still being stigmatized; people that live in public housing 

and subsidized housing feel that they don't have the right 

to actually use cannabis without fear of being kicked out of 

their premises, even when it is not smoking.  And so, I

think that those were the larger concerns that we heard 

about social acceptance of cannabis, rather than a concern 

about us coming.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  Thank you.  Those are all the 

questions right now.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Yep.  Niko?          

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Hey, thanks.  I just have two 

follow-up questions to things you just said.  So you 

described activism in Cambridge.  What were you referring 

to?    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So both Michael, Shanel and 

myself have done a lot of activism around medical marijuana 

and recreational marijuana and social equity and building it 

into the laws and legislation in Cambridge, as well as 

advocating for individuals who have been -- gotten in 

trouble for any sort of medical marijuana related offense.  

Michael himself has gone out from people's court dates and 

has drove people to and from their court dates for using 

marijuana in the City of Cambridge.   

          We've all helped a variety of elders in the area 

as well with their medical issues when medical marijuana was 

still in effect here, so yes. And Shanel as well can speak a

little bit more to that too.   

          SHANEL LINDSAY:  As you are aware, you know, 

Cambridge has exclusivity for Economic Empowerment 

applicants.  One of the big challenges there when we were 

originally pushing for equity, just to even be -- there be a 

kernel of equity language in the original question form. 

          From that point on, we've been pushing to try to 

expand equity.  And we've been successful at least on paper 

in the state in doing that. 

          One of the big challenges there is that there are 

big corporate interests pushing back against equity.  And 

one of the things that they from the very beginning tried to 

do was say that it was unconstitutional, and this would be 

illegal to have preferences for different people. 

          And so, back when the law first was being crafted, 

we found a non-profit equitable opportunity now.  And since 

2016, have that nonprofit has been working with the 

community, and also, Northeastern Law School to develop 

comprehensive reports.   

          The first one was actually in conjunction with 

another group that Jess, Michael and I were on the board of, 

and along with the unit of minority neighborhoods in Boston 

91

came up with the first report that supported the first round 

of equity provisions. 

          Then again in 2018 we got another report with 

Northeastern that was a constitutional analysis of whether 

or not equity provisions, especially exclusivity, could push 

forward.   

          And so, that was -- we shared that research with 

the City Council, and I know that that was a large part of 

being able to push forward.  So we not only act on the front 

lines, but also behind the scenes doing the important but 

grunt work that's involved with advocating for cannabis.          

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Thank you.  So I've appreciated 

your emphasis on, you know, your connection to equity 

empowerment communities.  I think it's really important that 

the people who have been most harmed by the War on Drugs are 

people who can benefit from the legalization of marijuana, 

and that the people who facilitated the War on Drugs are not 

the people who most benefit from new retail marijuana.   

          With that in mind, can you talk about the process 

for selecting a security provider?             

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So I can just speak a little 

bit to the process for that.  So we basically just looked at

the who is the best provider in this area, and Dave has 

obviously given his track record and how well he's done in 

Boston Police.  It was kind of a no-brainer.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Was it a no-brainer?             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  For us it was, yes.     

          SHANEL LINDSAY:  I think you're speaking kind of 

to the concern of, hey, we're bringing in the Police 

Commissioner to help. But, as you've seen here, despite the 

fact that we're in Economic Empowerment, there is huge 

opposition into cannabis coming into the community, and 

there is a concern that we don't have the juice needed in 

order to keep this safe.   

          And so, there's always a balance there between 

making sure that you are addressing a community's concerns, 

even if those concerns are unfounded, and making sure that 

you are meeting people where they are and giving them that 

comfort.  And I think that that was part of the decision 

here.   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Some of the people who have spoken 

today have asked for an appointment-only basis.  I believe 

one of the slide mentions that you're planning to go 

appointment-only for 30 days.  Have you considered going 

93

appointment-only for longer than 30 days?  Are you 

comfortable with going appointment-only for two months, a 

year, two years?  Is 30 days the maximum?       

          SHANEL LINDSAY:  I think we are open to discussing 

those issues.  But I would like to say first of all, I think 

that we spent an inordinate amount of time talking about an 

issue that is very, very unlikely to happen, which is lines 

or a number of people trying to get in the store that is 

more than they can fit in the vestibule. 

          I understand that NETA, right has been open in 

Brookline, and you just seen massive lines there.  And 

that's what people have in their mind about what's 

happening. 

          Unfortunately, NETA was a result of a monopoly 

that was put in place for medical, and now in retail.  And 

by the time that this facility would be open, you will have 

a number of facilities open.  As you know, we are the eighth 

even in line in Cambridge.   

          And so, I think that we spent a lot of time 

worried and concerned about a situation that is very, very 

unlikely to happen, and I don't think that it will even be 

necessary to be appointment-only for the first 30 days, but 

94

obviously we will do that. 

          And I think that you've heard over and over again 

our commitment to taking any matter necessary to make sure 

that there isn't an impact on the community when it comes to 

any of the issues that we talked about tonight.  So the 

answer to your question is, "certainly, we'd be willing to 

consider more than 30 days."             

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Those are my questions.  I mean --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So are we trying to bring up issues 

now or just questions?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Just questions now.           

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I will pass.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  You'll defer?  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, so I was looking through 

materials again.  And one of my questions was whether you 

had agreed to all of the conditions recommended by Traffic 

and Parking.   

          I see you say you have agreed to them all.  The 

other question is will you be providing medical marijuana

services, and if not, what sort of information will you be 

providing to medical marijuana patients?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So just to speak real quick, I 

am a medical patient myself.  I've had nine tumors, and I've 

had to have surgeries to mitigate all of those tumors.  So 

I'm a huge proponent of medical marijuana.  Right now, this 

is a recreational facility.  If they give us an option to 

have both medical and recreational under the same roof, we 

would love to go that route.   

          But in response to your question, we plan on 

offering material about medical marijuana and the wellness 

benefits of medical marijuana in our store.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Can I follow-up?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  That's fine.                    

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So that hits on the actual 

requirement in the special permit process of if you do not 

provide a medical marijuana treatment center, you have to 

provide programs to assist qualifying patients within the 

city.  So are the programs leaflets?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  No, we can't -- I don't 

believe that we can even have leaflets at this point, but 

we'll be --

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  What are the programs?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Could you speak into the 

microphone?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  I don't believe that we can 

have leaflets at this point.  There are very strict -- I 

would defer this to Michael.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sorry, my question was not, 

"please provide leaflets."  It's just, "What are the 

programs, so that you satisfy these criteria in the special 

permit?"   

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So if somebody is seeking 

medical marijuana, we will point them in the right direction 

of a medical marijuana facility.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Questions on 

this side?  No?  No?     

          SHANEL LINDSAY:  Sorry, if I could --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          SHANEL LINDSAY:  -- respond.  Know that we would 

love to provide medical marijuana.  The way that the law 

sits right now, and as you may be aware, medical marijuana 

facilities need to be vertically integrated, which means 

that you have to cultivate and process and sell.   

97

16

18

19

20

21

22

          We are actually in the process of pushing to 

remove that vertical integration requirement, which would 

allow us to move forward.   

          There are very strict regulations about making 

sure we're not calling ourselves a medical marijuana 

facility, but know that we are all -- we all use cannabis 

for medical and wellness purposes.   

          Know that the type of products that are the most 

popular on the market are actually those wellness-focused 

products, rather than the products that are considered 

purely recreational. 

          So our facility will have a very strong wellness 

tilt to it, in addition to satisfying the requirements of 

actually letting people know if they are coming in and want 

to be treated as medical patients, if there are facilities 

available that they can -- they prefer that.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah, sorry.  This is just like a 

question that's a statutory interpretation, but so one of 

the requirements that we have to find exists is that you 

will provide programs to assist qualifying patients within 

the city who are registered through the medical marijuana 

program in obtaining services under that program.

          And so, are the programs that you were talking 

about just, like, saying there's a medical marijuana 

facility down the street, or, like, what are the programs?     

          SHANEL LINDSAY:  Michael is the registered Patient 

Advisor to the Commission, so he can actually answer that 

question.   

          MICHAEL LATULIPPE:  Yeah, so hi.  I'm Michael 

Latulippe.  I'll spell that for you -- L-a-t-u-l-i-p-p-e.  

Hi, I'm actually the registered patient advisory commission.  

one thing that we want to make clear is that we do not 

really want adult-use facilities necessarily saying that 

they are medical marijuana facilities.   

          So I think to comply with regulation, something in 

terms of a leaflet like you're describing or something that 

we could essentially give to the patient to let them know 

where the nearest medical marijuana treatment center would 

be I think what the Commission would want, as opposed to us 

providing something to patients that are other than what we 

are already providing them -- you know, or what we're 

already providing other customers.  Thank you.     

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  If I could just find out what 

provision you're talking to.  I'm not sure you're talking

about recreational marijuana as opposed to medical 

marijuana.                

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So talking about Section 11.085 of 

the zoning ordinance.     

Cambridge?                

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  Of this zoning ordinance in 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Yeah.  So in granting a special 

permit for a cannabis retail store, which I believe you are 

--    

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  Yep.                   

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  -- Section E is the proposed 

cannabis retail store is not proposed to include a medical 

marijuana treatment center, which I believe you're not --    

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  Right.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  It will nevertheless provide 

programs to assist qualifying patients within the city or 

neighborhood who are registered through the Massachusetts 

Medical Use of Marijuana Program in obtaining services under 

that program.     

          GERRY MCDONOUGH:  So I think that the best that 

we're allowed to do is to refer people to medical marijuana 

facilities.  I'm not sure what other capacity we have.  I

will certainly look into that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou, did I see 

you had questions?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  For the -- I guess the group 

-- where did you get experience in the actual selling of 

marijuana products?     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So we do have -- Shanel has 

ancillary retail experience in her Ardent product.   

          Myself and Tony Verzura, we both have a degree of 

retail experience.  Tony has over $30 million dollars in 

retail sales that he had done in Colorado working for 

another company. 

          Myself, I was involved in an incubation program in 

Oakland for women for a retail-only delivery in which I 

started the company.  And we incubated the company, we 

passed it off to another woman and Economic Empowerment 

business. 

          So I do have a degree of doing that for a couple 

of different years, and Tony Verzura also has retail 

experience through Shanel in ancillary marijuana products.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Thank you.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

101

Thank you for answering all of our various questions.  So I 

am looking at the time, and just want to confirm with the 

Board do we want to go to deliberation and discussion now, 

or do we need additional information from anyone before we 

do that?  What is the pleasure of the Board?  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I would certainly like to bring up 

several items.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  But I couldn't -- I'm not a 

Jeopardy player, so I couldn't phrase them as questions.     

          COLLECTIVE:  [Laughter]  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay, fair enough.  

All right.  So it sounds like we want to have some 

discussion now, and then see where we are.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  All right.  

Hugh, why don't you kick us off, since you didn't phrase 

them as questions?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Okay.  So one of the general 

concerns actually doesn't involve our action, but we have 

permitted several medical facilities, which the city has 

closed, because of changes of ownership.  And I don't know

the facts, other than if you go to the door know, you can't 

get inside, even if you've got a card, because it's closed.  

          And so I tried to look and understand how your 

organization worked from your submission, and who the 

players were.  There was a certain amount of conflicting 

information in terms of percentage ownership, but it seems 

like they're your people who are sitting here, who are 

collectively represented as having majority ownership of 

this venture in Cambridge.  I think that's correct.   

          You're associated with -- and somehow with the 

business that started in Oakland, and then you may not have 

some ownership, and you're getting -- you have some kind of 

arrangement with a large grower and retail operator in 

Florida, who apparently is providing you with capital.   

          I understand that one of the problems that caused 

one of the places to get closed was that their source of 

capital changed. 

          So this is not actually an issue before us, except 

that apparently, it's a messy, gray area for the city, and 

if it's messy and gray, the same thing might happen to you, 

if we grant this permit.  I'm really, really upset the two 

facilities that we permitted, that were seeing patients,

providing services and products, are now closed because of 

the complexity of the law and the interpretation.   

          So I don't want an answer now, I just want you to 

put that on your agenda to talk to the various entities in 

the city and make sure that this doesn't happen to you, and 

to clarify in the documents that we would be representing 

should we vote for this, exactly what the situation is and 

making them understand what changes in financing and 

financial partners and other things the city will or will 

not accept.  

          So that's the -- let's say I don't wish to have 

answers to this comment now.  So --    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  I would like to clarify, if 

you would allow me the time --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So right now we're 

having Board discussion.  We may come back to you later.  

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I wanted to be clear when the

decision --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  It doesn't affect the decision, 

because it's now on the criteria?

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So we actually -- the way the 

Councillor wrote the ordinance, we have relatively few 

things we actually have to find to grant the permit.  The 

Council I think as a result of the referendum decided that 

this was a valuable business to serve the citizens of the 

city and should exist.   

          But one of those things -- and, well this is easy 

to check off virtually everything on the list.  Yes, you're 

in a building.  Yes, the zoning district you're sitting in 

is in the Business District, et cetera, et cetera.   

          One of the criteria is that the site design 

provides convenient, safe and secure access and egress for 

clients and employees arriving to and leaving, using all 

modes of transportation, including drivers, pedestrians, 

bicyclists, and public transportation users, as we've 

learned also -- people who use Uber and Lyft and other ride 

sharing services. 

          So you've provided us with traffic and 

transportation study about parking, and response of our 

traffic and Transportation Department was, "Parking will 

likely be a challenge for this product at this location."  

105

So I dug into this.  So I'm trying to understand what the 

problem was when it happened.   

          So page 9 of the parking study provided was a 

chart that shows parking on Wednesday, July 12, 2019, at 

five different times of day, and at four different places 

where there was parking that your clients might be able to 

utilize. 

          And then there's another chart on page 10 that 

does it on Saturday June 8 three times.  And these -- so 

here's the problem.  The first problem is in the 7:00 p.m. 

in the evening line on Cambridge Street, it says the 

regulation is a two-hour meter.   

          Now, the meters stop being effective at 6:00 p.m. 

So -- and this is very significant, because look what 

happens.  Suddenly, at 7:00 p.m. -- between 5:00 p.m. and 

7:00 p.m., the spaces are very heavily utilized.  What's 

going on?  

          Well, at first, I thought, "Maybe there are a 

bunch of restaurants there,” because I live farther down 

Cambridge Street where there are a lot of restaurants.  But 

there aren't a lot of restaurants in that stretch between 

Columbia and the school.  It's got to be resident parking.  

106

It's got to be people who are living in the dense, 

residential neighborhood that was built before there were 

parking garages and places.   

          You're parking in the street just as I park my car 

on the street driving there.  Because my house doesn't -- 

isn't on the street even. 

          So what it seems is that you've got a big parking 

problem after those spaces on Cambridge Street suddenly are 

available for residents to park after they come home from 

work.  And on Saturday, there are only four spaces out of 

like 70 spaces. 

          Another thing that's very curious is if you look 

at the Windsor Street municipal lot, on Saturday night it's 

almost full. On a Wednesday night, it wasn't.  Well, these 

are just like brief snapshots.  Which ones -- what's it like 

ordinarily?  I mean, I rode my bicycle down there today, and 

-- it was about 3:00 p.m., and that's indeed pretty much 

like what I saw. 

          So my conclusion is that you probably shouldn't be 

open after 6:00 p.m., because there isn't parking to serve 

people who drive there in the evening.  And I believe, based 

on logic -- purely logic alone -- that people are going to

be more inclined to drive to -- in the evening.  One reason 

is bus service is not very good.   

          Another reason, it's dark much of the year, and 

people's questions of personal security changes in darkness.  

And the third is, you know, they might actually have a car 

if they're using parking and you go after work. 

          I suspect on your scale of four to ten cars, 

you're going to need more cars in the evening, because I 

understand that, you know, you're -- I mean, you took that 

extra hour, put on the end when you took off the one in 

front.  Did you expect you were going to have significant 

business in the evening?   

          Indeed, my husband, who buys medical marijuana, 

does use the car in the evening, sometimes, because that's 

when it's available. 

          So I think this -- I think you can't make the 

finding you need to make about adequate parking, based on 

the data that's given us.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And part of that is because this 

data is really very sketchy.  It's like -- I went out there 

eight times.  And five of those times, it was at times when

the school wasn't in operation.  Now, schools do not operate 

as much over the summer.   

          I'm not quite sure what program is going to be at 

that school, but there needs to be a good deal of finer 

grain, because you've got some places where there isn't -- 

there aren't available spaces, and you're not providing any, 

and you're going to need them. 

          So is that a question?  Yeah.  Or is that a 

polemical statement?  I mean, I thought we could say, "Well, 

we'll give you a permit, but you've got to close at 6:00 

based on the data we have."  I don't think you'd like that.  

But it might be what's necessary. 

          The other questions in my mind is the finding in 

1043 we have to make, "That the continued operation of or 

development of adjacent uses, as permitted in the ordinance, 

would be adversely affected by the nature of the proposed 

use."  

          And the adjacent uses that have been brought up 

here are people who are worried about their children walking 

down Cambridge Street in front of this facility. 

          And they describe, some of them, how they're going 

to adapt to this -- you know, not let your kids go to the 

109

library, et cetera.  I think that would be an adverse impact 

on adjacent uses.  Whether that rises to us making this 

finding that this shouldn't be here, I don't know.  But put 

it on the table.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Do you want to?            

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Sure.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.                 

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  I appreciated the presentation.  I 

also appreciated hearing from all of my neighbors in 

Cambridge.  I have a daughter.  She is right now home with 

Grandma, and I appreciate everyone's desire to protect their 

children.  Hopefully when she's older she will go to 

kindergarten in King Open or one of the other public schools 

in Cambridge, I'm looking forward to that.   

          I'm a frequent pedestrian, I don't like 

congestion.  I don't like not being able to find parking 

spaces in Cambridge.  That's really annoying.  And I also 

care about -- you know, facilitating operations for the War 

on Drugs.  I think that the Economic Empowerment program is 

really good.  I'm happy that Cambridge passed this 

ordinance. 

          So this is now what, the eighth applicant I've

seen?  So I mean it's sort of funny, because on one hand I 

can really appreciate the feeling that other neighborhoods 

would be better for dispensaries than this particular 

neighborhood, and this is the eighth one.  We've now heard 

this eight times.   

          You know, every single one of these dispensaries 

has been opposed by people in the neighborhood -- some 

people in the neighborhood, not everybody, but on the ground 

that other parts of Cambridge would be better. 

          I believe in democracy.  I believe that after 

people in Massachusetts voted for Question 4, what we were 

voting for was the creation of dispensaries, and this is, 

you know, the consequence of the law.    

          So looking at the legal requirements that the 

Planning Board is required to look at, is this within 300 

feet of a school?  No.  Is it within 400 feet of a school?  

Looks like it, but that’s not what we're supposed to 

evaluate.   

          So I can appreciate that this is close, and I 

empathize with, you know, families who don't want their kids 

walking by a dispensary.  But that is not a factor.  I 

disagree with my colleague that whether people walk up and 

111

down the street with the dispensary constitutes an adverse 

effect on neighbors. 

          I think the existence of the 300-foot threshold -- 

and the 300-foot threshold in the law is not if a dispensary 

is within 300 feet it cannot exist.  It's if the dispensary 

is within 300 feet of a school, then we have to make a 

finding about that.   

          So I interpret that provision of the ordinance 

that Cambridge passed as 300 feet is what we think is an 

acceptable distance from a school.  This is more than 300 

feet away.  And so, based on the ordinance, I feel like that 

this is totally fine. 

          The other factors, "Is there going to be safe 

access and egress?"  I think so.  "Is there going to be 

secure loading?"  I think so.  "Is the design compatible 

with the environment around it?" I think so.  "Is there 

going to be an unwelcoming façade?"  I don't think so.   

          "Is it going to provide programs to facilitate 

people using medical marijuana?"  That seems up in the air, 

but I'll know -- I don't know what that means. I don't know 

how to interpret that, to be honest. 

          I think telling people that there is a medical

marijuana facility nearby -- I don't know that I would call 

that a program in the abstract, but I don't know what other 

programs the ordinance is expecting.   

          So that's -- and then for the special permit 

criteria, is this going to contribute to traffic congestion?  

Yes, I think it will, but I don't think it will more than 

any of the other dispensaries that we have permitted or -- 

you know, most of the other retail stores that we've 

permitted. 

          Congestion is brought up any time anything opens, 

because congestion is a problem in Cambridge.  Will this 

particular use contribute to congestion more than any other 

retail use?  I don't think so.   

          I think that the Brookline example is on 

everyone's mind because of the lines that were on the news.  

And that was -- you know, that -- I really doubt that in 

2021 when this opens, along with seven other dispensaries 

that we're going to see lines around the block.  I just 

don't think the demand for marijuana is that high.  And it's 

not just Cambridge, it's, like, every city in eastern 

Massachusetts is doing the same thing.   

          And so, when all of these dispensaries open, I'm 

113

not, I do not predict --  and I'm happy to be proven wrong, 

but -- I don't predict that you're going to see Brookline-

style lines out the door of any of the places that we have 

opened.  If anything, it looks like there's going to be a 

glut of dispensaries. 

          And, you know, will this create a nuisance?  I 

don't think so.  I mean, I understand that -- again, I 

really empathize with people who don't want dispensaries 

near where they live or near where their children go to 

school or near where they own parking lots.   

          The problem, though, is not therefore we should 

prevent this particular dispensary from opening, the problem 

is, "Well, that's a good argument against voting for 

Question 4, Question 4(1).”   

          And I do not feel like it would be consistent with 

my faith in democracy for us to stand in the way of this 

dispensary opening because people object to the existence of 

the dispensary near them. 

          I hope when my daughter is old enough, that she 

will go to a school like the King Open.  When she walks 

there or takes the bus there or we drive her there, we will 

pass by liquor stores on Cambridge Street.  I brought this

up in past dispensary permits, but looking through the 

records 100 years ago, when Cambridge licensed liquor stores 

and people came to Planning Board Special Permit and 

protested liquor stores because of the effect it would have 

on children, it's hard not to see the parallel between 

people now saying they don't want their kids walking by a 

dispensary.   

          You know, I personally feel great about my 

daughter walking by a liquor store.  I'm not too worried 

about it.  I mean, she can barely walk, but I at this point 

do not think that there is a threat that we live near a 

liquor store, she's going to be, you know, somehow through 

osmosis, intoxicated. 

          And so, this to me seems like a pretty easy call.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?   

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, Niko very eloquently 

summarized all my questions and concerns and attitudes 

towards this, and it's not just liquor stores, it's bars.  

My kids walk by bars on their way to Boston subway and 

schools all the time and walk by drugstores that sold all 

sorts of things inside.   

          And I think, you know, families will establish

their own patterns and their owns rights and wrongs and what 

kids can do and can't do, and how they should go, and I 

think that, you know, we live in a city and there are things 

in a city that, you know, some of us like, some of us don't 

like, and we all live with it. 

          And I certainly agree that I think there will be a 

glut of marijuana facilities in Cambridge if they all open 

up, and there will similarly be ones in Somerville and in 

Boston.  And I do not believe the Brookline situation is 

going to exist in coming years. 

          I'm not taking any position on it.  You know, if 

we were serious about it and discussed it -- but my 

understanding is that Brookline town meeting recently voted 

down a proposal to make marijuana facilities by appointment-

only, on the basis that it involved -- it interfered with a 

customer's right of privacy; that right now you can 

apparently just walk in and show your Massachusetts ID and 

not answer any questions who you are, or where you go or 

what you do, whereas with appointments you're giving a name, 

and it may become a record that someone can find somewhere. 

           I know we have imposed it, or actually other 

applicants have suggested that they would be appointment-

only on various times and places, and if we were going to 

impose that, I think it might be something worth discussing. 

          No, I think the traffic and parking issues -- if 

it were a CVS, if it really a very popular restaurant -- and 

Hugh there are some restaurants in the area, certainly not 

the aggregation that there are in Inman Square, and I know 

you live there, but have you tried to find a parking spot in 

Inman Square to go to a restaurant on an evening -- a 

weekday evening, or on a weekend evening?  It's well-nigh 

impossible.   

          So whatever goes into this facility -- I mean, 

Harvard Glass may have been one of those facilities that did 

not attract an enormous number of people at the time, but I 

think anything else that went in here probably would attract 

a lot of pedestrian, bike and motor vehicle traffic.  So -- 

yeah, I agree, but I think most of the criteria have been 

complied with.             

          CORINNE ESPINOZA:  So I concur with Niko and with 

Ted, but I do want to raise some of my previous concerns and 

address them, and raise some concerns I have myself.  So I 

want to first thank the public for taking the time to come 

and to participate in this public hearing.  I value your

time, thank you. 

          For the people who spoke out against recreational 

use, tonight our job isn't to debate whether or not adult 

recreational use is good or bad.   

          We care very much about what the community thinks, 

and we all have an impact on making laws, so if we think we 

shouldn't have adult recreational use in Cambridge, there 

are ways that we can try to adjust zoning or try to change 

the law, but that's not what we're allowed to consider

          What we're allowed to consider is whether or not 

this complies with the zoning requirements for issuing a 

          For members of the public who said that they 

thought -- and my colleague Hugh, as well -- that the 

traffic study severely undercounted, I completely agree, but 

the TP&T report already said there wasn't enough parking, 

and so, assigned a plan that requires certain things of the 

applicant, so the applicant is required to give $35,000 to 

the city to help make this better.   

          They're required to provide free MBTA passes to 

their employees; they're required to do certain things

because of this report found that there's not enough 

parking. 

          So even if it was not undercounted, they would -- 

they're being held already to the highest standard that they 

can be held to, as far as that goes.  So if it were a more 

appropriate account taken and a more appropriate time, that 

would be the result. 

          For community members who are very upset about it 

being so close to a school, I want to first say that I have 

a stake in this as well.  Part of my family lives in RVT.   

          My grandbaby may go to school down the street.  

This is the current zoning right now, though.  So right now 

the zoning says that as long as you're 300 feet away from a 

school, park or other public facility, that that is allowed.  

          And one of the reasons is when the zoning was 

written, we were shown a map of all of the wonderful 

amenities we have in Cambridge, and when you draw a circle 

around all of the schools in Cambridge, when the original 

proposal of 500 feet was drawn, there were basically 0 

places in Cambridge that you could put a facility like this, 

because we had so many parks and schools in Cambridge.  So 

there was almost nowhere where a cannabis facility could go,

and we are required to figure out how this works in our 

city. 

          So again, if folks disagree with that proximity 

rule, they should request to change the zoning, and people 

in the Cambridge Community Development Department can help 

people learn about how to change zoning laws. 

          I also hear people saying that there are too many 

cannabis retailers approved.  But again, that’s not what 

we're decided about tonight.  So that's not something that 

we're allowed to make a decision about tonight. 

          So as far as my concerns, and the things that I 

love about this: I love the plans for employment, they're 

very aligned with the goals of repairing and restoring 

communities that were disproportionately harmed by the War 

on Drugs, and I thank you for that. 

          I encourage applicants to consider the choice of 

security vendor.  I completely respect that you have a 

balance of addressing community concerns, but I also think 

the community, when they think about who has provided safety 

and justice to black and brown communities in Cambridge and 

Boston, I think Boston Police Department might not be on the 

list.

          Perhaps one thing, since it's been a vendor that's 

been vetted by professionals such as yourselves, perhaps one 

thing you might think about is how to do iterative design 

with community input, right?  Could you survey the 

community, "Do you like our security?  How's your security 

working out?  Can things be going better?"  

          Perhaps this will be a fantastic security plan, 

but perhaps it makes people feel uncomfortable or targeted.  

So it will be good to get iterative design feedback from 

communities to see how they're experiencing that style of 

plan. 

          I do also want to mention that I'm concerned what 

that line is.  So there was a video tie-in to CPD.  I'm 

curious about whether that means that video law-abiding 

customers and employees of your store will be sent to 

Cambridge Police Department, and I'm not asking you to 

answer that question. 

          I'm just asking you to think about addressing that 

concern before you talk to City Council how the Cambridge 

Police Department store that data, how will they use that 

data, are they -- are you proposing to surveil people on the 

street and send that video to Cambridge Police Department?

I think that's something that Council would be interested to 

know. 

          Other comments that I have are that I encourage 

you to please think really strongly about traffic in the 

area.  I understand that we will have less demand than some 

people have been concerned about because there will be other 

retailers open, but that really is a horrible corridor.   

          Trying to drive on it is horrible, trying to walk 

on it is horrible, and I know you want your customers to be 

safe and the community not to be harmed by your presence 

there.  So I think there really needs to be a lot of work 

thinking about traffic control. 

          Other people who have received a special permit 

from us have had great ideas about language on websites, 

language when people are making appointments to let people 

know where it's good to arrive, where it's not good to 

arrive, working with Uber to make sure that people aren't 

double parking in front of the bus stop for example.  So 

there are lots of examples of solutions people have offered 

that you might consider.   

          I'm also glad that you learned and presented 

tonight that you don't need frosted glass on the façade.

But I would also encourage you to look at other people who 

have received a permit about how their façade looked more 

interesting.  They did art, bamboo, different solutions to 

make it a really pleasant part of the community that also 

aligned with the urban design in the area. 

          I encourage you to think about the interaction 

between the bus stop and your customers, because whenever 

people are waiting for the bus, there's already a huge sort 

of chunk of people on the sidewalk.  It's already hard to 

get around people. 

          I encourage you to think whether space for two 

bikes is enough for all your employees.  I encourage you to 

think about the loading bay on Windsor Street and encourage 

you to consider restricting your hours of deliveries.  

Because, again, that street is horrible. 

          I also encourage you to think about entry and 

exit.  I'm not sure why people are going out the front 

instead of the back, but defer to the professionals on that. 

          I also appreciate where you're trying to go with 

the coupon idea, but in our neighborhood, over there, $5 

does not buy anything.  And so, I also encourage you to 

think about ways to continually look at that as you

implement it to see ways that, you know, isn't working, that 

people are staying off the street and not queuing on the 

street.   

          So again, I concur with Ted and Niko that this 

complies with the special permit requirements.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Lou?   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I actually started out with 

a fairly long list, but I've reduced it to more of 

congestion, both traffic -- this is going to create a lot of 

traffic -- and pedestrian congestion.  To your point 

exactly, you have a bus stop in front of your proposed 

establishment.  If you have any queuing at all, 

intermingling of high school kids mostly, with the 

clientele, it will be a problem. 

          The neighbors and abutters, I think you will 

create some nuisance at first for their parking lots and so 

forth.  I don't know what the answer to that is.  I don't 

know how you can work with them to make this go away, but I 

believe that will be a definite problem. 

          I think you should extend the appointment-only, if 

that were -- you were to get this permit.  And I have 

nothing against the business itself, just it's kind of a bad 

124

location for this business.   

          It took me five minutes to get across the 

intersection this afternoon coming here.  I live on Willow 

Street.  I really wish the outreach had gone a little 

further.    

          I know you did what you were required to.  I never 

got my notice.  I didn't find it until I got the packet, I 

live a street away.   I know lots of my neighbors have no 

idea this is happening.  So, like I said, that's my concern.  

It's more the congestion, and if we can't seem to make those 

findings, this will be a definite nuisance.  So unless there 

are some changes in it, I can't see going forward with it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Steve?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I guess I'm sympathetic with 

some of the concerns raised by neighbors, and I too question 

the wisdom of the law in general.  But that train has left 

the station, and our job now is not to decide whether we 

support or oppose such establishments, but rather just 

looking at the physical and operational elements of the 

operation. 

          So there's also the question of the applicant.  

You know, I find the applicant to be very impressive.  And 

125

22

if we were voting on personality and sincerity and so forth, 

that would be an easy vote.  But the truth is, that 

ownership of such establishments, and any establishment, can 

change over time.   

          And we should never make decisions at the Planning 

Board not on marijuana dispensaries or any other applicant 

based on their character or impressiveness of the individual 

applicants, because that can change.  So we have to make our 

decisions strictly on the facts and physical qualities of 

the project being proposed. 

          And along those lines, if there are elements that 

we hear from the appealing applicant that we think is 

important to our decision, we shouldn't just say, "Well, 

great, this is a great applicant, they're going to do that." 

We have to build those things into the decision as 

conditions, so we know that not only will this applicant 

live up to those representations, but that if ownership 

changes over time, as frequently happens, that the next 

owner will also be bound to comply with those conditions. 

          So getting to the substance, then, of this:  From 

my perspective, the one and only issue here is parking.  And 

we've heard several people talk about the parking.   

126

          Now, there are many ways that that can be 

addressed, you know, because there are so many dispensaries, 

I would imagine that the people that come to a particular 

dispensary would tend to be people that live close to that 

dispensary.  They're not going to be coming from other towns 

or other sections of Cambridge, because there are closer 

dispensaries for them in other neighborhoods of Cambridge. 

          So I frankly would imagine that most of the folks 

coming to this dispensary are probably neighborhood people 

who might walk or might be able to take the bus down 

Cambridge street, or if they're a little further, they could 

take an Uber. 

          Now yes, they may drive.  So what would be the 

impact if they're driving?  Well, frankly if they drive, 

they're going to come over here, they're going to have a 

really hard time parking.  They might not be able to park       

at all, and in very short order, they're going to go to 

another dispensary, where they don't have so much difficulty 

parking. 

          And so, while I am concerned that there really 

isn't adequate parking in the ideal, I think in practice it 

may not be such a problem.  I mean, because if it is a

problem, people simply aren't going to come here.  But, 

having said that, you know, I don't want to bet everything 

on my guess that there might not be a problem, and the 

easiest way to assure that there isn't going to be a 

significant parking problem is to provide for appointments.  

          And that way, you're not going to have a crowd of 

cars there.  And you mentioned that you would do so for a 

month, and you thought that you wouldn't need it beyond a 

month -- maybe you won't even need it for a month.  And 

you'd like to make that judgment.  But frankly, I think I 

would prefer that some governmental entity make that 

judgment.  God willing it not be us, but perhaps the 

Licensing Commission or another entity.   

          So I think that you should start out with 

appointment-only, and that some appropriate governmental 

entity give you approval to dispense with the appointment-

only, if circumstances so warrant.  And I imagine that if 

that came to pass, and it turned out that there is a problem 

that that other licensing entity might reimpose the 

appointment-only requirement. 

          But as I say, given all the criteria of the law, 

and we've heard some really eloquent dispositions of that 

128

law, I think the one and only potential issue is parking.  

I've explained why I don't think it would be a problem, but 

you do it by appointment, and that should be a guarantee 

that it won't be a problem. 

          And for the concerns after, what was it 6:00?  

Frankly, after 6:00, when all of the local residents start 

parking there, it's probably not going to be the residents 

who are going to be impacted so much as your customers who 

are impacted. And if they're impacted and you have a 

commercial problem because your clients can't come here, 

well that's your problem.   

          And I don't feel the need to take steps to address 

your problems.  You can deal with your own problems.  If a 

business doesn't work for you, so be it. 

          So there we are.  I question the wisdom of the 

whole thing, frankly.  I wonder how our culture is, there's 

going to be a change in access to marijuana, is just as easy 

and normal for our kids as alcohol?   

          But of course they do have access to alcohol, and 

of course they do have regular access to drugs illegally, so 

it's not like we're making something available to our kids 

that isn't readily available probably at a much, you know,

lower price as well. 

          So, you know, the culture changes and the laws 

change.  I would support this; however with the sort of 

restrictions that I've mentioned on parking and on making 

appointments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Mary?       

          MARY FLYNN:  Well, I don't really have much to add 

after listening to all of my colleagues.  I think, you know, 

everybody has expressed very valid points.  And then the 

criteria that we have to evaluate this project by, they are 

very narrow.   

          That being said, I do appreciate all of the 

various points of view.  You know, as one of my colleagues 

said, there really isn't a good place in Cambridge which, 

you know, everybody thinks it shouldn't be in their 

neighborhood.   

          And, you know, as others have said, you know, over 

time people adjust to different things.  It seems like, you 

know, the worst thing in the world, and then reality, we 

find out, it isn't.   

          But I do think in this particular location, the 

traffic and parking and the queuing are problems, which I 

130

realize, you know, maybe discounted, and probably will be 

over time, as more of these open.  But I think that is a 

real concern.  This is a very congested area.  It's -- it is 

an area where there are a lot of children, and I don't think 

we want to see long lines on the sidewalks.  So I agree with 

Steve, in that I think the appointment-only period should be 

extended. 

          And I think, you know, I think Traffic and Parking 

is actually going to be looking at that in other cases, if 

I'm correct, right?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.       

          MARY FLYNN:  I think, you know, it's -- and I 

don't know exactly what the right number is, and I don't 

understand really --  I know you're number eight in line in 

Cambridge, but I don't know if that means you will be the 

eighth to open, or whether -- you know, maybe somebody else 

will have problems, and maybe you'll be number 2 to open, 

for all I know.   

          But -- so I don't think we can count on not having 

problems.  So I think some of our other applicants have 

said, you know, they would do appointment-only for up to six 

months.  But again, it has to be evaluated by Traffic and 

131

Parking in terms of the impact on the sidewalk.   

          And I do think, you know, and you probably will 

end up with a lot more Uber rides and things like that, 

particularly if people can't find parking after 6:00, which 

is further going to create traffic congestion.  And you 

know, as much as Traffic and Parking does provide a very 

robust template of things that you need to do in terms of 

the mitigation, personally for me, I'm much more comfortable 

with locations that are near a rapid transit.   

          Only because, you know, nobody likes to take -- I 

generalize -- I in particular do not like to take busses, 

but I think a lot of other people feel the way I do, 

particularly with the amount of congestion that there is. 

          So to me, this location is more problematic, just 

because it is farther away from say, you know, the red line 

where -- I understand the green line station is coming, but 

that's still a little bit of a distance. 

          At any rate, I'm just kind of expressing what I 

would see as sort of the issues.  So I would like to see the 

longer appointment-only list, and I know Traffic and Parking 

will review after a certain period of time, and maybe there 

needs to be more transportation management additions.

          But I think, you know, in general I think you've 

done a wonderful job of, you know, presenting what the 

facility will offer, and, you know, I think you will 

continue to work with neighbors.  I would certainly 

encourage you to do that.  So, again, I think if we can make 

those adjustments, I would be okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I just wanted to throw out one more 

parking suggestion.  We had testimony from the person who 

runs the 10:35 Cambridge Street.  And he said, "What are we 

going to do at 6:00 when we're all gone, and people are 

parking there?" Well, in a way that's a solution for these 

people --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- to have some nice, appropriate 

person there in the lot, with a, you know, a uniform that 

identifies them as -- and to work out a lease arrangement 

for not very many parking places.  I mean, you're only 

certifying six parking places, and it's only open 9:00 to 

6:00. 

          Now, that probably requires all kinds of permits 

from the city, but it may have a commercial license, it may 

133

not.  Anyway, it's a real safety valve, that if that's the 

problem.  Because during the rest of the day, there seem to 

be parking spaces available if you're diligent and you're 

willing to walk a couple of blocks.  And that's true for any 

place in the city.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Hugh, can I ask a question?  Are 

you proposing that, like, making -- are you proposing a 

recommendation or a condition?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I'm proposing that -- well it 

depends on when we vote.  If we vote tonight, then it has to 

be in the form of some kind of a condition.  If we send them 

back to think about what we said, and there's not too much 

that we're really having problems with then they can talk to 

1035 they can talk amongst themselves, they can work out the 

strategy to solve particular problems that we identified. 

          And as you so eloquently said, those problems are 

very limited in terms of the criteria we have.               

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  So I definitely agree that it 

sounds like there is a workable compromise here.  I would 

hesitate to make that a condition.  I mean, just --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  You can't condition that lease.          

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  Well, no, but I mean theoretically 

you could make a condition that absent -- I mean, there has 

to be a plan for workable parking beyond --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.                  

          NIKOLAS BOWIE:  -- what's available on the street.  

But I mean, we in Cambridge have seen what those conditions 

look like.  They look like the garage near the courthouse.  

And so it can turn into a nightmare.  And so I would 

hesitate to require the applicant to -- actually I think 

that's a good idea.   

          But I would hesitate to require the applicant to 

obtain a lease as a condition of opening.  I think that 

would create all sorts of incentives that are probably not 

going to work out.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  No objection.  Well, I was just 

going to toss in that my understanding is that parking lot 

is part of a condominium, and the idea of trying to -- you 

know, get agreement of the condominium to lease this, let 

alone the issues it would have with the city --    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- you know, maybe it can 

happen, but it seems that it's a very high bar to try to

make somebody to jump.  I think if we're that unhappy about 

the parking situation, which I personally am not, the idea 

of it being conditioned on some further commitment to 

Traffic and Parking that they were comfortable with, that 

would be about as far as I want to go.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I tend to agree 

with Steve's comment earlier, that if parking is a problem 

after 6:00 p.m., it's a commercial problem that is generally 

going to impact the business's customers more than anyone, 

and therefore they will have an economic incentive to figure 

out what sharing arrangements or might be feasible in the 

neighborhood, if that were to come to pass.   

          I certainly think there are opportunities, but 

there are some fairly big permitting hurdles. 

           I know years past working on the PTDM plan for 

the condo building, just getting the condo owners all on the 

same page to have a plan for their building when there are 

so many different owners and tenants and operations, was 

challenging, adding an additional, totally different kind of 

use into that, and getting the amended PTDM plan associated 

with it, and possibly zoning for different principle use 

parking, which is what that would become, is not a small

thing. 

          So it -- frankly, they could probably find other 

parking in the area that they could contract for more 

easily, if they were to find that necessary, and that would 

-- again, if they find that necessary, they have the 

economic incentive to do so.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I was impressed by Steve's thinking 

that it is a commercial problem.  Because when a resident 

comes, he blocks his car in the space, and then it's gone.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And then a -- one of your 

commercial leaves every 10 minutes, and the space becomes 

available.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  But it's not available for 

the resident.              

          HUGH RUSSELL:  No.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Because it keeps on swapping 

over, it keeps on turning over.  One of the other 

alternatives is the gas station across the street.  I don't 

know if that would be another way --             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  -- they seem to have a lot 

of parking spaces.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, again, I think 

that if they need to find off-street parking, there are 

opportunities to identify that if it becomes necessary, and 

I think -- yeah, I think, well, I don't think it's more 

necessary for this use than it would be for any other retail 

use, which would be grandfathered in in this space.   

          So -- and I guess just to add my own thoughts to 

the mix here -- on a broader basis, I generally concur with 

Niko and Corinne that, you know, our scope here is limited.  

It does tend to revolve around the Traffic and Parking.   

          I also appreciated the comments about trusting in 

democracy.  I will add that our zoning ordinance is adopted 

democratically, and to the extent people think that that is 

the wrong distance, that is where that can be taken up.   

          Unfortunately, this Board, you know, doesn't have 

the power to change that distance on an ad hoc basis.  We 

make recommendations to the Council; sometimes they follow 

them, sometimes they don't.  I can tell you that this 

particular special permit was not one of the instances when 

our recommendation was followed to the letter.  Because none

of us wanted to see every neighborhood in the city come in 

and tell us "we don't want this in our neighborhood" and to 

not be able to do anything about that particular question.  

          We -- as previously stated, there's the traffic 

and parking, there are sign issues, there are operational 

issues.  Those we can address.  Whether or not this use 

belongs in this place is less within our purview just 

because of the way the zoning was written. 

          So while I appreciate everyone's concerns, I do 

think our scope is more limited than people would like it to 

be. 

          I do think that the parking here is the same as it 

would be for any other retail use.  I do also think that 

based on both Traffic and Parking's memo and what we have 

heard from them on other cannabis -- retail cannabis shops, 

they have expressed a pretty robust interest in the 

operations of these and avoiding the Brookline type 

situation.   

          Whether that's through appointment-only or working 

with the Uber and Lyfts of the world to designate an 

appropriate drop-off pickup place, there's a lot of 

operational challenges here that are appropriately addressed

by the those city departments, and Jeff, correct me if I'm 

wrong -- if we were to adopt, or to approve the application 

based on including the conditions for recommendations in 

both the CDD and Traffic and Parking memo, that ongoing 

operational review and control with Traffic and Parking 

would be a part of that?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's correct.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So if you look at the memo that's 

laid out --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- it recommends certain measures, 

including the review and approval and operation and plan 

that we have to then, you know --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It would have an implementation 

element to it that would continue on to the operations 

facility.  And I think one -- you know, if the Board wanted 

to be more, you know, take a little -- I think that the memo 

mentions wanting to explore appointment-only options with 

the applicant.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.   

140

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think they -- you know, committed 

verbally in testimony here to a 30-day period if the 

Planning Board wanted to suggest something different, you 

know, that that could be communicated back to Traffic and 

Parking, or it could be made more -- that could be made a 

more explicit condition, or it could be left to discretion.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So one of the things 

that I think we have done previously is to do a six-month 

period or as needed, as determined by Traffic and Parking.  

And I remembering that correct, Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'm getting a nod from over -- from 

the person who's --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Who actually drafts 

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- more intimately familiar with 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, okay.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- of all the special permit 

these?   

the details --   

conditions.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So that is one option 

that we could do a longer period, but still give Traffic and 

Parking the discretions that, say, if it's not necessary for

that whole time to make that judgment. 

          If we were to include a condition of that type, 

Ted, you had expressed concerns about including appointment-

only.  Do you want to discuss that further?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Not unless other people want 

to.  I mean, I had not thought about it before.  I heard 

about it.    

agreed to it --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:   I know we've imposed it or 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- and other conditions, and I have 

no problem in continuing to do that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  You know.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Steve?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So first of all, I'm -- just to 

clarify for myself -- what I was thinking is that the 

parking, or that it be by appointment-only.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.               

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  And in my mind, it remains 

appointment-only until somebody -- in this case Traffic and

Parking -- certifies, permits otherwise.  Not for a -- you 

know, an arbitrary, finite period of time, maybe six months, 

there should be some sort of substantive review and 

conclusion that you no longer need it.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I think that would 

be inconsistent with what we have required of other 

applicants, including those, like in Central Square that are 

provided.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  But if we're saying that there 

may be a problem there, what's the point of limiting it to 

30 days or six months, if, you know, there will then be a 

problem afterwards?   

          I guess I was thinking and looking for some 

appropriate entity making a judgment that there will not be 

a problem, if we no longer do it by appointment?    

          What's the reasoning of making an arbitrary period 

without some appropriate party making an appropriate 

judgment?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I think the logic 

behind it is to give people a chance to adjust, to have some 

of the novelty wear off --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Mm-hm.    

143

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- to get over that 

initial hump where it is the new kid in town -- and it -- I 

do think that there remains, partly through the host 

community agreement, and partly through the various 

licensing mechanisms that Jeff described, an ability to work 

with any given applicant on ongoing operational issues if 

they are causing a problem.   

          But it is also, you know, in the interest of the 

business to have some kind of flexibility to adjust their 

operations so that they can --   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Mm-hm.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- you know, serve 

the most customers possible.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Well, I agree with all of that.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  And actually, I don't think 

there will be a problem.  But it's one thing for me to hope 

and believe --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- how it's going to be, and 

it's another thing to know with certainty how it's going to 

be.  And it just seems to me that if we're going to relieve

them of an obligation to go by appointment-only, it should 

be based on a judgment that is no longer required, and if 

there's a -- it turns out that there is a problem 

thereafter, there should be the ability to reimpose the 

appointment-only requirement.   

          It just seems to me that the whole purpose of this 

is to allow some sort of governmental entity to observe and 

make a judgment.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Can I --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- make a suggestion?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Please.   

          HUGH RUSSELL:  If we follow Steve's comments that 

there's an annual agreement with the city that is a host 

community's agreement which could be a forum for a serious 

discussion about any problems that exist, we would set the 

appointment-only period and our decision to be the 12 

months.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Subject to TP -- Traffic and 

Parking Department saying it's not needed at any time during 

those 12 months.  If it's clear at the end of 12 months that

there's still an unsolvable problem -- and of course it's 

appointment-only, I don't think there's going to be a 

problem, so how will you know until there isn't one?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  But anyway, that might be a way of 

tying our -- determining our initial discussion, and say, 

okay, one year at the end of the year, it's up to the city 

to deal with residual problems through the other process?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Well, just to pick up --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  

Okay.  So that's one suggestion.  Yeah, Jeff?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Can I just make one clarifying 

question?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Please.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Maybe this didn't come across well, 

just a correction.  So the host community agreement is not 

the part that gets subject to annual renewal.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  It's actually an agreement which is 

for five years.  And there are -- I believe the question of 

whether that after five years is then subject to 

renegotiation and renewal, I think is maybe an outstanding

question still.   

          It's the local permitting process which is to 

comply with the provisions in the cannabis business 

permitting ordinance, which is subject to annual renewal, 

and the state license is subject to annual renewal. 

          I think in terms of the host community agreement, 

if there are provisions in that for ongoing traffic 

monitoring, which may dovetail with the requirements of the 

special permit, that is -- it could be laid out in the host 

community agreement that they're subject to that ongoing 

review.  But it's not that -- the agreement itself is not 

annually renewed.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So it's just --    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- suggestion be amended to the 

appropriate --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Annual?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Mm-hm.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, it seems to me we're 

getting into area we don't really need to, because there's 

going to be an operations --

and traffic and parking.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And it seems to me they are the 

people who are most able to determine --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  What sort of appointment-only 

period should be imposed.  And so, if we simply condition 

this, which I assume we will, on what is in Traffic and 

Parking's memo --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Which cites that one of the 

issues for the operation plan is appointment-only scheduling 

--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It seems to me, you know, yes, 

if we want to say, "All right, we'd like to see it for at 

least the initial six months -- "     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- because we don't know what's 

going to happen, but then leave it up to Traffic and Parking

to figure out where it should go --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- from that point on, then we 

don't have to tie it to anybody else's -- you know, to the 

host agreement, or --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- the annual licensing, which, 

because it seems to me that that's not an issue for City 

Council anyway --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- that it really is a Traffic 

and Parking issue.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Can I --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- address that?  I certainly 

agree.  As I said, you know, to the extent that we can 

extricate ourselves from these issues, it would be better.  

And Traffic and Parking would be the appropriate body to 

evaluate.  I would just ask that there not be an arbitrary 

date --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.      

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- of three months or six months

or what have you, that it be subject to Traffic and Parking 

making the determination that it's no longer required, or 

that it needs to be reimposed.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, I think Ted's 

point is probably the most helpful here -- that the 

operations plan is subject to continuing discussion and 

review with Traffic and Parking, to the extent we just adopt 

their MO with the condition, we've addressed that problem.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Is it continuing?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Okay.  Then you're right, then 

it is addressed.

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  I'd actually like to get a 

clarifying question.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Sure.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  My notes are in a mess now, 

they all fell over.  Your numbers per hour, your clients per 

hour, I forget the number you had -- the literature is kind 

of hard to find now.  Can you tell me what that is, and if 

you go to an appointment-only system, what would that do to 

those numbers?

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  So in the literature, I 

actually do believe that it's grossly overestimated.  Like 

everybody has said here, you know, if we don't open until 

2021, there is going to be so many dispensaries across the 

Boston Metro area, so in terms of a number, honestly, I 

can't give you a specific number right now.   

          I don't -- yes, we gave -- I think it was maybe 

100 or 200, but at that point there was no other 

dispensaries open in the Boston area.  And now that we are 

seeing more and more people opening, we are seeing less and 

less members in each dispensary.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  But I mean, I think 

that in some respects, the question of whether they'll be 

able to predict when it's okay to stop having an 

appointment-only system, the mere existence of, "How far out 

do I have to go to get an appointment"?  will tell them a 

lot about their demand at any given time.   

          And that will help Traffic and Parking I think to 

work with them on the operations plan to ensure that their 

operations do not impose an undue burden on city 

infrastructure, and to make sure that the sidewalk remains 

clear, and the bus stop remains feasible, just as we talked 

151

to them about extensively in Central Square.  So --    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  Can I just quickly draw to an 

example of what's going on in Northampton in terms of their 

lines and less congestion?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I think we're okay --    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  Okay.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- for now.  And 

again, it's almost 10:00 and we have another hearing to do 

after this, so --    

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  God willing.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I'm going to hold 

off on that.  All right.  So with adopting that control --  

yes, Steve.   

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  Can I just raise one other 

point?  We haven't discussed much of our design review 

function here.  It's interesting that some other applicants 

here, that's all we talked about, what does the storefront 

look like, what's behind the glass?  And so forth here.   

          And we've had so many other issues here that we 

haven’t even touched upon that -- and I wonder whether --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So --    

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  -- in fact we should touch upon

it?    

this. 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Well, I would say, I 

was encouraged by the fact that even the designs that came 

tonight were responsive to Community Development's memo and 

addressed every one of the things that they laid out as 

concerns, and -- but, again, Community Development has 

ongoing design review in their memo, that would be part of 

          So I think given that this is not as challenging a 

design situation as many would be, especially considering 

that they're using an existing building.  But if others feel 

that we need to discuss that, we can.   

          Yes, Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think Erik’s review is very 

perceptive and --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes.               

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- thorough, and there aren't very 

many issues --     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I will say my personal preference 

is to have no 50-foot long, white, painted concrete block 

wall on Windsor Street.  But if you're going to -- it could 

153

be a light or medium gray contrasting with black, but I 

think the white is just a slap in the face -- and I believe 

his memo basically --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Says that.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  -- says that, yeah.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  Yeah.  And to do it to establish 

corporate identity is really very un-Cambridge.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yes, that is true.  

Any other concerns?  I'm -- my sense is that there are an 

adequate number of Board members who feel that by adopting 

the conditions and recommendations in the memos from Traffic 

and Parking, that we can make the necessary findings to 

grant the requested special permit; that being and by seeing 

that -- so that being the case, I would suggest that we 

close deliberation, and if someone wants to make a motion, 

then we can entertain that at this time.            

          Okay.  So are we moving the -- closing the 

discussion first?  Okay.  Let's close the discussion.   All 

those in favor of closing?     

          COLLECTIVE:  Yes.

evening, adopting the conditions in the Traffic and Parking, 

and Community Development memos and granting the special 

permit?  Someone else can say, "So moved."       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  So moved.      

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Thank you.  Could I 

have a second?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Second.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:   All those in favor?  

We got it, yep.           

          [ 6 vote YES -- Louis Bacci, Jr. votes NO. ]  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  And this is a case where I think 

the Chair will need to appoint one Associate Member to vote 

on this?  I'm just counting six full Board members and there 

will need to be one Associate Member.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  So I will 

choose Niko, then, for this one.  So we got the five voting, 

six voting in favor then.  So all those opposed?  One.  

Okay.  Okay.  Thank you very much.     

          JESSICA PELLETIER:  Thank you.     

155

          COLLECTIVE:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  We will take a very

needed, but come right back for Part 2.

                  Espinoza 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  So we're 

going to come back into session.  So at this time, we are 

taking up our second hearing of the evening, which is 

Planning Board #339, which is a continued hearing.  We only 

have at this time five Board members who are eligible to 

vote on this condition.  And so, we asked, do you want to go 

forward at this time, or would we be looking to continue 

this to the next available date?   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.   

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  I think recognizing that

everyone I think has --       

          THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry, could you just give your 

name?     

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  Timothy Flaherty, F-l-a-h-e-r-

t-y, 103 Fresh Pond Parkway.  I'm the attorney on record 

with and for Revolutionary Clinics, and the application to 

amend special permit #339. 

          So recognizing the hour's late and numbers are 

dwindling, I think it makes sense to continue this hearing 

on --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  -- what I'm told may be the 

next available day.  And I just think that's the best way of 

moving forward.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  And I would ask the Board, and 

I know that you've probably reviewed all of the application 

materials and the submissions from the City Solicitor and 

the Central Square Advisory Committee if there are any 

outstanding issues that you'd like us to address between now 

and whatever the next scheduled date is, if that makes 

sense.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I think probably 

we can't discuss that without the voting members, necessary 

public.  So we can certainly -- I would encourage Board 

members to communicate any such concerns to staff --    

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  Right.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  -- so that they can 

individually convey those concerns to the applicant.      

          TIMOTHY FLAHERTY:  Right.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So that hopefully we 

can facilitate a speedy resolution to this, when you are 

next before us.  And I understand from staff the next 

available date is February 11?  

          JEFF ROBERTS:  That's correct.  The agendas are 

full, and even on February 11 it's fairly full.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  But we think we can try to put it 

in with the rest of the items on that date.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So this is what 

happens when we do one meeting that gets out at 7:30 last 

weekend.  Everybody was so excited.  Now, we have, like, 

three weeks in a row where we're doing, like, -- so we will 

continue this to February 11.  Because it's a date certain, 

it won't require additional advertising is my understanding.  

158

Yep.   

          And, again --  

decision?    

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Do we have to extend the time for a 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So since we're going 

-- when we have the --  it'll make sense to extend the time 

for the decision, which won't have expired by then when we 

get to February 11, and we can better know exactly how long 

an extension.  Oh!  Oh!           

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  I apologize.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  I was misinformed.            

          SWAATHI JOSEPH:  The deadline for this is February 

10.  We do need an extension.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So we do need an 

extension.  Okay.  So should -- do we know to when you would 

like it extended, or should we just extend it to February 28 

this time?  And then if we need further extension, we can do 

that? 

28?     

          Okay, so can I have a motion to extend to February 

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  So moved.

turn it over to the applicant's representative?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Good evening, Madam Chair and 

members of the Board.  For the record, my name is James 

Rafferty and I'm an attorney with offices located at 907 

Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge.  And I represent the 

applicant, which is Philips of North America.   

          This is a building that I'm sure the Board is 

familiar with, approved by a special permit, what's now 

considered Cambridge Crossing.  And they have filed a 

variance request to allow for a sign -- a nonilluminated 

sign on the building.  I don't know -- do Board members have 

that image, Liza, that --  

          LIZ PADEN:  I e-mailed it.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Oh, so the sign, as I'm sure Board 

members will recall, the one size fits all sign ordinance 

says wall signs can't be higher than 20 feet.  In this case, 

Philips is relocating their North American headquarters to 

this location.  Even where the building is located, it's set 

quite a distance back from Monsignor O'Brien Highway, and 

the request is for a sign that's higher than 20 feet, and 

larger in area than the 60-foot limitation.   

          The area is a function of the height of the sign.

22

The hardship, as set forth in the application, some of the 

images some of you have, is that the newly constructed green 

line is coming right across this building at the 20-foot, 

30-foot location.   

          And we had -- we sent -- I don't know if anyone 

had a chance to see the e-mail.  We've sent -- I sent some 

of those images to Liza today.   

          We met with the East Cambridge Planning Team and 

were pleased that they supported the application.  They did 

ask questions about the hardship specifically, and the green 

line.   

          The company anticipates they'll have about 2,000 

employees in the building, but the nature of the business is 

they attract an awful lot of visitors to the building, given 

the nature of their work. 

          The building itself, a portion of it is located in 

Somerville, so it's about as far on the outskirts of the 

city -- it won't have any impact on any residential 

neighborhood.  It is specify located on a portion of the 

building, a mechanical equipment, so it reminded me a bit of 

the Genzyme sign, but it's not on the façade of the building 

itself. 

162

          So we're going to be making the case to the BZA 

that the hardship presented by the Green Line.  When we 

presented at the ECPT, representatives of the MBTA were 

there to discuss -- it was timely that they were laying out 

the extension of the Green Line.   

          They acknowledged that the area -- if you go out 

there today, the concrete pillars -- a few of them are 

already up, and you can see the height of it -- is proposed 

to be 14 feet clear below the ground, and then the railbed 

will be on top of that. 

          So for those reasons, Philips has requested -- 

they're going to occupy about 80 percent of the buildings, I 

think floors 3 through 9 initially, and they have -- they're 

making this request.  They're excited about being in 

Cambridge, and they see the sign as a wayfinding, as well as 

a way to identify their presence.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I just have two comments.  Number 

one is a graphic comment on the rendering.  You'll see there 

is a shadow line or something that makes it looks like the L 

kind of disappears.  And so, that's your problem to solve.  

          I just want to point out that every rendering has

made it look really -- it looks wrong.  And I don't know how 

you solve that, but I think you -- if you're going to do it, 

you might as well have a sign that works. 

          The second piece is that the unusual thing about -

- we have a development here that's planned as a whole.  It 

is actually in three different cities, with three different 

signers.   

          And so, you know, a building across the street -- 

literally across the street -- is entirely in Somerville, 

and follows Somerville's whatever they may be.   

          The buildings down at the end of the back street 

are in Boston, and those -- they plan to have signs -- even 

though part of the building is in Cambridge, the signs will 

be in Boston.             

          And also, they will face Boston, face the river, 

and that's the logical place for a vanity sign.  And these 

are all corporate identification signs, and I would submit 

anybody at Philips who needs to see the sign to find his 

workplace on a regular day doesn't belong to be working 

there.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  No, it's the visitors coming.  

The employees they give them a test, if they do not know

where they're going, they don't get hired.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  So I think it makes sense to have a 

rule in this district that is different from the role in the 

city, even though our ordinance, or others may remember when 

this was amended to permit such signs, and there was a 

misinformation campaign against that, which resulted in the 

City Council rescinding it.  This Board was in favor of it.  

So I think we ought to advise the Zoning Board that this is 

not a problem for us.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Other thoughts?     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  It's not a problem for me.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Ted?     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Well, I concur that this might 

be okay here.  But I have the same history as Hugh about 

adopting the ordinance, and then City Council rescinding it.  

          And, you know, my thoughts about corporate 

identification keep flip-flopping back and forth, mostly 

because I think the signs that have gone up in Boston and 

the Seaport District and by causeway are really pretty 

horrible.  And actually, I'm not a big fan of the new Akamai 

sign either, along the really terrific building. 

          But I really think, you know, the city has to come

to grips with this.  That either it's going to -- you know, 

say yes, they're okay, or reiterate that no, they're not 

okay, and perhaps, you know, and if it's not okay, then 

maybe, you know, the Redevelopment Authority ordinance has 

to be amended too, because that's why the Akamai sign is 

there.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  That's right.         

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It's a --    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  The MAC district is not subject 

to --              

          H THEODORE COHEN:  It's not subject to it, and, 

you know, maybe --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  There's going to be a Google sign 

too.       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- you know, maybe the BZA 

ought to get the point that if the city says no, it really 

means no, unless there's some really tremendous, 

overreaching reason why, and maybe the viaduct for the T in 

this case would be an overreaching reason why.  But I think 

it keeps ping-ponging back and forth and back and forth, and 

I really think it ought to be clarified, as to exactly 

what's going to happen.   

166

          But you know --            

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I mean, in a way the non-

illumination of the sign points a way to a compromise.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Mm-hm.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right, right.  But, you know, 

the whole wayfaring issue, and everybody carries around 

their phone, or their -- which has -- you know, a GPS in it, 

it's really gone away.  So it really is just purely a 

vanity, "I want to put my name on this building because I 

can."    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Well, just by way of context, it 

may be of interest to the Board, Philips -- everywhere you 

see the Philips sign, you then see the Philips logo.  So 

their original goal was to have both, and the logo Council 

advised them that that was not recommended, that they should 

pare it down, make it nonilluminated, and drop the logo.   

          So there's no logo, it's just those letters.   I 

know what you're talking about.  Because, there's something 

about something on the building.  We'll look at that again, 

but it had to do with the way it brackets on the building.      

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Yeah.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I know exactly what you mean.

But it is a pared down version of the Philips logo.  So it's 

not the complete corporate brand that some might see in 

other signs.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So I guess the 

question is, do we want to forward a recommendation on this 

to the BZA, or leave it to them to keep ping ponging back 

and forth on it without our input?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think they deserve to know what 

our thinking is, even if it's diverse.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  Fair enough.  

So then, in that case, it sounds to me like Jeff, we would 

be forwarding a communication to the BZA that said some  

Board members felt that this sign represents a thoughtful 

compromise, with -- being nonilluminated and not 

incorporating a logo, but other Board members feel that the 

City Council in presenting the earlier sign ordinance had 

spoken clearly that this type of corporate identification 

sign is not welcome in Cambridge.  Does that accurately 

capture the discussion?    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Well, I heard nonprofit for us.  

And with all due respect, I mean, recounting the history, 

the City Council was very muddled.  When they rescinded, 

168

that's because they didn't want the thing going on the 

ballot.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  They didn't reject the concept; 

they had passed the very ordinance 60 days prior to that.  

So I think it might be -- if someone didn't know the 

history, that characterization of the Council vote --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Fair enough --    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Might be less than precise.  I 

think what the Council did is they were persuaded by a 

misinformation campaign of billboards up and down the 

Charles River, robocalls from Michael Dukakis -- I mean it 

was quite an impressive outlay over a million dollars when 

the numbers were finally tallied up on this enterprise.   

          But the Council said they were going to send it 

for study.  They didn't say we were going to reject this.  I 

guess they're still studying it.  I haven't heard much.   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Already, this -- if I 

rephrase to say some members find that even this sign is 

inconsistent with the policy as adopted by Council to date, 

pending any outcome of any study the Council may do on other

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Well, I would defer -- because 

Mr. Cullen -- it seems to me what Mr. Cullen is lamenting is 

the reality that there's some inconsistency in the signs, 

the fact that they're in "MXD" and not elsewhere, the fact 

that we passed an ordinance, and then it got rescinded.  It 

seems to me that it's a legitimate observation that the 

process around --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  The zoning rules for signage lack 

some consistency.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So Ted, what --  

          H THEODORE COHEN:  I would agree with Mr. 

Rafferty's --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Characterization?       

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- characterization that the 

process lacks --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  -- consistency.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  So it's not a comment 

on --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  But, and that if, you know, if 

-- I would hope that they are very serious in making a

determination there is indeed a hardship for any sign they 

grant, for any variance from the sign ordinance, as it 

stands.    

in trouble.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Okay.  I'm not going 

to try to recharacterize that, because I'll only get myself 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  What we could say is to the 

there is some inconsistency.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And that they can take that 

into account when they're considering the variance.  Is that 

--   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, Mm-hm.             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  And we normally don't comment on 

hardship, because that's --    

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Right, that's there --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Right.  Yep.     

          H THEODORE COHEN:  We don't determine whether 

there is hardship.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  I can assure you they don't take 

it lightly.  I'm not sure where this is headed, but it's 

front and center on -- particularly on assigned cases.

That's why we see fewer and fewer of them, because anyone 

who comes to me, I have to tell them, unless you've got a 

clear hardship, you're not going to fare too well." 

          Now, they did grant one last year to EF, which had 

similar situations, same zoning district, similar issues.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, blocked by 

infrastructure.     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Right.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  They lost their logo too, didn't 

they?     

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  They did.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That's amazing.  

Yeah.  Okay.  So with that communication, we're comfortable 

that the various diverse views of the Board have been 

represented?     

          COLLECTIVE:  Yes.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Excellent.  Jeff, 

we're good?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I think I got that.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  You got that?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  Two different comments.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Perfect.     

172

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Okay, so you can tell me to shut 

up.  You're well within your purview, but is it more correct 

that there was consensus and a bit of a one outlier type 

thing?  I mean, "diverse" suggests multiple?     

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  There may be more than one 

outlier.      

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Okay, then I'm just going to --  

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah, no, I -- yeah.    

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  All right. I'm quitting while I'm 

ahead.    

right call.     

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  That sounds like the 

          JAMES RAFFERTY:  Thank you.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  All right.  I believe 

that is the end of our agenda?   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  I'd like to do one more thing if 

you'll indulge me.   

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  Sure.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So someone, he may have thought he 

was part of the cannabis group, but this is Daniel Messplay.  

He's our new senior zoning manager, who started just today.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Oh, wow.

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Welcome.  Trial by 

fire.   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  So he's been learning a lot about, 

you know, about how the Planning Board runs, but he's also 

going to be working a lot and kind of filling out our team 

to work on all of the rezoning projects that we have going 

on with the city within the department and other departments 

and the City Council and the Planning Board.  So --  

          LOUIS J. BACCI, JR.:  He can take a look at the 

signs.   

and, you know --   

          JEFF ROBERTS:  -- you'll see him from time to time 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Time to welcome him 

to the city.  Great.  Absolutely, welcome.  Thank you for 

hanging in there with us this evening.                 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Could I make one very quick 

comment?    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Please do.                 

          H THEODORE COHEN:  Having just disparaged the 

Akamai sign, I would say that the lobby is really gorgeous.

          COLLECTIVE:  Oh!

recommend people actually go --   

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Check it out.  Okay.          

          H THEODORE COHEN:   -- go check it out, and if you 

spoke, the guards will come over to you, and, "I'm on 

Planning Board I wanted to see the lobby" they say, "oh, 

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Yeah.               

          H THEODORE COHEN:  And then they'll explain things 

fine."   

to you.     

          STEVEN A. COHEN:  I'm glad they heard that.  

Because it hurt their feelings.    

          CATHERINE PRESTON CONNOLLY:  Pardon, Hugh?             

          HUGH RUSSELL:  I think the they turned off the 

elevated sign.
